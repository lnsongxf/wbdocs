The origin of this study is the request by the State Governments of Jharkhand, Odisha, West
Bengal, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh, by way of the Department of Land Resources,
Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India, to the World Bank for support in
undertaking an independent land governance assessment using the LGAF approach in 2012.
A similar request was made by the State Government of Bihar in 2013. In each of the
participating states, a well reputed local institution was selected to undertake the State-level
Coordination of the LGAF, which was CGG for Andra Pradesh. CGG selected a State
coordinator and a team of State experts to undertake the assessment in consultation with a
nodal officer assigned by the State government.

LGAF implementation is in a number of discrete steps that are overseen by the State
coordinator as will be explained in this report. The six State institutions and LGAF teams are
supported by the Technical Advisory Group (TAG), a highly qualified and capable team of
nationally recognized experts each covering one of the LGAF thematic areas. The TAG
provided backstopping and quality assurance for the entire LGAF exercise. The LGAF
process and TAG are coordinated by the TAG secretariat, hosted by CSD, the Center for
Sustainable Development, in Delhi. CSD coordinated also the work with DoLR and The
World Bank that has provided financial support and methodological guidance on the use of
the LGAF instrument.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

“Land is the foundation on which the entire edifice of development is built”. In Andhra Pradesh the
way that land is governed is important for sustainable development. Land also has significant social,
cultural and economic implications and emotional attachment to millions of people who depend on
agriculture for their livelihood. With the burgeoning population, pressure on land is increasing. Its
proper use is also of much relevance for industrialisation and urbanisation strategies and for
managing the ecological bio-diversity, as well as for equitable access and conferment of rights and
their protection.

This synthesis presents the findings of a self-assessment of land governance by experts and other
specialist form the State of Andhra Pradesh. Following an introduction to the methodology and
context of the State it presents the results for key land governance topics. This synthesis ends with a
list of issues which require urgent policy intervention that area also summarised in the policy matrix.
Although this analysis was prepared before the division of the former State of Andhra Pradesh, the
overall conclusions are still pertinent.
      1 Land governance Assessment framework
The Land Governance Assessment Framework (LGAF) is participatory, evidence driven instrument for
scoring the current status of land governance at the country or State level. The LGAF framework is
constructed around nine distinct areas that have each been assessed by State experts who pulled
together available data and other information. The Framework is composed of 27 land governance
indicators that are broken down into a total of 116 “dimensions” with pre-coded statements (on a
scale from A to D). Dimensions were ranked based on actual conditions prevailing in the state and
the resulting scorecard is implemented in the annex. LGAF implementation in Andhra Pradesh
started in September 2013. The report was validated in June 2014 for both States. The process
involved the CCLA of the state and Nodal Officers representing relevant Departments providing. The
LGAF team was headed by Shri Sripad Bhalerao, IAS (retd), former Spl Chief Secretary to the
Government, who led a team of 9 State level Expert Investigators (EIs)1, while over 50 specialist from
a range of background participated in the nine panels. Institutional facilitation was provided by the
Centre for Good Governance, Hyderabad.
      2 Findings
The next sections discuss land governance from the following angles: (i) Land Rights Recognition (ii)
Rights to Forest and Common Lands & Rural Land Use Regulations (iii) Urban Land Use Planning and
Development (iv) Public Land Management (v) Transfer of Public Land to Private Use (vi) Public
Provision of Land Information: Registry and Cadastre (vii) Land Valuation and Taxation (viii) Dispute
Resolution. It ends with a review of Institutional Arrangements and Policies.
        2.1           Land Rights Recognition
The existing legal framework in the state is very comprehensive. Land reforms undertaken after
independence led to the abolition of Intermediaries, tenancy Reforms2, ceilings on land holdings,
distribution of government lands and waste lands to rural landless poor. Implementation is lagging.
For example for the ceiling act, out of 3.37 lakh ha of land declared as surplus, 2.34 Lakh ha of land
has been distributed to 5.41 lakh beneficiaries, but implementation is still not complete due to
pendency of cases in the courts and many exemptions were given, or the law was circumvented the

law. Although tribal lands are legally protected from transfer to non-tribals since colonial times3,
these laws are not enforced. It was observed that more than 48 % of lands in these scheduled areas
are hold by non-tribals in 2014. Further the rights given to tribal thandas, community pattas given to
Vana Samrakshana Samitis have no legal recognition.
Legal restrictions on land leases are routinely neglected. Despite the availability of Tenancy Acts in
the State, only oral and informal leases are taking place. A large number of tenants are not recorded
on ROR, affecting also their access to credit, input subsidy, crop insurance. Of the 22 lakh tenant
farmers, 5.10 lakh were issued LECs in 2011-12. The abolition of land revenues has adversely
affected rights of tenants. Landlords are not ready to give formal lease of the land due to the
insecurity of their ownership rights. Moreover, although a large numbers of tenants are in
possession of their lands, the names of the former owners are still shown as pattadars in the
records4. These SaadaBainama cases (tenants who bought lands about 30-40 years ago, are
cultivating but the related ROR was not registered in their names (12-15 lakh farmers).
Land is classified into communal land or common property resource; public lands or government
lands and privately owned lands which include lands held by religious and charitable institutions,
cooperatives and companies. The categories of tenure rights are (1) owners under the above Acts
and other Land Ceiling Laws, (2) cultivators under Acts like the Estate Abolition, Jagir Abolition, Inam
Abolition, Tenancy, Homestead. (3) beneficiaries of land grants under the Assignment Policy of the
State for agricultural lands and house sites, and (4) Tenure rights of women under the Land Purchase
Scheme of the State.
There are provisions to recognise long term possession of Government lands. Under the AP
Assignment (POT) ACT,1972/7 the long term possessors of land known as the ‘shivaijamadars’ can
be assigned pattas (titles ) to the land parcel under possession. This is true for all the lands
categorised under Government lands and ceiling surplus lands. For Inam lands long term possession
is recognised under the Inam Abolition Act wherein the concerned authority (presently RDO) settles
the land in favour of occupant of the land provided he is the legal heir of the original Inamdar or has
bought it from a legal heir of the original Inamdar.
In AP, about 75.40 lakh acres of public lands have been distributed, mostly to 39.30 lakh landless
poor, and an estimated 2.2 million households were given homestead rights. However, the majority
of beneficiaries of government’ lands grant assignment or distribution) are not in the possession of
these lands5 and which requires proactive enforcement. Regarding womens’ rights, the government
of AP, while distributing lands in government schemes, decided to issue pattas of lands or house
sites in the name of women but only 50-70 percent of such grants are effectively recorded in the
name of women. Slum dwellers have no legal recognition of tenure even when they are provided
with facilities by projects and local bodies, which de facto informally recognise their occupancy.
The legal framework recognises and protects the individual rights on rural land for over 90% of the
rural population and records are maintained by the land revenue administration. In AP, as elsewhere
in India, there is no system of conclusive titles. Records are issued on a presumptive basis, and when
land transactions take place it is up to the purchaser to establish the authenticity of the documents

  The Agency Tracts Interest and Land Transfer Act, 1917 protect the interests of tribals in the agency areas and prohibits the transfer of
lands between tribals and non-tribals without any prior consent from the Government or any other prescribed officer. The Tribal Areas
Regulation, Fasli 1356 enacted in 1946 entrusted all tribal land disputes to tribal Panchayats. The AP Scheduled Areas Land Transfer
Regulation (APSALTR) Act of 1959, prescribes that tribal lands should not be transferred to non-tribals and has a provision for retrieval of
tribal lands illegally acquired by the non-tribals before 1959. The AP Scheduled Areas Ryotwari Settlement Regulation 1970 made
provisions for Ryotwari settlements for certain lands in the scheduled areas of Andhra region by issuing Ryotwari Pattas with the alienable
rights to the cultivators in estates and Ryotwari areas. The other important legislations are The Andhra Pradesh Scheduled Areas Minor
Forest Produce (Regulation of Trade) Regulation, 1979 (Regulation issued under Fifth Scheduled of the Constitution by Governor of Andhra
Pradesh), Andhra Pradesh Panchayat Raj (Amendment Act), 1998 - popularly known as (Panchayat Extension to Scheduled Areas or the
PESA Act of AP Act, Andhra Pradesh Minor Forest Produce (Regulation of Trade) Act,1971,Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 (GoI Act).

and rights emanating from them. This “burden of proof” puts strain on the citizen and often leads to
avoidable litigation.
Rural land was surveyed and mapped in 1920 and should have been resurveyed every 30 years, but
this did not happen. Information on maps no longer reflects ground reality in many cases. The
situation for urban land records is much worse. Records are scattered and there is no integration of
these sources, resulting in a deficient protection of rights. No cadaster exists for urban land and
most urban land maps have not been updated since the 1920. Recent Town surveys were
undertaken in only 30 out of 130 cities, all in Andhra Region. Detailed Town survey was done only in
a few Municipalities in the State. The last survey of Hyderabad was done in 1966-70 and around half
to two-thirds of individual urban land is formally recorded and mapped.
Women are subjected to discrimination and inequality in having access to land. Though the position
of Women has improved they are the major sufferers in land disputes. Studies found that 7% of plots
are owned by women and 34% of ROR but plot size is small; 6% of inherited lands and 77% of
assigned lands is in the names of wives, but recording their names in the land registers is yet to
improve substantially; Around 52% of property transactions were registered in the names of women
in 2013, but the total holding could be marginal.

      2.2       Right to Forest and Common Lands & Rural Land Use Regulations
Forest legislation differs between Andhra and Telengana. The AP Forest Act, 1967 provides for clear
identification of forest areas with “well-known or readily intelligible boundaries, such as roads,
rivers, bridges and the like” and has a provision for recognition of some user rights, as has the Wild
Life Protection Act. Community’s rights over forests are formally recognized as per FRA, 2006, but
only some rights over collection of Minor Forest Products (MFP) are really protected.
Notified forests covers 23% of the total area of AP, with about two-third in scheduled tribe areas.
Nearly 79% of all forest area was declared as Reserve Forests, but for the remaining 30 lakh acres
(21%) the settlement process is not completed. This situation causes conflict between forest
dwellers and forest department officials. Under the Forest Rights Act (FRA), community rights were
conferred on Vana Samrakshana Samiti (VSS) instead of Gram Sabha, but even these rights were not
recorded in forest records.
Community lands comprise forests, grazing lands, burial and cremation grounds. Group rights or
collective tenures can be recorded but the procedure is neither clear nor affordable, which leads to
hardships. Village commons are treated as government/public lands with access rights governed by
custom or conventions, but these rights are not recorded formally. Customary land tenure rights
exist for Government Poramboke lands which cannot be assigned or alienated. However, under
pressure of demand for land government has relaxed the ban on alienating Porambokes and
distributed them to landless poor or auctioned fishing rights, creating friction with customary users.
A series of regulations restrict rural land transferability and serve public purpose. Some are also
enforced, eg., ban on conversion of agriculture land into fish tanks for environmental reasons,
restrictions on conversion of agricultural land for non-agricultural purposes etc to protect farmland.
Enforcement is becoming more stringent as a result of various directions from Courts (setting up of
Coastal Zone Regulatory Authority), setting up of Committees at district and state level to permit
conversions / change of land use. Most of the changes in land use are complied with by the destined
use, however the mechanism to monitor this needs to be strengthened. It is assumed that more
than 70% of the land that has had a change in land use assignment in the past 3 years has been
developed to its destined use.

Land use plans exist only for urban land use. There are no meaningful rural land use policies or
formal rural land use plans. Villages, Gram Panchayats / Directorate of Town and Country Planning

       9
give permission for housing and conversion for other non-agriculture purposes on an ad-hoc basis.
Most of the more small-scale rural land use changes by individuals for housing, industry occur in
villages close to urban areas and are recorded in supplementary register and updated in village
Permanent Register. For large-scale change of rural land use, public consultation under EIA is an
obligation, but not always conducted with the transparency needed.
        2.3           Urban Land Use
The number of Urban Agglomerations/towns recorded in 2011 in AP is 260 (58 Urban
Agglomerations formed with 61 Statutory Towns & 90 Census Towns and 64 Statutory Towns & 138
Census Towns independently accounting for the 353 towns in different urban classes). Master Plans,
General Town Planning Schemes, Zonal Development Plans or Detailed Town Planning Schemes,
Area Development Plans and Road Development Plans are prepared under the Andhra Pradesh
Town Planning Act, 1920, Andhra Pradesh Urban Areas (Development) Act, 1975 and the Hyderabad
Metropolitan Development Authority Act, 2008. There is also no single comprehensive policy
document for disaster preparedness in the urban areas.

Information on planned urban expansion and infrastructure development is publicly available
through the gazette and on the website, with calls for objections. Although public input is sought for
preparing and amending land use plans, the process is unclear and reports are not publicly
accessible. Despite this hierarchy of regional/detailed land use plans, the practice of urban
development is ad-hoc with infrastructure provided some time after urbanization. Master plans have
not delivered and 90% of urban land use is estimated being misused, particularly around
metropolitan regions of AP. Political forces play a role also. Despite many examples of good urban
land management practices in AP, there is immense scope for learning from best practices
elsewhere and adopting innovative techniques.

Restrictions and regulations on land use exist, but enforcement is deficient in the metropolitan
regions, such as with respect to the required buffer zones between industrial zones and other land
uses. Other challenges are unavailability of land for industrial housing in areas demarcated for
industrial purposes.

AP is actively pursuing housing policy for the poor and middle income groups, resulting in a number
of housing schemes throughout the state. There is still a shortage of dwelling units and the schemes
are not sufficient given the many needs and growing demand. A related strategy is the granting of
house-sites pattas to the landless poor in the rural and urban areas on government lands.
Government even acquired private lands for house-sites. The poor were also given loans and
subsidies for construction of dwelling units. So far 87.13 lakh number of beneficiary families have
been given house-sites and houses.
The proportion of formal housing is about 70% – 75% and improving housing planning and
promoting apartment culture. Common property under condominiums is recognized and the law has
clear provisions for management and publicity of relevant records that are followed in practice.
Rights of common property are recorded while granting permissions and transfers of ownership of
the individual property in common housing such as staircases, corridors, etc. Requirements for a
building permit are technically justified, take 3 months affordable but only partly complied with. The
cost ranges from 5% to 7% of land cost.
The share of slum households is 36% (2011). As far as informal tenure, the policy for slum free city
provides for regularization of the land rights and provision for services to the existing informal
occupants6. Requirements for formalizing housing in urban areas are clear, straight-forward, and

rights of slum dwellers.

       10
affordable but are not implemented consistently nor in a transparent manner also due to pressure
from a large migrant population, and lack of adequate resources for infrastructure.
Granting of tenure rights is constrained also by legal disputes but many ULB informally recognize
their occupation by providing all civic amenities. However, there is pressure on ULB to sell public
lands and raise revenues, while evicting squatters if any. There is also pressure to regularize informal
housing that are encroachment of public land and the government has announced from time to time
regularization policies, but elites tend to benefit and not the landless poor.
      2.4       Public Land Management
All public lands are government lands and property of the State, but not all government lands are
accessible and available for public use, such as Porambokes or Wakf lands. As per the Andhra
Pradesh Land Encroachment Act, 1905, commons are included in the village Permanent Register
with survey numbers and can be assigned only on specific order of Government to individual /
organizations. Most public lands were mapped but not demarcated, and survey maps not updated.
Mutations are not identified and recorded properly and the land registry is not updated. There is no
database to access all essential information on neither public lands nor their allocation to private
interests.
The revenue department is in the process of updating the records for public lands and identified 180
types of common, community and public lands. There is no single database available in public
domain so far to access all essential information with respect to transfers such as its area, location,
the private parties involved, financial terms etc on public land allocation to private interests.
Pursuant to the recommendations of the Koneru Ranga Rao Land Committee, the government land
inventory has been made public on the websites by 7 District Collectors so far. However, public lands
are in the purview of a range of different Departments and agencies.
Government is the custodian and care-taker of public lands with management and administration
being vested with different government departments and agencies. The management responsibility
for different types of public land is unambiguously assigned but this is not always consistent with
objectives of equity and efficiency. Institutions are not always properly equipped for their tasks.
Sale, lease, assignment are the instruments used by government for transfer and alienation. Out of
the land that has been expropriated in the past 3 years only 30-50% has been transferred to its
destined use. The AP Land Management Authority under chairmanship of Chief Commissioner of
Land Administration (CCLA), has been resuming lands which are not being used for the specified
purposes. Moreover, government lands have been assigned, alienated, and leased out without
bearing in mind the interest of various stake-holders, who have rights to access and use of such
public lands and common property resources. This has raised a lot of controversy in recent times and
invited judicial intervention. Other management decisions on transfers may be discretionary and
questions relating to transparency are often raised in Courts. The state is using existing legislating,
the AP Land Grabbing (Prohibition) Act, 1982, to addresses disputes concerning land grabbing and
which stipulates time limit for disposal of such cases in an expeditious manner.
A systematic process exist for compensation of those affected of land acquisition (but not by
changes in land use), although not fully in line with international standards. Compensation, in kind or
in cash, is paid also for some unrecorded rights such as possession, and occupation etc but not for
unrecorded user rights (which may include grazing, access, gathering forest products etc.).
Compensation payments can be delayed and around 50% of expropriated land owners receive
compensation within one year. Causes of delay are referral to Courts. This is the only forum
available for affected persons to dispute expropriation or valuation, but is also costly and time
consuming. A first instance decision has been reached for less than 30% of the complaints about
acquisition lodged during the last 3 years. These are some pre-emptive actions to get enhanced
compensation such as sell or purchase of small holdings with an assumption of increased valuation

at higher prices, erecting structures, planting of orchards, digging bore wells, to appreciate the value
of land etc.
      2.5       Transfer of Public Land for Private Purposes
The AP Industrial Infrastructure Corporation Limited (APIIC) is entrusted with land acquisition and
Resurvey & Resettlement activities, for industrial parks and SEZ’s. Land is also acquired for dams and
mines and areas are significant. In the urban periphery of Hyderabad 90,000 ha were diverted
(2006). Over 50% of expropriated land (2011-2013) is used for private purposes. Policy is in place for
selecting investments to maximise economic; socio-cultural and environmental impacts, but
implementation is weak. There are lacunae also in the information provided by the investors that
would enable rigorous evaluation of proposed investments. The establishment of infrastructure likes
airports, ports, roads and railways, industrial hubs resulted in the alienation of large tracts of Govt /
Public land for private purposes.

The state can acquire land by invoking the powers of the ‘eminent domain’ and using emergency
provisions, but which have been misused. A performance audit report of 409 cases allocated
between 2006 and 2011 concluded that the process used was neither transparent nor consistent,
arbitrary manner and found irregularities with pricing. Rules and stipulations have been violated and
land is transferred at nominal prices, while there are also cases of land accumulation by the private
sector actors. There is increased public scrutiny and interventions of Courts have increased
accountability on the part of private parties to utilize transferred lands for destined use. As a result
of activism by civil society in AP there has been more recognition of the need for land transfers being
transparent and done in a participatory manner. Over the last three years there also has been
reduction in the quantum of transfer of public land primarily due to Public Interest Litigations in
courts and activism by civil society representatives.

Policy instructions are to transact public land at market prices, but land has been transacted in 60
cases (11498 acre) also in nominal prices stemming from government’s perception of what
constitutes public good. There is no collection of public leases fees and only promptness during the
period of renewal of leases. Policy also stipulated that allotment of public land for commercial
purpose should also ensure that sufficient employment and skill up-gradation of local people is part
of the investment plan, but which is not monitored or enforced. There are cases of very limited value
capture by government with investors making substantial profits out of the transaction.
There is a clear identification and mapping of public bodies engaged in transfer of public land to
investors and they share the information related to transfer and are monitored. However,
monitoring of contracts itself and compliance with contractual obligations is relatively weak in the
state. Action against non-compliance is possible, however, and any dispute regarding non-
compliance is dealt with under the terms and conditions of the contract example arbitration.
There is no system of disclosure regarding concessions given or on benefit sharing agreement and
disclosure occurs only when matters are raised in the assembly or revealed during audit or court
directions are given in PIL’s. There is also little third-party monitoring of investors' compliance with
safeguards and mechanisms to quickly and effectively ensure adherence are virtually non-existent.
      2.6       Land Information Management – Registry and Cadastre
Over 90% of agricultural land parcels have an ROR and 1,51,32,291 pattadar pass books were
distributed and 88,7% have unique numbers. ROR are digitalized and are accessible via Mee-Seva
centres by paying a fixed fee. However ROR were not verified and updated before digitalization and
can be incorrect (estimated for about 30% of ROR). Village maps were not updated since their
creation in the 1920s and only 49% of the originals are in good condition.


      12
The“Jamabandi” that used to be undertaken annually by a district level senior officer to verify and
approve all village revenue records was ended when following the abolition of land revenues. The
departments in charge of maintaining land records (Survey Department, Revenue Department,
and Registration Department) have no shared computerized data base and function in stand-alone
mode. Registration of a transaction does not result automatically in updating of related records. It is
Bhu Bharati (2005) that is bringing together all land administration tasks (Survey Department,
immoveable property registration, Land Record maintenance, property tax and layout record
maintenance of local bodies); procedures were re-engineered to allow for auto updating. However,
Bhu Bharati is still limited to one district and upscaling is delayed by legal and administrative
challenges

For recording of rights there are clear timelines for every step and notices are issued to the affected
parties by the Tahsildar who on a given due date proceeds to the site of the land parcel and conducts a
public enquiry and satisfies himself/herself with the veracity of the claim in the application both on
record and in terms of the physical possession of the land before he/she issues proceedings for the
record of rights. However, even a non-holder of land can undertake registration because the
registration process does not warrant an examination of title. Fraudulent, duplicate and overlapping
land titles are wide spread, and cause conflicts. Vexatious litigations are being used for grabbing
public and private land


The official fee is fixed, but whether the total cost is 1% or higher depends on the efficacy and the
personal integrity of the official functionary concerned. Private encumbrances can be recorded at
the request of interested parties but is not done in a consistent and reliable manner.
Information in records and on map do often no reflect current ground reality. Survey sub division of
land parcel does not happen concurrently with the division of a land parcel either through sale of a
part of land or through inheritance. There is a long queue for survey subdivision work and the
process for priority setting is opaque. In AP time-consuming survey methods are used (chain survey
method introduced during colonial times; use of GPS, DGPS etc. is only on an experimental basis and
not yet formally introduced). Field map books are mostly in the district Head Quarters; online
submission of subdivisions is not possible. The long waitlist for survey sub division creates
opportunities for unofficial fees and intermediaries. In 2013, pendency for individual survey is 23%.

Moreover, it is estimated that about 30% of sale transactions are carried out through a plain paper
transaction and are not recorded in registries. High stamp duty and registration charges discourage
formal registration of transactions, increasing incidences of litigations and tenure insecurity.

Scanning of the title record (Adangal / Pahani) is completed, but not the graphical record i.e., the
parcel map and the village map. The Registration Department keeps land transaction records in
the form of deeds executed on stamp paper (sale, purchase, gift), which are now also computerized.
An integrated computerized database is not available for the three departments charged with
maintaining land records. Urban Local bodies keep computerised property registers (that are
incomplete), primarily for collection of taxes.


The records in the registry can be searched by both the right holder name and parcel. The
government provides copies or extracts of documents recording rights in property to citizens
through the computerised mee seva centres. Only documents which require local enquiry to be done
by tahsildar are not immediately available, and it may take about two weeks. These copies or
extracts of ROR documents can be obtained by anyone who pays the formal fee.

     13
      2.7       Land Valuation and Taxation
Property tax is levied by all Municipalities and Municipal Corporations and is one of their main
sources of revenue. AP also has a vacant land tax within the ULB limits, and tax on land conversion
(10% from agric to non-agric). The 21823 panchayat / rural local bodies have direct taxes and
transferred revenues like house tax, land cess, water cess, stamp duties adds on. Criteria were
introduced to calculate the tax liability (Location, Nature of use, Plinth area, Type of construction,
Age of building) to improve efficiency, transparency, and reduced complaints, but valuation is still
done often on an adhoc basis and not synchronized to market values.


Taxation and valuation policies in the State were regarded by the panels as prepared on an ad-hoc
basis, and used only to increase revenues of the government and not as incentive to promote certain
types of landuse.
The Municipal Acts, the constitutions and executive instructions provide for exemptions, but are not
always transparent nor applied in a consistent manner. Exemptions seem not to be based on equity or
efficiency arguments or applied in a transparent and consistent manner.
Tax collection has been observed to be prompt and efficient in Hyderabad and more than 80% of
assessed land/property taxes are collected. The same cannot be stated for the other municipalities
in the erstwhile State and collection efficiencies differ across cities.
      2.8       Dispute Resolution
Land related disputes relate to title; identity of the land; boundaries; inheritance/succession;
community rights; grant of patta rights etc. Improper and defective land records caused 2% of rural
land disputes, 5% of urban and 28% of semi urban areas land cases. It is estimated that more than
50% of court cases are related to land disputes.

There are various formal forums for dispute resolution like civil courts; special tribunals/revenue
courts constituted under the Special Enactments and in erstwhile undivided Andhra Pradesh, there
was a clear assignment of responsibilities. Explicit rules are in place for shifting cases from one
instance to the other to minimise the scope for forum shopping. Informal dispute resolution systems
are encouraged, but the decisions reached have no formal recognition. There is discussion regarding
compulsory introduction of Lok Adalat system in every adjudication process relating to land.

There is a large pendency of cases in Courts, While the Supreme Court has issued directions
regarding disposal of cases within 3 years, final resolution could well take decades. First instance
decision has been reached for less than 30% of the complaints about expropriation lodged during
the last 3 years. The majority of the legal disputes are pending at higher forums at the state level.
Causes mentioned include vacancy in appointments of judge and internal organization of courts

More simple cases relating to land boundary disputes or recording of pattadars could be quickly
disposed off through a different expeditious and cost-effective process, and have sittings of revenue
courts in the field area outside court rooms (circuit courts). It was also observed that o Officers
sitting on courts should have legal knowledge and expertise, on land laws and also the personal laws
which govern succession and inheritance.

      2.9       Institutional and Policy Framework
Archaic pieces of legislation continue to govern many of the land transactions; overlap and
restrictions create frictions and cause legal disputes. A single land code which covers all aspects of
land administration is lacking.

     14
Primarily there are four departments in the state (Revenue Department, Survey & Settlement
Department, Registration & Stamps Department and the Municipal Administration & Urban
Development Departments) that handle information and transactions about land. In addition there
are a host of other institutions/departments who deal also with land as the base for their
programmes and functions: Departments of Forests, Tribal Welfare, Panchayat Raj & Rural
Development, Housing, Industries and Commerce, Infrastructure and others. There is no overlap in
administration of land-related responsibilities between the different levels of administration and
government but coordination and sharing of information is inadequate, in particular around public
land, among the multiplicity of agencies connected with land.
In the state, there is a system of periodical reporting of land related issues in the legislature, as well
as before standing committee during budget sessions, however, land issues are not monitored and
tracked in a systematic way. The panel felt that though formal land institutions report on land policy
implementation but this does not allow meaningful tracking of progress across different areas.
The Revenue Department maintains ownership and possession records (pahani/adangal, RoR,
khatauni etc.) pertaining mainly to collection of land revenue. The Survey Department maintains
graphical records (village maps/tippons/FMBs) and textual records (sethwar/diglott, RSR register). In
situations that can entail conflicts of interest or are sensitive to abuse (Eg. Transfers of land rights),
there is a clear separation in the roles of policy formulation, implementation and arbitration. There
could be marginal overlaps of agencies dealing with the land.
Performance of the Revenue Despite many initiatives and pilots to improve the cadastre and
registry, human resources and physical capital investment are sufficient only to maintain medium
level service standards. The department has suffered due to inadequate staff, use of staff for other
non-revenue tasks, paucity of financial resources, non-induction of new technology in surveys,
settlement. The under-resourced land administration machinery cannot cope with the speed of
change. The evolution towards an effective land management system is yet to take place. Land
administrators have too many other tasks and verification procedures are not applied because of the
volume of ROR applications. Political interference in posting of revenue officials also affects
effectiveness.
In 2003, 14% of households had no land at all and 53% households a homestead only. An important
welfare policy of GoAP is therefore assigning public lands for house sites to weaker sections of
society (SC, ST, BC, other minorities etc.). All public lands acquired under the ceilings act and as
bhudan lands tend to be reassigned to the eligible poor. Most land legislations enacted have a pro-
poor and equity oriented. However, the implementation of these laws is ineffective and incomplete.
Existing land policies incorporate some ecology and environmental principles but these are not
monitored regularly and in a meaningful way. Further the implementation of land policy is not fully
costed and there are inadequacies in at least one or the other areas of budget, resources or
institutional capacity.

Institutionally, there is no unified comprehensive state-wide policy for land, but there exists
individual department policies. There is a need for setting up separate state-wide body with Chief
Secretary as the head to formulate land policies and ensure implementation.

   1 INTRODUCTION
“Land is the foundation on which the entire edifice of development is built”. In India land is
an important resource and has significant social, cultural and economic implications and
emotional attachment to millions of people who depend on agriculture for their livelihood.
With the burgeoning population, pressure on land is increasing, as it is not just
resourcefulness for agriculture alone but has relevance for industrialisation, urbanisation and
for managing the ecological bio-diversity.


Land in Andhra Pradesh can be broadly classified into communal land or common property
resource; public lands or government lands and privately owned lands which include lands
held by religious and charitable institutions, cooperatives and companies. Land governance in
the state encompasses not only its conservation, proper use and equitable access for
sustainable development but also conferment of rights and the protection of such rights.


Governance is considered as the foundation for economic, social and environmental
development. To address the Millennium Development Goals (MDG’s) and sustainable
development (SD) challenges there is a need to plan for efficient and equitable use of natural
resources. Land being an important natural resource and input for productive activities,
income generation and wealth creation its governance plays a crucial role in promoting
sustainable and equitable development.


Worldwide Land governance is not just an economic issue but emerged as a major social and
political issue. Increasingly land governance is attracting the attention of global leaders in the
context of ecology and environmental protection. Inclusive policies for development need to
take land as key resource for development. In countries like India it has cultural and
psychological significance too as land is closely linked to cultural practices and social
relations in major part of India.


Because of its importance land issues are often contentious and play a major role in power
relations and evolution of social structure. Hence if land governance is sound, efficient and
effective overall delivery of development can be improved. In recent years land related issues
particularly land allocation and acquisition for public and private uses have attracted public
attention and scrutiny due to large scale unplanned transactions involving government
machinery and political leaders. In this context attempts to improve land governance through
proper analysis and participatory discussion to bring in reforms in the existing policy
framework is the need of the hour. Land Governance Assessment Framework (LGAF) is an
attempt to address this need.


LGAF is a tool designed by the World Bank in collaboration with national governments and
other partners with the objective of finding out where policies and practices regarding land
governance stand in various countries (in our case state). This tool helps to make assessment
of land governance as it exists at both the policy and practice levels. It analyses policy and
framework gaps with a view to formulate better policy and institutional framework and fix
priorities and monitor the implementation over short term, medium term and long term..




26 | P a g e
   2 METHODOLOGY
The LGAF is a diagnostic tool to evaluate land policies and practices in a country. This
exercise is undertaken through a participatory approach and is guided by discussion by a
State team interanally backed with state and non-state held data, and a consultation process
with experts, bureaucracy and stakeholders to analyse policy and practices. This enabled
undertaking a comprehensive analysis of the entire land sector. The various issues concerning
land governance have been analysed under nine thematic panels such as :-

   1. Land Rights Recognition – This panel broadly deals with all types of land rights
       including their protection and enforcement, particularly user rights, ownership rights,
       customary rights, community and individual rights.
   2. Rights to forest and common land & rural land use regulation - This deals with
       identification and protection of rights in forests, common lands and indigenous group
       rights, multiple rights in the usage of land and sub-soil, land-records, mapping and
       registrations of transfers of land rights etc.
   3. Urban Land Use, Planning and Development–as the name suggests it covers issues
       of effective and efficient usage of urban land; on restrictions of land use, urban land
       use plans; whether the process of urban planning is transparent and acknowledges and
       protects existing rights; and how participatory is the planning process etc.
   4. Public Land Management- deals with issues relating to management of public lands
       and its use, including recording and access to information relating to public lands.
   5. Transfer of large tracts of public land to private investors- This panel deals with
       the extent of transfers of public land to private investors and whether transfers are
       done in an open and transparent manner, and whether transfers address equity
       concerns. The panel also looks at whether benefits from these transactions are
       available to the public and whether process of transfer is participatory. It looks at the
       social, cultural and environmental concerns and its impact and if this is adequately
       recognized and protected. Publica availability of the said information is also dealt
       with.
   6. Public Provision of Land Information – deals with the issue of whether land
       information is in the public domain, easily accessible and affordable; whether there is
       recording of land transactions through registry, and whether registration process is
       expeditious, cost effective and accessible,;whether the registry is searchable by



27 | P a g e
       public. It also deals with whether there is a system to detect and discourage and
       prohibit informal payments etc.
   7. Land taxation and valuation–It deals with the process of land valuation; public
       access of the same; and whether valuation and taxation exemption is transparent and
       justified; efficiency & effectiveness of tax collection both for urban and rural land.
   8. Dispute Resolution– whether there is clear assignment of responsibility for
       settlement of disputes and whether redressal of disputes is easily and cost effectively
       accessible. It also analyses whether there are any informal channels of dispute
       resolution and their legal recognition, efficiency and effectiveness of the dispute
       resolution process. This is attempted through an assessment of the proportion of land
       related cases before courts and tribunals and the delays in adjudication.
   9. Institutional Arrangement & Policies- this panel attempts to study whether there is
       any conflict of interest, and overlap between different agencies dealing with land;
       whether there is broad sharing of information. It seeks to find out whether there are
       minimum overlaps of jurisdiction. Whether there is participation of all stakeholders
       in formulation and implementation of land policies and regulations; whether the
       policies address equity and poverty reduction goals as well as ecological and
       environmental concerns; further it seeks to find out the process of implementation and
       attempts to identify structural and institutional deficiencies in implementation. It also
       seeks to find out whether land policies address disaster risks etc.

In each of these panels there are various dimensions for which scoring was given. The task of
scoring on various dimensions is done through a consultative process involving experts,
officials of the government, representatives of stakeholders and the scoring is done based on
evidence of available data as well as knowledge and experience of the participants in the
discussion and consultation process. The primary goal of the exercise has been to reach at a
consensus scoring.


Land being a State subject, the preparation of LGAF at state level is coordinated by a State
Coordinator. The responsibility of engaging and supervising the team of specialists was also
the responsibility of the State Coordinator.




28 | P a g e
Methodology adopted in the State:
The institutional partner for LGAF exercise in the state is the Centre for Good Governance
(CGG), which has the overall responsibility to prepare the state report. The CGG identified
and engaged the services of a State Coordinator (SC) and through the State Coordinator, a
team of Expert Investigators (EIs), one for each of the nine panels.


Departments dealing with land in the state were approached to identify Nodal Officers who
could give/collect/share information pertaining to land and its management within their
domain. All the major departments were involved and they identified their Nodal officers.
Meetings were held, at the Chief Commissioner of Land Administration(CCLA) office,
GoAP level and at CGG between September 2013 and February 2014 to appraise the
Departments and collect information from the Nodal Officers.


With the data made available, the EIs prepared background notes that were vetted by the
State Coordinator and shared with the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) for comments.
Based on expert comments, the notes were revisited and updations were made in the light of
comments made by TAG members.


The background notes for each panel along with dimension scoring were placed for
discussions to an invited group of panellists comprising of experts, interested groups and
stakeholders for    further deliberation. Issues based on available data, experience and
knowledge were thoroughly deliberated, available information was critically analysed, fresh
data and evidences from several quarters – academics, civil society, legal professionals,
grassroot level officials &workers of NGO’s, interest groups was gathered and the scoring of
the various dimensions was revised where necessary.


The present state report is a product of an extensive and detailed study that has gone through
a process of scrutiny at different levels and with inputs/information from academic and
government sources.

     3 GENERAL CONTEXT OF THE STATE
The State of Andhra Pradesh7 is situated in the southern part of the Indian peninsula having a
population of 846.66 lakhs as per the provisional census of 2011. It was the fourth largest
state in area with 275,045 sq. km and was the
fifth largest population terms.


About 563.12 lakh population in the State
i.e., 66% of the population are based in the
rural areas and the other 283.54 lakhs i.e.,
33% reside in the urban areas.


The State of Andhra Pradesh state comprised
of 23 districts 8 , 10 of which are in the
Telangana region (including Hyderabad), 4 in the Rayalaseema region and the remaining 9 in
the Coastal area generally known as the Circars (area that came under the Madras Presidency
under the British). Now the Telangana region comprising of 9 districts and Hyderabad have
been formed into a new state of Telangana which has come into being from 2nd June 2014.


A majority of the rural population, male and female are dependent on agriculture as a major
source of income and livelihood. This includes the vast population of tribals who depend on
forests and forest produce. The Scheduled Tribe population in the state constitute 6.6 % of
the total population and Scheduled Caste is 16.2% (2001).


Land in the state
The total land area in the state9 is 2,75,045 sq kms. Dependence of majority population on
land and land related occupations is large. Out of 348.94 lakhs of total workers in the state,
216.92 (62%) are agricultural workers and the remaining non-agricultural workers. Though
agriculture continues to employ more than 75 percent of the rural workforce, the state has
seen a significant shift away from the agriculture sector in favor of services sector resulting in
falling share of agriculture in the GSDP from 25 percent in 2004-05 to just 19 percent in
2011-12. Agriculture has shown a growth of just 5 percent over last five years, which further
drops to 3.9 percent if only the crop and horticulture output is considered. The growth in

livestock sub sector at 6.7 percent increases the overall growth rate for agriculture sector. The
growth rate would be even lower for the small and marginal farmers that constitute 81
percent of the operational holdings and 47 percent of the output as these small and marginal
farmers who typically have low access to extension services, quality inputs like improved
seeds and institutional credit. The problems for these farmers are also compounded by the
very low share of income accruing from non-farm sources (less than 20 percent).


Land Tenure in Andhra Pradesh
Historically a country is identified by the land and territory it owns and controls and all land
belongs to the State. It exercises all sovereign rights on the land. Rulers, Maharaja’s of
erstwhile kingdoms had sovereign rights of the State vested in them. They had absolute right
to determine who could possess/hold land. Now In modern constitutional republic, the
sovereign powers of the state vest in different organs of the state.


Land tenures are described generally as the relationship between man and land. Tenure rights
are granted by law, by the State. Laws thence determine the nature and extent of rights that
are granted to persons - to possess, use and control and transfer these rights granted under the
laws. In the present day, land can be owned, possessed, used and transferred including the
right of inheritance as granted by the law. However, the overarching right of the State over
land still holds good.


In Andhra Pradesh different types of tenures existed. These tenures could be broadly
classified as intermediary tenures and ryotwari tenures. Historically the rulers granted rights
to certain intermediaries such as the zamindars, jagirdars, watandars, inamdars etc to allot
lands to peasants and to collect taxes in the form of land revenue and irrigation fees. These
intermediaries were created as the rulers did not have the wherewithal to directly engage with
peasants. The creation of such intermediaries led to exploitation of the peasants by the
appointed intermediaries. This became one of the trigger points for struggles for self rule
during pre-independence times. At the time of the independence movement, land reforms or
more particularly the abolition of the intermediaries became an integral part of the agenda for
freedom struggle. Immediately after independence and the creation of states, the first set of
land reforms measures were undertaken with the abolition of the intermediary tenures and
also reforms in the tenancies relating to agriculture.


31 | P a g e
As early as 1858 when the British crown took over the territories which were administered by
the East India Company and after the experience of severe famines in many parts of the
country, the British administration introduced the ryotwari system. Under this system the
peasants were given cultivation rights on the lands they were enjoying and the collection of
land taxes was directly undertaken by the government. Under the ryotwari system, the ryots
were brought in direct contact with the government. Land settlement was done after detailed
surveys and mapping of lands and those cultivating the lands were given pattas i.e. right to
possess, enjoy and transfer the lands given to them. While preparing the records and during
the settlement process lands of different categories were created. Lands given to individuals
were called as patta lands, while those that were not settled were called as government
lands/common lands/public lands. Lands were set apart for different communal purposes for
use of the community as a whole such as forests, grazing lands, burial and cremation grounds
etc. However some enlightened rulers did establish the ryotwari system and even in the
British held territories ryotwari system was introduced (Sir Thomas Munro).


Post-independence the government’s policies focussed on undertaking various land reforms
measures which included inter alia;
1. Abolition of Intermediaries : As large tracts of land were held by intermediaries laws
were enacted to abolish such intermediaries and giving land rights to the cultivators who were
cultivating the lands given to them by the intermediaries. The major laws enacted were, were
the AP Estate (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Act, 1948, the Jagir Abolition
Act, Inams Abolition Act. These were the most effective and beneficial legislations. As per
statistics available, about 3.63 lakh ha of land was distributed among 3.4 lakh beneficiaries
who became pattedars with all the attendant rights. However, while the major work of
settlement has been completed, still some residual work remains to be finished particularly
the final settlement of cases pending before revenue and civil courts.

2. Tenancy Reforms : The next set of reforms undertaken were relating to tenancy. In the
Telangana area, The AP (Telangana Area) Tenancy and Agricultural Land Act, 1950:
(Act XXI of 1951) was enacted under which tenancy was abolished. Those who were
cultivating lands were classified as ordinary tenants, protected tenants, protected tenants with
ownership rights. The number of persons recorded as protected tenants is about 3.3 lakhs10. In

 Implementation of Land Reforms A Review by the Land Reforms Implementation Committee of the National Development Council,
Planning Commission, Government of India ,New Delhi, August, 1966:Report submitted by Shri Ameer Raza, Joint Secretary, Planning
Commission on implementation of Land Reforms in Andhra Pradesh

32 | P a g e
the Andhra area, in 1956, The AP (Andhra Area) Tenancy Act, 1956was enacted with an
object to protect the peasant rights from unjust eviction, to regulate the fair rent payable, to
prescribe minimum period of agricultural leases and to provide a right of first preference to
the tenant in purchasing the land. Another important right provided to the tenant is that if the
land owner fails to cultivate the land resumed personally within a period of one year from the
date of such resumption or having discontinued cultivation for a period of not less than one
year within a period of six years, such land shall be restored to the tenants by the Special
Officer on application made by the tenants.


The implementation of the tenancy laws has been quite dismal. The laws gave a number of
exemptions and land owners resorted to devious methods to circumvent the tenancy
legislations. Leasing of land to tenants continues to be rampant despite ban/regulation and the
tenants continue to be deprived of their rights. The tenancy laws have pushed tenancy under-
ground and the phenomenon of concealed tenancy, reverse tenancy exists. The tenants do not
find their names in the village land records and therefore do not get benefits of crop-loans,
loan waiver schemes, subsidies, crop-insurance and ex-gratias for crop losses after natural
calamities. As per a survey undertaken by the Andhra Pradesh Agricultural Workers Union
(quoted in the KRR Committee report), the extent of informal/oral tenancies is as large as
100%, implying disconnect between protected tenancy laws and the actual practices, in both
Telangana and Andhra areas. The government of AP brought in a legislation called the
Licenced Cultivators Act, 2011 under which tenants were given rights and facilities to get
crop loans, insurance etc and presently 4.23 lakh people were given certificates. However,
presently new problems have cropped up and the numbers have come down drastically.
Overall one might venture to comment that tenancy legislations have failed not only in AP
but also in other states.


3. Imposition of ceilings on land holdings : In order to bring about equity and distributive
justice, and remove the skewed land holding pattern in the state and to curtail large land
holdings, The Andhra Pradesh Land Reforms (Ceiling on Agricultural Holdings) Act,
1973 was enacted to impose ceiling on land holdings of a person or family of not more than 5
members which is fixed as 4.05-10.08 ha for wet land and 14-16 ha of dry land. As per the
Act beyond this stipulated limit no person or family shall hold land. Persons holding lands
above the ceiling limit had to surrender the surplus land and this surplus land was distributed
to landless poor for agriculture, housing etc. After this Act came into being in the state, out of
33 | P a g e
3.37 lakh ha of land declared as surplus, 2.34 Lakh ha of land has been distributed to 5.41
lakh beneficiaries. The implementation of the land ceiling law is still not complete due to
pendency of cases in the courts. The government could not also get the estimated surplus land
as too many exemptions were given under the law and land holders also adopted devious
methods to circumvent the law.


4. Distribution of government lands, waste lands to rural landless poor: As a welfare
measure, the government also undertook distribution of government lands to the landless
poor. AP has been the largest distributor of government lands to the rural poor. About 75.40
lakh acres of land has been distributed to the 39.30 lakh landless poor. The state has even
converted certain unobjectionable government ‘poramboke’ lands into assessed waste lands
and assigned to eligible sivoijamaidars (landless poor persons who have been cultivating
these lands for over a good deal of time uninterruptedly), duly entitling them to the piece of
land they cultivate. Depending on the need and demand of the eligible sivoijamaidars,
cultivating unobjectionable ‘Unassessed’ waste lands are also being converted into ‘Assessed
waste’ lands and assigned to those who are cultivating, enabling them to access loans,
subsidies and other help extended by the Government. They are given Pattadar passbooks and
title deeds along with Tippons and the Field Measurement Sheets, duly marking them as
‘Assigned and not transferable’, as an instrument useful for borrowing loans from
government financial institutions.


The government also assigned lands to freedom fighters, political sufferers, ex-servicemen,
sports persons, widows of policemen who died in anti-naxal operations and also to various
other categories of persons both for agriculture and for housing. The government also
enacted the The Andhra Pradesh Assigned Lands (Prohibition of Transfers Act), 1977 to
prohibit the transfer of assigned lands by the beneficiaries. All land transfers were declared
null and void and the transferred lands were restored to 43,000 original assignees. Under the
Bhoodan Movement land owners voluntarily donated land and the bhoodan yagna board was
setup. About 1.10 lakh acres of the donated lands have been distributed to the poor.


The government enacted another legislation by the name of Andhra Pradesh Occupants of
Homesteads (Conferment of Ownership) Act, in 1976 which prohibited eviction of an
occupant of a homestead who is in occupation of a dwelling house as on 14-8-75 unless the
land owner proves that the dwelling house was built at his expense and the occupant is a
34 | P a g e
tenant. The occupant of homestead shall become the owner of homestead and dwelling house
subject to the extent that homestead shall not exceed five cents, and the right conferred is
heritable but not alienable. Under this Act 2.2 million households11 were given homestead
rights in Andhra Pradesh.


Successive governments embarked on massive programmes to give house-sites pattas to the
landless poor in the rural and urban areas. Pattas for housing were given on government lands
and also where government lands were not available private lands were also acquired for
house-sites. The poor were also given loans and subsidies for construction of dwelling units.
So far 87.13 lakh number of beneficiary families have been given house-sites and houses.


In order to empower women and grant them property rights, the government amended the
Hindu Succession Act in 1986 to make women coparceners in Hindu joint family with equal
property rights. The government made a policy to assign lands and house-sites in the name of
women only. It launched a scheme of land purchase for the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled
Tribes and the title to these lands were given to women. Rural poor who were in occupation
of government lands (as encroachers) were also given pattas as part of land regularization
scheme provided the occupation is not objectionable. This scheme was also extended to urban
areas.


Forests and Related Rights:
The total notified forest area of Andhra Pradesh is 63,814 Sq.Km, which is 23.2 % of the
geographical area. The Reserved forests are 50,478.63 SqKms (79.10%), Protected forests are
12,365.34 sq. km. (19.38%) and Un-classed forests constitute 969.76 Sq. Km. (1.52%) of the
total forest area.(APFD,2009).

The Scheduled area in the state extends to nine districts namely Srikakulam, Vijayanagaram,
Visakhapatnam, East Godavari, West Godavari, Khammam, Warangal, Adilabad and
Mahboobnagar. Nearly 66% of the forests are located in these scheduled areas and 31 out of
35 Scheduled Tribes mostly live in Scheduled areas. The Scheduled Tribe population in
Andhra Pradesh as per 2011 Census is 59.18 lakhs and 60% of them are living in scheduled
areas dependent on forests in varying degrees.


Administration of Andhra Pradesh forests has two historical backgrounds. The forests in
Andhra and Rayalaseema areas, which were part of erstwhile British regime, were governed
by Madras Forest Act, 1882 (which later on became The Andhra Pradesh (Andhra Area),
Forest Act 1882) while the forests in Telengana area which was part of Nizam’s Dominions
were administered by Hyderabad Forest Act, 1322 Fasli (which later on became Andhra
Pradesh (Telangana Area) Forest Act, 1355 F). The Andhra Pradesh Forest Act, 1967 came
into force from 15.04.1967 after repealing both these Acts. It relates to the protection and
management of forests in the state of Andhra Pradesh.


With regard to the tenure rights of Scheduled Tribes there were two major laws that were
enacted in AP before independence. The first law is the Agency Tracts Interest and Land
Transfer Act, 1917 to protect the interests of tribals in the agency areas. The Act prohibits
the transfer of lands between tribals and non-tribals without any prior consent from the
Government or any other prescribed officer.        The second one is the Tribal Areas

36 | P a g e
Regulation, Fasli 1356 enacted in 1946 which entrusted all tribal land disputes to tribal
Panchayats.


Besides on the provisions under Fifth Schedule of Constitution, the State government has
enacted special laws. The AP Scheduled Areas Land Transfer Regulation (APSALTR)
Act in 1959, prescribes that tribal lands should not be transferred to non-tribals and also has a
provision for retrieval of tribal lands illegally acquired by the non-tribals before 1959. The
APSALTR Act 1959 became effective from 4th March 1959 in Andhra area and from 1st
December 1963 in Telangana region. No rights were granted to the Tribals in the Forest in
the Scheduled Area under the Estates Abolition Act, 1948, Mahals Regulation 1969 and
Muttas Regulation 1969 since the land covered under this Act & Regulations is not a Ryoti
land. The AP Scheduled Areas Ryotwari Settlement Regulation 1970 made provisions for
Ryotwari settlements for certain lands in the scheduled areas of Andhra region by issuing
RyotwariPattas with the alienable rights to the cultivators in estates and Ryotwari areas.
PESA Act of 1996, at the central level,was enacted with an objective of recognizing and
empowering the rights of scheduled tribes in Scheduled Areas.


Public Land Management in Andhra Pradesh
Within the State, all public lands are government lands, but all government lands are not
public lands, accessible and available for public use. As per Section 2 (I) and (2 ) of the AP
land Encroachment Act 1995, public roads, streets, lanes and paths,(punthas, kalidaari),
Bandibaata(cart track), Dandubaata (way for marchers of army), bridges, ditches, dykes and
fences on or beside the same, the bed of the sea, harbors and creeks below high water mark,
the mangroves( Mada forests) and of the rivers, streams, nalaas, lakes and tanks and all canals
and water courses and all standing and flowing water and all lands situated are the property of
the government including railway lands and land in port limits. Even all public roads and
streets vested in local authority are deemed to be the property of the Government.


It has been found that in Andhra Pradesh about 180 types/categories of public, common,
community lands have been mentioned in various records. The management of these public
lands vest with different government departments and agencies which are expected to
administer these lands. While the government is a custodian and care-taker of public lands,
governments have been treating these public lands as government property and not as
property of the state. Government lands including public lands have been assigned, alienated,
37 | P a g e
leased out without bearing in mind the interest of various stake-holders who have rights to
access and use such public lands and common property resources. This has raised a lot of
controversy in recent times and invited judicial intervention.


Instances have also come to notice of lease/transfer of certain common property resources
such as lakes, water tanks, grazing grounds, burial grounds etc by government and also the
inaction of the government in not protecting these common property resources, inviting
strong action and strictures from the judiciary. In AP we also have land grabbing court which
deals with grabbing of government and private lands by un-scrupulous elements and the
tribunal has done notable work. All the above interventions taken by the Government are in
conformity with the directive principles of the state policy enshrined in the constitution, to
ensure respectable living to the landless poor citizens and socially, educationally and
economically weaker sections with dignity.


Urban Land Use, Development and Planning
In Andhra Pradesh the total number of Urban Agglomerations/towns recorded in 2011 is 260
(58 Urban Agglomerations formed with 61 Statutory Towns & 90 Census Towns and 64
Statutory Towns & 138 Census Towns independently accounting for the 353 towns in
different urban classes). Plans for urban development in Andhra Pradesh are in the form of
Master Plans or General Town Planning Schemes, Zonal Development Plans or Detailed
Town Planning Schemes, Area Development Plans and Road Development Plans prepared
under the Andhra Pradesh Urban Areas (Development) Act, 1975 and Andhra Pradesh Town
Planning Act, 1920. Detailed analysis is given under Panel 3.


Land Records- Survey & Settlement & Mapping: Land records are prepared after detailed
cadastral survey of land and preparation of maps and recording the enjoyment of different
types of tenures are the basis for a sound land governance system. The present system of
Land Revenue Administration in Andhra Pradesh had been introduced by the British
more than two hundred years ago in the Circar areas and in Telangana area after
independence has not changed much in terms of the administrative structure and the records
that are maintained.

The basic annual land record known as pahani in Telangana area and Adangal in Andhra and
Rayalseema areas of the state are maintained by the Village Revenue Officer. The changes in

38 | P a g e
the land record are done by the Tahsildar who is the Mandal Revenue officer after following
due process of enquiry. There is an annual event called the ‘Jamabandi’ where all the village
revenue records are verified and approved by a district level senior officer. Other important
components of the land records are the Field / Parcel map, the Village Map, the
Record of Rights / Village accounts and the Register of Transactions maintained by
the Sub-Registry. In AP the Record of Rights (ROR) Act deals with the maintenance and
updation of the record of rights in land. Pattedar passbooks have been issued to landholders
and this passbook is necessary to be produced for land transactions, obtaining loans and for
recording of charges, encumbrances on land. An attempt has also been made to scan and
preserve the old land records and reconstruct the dilapidated and non-existent records. The
non-availability and periodic updation of land records is a major issue to be tackled for
improvement in land governance. This aspect has been dealt with in detail under panel 6.



Land Taxation
The government has abolished land revenue on agriculture land. This was done as a welfare
measure for the agriculturalists. Therefore there is no taxation on agriculture land. However
there is a law which provides for collection of fee where agriculture land is converted for
non-agriculture use. This is a one-time fee to be paid at the time of making application for
change of land use. System of land valuation is in vogue for the purposes of collecting stamp
duty and registration charges for registration of land transactions. For agriculture lands, land
valuation registers are maintained and this valuation acts as a basic value for land transactions
including land acquisition. These basic values are revised (upwards) from time-to-time and
there is no fixed periodicity of revision. Upward revision is done basically as a means of
resource mobilization by the government.
The land taxation and valuation scenario in AP has undergone several changes since the
formation of the state. These changes were undertaken as a result of new demands which
were generated by the changing economy.
The various Acts concerning the property taxation in the state of AP are:
1. A.P. Municipalities Act, 1965.
2. Hyderabad Municipal Corporation Act, 1955.
3. Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Act, 2008.
4. A.P. Urban Areas (Development) Act, 1975.
5. A.P. Agricultural Land (Conversion to Non Agricultural Purposes) Act, 2006.

39 | P a g e
6. A.P. Town Planning Act, 1920.
7. And the Government Orders issued from time to time.


In the State, the rate of taxation is fixed by a council and the rates shall not exceed 25 percent
of annual rent for Residential buildings, and 33 percent of annual rent for Non-residential
buildings. Such a system of valuation for taxation had many problems in it. Land taxation and
valuation has been dealt with under Panel 7.


Dispute Resolution
Within the State, mechanisms have been put in place and several measures have been taken to
tackle the rising disputes regarding land conflicts. A special court under Land Grabbing
(Prohibition) Act, 1982 was constituted in the year 1988. The Special Court consists of
former High Court Judge and other judicial and revenue members who are normally drawn
from retired district judges and retired civil servants. In 2004, a Legal Assistance Program
for Land was also designed under world Bank assisted SERP to provide effective legal
support to the poor in fighting on land related rights. In the past two decades or so the subject
of land acquisition has generated considerable concern and debate not only throughout the
country but in the state of AP as well. For the purpose of industrialisation, infrastructure,
housing etc the government has resorted to acquire private lands and make it available for
these sectors. Bulk of the lands acquired were agricultural lands belonging to small and
marginal as well as poor agriculturists.


Lands were acquired under the Land Acquisition Act 1894. Large scale acquisitions have
displaced the agriculturists from their livelihood and even though compensation is paid, this
compensation was grossly inadequate to provide relief and rehabilitate the displaced persons.
Displacement has occurred on a very large scale in the construction of irrigation projects,
industrial zones etc. Apart from displacement, other issues involved relate to non-payment of
compensation in time, delays in courts of cases relating to quantum and entitlement            of
compensation etc. In order to expedite acquisition process and ensure adequate compensation
the government of AP set up committees at district levels and also at the state level to go for
consent awards. This mechanism has proved quite successful and has avoided litigation in
many cases.

Institutional Arrangements:
Primarily there are four departments in the State which deal exclusively on matters relating to
land viz.Revenue Department, Survey & Settlement Department, Registration & Stamps
Department and the Municipal Administration & Urban Development Departments that
handle information and transactions about land.        In addition there are a host of other
institutions/departments who deal with land as the base for their programmes and functions.
These are Departments of Forests, Tribal Welfare, Panchayat Raj & Rural Development,
Housing, Industries and Commerce, Infrastructure and others.
During the pre-independence period the state had been ruled by the British and the Nizam in
different regions namely the Coastal region and Telangana respectively which had their
imprint on the administration. When the state of Andhra Pradesh was formed an Integrated
Board of Revenue was also formed that inherited functions and powers of Hyderabad Board.
However in the year 1977 the Board of Revenue was replaced by Commissioners in
consonance with A.P. Board of Revenue (Replacement by Commissioners) Act, 1977. In the
year 1999 Commissioner Land Revenue was re-designated as Chief Commissioner of Land
Administration (CCLA).


At the district level the collector is the head of the district administration. A joint collector
looks after most of the revenue department and land administration matters. At the sub-
division level we have the Revenue Divisional Officers (RDO’s). Earlier there used to be
Tehsils/Taluks under Tehsildars. These Tehsils/Taluks were abolished and in their place
Mandals were created. In each mandal there is a mandal revenue officer(MRO) (now called
as tehsildar). The Tehsildar is assisted by deputy tehsildars. Earlier there used to be firkas
under revenue inspectors. Now these firkas as a administrative unit do not exist.


At the village level we used to have village officers called as karnams (in the circar and
rayalseema) and patwaris in Telangana. They used to maintain land records and revenue
records. Each village also had a village munsif (circars & rayalseema) and mali and police
patels in Telangana. These village officer posts were hereditary. They were abolished later
and number of experiments were made in the village officer setup. Presently we have village
revenue officer who discharges a number of functions related to the village including land
records.




41 | P a g e
At the state level we have the revenue department which deals with land matters and every
other department has to consult the revenue department whenever land issues are involved.
Other departments dealing with lands under their jurisdiction have functionaries at the HOD
level, regional level, district level and mandal level with clear cut powers and authority. The
local bodies such as municipalities, Gram Panchayats fall under the overall control of the
state level departments and the HOD’s.

        4 PANEL CONTEXT & ASSESSMENT

4.1          Land Rights Recognition

4.1.1 Panel specific context
The British superimposed the traditionally existing land system with their rules and customs
and broadly three types of land revenue systems were introduced in British India. Those
systems were Zamindari system (followed in the Andhra Area) / the Jagirdari system
(followed in the Telangana area), Ryotwari system (followed again in part Andhra area) / the
Diwani system (followed in Telangana area) and the Mahalwari system. The Ryotwari
system was introduced in the Madras Presidency in 1802 in which the individual Ryots
(cultivators) were declared as the proprietors of the land and had the right over the land to
cultivate, sell or mortgage or transfer as long as land revenue payments were made directly to
the Collectors. This system prevailed in South India which accounted for about 38% of total
cultivated area. This system resembled the Moghuls revenue system where in the proprietary
rights of the cultivators had been recognized. In addition, the Inamdari system (Feudal title)
prevailed in which title was given to a person who received land as gift for the extraordinary
work rendered to the kingdom or ruler12.


The Zamindari system was abolished under AP Estate (Abolition and Conversion in
Ryotwari) Act, 1948 and the lands were converted into Ryotwari systems. This was the first
law that provided and granted individual rights by repealing the permanent settlements,
acquisition of rights of landlords of permanently settled ones and other estates in Andhra area
and grant of Ryotwari Pattas to actual cultivators by introducing Ryotwari settlements. Under
AP (Telangana Area) Jagir Abolition Regulation, 1949, the Jagirs in Telangana area were
abolished and rights were given to ryots.


The Inamdari system was abolished through Andhra Pradesh (Telangana Area) Inam
Abolition Act, 1955 and Andhra Pradesh Inams (Abolition and Conversion into
Ryotwari) Act 1956 and the pattas were issued to the individuals who cultivated Inam lands.
As per an assessment made by the Koneru Ranga Rao Committee in 2006 about 3.63 lakh ha
of land was distributed among 3.4 lakh beneficiaries. However still thousands of acres of
lands are said to be unsettled in the entire Telangana area13.

A few new laws were enacted to protect the individual rights of the Ryots. Important among
these are: The AP (Telangana Area) Tenancy and Agricultural Land Act, 1950: (Act
XXI of 1951). This law which was enacted by the Hyderabad Government before the
formation of the State of Andhra Pradesh is a comprehensive measure containing provisions
for fixation of maximum rent, security of tenure, purchase of ownership by protected tenants,
ceiling on holdings and consolidation of holdings and prevention of fragmentation. By a
subsequent amendment, provisions regarding consolidation of holdings and prevention of
fragmentation were omitted from this Act and incorporated in two separate Acts i.e.,
Hyderabad Prevention of Fragmentation and Consolidation of Holdings Act, 1956 and
Andhra Pradesh Ceiling on Agricultural Holdings Act, 1961. This Act came into existence
w.e.f 1.6.1950 providing ownership rights to the protected tenants in Telangana area. This
Act recognizes two types of tenancy: the ‘ordinary tenancy’ and the ‘protected tenancy’.


In ordinary tenancy, any person who lawfully cultivated any land of another is deemed to be
a tenant. Section 8 of this Act states that every lease made within 3 years from
commencement of the Act shall be for a period of 10 years. Similarly Sec. (19) of the Act
provides the leaseholder rights that no tenancy shall be terminated before the expiry of the
period of lease. A tenant that holds land continuously for a period of 6 years is treated as
protected tenant. Tahsildars were competent authorities to issue Protected Tenancy
Certificate under Sec (35). Under Section 38, protected tenants were given an optional right
of purchase of ownership of non-resumable land on payment of compensation varying from 6
to 15 times the rent. In addition, law also provided for conferment of ownership of non-
resumable land upon protected tenants by a notification under Section 38 E. The Revenue
Divisional Officer (RDO) is the competent authority to issue Ownership Certificate to the
Protected Tenant U/s 38-E of the said Act. Both classes of tenants are liable to ejectment on
certain special grounds such as failure to pay rent, destruction or permanent injury to land,
sub-division or sub- leasing etc.


In addition, ordinary tenants were liable to ejectment on the expiry of the period of lease.
Protected tenants, on the other hand, are generally not liable to ejectment except in exercise
of the land owners right to resume land for personal cultivation. Ownership was granted to
the tenants who pay 60% of the market value and given the facility to pay it in 20 annual
installments. Hyderabad Government had, after the enactment of the law, undertaken land
44 | P a g e
census operations and the reorganization of the record of rights. The number of persons
recorded as protected tenants in the area now included in Andhra Pradesh was about 3.3
lakhs14.


The AP (Andhra Area) Tenancy Act, 1956 has been enacted with an object to protect the
peasant rights in Andhra area from unjust eviction, to regulate the fair rent payable, to
prescribe minimum period of agricultural leases and to provide a right of first preference to
the tenant in purchasing the land. Section 10 (2) and (3) of the Act stipulates the maximum
period of lease to be of six years at a time. Further this Act provided that the lease is heritable
and the tenant is entitled to continue his tenancy on same terms and conditions even though
the ownership is no longer the same. One more important right provided to the tenant is that
if the land owner fails to cultivate the land resumed personally within a period of one year
from the date of such resumption or having discontinued cultivation for a period of not less
than one year within a period of six years, such land shall be restored to the tenants by the
Special Officer on application made by the tenants. Tenant gets ownership rights if they pay
the price fixed by the Special Officer or the amount agreed by both tenant and landlord,
which is not more than 5 times of the rent paid. Section 20 of this Act stipulated the rent paid
by the tenant should not exceed 30% of the gross produce in irrigated area and 25% in un-
irrigated area. But in practice we do not find this rate being maintained.


The Koneru Ranga Rao Land Committee Report 2006 revealed that majority of lessees grew
paddy, and that the lease rent has been ranging from Rs.80000-10000/-per annum in
Prakasam district. In Godavari districts, the rice bowl of AP, the lease rent is 26-25 bags of
paddy per annum where two crops are grown, the first being paddy and the second being
pulses. In a single cropped area like Prakasam, the tenant would not have any produce left for
himself after paying the rent. In East Godavari district, if the average paddy yields are around
40 bags per acre if the tenant pays more than half of his produce he could not realize anything
from the first crop. He has to sustain with the produce of the second crop. In case of payment
in cash as lease rent, half will be paid before the season and remaining half after the harvest.
This has been corroborated by studies done by researchers. Dr. T. Haque 15 reports that 70.2%
leases in wetlands and 99% in dry lands are for fixed money only. As per the Agricultural

Census, 2005-06, the terms of tenancy in majority of cases is either fixed money (87.4%), or
in the form of fixed produce (8%) or share of produce (4.4%). Tenancy reform laws we see
have done little to enhance tenure security among the poor and, contrarily, they made it
harder for poor families to access land through lease (Hanstad et al. 2005)16.


The Lanka lands situated in Krishna, Godavari delta regions which are formed due to the
erosion of the rivers are being cultivated since many years. As these lands frequently change
their boundaries due to floods, the enjoyers were not given D- pattas, but they are granted
only Eksal - lease. In general these lands are given to the societies and not to the individuals.
In this case the farmers have the enjoyment right only, they do not have any ownership right.
But they have been given some assistance in terms of water tax exemption, providing loans
for land development and digging of bore wells, etc. However, the societies should pay the
Lanka Land Rental (LLR) which is seldom done in practice. The KRR Committee
recommended for regular monitoring of the lands by the Revenue Inspectors and Panchayat
Secretaries to know the right enjoyer and also to collect the LLR. Accordingly Government
have issued orders vide Memo No.43279/SS-1/2007-4 by approving the recommendation.

endowment/assigned land is one of the important welfare measures taken up by GOAP. In
GO MS. No 90, SW (LA.1) Dept, Dt. 24.09. 2001 government have issued orders revising
the house sites as 40% to SCs, 10% to STs, 30% to BCs, 10% to Minorities and 10% to other
poorer sections. During 1957 to 2006 an extent of 3.57 lakh acres of land has been acquired
and distributed to 79.45 lakh families. Under “Indiramma” housing programme from the year
2006-07 to 2012-13 a total of 35722 acres of land was acquired and distributed to 7.68 lakh
families17.


Homestead Rights: The 59th round of NSSO survey conducted for the reference year 2003-
04 on land and livestock assets revealed that 14.33% of households in the state of AP18 do not
own any land including homestead and, 53.19% households do not own land other than
homestead. This is despite the fact that the state of Andhra Pradesh has enacted the Andhra
Pradesh Occupants of Homesteads (Conferment of Ownership) Act, in 1976 and framed

Rules. As per the Act, homestead means the site of any dwelling house, built by a landless
agriculturist (i.e. having less than Ac. 2.5 acres of Wet or Ac.5.00 of dry land), Agricultural
laborer or Artisan at his own expense or at the expense of his predecessor and includes other
area adjacent to the dwelling house necessary for its convenient enjoyment and belonging to a
land owner.


Bhoodan and Andhra Pradesh: Sri Vinobha Bhave, a staunch Gandhian, launched the
Bhoodan movement in Pochampally village in Nalgonda district in 1951. It was the country’s
first voluntary land donation and redistribution initiative. Since the movement was kicked off
with a donation of 100 acres by a landlord of Pochampally, some 1.95 lakh acres was pledged
to the movement. Of this, the AP Bhoodan Yagna Board distributed around 1.10 lakh acres.


Land Ceiling Laws: The Andhra Pradesh Land Reforms (Ceiling on Agricultural
Holdings) Act, 1973 was enacted to impose ceiling on land holdings of a person or family of
not more than 5 members which is fixed as 4.05-10.08 ha for wet land and 14-16 ha of dry
land. As per the Act beyond this stipulated limit no person or family shall hold additional
land. The surplus land had to be surrendered which was planned to be distributed to landless
poor for agricultural purpose @ not more than 1ha of wetland or 2 ha of dry land. After this
Act came into being in the state, out of 3.37 lakh ha of land declared as surplus, 2.34 Lakh ha
of land has been distributed to 5.41 lakh beneficiaries. The remaining land could not be
distributed due to various reasons like, its unfit condition for cultivation, court cases pending
against some surrendered lands, lands reserved or transferred for public purposes,
administrative delay etc.19


In our context, wetlands refer to the lands which are registered as Wetlands in the revenue
records. But for effective implementation of the Act, wetland would otherwise include lands
which are using government irrigation facilities in the commands, tanks etc., even though
they are not recorded in revenue records. In some instances at the time when the Act came
into force, the lands might be dry lands. But in due course of time because of execution of
many irrigation projects, some dry lands get converted into wetlands, but this change in
classification did not get registered in the Revenue records. The reason for not doing so is
obvious. This would facilitate surrender of additional ceiling land by the declarant as the

landless poor. Registration of such converted lands could be ensured by a thorough
verification of the Adangal/Pahani and water rate there, by the land owner who could file
fresh declaration stating alteration in the classification of his land.
Under this Act, any alienation should take place only after declaration of the transferor
stating that he is not possessing any land in excess of the ceiling limits before the Registering
Authority which in turn is to be verified by the Revenue Divisional Officer (RDO). This is
not taking place now. C.Umamaheswar Rao 20 suggests that such cases should be verified
compulsorily for effective implementation of the Act. The restriction imposed on possessors
as per Sec 14(4) of this Act is that the transferee shall not alienate the land by sale, gift or
lease etc. The Act exempted the lands held by State and Central Governments, religious
charitable and educational institutions, local authorities etc.


The Draft Land Reforms Policy, 2013 of Govt. of India suggests discontinuation of any
exemptions. The draft policy also suggests reduction in the ceiling limits if the existing limit
is more than 5-10 acres (2-4ha) of wet land and 10-15 acres (4-6ha) of dry land. As per the
existing law, Andhra Pradesh also comes under the purview of the draft policy. But the State
Cabinet passed a resolution stating that AP is not agreeable to further reduce the ceiling limits
on agricultural land as any further fragmentation of land would adversely affect the
agricultural production making small farm holdings unviable.


To create surplus land and to use it for public purpose, the Andhra Pradesh (Telangana
Area) Prevention of Fragmentation and Consolidation of Holding Act, 1956 had been
formulated. As per NSSO 26th round, 1971-72 it was observed that many land holders held
many parcels of land scattered across the villages. This enabled them to escape from the
Ceiling laws as the lands were scattered. To confront such situations, government decided to
consolidate all the parcels of each individual for easy identification through proper
implementation of the Act. In practice however we find that this creates lot of problems
because this exercise would involve a lot of social dynamics that would come in to play. In an
assessment made by World Bank, it was found that in many States in India, the laws related
to consolidation programs failed to achieve the desired goals because of lack of political will
as well as difficulties in administering the same.

in the Process of distribution, and safeguarding the Dalit Land Rights (Legal & Administration)”

48 | P a g e
Rapid fragmentation rather than consolidation during the past 30 years was evident from the
Agricultural Census reports 21 as the number of operational holdings increased from 54.2
lakhs to 131.75 lakhs with a decreased average size of holding from 2.51 ha to 1.08 between
1970-71 to 2010-11. The obvious ways of circumventing the ceiling laws was to fragment
large holdings and registering them in fictitious names.


In a study on the nature of consolidation and implementation of ceiling on lands in Andhra
Pradesh by Darryl S, et al22, it was found that despite a definitive pro-poor inclination in the
laws and three decades of sustained official effort, many of those intended ‘reform
beneficiaries’ as well as other small and marginal farm families in Andhra Pradesh, have not
fully realized the land rights for which they are entitled. The authors mention from their work
experience that such farmers and rural landless population do not know their rights and are
usually unable to assert those rights when they do understand them.


To prepare and maintain records of rights of the famers, Govt. of AP enacted AP Rights in
Land and Pattadar Pass Books Act, 1971 enforced for entire Andhra Pradesh by repealing
the earlier one i.e., the AP (Telangana Area) Record of Rights in Land Regulation, 1358
Fasli. The Record of Rights includes correction of entries and incorporation of all mutations.
The passbook holder would get the land transactions like sale, mortgage, gift, lease, etc.
recorded in the title deed and passbook through the Registering Authority which will give it
the authenticity and right over the land.


In the process of registration, the Registering Authority shall not register the document
without producing the pass book and title deed of both the parties. From 1 st April, 2013 this
provision is in operation. This is one type of safeguard and protection to the landholder,
acting as a check from land related malpractices.
4. Customary and Indigenous Land Tenure
Customary land laws regulate the rights to enjoy some use of land that arises through
customary, unwritten practice, rather than through written or codified law. In one or another
way easement rights also fall under category of customary rights because a person enjoys the
land of another land owner by way of grant, custom or prescription. Whether the land owner

49 | P a g e
likes it or not he has to obey the right and the other person has the right to enjoy it as per the
Indian Easement Act, 1882.Easement by virtue of custom is a legal right acquired by the
power of law through continuous use of a land over a long period of time. Therefore, the right
of way continues to exist by grant, prescription or by virtue of custom.A grant is given by an
agreement executed by a grantor in favour of a grantee for a consideration. The grant
becomes effective when the grantee has the right to enter upon the grantor's land. Prescription
means getting a right by continuous assertion of the right, which has been in use for a long
period of time.


The fifth schedule of the Constitution provides most comprehensive provisions for the
protection of the rights of tribes in the schedule areas. The schedule areas are declared based
on certain criteria such as preponderance of tribal population, compactness and reasonable
size of the area, available administrative entity such as district, block or taluk and economic
backwardness of the area as compared to the neighboring areas.


In the state of AP, the schedule area is spread over 9 districts viz., Srikakulam, Vizianagaram,
Visakhapatnam, East Godavari, West Godavari, Khammam, Warangal and Adilabad, extends
to an area of 31,48,534 ha, consists of 5936 villages23. The contribution of schedule tribes to
the total population of AP is 7 percent which has increased from 3.68 percent in 1961 with 35
recognized scheduled tribes like Andh, Bhil Chenchu Gadaba Gondu Hillreddy ,Jatapas,
Kattunaikam, Kondadora, Konda Kapu, Konda Reddy, Lambadi, Koya etc. They contributed
8 percent to the total land holdings. By inheritance from generation to generation the forest
dwellers and other forest communities are depending on the forests for their livelihood,
identity, customs and traditions. But their traditional and ancestral rights are not being
completely recognized even though they are the integral part of the forest.


Acts governing land tenure rights of tribals:
From the point of view of land rights, Scheduled Tribes can be considered as significantly
vulnerable group. There are two laws that were enacted before Independence. The first law is
the Agency Tracts Interest and Land Transfer Act, 1917 to protect the interests of tribals
in the agency areas. The Act prohibits the transfer of lands between tribals and non-tribals

without any prior consent from the Government or any other prescribed officer. The second
one is the Tribal Areas Regulation, Fasli 1356 enacted in 1946 which entrusted all tribal
land disputes to tribal Panchayats.


Besides the provisions under Fifth Schedule of Constitution, the State government has
enacted special laws. The AP Scheduled Areas Land Transfer Regulation (APSALTR)
Act in 1959, prescribes that tribal lands should not be transferred to non-tribals and also has a
provision for retrieval of tribal lands illegally acquired by the non-tribals before 1959. The
APSALTR Act 1959 became effective from 4th March 1959 in Andhra area and from 1st
December 1963 in Telangana region. No rights were granted to the Tribals in the Forest in
the Scheduled Area under the Estates Abolition Act, 1948, Mahals Regulation 1969 and
Muttas Regulation 1969 since the land covered under this Act & Regulations is not a Ryoti
land.


The Andhra Pradesh Forest Act, 1967 relates to the protection and management of Forests
in the State of Andhra Pradesh. But it does not provide any recognition to the tribal
customary rights. The AP Scheduled Areas Ryotwari Settlement Regulation 1970 made
provisions for Ryothwari settlements for certain lands in the scheduled areas of Andhra area
by issuing Ryotwari Pattas with the alienable rights to the cultivators in estates and Ryotwari
areas.


With a few stringent amendments, the government of AP reinforced the APSALTR Act 1959
which came into existence as Land Transfer Regulation (LTR) - I (popularly known as
Regulation-I) of 1970,which provided that the non-tribals could transfer their lands only to
tribals or to the government, and could not sell them to other non-tribals. Further it has a
provision that if a tribal could not find another tribal to sell his land in the schedule area, the
Agency Divisional Officer will take over the land by paying the compensation. Despite the
existence of all the protective laws, as per an estimate, 48% of land is stated to be in the
control of non-tribals.
An assessment presented in the Koneru Ranga Rao Land Committee Report (2006) shows
that out of the LTR cases disposed of in the schedule areas, more than 50 percent cases were
in favor of non- tribals.Total 72,001 cases were booked under LTR from inception to 30-9-
2005 covering an extent of 128673 ha of land. Out of 70,183 cases disposed of, 33078 cases
were in favor of STs and 33319 cases were in favor of non-tribals. The ownership rights of
51 | P a g e
the occupiers and the Community rights over the Forest Lands were not recognized legally
till the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest
Rights) Act, 2006 is enacted to protect the rights of tribals and other forest dwellers
including both individual rights to cultivated land in forest area and community rights over
common property rights. It addresses some of the burning issues by securing tenurial and
access rights to lands and providing empowered authority for conservation of the lands. As
on 31-12-2012, it was reported that there were 3,30,479 (3,23,765 individual and 6,714
community) claims received under Forest Right Act,2006. Titles were given to 1,67,797
(1,65,691 individual and 2,106 community) and 1,53,438 claims were rejected. On the whole
3,21,235 claims were disposed of which accounts for 97.2 percent24


5. Urban Slums and Land Tenure:
As per a survey conducted by GOAP in 2009 exclusively on Slums, the findings revealed that
there are 5389 notified slums and 1996 non notified slums and 66 pockets of poor with a total
slum population of 89.32 Lakhs. Andhra Pradesh, with 36% share of slum households to
urban households is one of the states with high prevalence of slums.The following table
shows the distribution of slums based on the land ownership25.

Some of the key issues of slum dwellers with regards to property rights and land availability,
are policy of regularization as per GO.166 that recognizes only those occupants of land who
came into physical occupation of the land by way of creating structures and it does not
recognizes those dwellers who are living in rented houses in slums since many years.
Secondly, the conventional system of town master planning does not provide space for
housing or workplace for urban poor.

52 | P a g e
Against this background, Govt. of Andhra Pradesh has framed a policy in 2009 with a vision
of a Slum-free State by 2014. It provides space to review the tenability of slums based on
realistic conditions existing on grounds, a review of the implementation of GO 166, prepare a
comprehensive town plan for all towns which includes slum infrastructure requirements for
all notified and non notified slums etc. Recognition and protection of tenure rights in urban
areas is primarily for the purpose of increasing shelter security since the acceptance of the
National Urban Housing and Habitat Policy (NUHHP) by the national government in 2007
and subsequent launching of a national level housing programme called Rajiv Awaas Yojana
(RAY). The key component of the RAY is extending property rights to the slum dwellers.


Government of Andhra Pradesh have formulated a policy in 2009 with a vision to create
slum-free cities in Andhra Pradesh by 2014 through comprehensive reconstruction of the
existing slums in the State, both in terms of housing and infrastructure facilities, in addition
to assigning property rights and tenement rights to the identified slum dwellers. It also
envisages the prevention of formation of new slums. Government of Andhra Pradesh felt that
the existing law on slum development does not provide support to the executive machinery
for implementing various developmental measures to improve the social status of slum
dwellers. Therefore it was proposed to have a comprehensive legislation for identification,
redevelopment, rehabilitation and prevention of the slum areas. The Andhra Pradesh Slum
(Identification, Redevelopment, Rehabilitation and Prevention) Act, 2010 is still in its
draft stage.
Some of the other urban land tenures are discussed below:

    1) Individual Households: - The owners have the absolute freedom to put the land to
        the use of their choice, subject to the rules and regulations of the Urban Local Body,
        such as Master Plan, Zoning, Layout approval, Building Plans, Environmental
        requirement, etc. The tenure rights extend to the building and the appurtenant land.
    2) Apartments: - There is proliferation of these due to scarcity of affordable land in
        urban areas. There is a developer who constructs and sells them to individuals. The
        buyer gets a portion of undivided share in the land and the plinth area in the built up
        area which includes a percentage of common areas, such as corridors, lift(s),
        staircase(s), parking, motor/electrical rooms, etc. The rights of owners is absolute
        only in respect of the carpet area (excluding common areas) and joint in respect of
        others.

53 | P a g e
   3) Gated Community/Housing Projects: - Apart from the above these may contain
       other utilities, such as gyms, swimming pools, club house, etc. which are managed
       and charged by the developer. Apart from routine maintenance charges collected by
       Apartment Residents Associations, the developers may take up specialized services,
       such as landscaping, provision of piped gas, hot water, continuous power supply,
       security guards, etc. and charge the occupants heftily. The tenure rights are similar as
       in the case of apartments regarding plinth and common areas. The others are only user
       rights available for a fee, governed by agreements.
   4) Commercial complexes: - The developers sell or lease these properties through
       agreements. Buyers’ rights are similar to those in apartments. However leases are
       governed by agreements and other applicable laws.

All the above transactions are enforceable only when they are registered and the appropriate
stamp duty and registration fees are paid. The rights are recognized but in the event of
disputes the civil courts have to adjudicate. Since in India only presumptive title is passed to
the buyer, the onus lies on the buyer to establish the veracity of the documents through
corroborative evidence to prove his title. This puts a burden on the genuine buyer and may be
exploited by unscrupulous elements.


Status of Land Survey in Andhra Pradesh
Survey in Rural areas: In Andhra Pradesh the survey systems were distinct in Andhra Area
and Telangana area prior to formation of Andhra Pradesh. In Andhra region in the earlier
days different types of survey systems were adopted viz. Paimash, Khasra, Simple
triangulation, Plane table, Block map, Punganur System and Diagonal and Offset method
which is the latest. Until 1897, the survey was done as per Act XXVIII, 1860; subsequently
another Act No.II was passed to maintain the boundaries. An amended Act was passed in
1897 for land survey and settlements of boundary disputes. To remove the lacunae in that
Act, the Survey and Boundaries Act was enacted in 1923, which is the latest one and being
adopted.
Until reorganization of Andhra Pradesh State, the Hyderabad Land Revenue Act, 1317 F
(Act VIII of 1317 F) was under implementation which provided the legal basis of the Survey
and Settlement of Villages. The Survey and Boundaries Act, 1923 was extended to Telangana
area also from 1956 onwards.During that period it was thought that survey is mainly meant
for collection of revenue from the cultivators. Therefore the government Porambokes and

54 | P a g e
waste lands which could not generate any revenue were kept out of the survey. But those
lands were mapped based on the adjoining Pattadars data which were surveyed in detail.
Further the area of the government lands and wastelands were computed by scaling off the
measurements from the map.Because of complexity of the exercise and financial and other
resources involved in the process, the cadastral rule was seldom followed. In Andhra Pradesh
the last survey of land records was done in 1920.


As per one estimate, out of about 5 million land parcels, 49% of tippons are in good condition
while the others are in torn conditions. In earlier days the land revenue was the major source
of income to any state, but after abolition of land revenue on agricultural land in AP, the
government is not showing interest in updating the land records. Due to the resultant
improper and defective land records, it is estimated that 2% of rural, 5% of urban and 28% of
semi urban areas are embroiled in land disputes and never-ending litigation. As per the data
available with the Survey department, the pendency in individual survey is 23% during 2013.


The information and service needs concerning private property in Andhra Pradesh are
currently handled by four wings of the State government: Survey Department, Revenue
Department, Registration Department and Local bodies. The Survey Department maintains
graphical records (village maps/tippons/FMBs) and textual records (sethwar/diglott, RSR
register). The Revenue Department maintains ownership and possession records
(pahani/adangal, RoR, khatauni etc.) pertaining mainly to collection of land revenue. The
Registration Department keeps land transaction records in the form of deeds executed on
stamp paper (sale, purchase, and gift). Local bodies maintain property registers, primarily for
collection of taxes. There are over a dozen archaic pieces of legislation, enacted between
1839 and 1923, that govern most land transactions. If the title to a piece of land is of doubtful
authenticity for any reason, legal disputes ensue. Thus, multiple departments, complex
procedures and litigations cost heavily, hitting the poor and vulnerable sections most26.
Survey in urban areas: Detailed Town Survey of some Municipalities and Survey of streets
in some Panchayats were done in Andhra Region. The detailed Town Survey in
Municipalities and street Survey in Panchayats will be done only when the Municipalities are
prepared to pay 2/3rd cost of survey and Panchayats are prepared to pay 1/3rd cost of survey
and resolutions are passed to that effect and sent to the Director of Settlements, Survey and


26
     http://nisg.org/project/73

55 | P a g e
Land Records. This survey was done only in a few Municipalities and Panchayats. In respect
of Telangana region, detailed Town Survey of the Hyderabad was done in 1966-70. The
object of undertaking detailed Town Survey is not only to survey the boundary between the
streets and private properties, but also the boundaries of all private properties whether built
up or vacant, Govt. lands and Municipality lands27.


Illegal land sales: Illegal land sales cannot be defined in a narrow way as it is spanning
across a wide range of land related issues. Illegal land sales can happen in the transaction of
land between private parties or the selling of assigned lands to the poor under land
distribution initiatives or selling of public/government land or the sale of tribal lands. Broadly
we can say that the land sale which is not conforming to the provisions of various land
transfer regulation Acts can be stated as illegal land sale. In the private land transfers there
are certain Acts which regulate these sales. They are:
        1. The Andhra Pradesh (Andhra Area) Land Registration Regulation, 1802
        2. Transfer of Property Act, 1882
        3. The Indian Stamp Act, 1899, Indian Stamp Rules, 1925
        4. Indian Registration Act, 1908, Rules : Andhra Pradesh Rules under Registration Act,
             1908 (W.e.f. 1st Jan, 1960)
        5. Indian Succession Act, 1925
If the land sales between the private parties are not according to these provisions or violate
these rules, they are considered to be illegal. Multiple sales of land, sales of somebody else’s
private property etc. are reported to be the most frequent cases of illegal sales in the state of
Andhra Pradesh.


Sada Bainama is one of the most predominant illegal practice prevailing in entire Andhra
Pradesh where the poor farmers purchased lands from land owners and executed on plain
paper. Since these transactions are not registered, the ryots could not enjoy the ownership
rights. A conservative estimate showed that nearly 1.0 lakh acres in each of the Telangana
districts is under Sada Bainama transactions. It also reveals that across the State there could
be 15-25 lakh acres of land under these plain paper transactions. But the Focus Group
Discussions in the survey conducted by KRR Land Committee shows that still there are
persons who are in physical possession of the land but their names are not figuring in any of


27
     Hand Book of Land Records, P.Kasthuri Reddy, Asia Law House, 2010

56 | P a g e
the revenue records. The Committee recommended to conduct local enquiry by the MRO,
take corroborative evidence from the neighboring ryots, village elders, etc. to establish the
fact of their physical possession. Accordingly Government has approved the recommendation
and passed orders in G.O.Ms.No 772 dated 24th June 2008.


Sales of tribal land/forest land is another area where there are large numbers of illegal land
sales occur. The Andhra Pradesh (Scheduled Areas) Land Transfer Regulation, 1959,
amended by The Andhra Pradesh (Scheduled Areas) Land Transfer (Amendment)
Regulation, 1970, 1971, and 1978 prohibit the transfer of tribal land to the non-tribals.
Andhra Pradesh has scheduled area in nine districts, and perhaps the most stringent law
prohibiting alienation of tribal land to non-tribals. Not only are non-tribals prohibited from
purchasing tribal land, they cannot (ever since the regulation 1 of 1970 was promulgated on
February 3, 1970) purchase land even from a non-tribal.


Illegal sale of the land which is distributed to the poor through the state land distribution
initiatives such as Bhoomi and Bhoodan: Reports show that much of land distributed to the
poor is not in their possession. The Andhra Pradesh Assigned Lands (Prohibition of Transfer)
Act. 1977 (Act 9 of 1977) prohibits these illegal transactions of assigned lands under land
distribution.


Legal status of Land Leasing: In Telangana area of Andhra Pradesh, the AP (Telangana
Area) Tenancy Act, 1950 prohibited leasing of land with an exception to allow certain
categories of people like disabled, minor, widows, defence personnel, etc., to give their lands
on lease. Such persons can lease with the prior permission from the District Collector. As
mentioned earlier there are two types of tenants in Telangana area. In ordinary tenancy, no
land shall be leased for any period after 3 years from the commencement of this Act.
However the land owner can lease his land when the total land not exceeding three times of
the family holding for a period of 5 years with an option of renewal for 5 more years. But the
lease can be terminated even after the first 5 years if the land owner requires the land for
personal cultivation.


The protected tenant is one who is cultivating the land as a tenant continuously for a period of
not less than 6 years immediately preceding the 1st of January, 1948 and in the event of
displacement is entitled to recover possession.He can purchase the land which is transferable.
57 | P a g e
At the same time a slight restriction on tenants that he could purchase only 1time of the total
family holding and the owner can retain 2 times of the family holdings of the local area.


Under Section 38 (7) the land owner can hold the land, after purchase by the tenant, which
shall not be less than 2 times of the family holding whether he cultivates personally or not.
Because of this provision many of the protected tenants could not get the occupancy
certificates under section 38-E of this Act. A sample survey done in Rangareddy district by
Koneru Ranga Rao Committee revealed that in 28,650 acres of land, Protected Tenants are
still continuing but Owners are still shown as Pattadars in Revenue Records. It was very
surprising to note that in some areas the protected tenants or their heirs do not know that they
have rights as protected tenants and the owners are alienating the lands to the third parties
without their knowledge. The Committee recommended to delete Section 38 (7) (C) of the
Act and the words in Section 38-E “subject to the condition laid down in sub-section (7) of
Section 38” to give occupancy certificates to all protected tenants irrespective of the extent
of the family holding held by the Owner- Pattadar.


In Andhra area tenancy is not completely banned but exists with some restrictions. The
Andhra Pradesh (Andhra Area) Tenancy Act, 1956 has been enacted to protect the tenants
from forced eviction, prescribe the minimum period of lease, to regulate the fair rent payable
by the tenants to the land owner and to provide a right of first preference to the tenant if the
land owner desires to sell the land. It has been amended by Act 39 of 1974 which came into
effect from 1st July1980 along with the A.P. (Andhra Area) Tenancy Rules, 1980 issued in
G.O.Ms.No.2792 Revenue (F) Department dt.27-6-1980 to achieve the objects effectively.
Every lease which is in effect at the time when the Act came into force in 1974 shall be
deemed to be in perpetuity. The leases made after the amended Act came into force will be
for a period of six years and such lease would be renewed for another period of six years with
same set of conditions. The lease is heritable. Even though the ownership changes, the tenant
has the right to continue with same terms and conditions. If the owner fails to cultivate the
land resumed personally within a period of one year from the date of such resumption or in
case failed to cultivate the land for not less than one year continuously within the period of
six years, the tenant is eligible to restore the land with an application made to the District
Collector.




58 | P a g e
Women and Land: In India, the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 applies to Hindu, Buddhist,
Jains and Sikhs. It excludes Christians, Muslims, Parsis or Jews. The HSA, 1956 could
establish the right of females to inherit but failed to make them coparceners.


Mid-eighties was a good period for Andhra Pradesh wherein HSA, 1956 has been amended in
1986 making women as coparceners for the inherited property. The Government also started
looking into the matter seriously and began to issue joint pattas in the names of both spouses
during 8th five year plan. But it is mostly restricted to the government allotted lands only.


A study conducted by Landesa revealed that joint-titling was virtually non-existent. Formal
documents listed either the woman’s name or her husband’s but not both.It is difficult to
monitor the devolution of land rights to women as per the HAS,1956 as amended in
1986.Another survey done by Landesa also observed a low overall awareness of the HSA
among the Hindu families surveyed. Only 22% of the families were aware of the law, and
59% of Hindu respondents who had heard of the law understood that it provides girls and
boys an equal right to inherit property.The study also revealed that only 7% of the plots in the
samples studied are actually owned by women, compared to 93% owned by their husbands.
Sixty percent of these women’s plots have formal documents, viz., patta and title deed, a
quarter of the plots lack any type of document, and the remaining plots are having various
informal documents such as a “white paper”. It was observed by this sample study that only
6% of inherited lands were in the name of wives followed by land acquired through a market
purchase (17%) or government allocation (77%). The researchers also noticed a minimal
percent (1%) of inclusion of women’s names in informal documents such as wills or white
papers. However the number of properties registered is 10, 43,450 under the name of women
for the year 2013 as against a total of 20, 14,704 properties which accounts for 51.79%.


However the females hold 33.46 lakh land holdings as against their male counterparts who
hold 98.24 lakh holdings in AP. The female population in rural areas is almost equal to male,
but the access to land is only 34 percent. However it was apparent that the proportion of
women’s land holdings and area is on the increase for the past decade. This is reflecting a
positive indication of women’s access to land, with or without secured title.

A few of the recommendations made by the Subcommittee28 of the Planning Commission are
being implemented in AP, These are:

     i    Implementation of Land purchase scheme since 2005 vide G.O.Ms.No.319, dated
          08.09.2005. The Govt. of AP purchased 1800 ha of land from private owners and
          transferred these in the names of 5300 women under Bhoomi project being
          implemented by SERP (Society for Elimination of Rural Poverty ), Dept of Rural
          Development.
     ii These lands are exempted from stamp duty and registration fee vide G.O.Ms.No 763
          of Stamps and Registration Department.
     iii The Andhra Pradesh Scheduled Caste Finance Corporation provides subsidized loans
          to landless women to fund the purchase of agricultural land to be titled in their names.
     iv Government also issued orders under G.O.Ms.NO.92, Social Welfare (LA.1)
          Department, dated. 29/12/2004) to accord permission to purchase land for house sites
          distributed to weaker sections without any time stipulation. As per this GO the pattas
          shall be given in the name of women.

4.1.2 Dimension wise analysis and scoring

LGI: 1.1 Recognition of a continuum of rights: the law recognizes a range of rights held
by individuals (incl. secondary rights of tenants, sharecroppers, women, etc)
1.1.1a: Individual's rural land tenure rights are legally recognized SCORE: A
Analysis: The detailed description of tenure rights in the background note supra clearly
brings out the fact that the various rights conferred on different category of persons in the
State are fully recognized. To illustrate this further we can classify the devolution of rights as
follows:

     1. Tenure rights of cultivators under different Acts such as Estate Abolition, Jagir
          Abolition, Inam Abolition, Tenancy, Homestead, etc.
     2. Tenure rights of owners under the above Acts and other Land Ceiling Laws.
     3. Tenure rights of beneficiaries under the Assignment Policy of the State with regard to
          agricultural lands and house sites.
     4. Tenure rights of women under the Land Purchase Scheme of the State.

Till date as many as 1,51,32,291 pattadar pass books were distributed in the State. Out of
these 1,34,20,084 were assigned unique numbers which constitutes 88.7%. This is impressive
performance in conferring title to the lands. Therefore there is no shortcoming as far as
legally recognizing any of the above rights are concerned.


1.1.1b: Individual's rural land tenure rights are protected in practice - SCORE: C
Analysis: Though under the Estate, Jagir and Inam Abolition Acts the protection of rights is
fair, it is quite poor under the Tenancy Acts. There is no compliance on fixation of fair rent;
resumption of land in cases of non-cultivation by owners is practically nil. Several studies by
reputed researchers/ bodies have indicated that poor families could not get access to either
land, credit or ownership rights under the tenancy laws. Out of 8.19 lakh acres determined as
surplus under AP Land Reforms Act, upto November, 2013 an extent of 6.62 lakh acres was
taken possession and out of this the land distributed is 6.02 lakh acres to 5.12 lakh families.
Rest is pending at various stages. The total land assigned to landless poor in the State under
all categories, except house sites put together is 75.40 lakh acres distributed to 39.30 lakh
beneficiaries. The extent of land acquired for house sites so far is 3.93 lakh acres which was
distributed to 87.13 lakh families. Studies show that under Ceiling Act, due to benami
transactions by landowners significant redistribution of surplus lands could not take place.
Conversion of dry into wet lands were not properly monitored and recorded. The KRR
Committee conducted sample surveys in the State and observed that majority of the lands so
assigned are not in the possession of the beneficiaries.


1.1.2: Customary tenure rights are legally recognized and protected in practice- SCORE:
B
Analysis: The customary land tenure rights exist in Government Poramboke lands which are
prima facie prohibited from assignment or alienations. These are generally tank, pathway,
stream, grazing lands, threshing lands and tree topus, etc. Apart from these, fishing rights in
some tanks, right to Minor Forest Produce to tribals residing in Forest areas are some such
rights. Similarly brewing of liquor for personal consumption in Scheduled areas and right to
tap toddy and Neera from the trees in Forest area also fall under this category. Easement
rights also come under the customary land tenure rights category and are also protected by
the Indian Easement Act, 1882.
With regard to Poramboke lands though there is prohibition, Government relaxed the ban,
keeping in view the demand for land and distributed them to landless poor from time to time.
61 | P a g e
In some cases this led to friction between the beneficiaries and other users. Similarly on the
advent of Panchayats, fishing rights were auctioned to augment revenues. With monopoly
given to Girijan Corporation to gather MFP in the Forests, the right of Tribals enshrined in
the Forest Act clashed with the contractors, resulting in unrest to some extent.
Though the customary rights are recognized there was no effective protection due to various
compulsions of the Government.
1.1.3: Indigenous rights to land and forest are legally recognized and protected in practice
- SCORE: C
Analysis: Based on evidence in the Schedule areas, tribals have indigenous rights to brew
liquor and collect minor forest produce for their consumption. Similarly to protect their land
tenure rights several Acts and Regulations have been promulgated prohibiting transfer of land
of tribals to non tribals. These Laws have also provided for restoration of lands to the tribals
of all such lands illegally transferred. Another important provision relates to sale of the land
to Government if there is no other tribal to buy his land. But in practice without the backing
of budget this provision remained only on paper. Moreover the KRR Land Committee
observed that under the LTR cases more than 50% were disposed of in favour of non tribals.
Similarly under the Forest Rights Act, 2006 out of 4,12,880 claims filed for grant of titles for
an extent of 24,68,092 acres, only 1,71,520 claims for an extent of 14,60,878 acres were
disposed of. Upto 2013 a large number of claims amounting to 2.42 lakh tribals comprising
10.08 lakh acres is yet to be decided. But the sad picture is that so far not a single title was
recorded in the adangal / pahani. However these are recorded in a separate register which is
redundant and may lead to litigation. The EI ranked this dimension B.


During the panel consultations, some it was held that different communities have different
customary tenure rights and the existing laws are not comprehensive to cover all these rights.
The community rights in the forest areas are not fully recognised. In the case of Tribal
Habitations (Thandas) individual pattas are not distributed in these areas. Community pattas
were given to Vana Samrakshana Samitis (VSS) which do not have any legal sanctity.


Even though there were executive orders for entering these ROFR pattadars in the Adangal,
in practice it is not followed and these pattadars names are entered in a separate register
which lead to disputes. As all these indigenous rights over land and forest are not recognized
it is felt that there is a lot of room for improvement.


62 | P a g e
1.1.4 Urban land tenure rights are legally recognized and protected in practice- SCORE: C
Analysis: The Urban land is not properly mapped as there is no Town survey for a very long
period. The erstwhile revenue records which are available are the only basis of lands in urban
areas. Registration documents involving property transactions form the other basis for
affecting changes in the property assessment registers/records. Assignment and alienation
registers / records if maintained give an indication of the status of Government and Municipal
lands. In the event of disputes, isolated survey is conducted to identify the boundaries of such
lands. Hence burden of proof largely lies on the landowner or claimant to prove his title over
the land. The flip side of it is that unscrupulous land grabbers create fictitious records and
indulge in vexatious litigation to unlawfully gain control of private and/or public lands.


Data for 2011 reveals that in AP, there is 36% of share of slum households to Urban
households which is the highest in the country. Even though legal disputes are a constraint to
grant tenure rights to slum dwellers, many urban local bodies informally recognize their
occupation and provide all civic amenities such as roads, electricity, water, school, health
centre, etc. to these areas pending disposal of disputes. Government of AP have formulated a
policy on slum free cities in the State by the year 2014 and to achieve this goal it is envisaged
to enact comprehensive law for identification, redevelopment, rehabilitation and prevention
of the slum areas. Studies indicate that squatters on public lands run a greater risk of eviction
compared to those on private lands as there is enormous pressure exerted on the urban local
body to sell these lands to raise resources. In order to provide tenure rights, Government
announces regularization of encroachments on public lands from time to time. However there
is criticism that the influential persons corner these benefits rather than the landless poor.
Hence in urban areas there is a crying need to conduct a detailed survey of all lands, both
private and public by using modern technology, maintain proper and up-to-date records. Only
then the tenure rights could be recognized and protected effectively.


LGI: 1.2: Respect for enforcement of rights:
1.2.1: Accessible opportunities for tenure individualization exist- SCORE: C
Analysis: The law provides for individualization of collective tenure in some cases. Of late
tenure system is veering towards individualization in order to access rights on the land to use
it for the purpose of his choice. Lands were assigned to Joint Farming Cooperative Societies
for the benefit of landless poor in the State. Due to persistent demands for individual pattas,
Govt issued GO Ms No 706, Rev Dept, date 03-05-1962 permitting such grant. The law
63 | P a g e
provides for individual share of property through Succession Acts, by way of will,
inheritance, etc., which are well established and recognized.


There are some land tenures which are conditional grants specifying that they are heritable
and not alienable. The Land Assignment of Govt lands to landless poor, the status of
Protected Tenant under the Tenancy Acts are some such laws. In the event of the death of the
original grantee, demand for individual pattas may arise which are routinely accepted. During
the lifetime of the grantee on attainment of majority by his children, some may demand a
share. There are no clear-cut instructions in this regard which gives undesirable discretion to
the authorities. Govt may issue necessary orders in the matter which are uniform and
unambiguous.


1.2.2: Individual land in rural areas is recorded and mapped - SCORE: B
Analysis: The land in rural area is surveyed and mapped in the State in 1920. It needed to be
resurveyed every 30years. But due to a variety of factors no such resurvey was conducted. As
per the AP Survey and Boundaries Act, 1923 all the registered holders should maintain,
renew and repair all the survey stones on the boundaries of their holding. In the earlier days
there was regular inspection and procedure for F line surveys of registered owners. There was
the practice of conducting jamabandi every year where in mutations of all land transfers were
incorporated, sub-divisions were surveyed and recorded. The actual cultivators, the annawari
yield of the crops were noted. If water is used from any Government source, appropriate rates
are charged and the bakijabithas for collection of land revenue were prepared. With the
abolition of land revenue and the discontinuance of Jamabandi the above activities took a
backseat and consequently the updating of land records suffered a great deal.


Studies indicate that out of 5 million land parcels, 49% of Tippons are only in good
condition. The improper and defective land records are contributing to 2% of rural lands are
being embroiled in land disputes. As per data provided by Survey Department in Andhra
Pradesh, pendency of individual survey is 23% during 2013.


1.2.3: Individual land in urban areas is recorded and mapped - SCORE: C
Analysis: The detailed Town survey was done only in a few Municipalities in the State. The
last survey of Hyderabad was done in 1966-70. Only when Municipalities undertake to meet
2/3rd cost of survey, it would be taken up by the Survey Department. It would be highly
64 | P a g e
desirable for the Government to waive this condition and take up detailed survey using
modern technologies. As discussed in detail in the background note and Indicator1 and
Dimension 1.1.4 supra, the basis for identification of individual land in urban areas is the
existing outdated revenue records, registered land transaction documents, property
assessment records and individual survey reports in case of disputes. Hence it is seen that the
details of private lands are dealt by four departments, namely, Survey, Revenue, Registration
and Municipality.
Due to improper and defective land records, it is estimated by studies that in 5% of urban and
28% of semi- urban areas are embroiled in disputes and never ending litigation. Therefore
data availability with multiple departments, title disputes, litigation, etc make land
administration in urban areas very complex and dissatisfactory. These would greatly harm the
interested poor and marginal sections of the society.


1.2.4: The number of illegal land sales is low- SCORE: C
Analysis: In the normal course any sales violating the provisions of concerned Act, such as
Transfer of Property Act, The Indian Stamp Act, The Indian Registration Act, etc., are null
and void. Instances of illegal sales could be sale of another's or public land by fictitious
documents and multiple sale of the same property. Sada Bainama (plain paper transactions) is
widely prevalent in the State. These transactions were given one time exemption under the
ROR Act. But many could not avail this concession due to lack of awareness. It is estimated
that 15- 25lakh acres are under such transactions. KRR committee observed that 70-80%
persons under this category are poor and dependent on these lands. It recommended recording
corroborative evidence of neighbours, etc. in the field to establish possession of such persons.
The progress is quite slow.


Large scale illegal sales occur in tribal lands where there is prohibition on transfer to non
tribals. Data upto November 2013 reveals that 81,569 cases were detected under LTR and
only in 34,170 cases lands were restored to the tribals. Similarly illegal sales take place on
assigned lands. Under the POT Act, 3.85 lakhs of such cases are detected covering an extent
of 4.22 lakh acres. Land assigned to original assignee is 0.43 lakh cases covering an extent of
0.54 lakh acres which works out to 21% only. Prosecutions were filed only in 1560 cases.


1.2.5: The number of illegal lease transactions is low- SCORE: D


65 | P a g e
Analysis: The KRR Committee based on a sample survey observed that large numbers of
tenants are in possession of the lands but owners are shown as pattadars in the records. There
is no effective mechanism to prevent them or protect the rights of such tenants (lessees). On
the advent of Tenancy Acts in the State, oral and informal leases are only taking place. In wet
lands these account for 90% and in dry lands it is 88%. A study revealed that inspite of LECs
granted to 4.23 lakh tenants in 2012-13,only 31% accessed bank loans. The demand for LECs
is showing a decline compared to 2011-12 where 5.10 lakh tenants were issued LECs as
against 6.80 applicants. Studies further revealed that there are about 22 lakh tenant farmers in
the State during 2012-13. These have no access to farm credit and other benefits like input
subsidy, crop insurance, etc. The private money lenders are still playing a major role. In
another study it is stated that large number of tenants remained outside the protection of law
as they are not recorded as tenants in the land records.


1.2.6: Women's property rights in lands as accrued by relevant laws are recorded -
SCORE: C
Analysis: Women in the State are subjected to discrimination and inequality in having access
to land as is the case of other States. The Hindu Succession Act, 1956 provided for equal
rights to women on par with men in property from 1986 onwards. Through an amendment to
HSA in 2005 agricultural lands were brought on par with other property and granted equal
rights to women. However the awareness on this subject is very low.
Studies reveal that only 7% of the plots are owned by women. It was further observed that
only 6% of inherited lands and 77% of assigned lands were in the names of wives. Though
around 52% property transactions were registered in the names of women in 2013, the total
holding could be marginal. The landholding of women is 34% but the extents are marginal.
Due to various interventions of Govt to grant assignment of land in favour of women, the
land holding of women is gradually going up. However, recording their names in the land
registers is yet to improve substantially. The EI suggested that B may be the scoring for this
dimension. In AP patriarchal system is still dominant and only a minimal improvement is
there in the woman’s property holdings. It may be added that the society still has not accepted
the fact of woman holding property in her name and hence real empowerment is elusive.

  1.1      All the residuary work relating to
           abolition of intermediaries such as
           jagirs, watans, estates, inams etc. and
           cases pending should be expeditiously
           settled by creating a land reforms
           tribunal/authority at the district level and
           at the state level. By means of a special
           law all pending cases in different
           judicial and quasi-judicial forums
           should be transferred to these land
           reforms tribunals/authorities.
  1.2      Adequate number of permanent                   There is an urgent need to bring in amendments to the Tenancy Acts to protect the interest of both ordinary

           thoroughly..

  1.3                                                     It is desirable to bring in suitable judicial and administrative measures to facilitate individualization of
                                                          pattas under assignment of government lands or the rights of protected tenants to his successors during the
                                                          life time of the original beneficiary.
  1.4                                                     Periodical survey of all rural and urban areas is to be taken up. If necessary a surcharge may be collected
                                                          from all the land holders. Survey of village habitation areas also must be undertaken.
  1.5                                                     There is a need to identify all the community lands in forest areas including tribal thandas. Use of
                                                          technology is necessary to expedite surveys and preparation of land records including village and urban
                                                          maps
  1.6                                                     There is a need to establish a Land Administration Department to ensure horizontal integration and
                                                          coordination by bringing in a direct interface of all land related departments and bring them under one
                                                          authority as far as land issues are concerned.
  1.7                                                     Village Revenue Officers, the cutting edge field functionaries are to be thoroughly trained at periodic
                                                          intervals (at the time of recruitment and also later on) in revenue and land matters. Further, it is
                                                          recommended that before the VROs are posted in a particular village, they have to undergo field level
                                                          training.
   4.2     Right to Forest and Common Lands & Rural Land Use Regulations

       4.2.1 Panel specific context
The total notified forest area of Andhra Pradesh is 63,814 Sq. Km, which is 23.2 % of the
geographical area. The Reserved forests are 50,478.63 Sq. Km (79.10%), Protected forests
are 12,365.34 sq. km. (19.38%) and Un-classed forests constitute 969.76 Sq. Km. (1.52%) of
the total forest area (APFD,2009). All the forest lands are in the custody of Forest
Department. As on 30-06-2008, an extent of 27945.295 Hect was diverted for non forestry
purposes and the area of 25786.090 hect. was the compensatory afforestation area obtained.
At the same time, 98.60% of the funds requirement of Rs 11764.267 lakhs for compensatory
afforestation was deposited by the user agencies and the expenditure was Rs 6472.757 lakhs.
Even though the geographical area has not changed, the quality of forests, however have
changed.


In 2005 assessment, the Very Dense Forest was 820 Sq.kms, Moderately Dense Forest was
24,805 Sq. Kms, Open Forest was 19,606 Sq. Kms, Scrub was 10,394 Sq. Kms and Non-
Forest was 219,444 Sq. Kms. However, the Forest Department published State of Forest
Report as per accurate data obtained from satellite imageries first time in 2010. The Forest
had 931.73 sq. kms of Very Dense Forest, 18408.48 Km Moderately Dense Forest and
22651.28 sq.kms Open Forest and corresponding figures in 2011 are 931.73 sq.km of Very
Dense Forest, 18400.61 sq.kms Moderately Dense Forest, 22594.92 sq.kms Open Forest.
Maximum negative change was noticed in Khammam Circle with net negative change of
58.52 sq. kms followed by Rajahmundry Circle with a net negative change of 22.75 sq.kms.
Minimum net negative change of only 0.14 sq.kms was found in Ananthapur Circle. In the
Protected Areas the net negative change was found to be 2.39 sq. kms.


It was reported that fresh attempts on encroachments had contributed to nearly 65% of the
overall negative changes. Rest of the negative changes are attributed to preparation of forest
lands for raising semi mechanical plantations and rotational felling of eucalyptus and other
plantations. (Source: Andhra Pradesh State of Forest Report:2013). The degradation also
resulted to some extent in decreased output of MFP which is discussed under Girijan
Cooperative Corporation. The statistics published in Andhra Pradesh State of Forest Report:
2013 also show that there is deficit in net revenue compared to net expenditure (plan + non
plan) from 1996-97 to 2006-07 (Annexure1a) but discussions with forest officials revealed
that the flow of funds from government under plan and non plan are not linked to revenues
generated.


Forest dependant populations: The Scheduled area in the state extends to nine districts and
66% of the forests are located in these scheduled areas. Sizeable Scheduled Tribes living
outside the scheduled area also depend on forests. Thus about 75% of tribal population is
forest dependent and the degree of their dependence varies according to the location of their
habitation and occupation. Having lived in isolation in forests for several generations, tribes
have developed their own way of life called ‘culture’. The most important aspect of this
culture is treating the forests as community resource and individual tribal families have
usufruct right with the consent of the community elders. (Sastry, V.N.V.K: 2011). Other
communities like Sheppard, cattle herders, bamboo workers (Medari), fishermen etc also
depended on forests and water bodies located in the forests for livelihood.

Rights under Forest Legislations: Administration of forests in Andhra Pradesh has two
historical backgrounds. The forests in Andhra and Rayalaseema areas were governed by
Madras Forest Act, 1882 while the forests in Telengana area were governed by Hyderabad
Forest Act, 1322 Fasli. The Andhra Pradesh Forest Act, 1967 came into force from
15.04.1967 after repealing both these Acts.
   The following legislations presently in force have provisions to provide different kinds of

Settlement Process under Andhra Pradesh Forest Act, 1967: As per A.P. Forest Act,
government have powers to constitute any land as a reserved. However, the government should
appoint a forest settlement Officer to notify boundaries, call for objections, enquire and settle
the rights of people before final declaration is issued. Detailed procedure is prescribed from
Sec4 to Sec 15 of the Act for this purpose. The Andhra Pradesh Forest Act, 1967 also provides
for deletion of some areas as per Sec28.


Statistics of Andhra Pradesh Forest Department show that the settlement process is completed
and notified under Section 15 of the AP Forest Act in 2592 forest blocks covering 5146826
Hectares and pending in 986 blocks covering an area of 12,34,547 Hectares( ie 30,86,367.50
acres). The forest department has been treating all these lands as “protected forests”. The
forest officials during discussions on the subject informed that the Sec 4 notified areas
whether or not finally declared under Sec 15 are being treated as forest areas for application
of Forest Conservation Act, 1980. Hence, people can be evicted from these lands unless their
occupation is recognized under FRA, 2006.The district wise number of blocks and areas
notified and to be notified are given in Annexure 1 (Source: A. P. Forest Department, Key
Informant: Sri Kashappa, IFS, Chief Conservator of Forests O/O of PCCF, Hyderabad)


Impact of incomplete settlement process: Non completion of the settlement process for
several decades in some areas has led to conflicts between forest officials and forest dwellers
leading to booking of cases against the forest dwellers. Where the settlement process was
reported to have been completed also there are several disputes over the boundaries as the
ancestral lands, very old habitations were also included in the reserve forests without looking
into ground realities and whose language was also different from local/official language.
There is ambiguity in boundaries in some notifications. Some of these notifications were
issued during British and Nizam’s period without verifying local situations and continued
under A.P.Forest Act,1967.(Sastry,V.N.V.K,1989). A study by Tribal Welfare Department
showed that the disputes over boundary between revenue and forest extend over several
hundred kilometers. (Sastry, V.N.V.K. and others: 1996). Even the lands held by tribals with
the permission of Muttadars (Muttadar is a tribal chief appointed by British government in
1920s to administer Mutta -group of villages) were included in Section 4 notification and
continue in a state of confusion as all Section 4 notified areas whether or not finally settled
under Sec15 of the Act are treated on par with reserve forest areas for implementing Forest
Conservation Act,1980. (Sastry, V.N.V.K., 2011).
70 | P a g e
As the issues relating to forest settlement were pending, the Forest (Conservation Act) 1980
came into force from October 25, 1980 putting ‘Restriction on the de-reservation of forests or
use of forest land for non-forest purpose’. Adding to the misery of the people is the problem
of perpetual vacancies of Forest Settlement Officers for decades as these posts are treated as
punishment/non rewarding posts by revenue officials and are remembered only at the time of
promotions for calculation of vacancies for promoting revenue officials to that rank. Soon
after getting the promotion, the officers try for transfer or deputation to the posts of their
choice leaving the Forest settlement work unattended. Now even if the settlement process is
taken up, the areas on which rights are determined cannot be deleted by State using the Sec
28 of A.P. Forest Act, 1967 in view of restrictions imposed under Forest Conservation
Act,1980.The resultant effect is that the forest dwellers became susceptible to punishments by
forest officials for decades.

Joint Forest Management Programme as a result of 1988 Forest Policy: As the Forest
Act, 1980 has put total ban on conversion of forests to any non-forestry activity without the
permission of Government of India and consequent delay in confirmation of rights already in
the process, several disturbances occurred in tribal areas throughout the country and also in
A.P. A review was made at all India level and National Forest Policy was issued in 1988.
(Sastry, V.N.V.K: 2011) which has recognized the symbiotic relationship between tribal
people and forests.


Government of India through their Resolution dated 7-12-1988 directed that the “Primary
task of all agencies, responsible for forest management including the forest development
corporations should be to associate the tribal people closely in protection, regeneration and
development of forests as well as to provide gainful employment to people living in and
around the forest”. In consonance with the National Forest Policy 1988, Government of
Andhra Pradesh issued a State Forest Policy in 1993 for “encouraging the participation of
village communities in forest management through Joint Forest Management by organizing
them in to Vana Samrakshna Samithis” and the Government of Andhra Pradesh have issued
orders in 1992 (GoAP: 1992) for improvement of degraded forests through the participation
of local people by introduction of the Joint Forest Management (JFM) programme. Learning
from the experiences of implementation of Joint Forest Management through V.S.S, the
Government of Andhra Pradesh issued a revised Andhra Pradesh State Forest Policy, 2002 to
“consolidate the initiatives taken in the area of JFM and evolve the system further into

71 | P a g e
Community Forest Management. This was followed by a Government Order (GoAP: 2002).
The Government Order issued in 2002 (G.O.Ms.No.13 Dated: 12 .2 .2002 Environment
Forest Science & Technology (For.iii) Department, Government of Andhra Pradesh) was
amended in 2004 (G.O.Ms.No.4 Dated: 12th January, 2004 Environment, Forests, Science &
Technology (For.iii) Dept., Government of Andhra Pradesh) to give some more clarity on
benefits to members of Vana Samrakshna Samithies (VSS). This coincided with the
implementation of World Bank Assisted Andhra Pradesh Forestry Project. The important
benefits accruing to the members of VSS from forests managed by them as per the amended
government order are as follows:

   (a) All Non-timber Forest Produce;
   (b) All Intermediate yields obtained from silvi cultural operations in natural forests;
   (c) All timber and bamboo (including yield from bamboo plantations) harvested from the
       forest managed by them except in case of plantations;
   (d) In case of teak plantations within VSS area, whose age is known, twice the
       proportionate yield harvested (including yield from thinning) with reference to age of
       the plantation and the period of maintenance by the Vana Samrakshana Samithi
       (maximum entitlement will not however exceed the total yield of the plantation);
   (e) In case of other plantations, whose age is known, 50% of harvest(including thinning)
       of the period of management of plantation by Vana Samrakshana Samithi is less than
       50% of the rotation period and 100% of volume harvested if such period of
       management by the Vana Samrakshana Samithi is more than 50% of rotation period
       of the plantation.
   (f) All the timber obtained from second and subsequent rotations of all plantations.
Problems in implementation:The progress was last reviewed by the Chief Commissioner of
Land Reforms, Hyderabad on 09-01-2014. Studies were also conducted by Sunil Kumar M
and Darryl Vhugen(2008), Reddy, M Gopinath and others(2011), Sastry, V.N.V.K.(2011),
Kalpavriksh and Vasundhara(2013), ELDF(2011), Chaithanaya,E.P(2012) on implementation
of the FRA, 2006. Several implementation issues emerged in these meetings/studies as
follows:

   i   Many Gram Sabha/FRC members are not aware on the provisions of FRA to exercise
       their duties




72 | P a g e
   ii It was officials, who are supposed to assist the Gram Sabha, have actually
       convened/conducted meetings
   iii Large    percentage    of   claims    (61%)    were     rejected   with   out    proper
       verification(Annexure-1)
   iv Rights over community resources were vested with Vana Samrakshna Samithis
       created by executive order and has limited membership while, these rights should be
       vested with Gram Sabha as per Act. Even these rights were not recorded in the forest
       records/maps.The VSS themselves have become dormant and therefore not able to
       excersise their ownership rights especially over Minor Forest Produce. Government of
       India’s instructions to vest the community rights with Gram Sabha/Gram Panchayat
       as per PESA Act are yet to be implemented.
   v The individual or group rights are not registered in the records/maps of forest
       department as according to forest officials the land is still treated as forest land and
       the occupations are not interfered with due to their recognition under FRA, 2006.
       However, the revenue department at Mandal level is maintaining separate registers
       indicating FRA titles. Presently there is no clear mechanism to involve communities
       for mapping and recording of group rights in forest lands.
   vi Imposition of deadlines to complete work led to undue rush and incomplete work or
       work with many mistakes in area, names, photographs etc.
   vii Tribal customary law is oral and therefore, the tribals in many cases could not
       produce documentary evidence. The traditional forest dwellers also could not produce
       evidence of residence of three generations due to lack of records with government
       themselves. Hence many of their claims were rejected.
   viii Whether non-tribals can be issued titles in scheduled areas in view of LTR and
       Samatha Judgement is another issue not clear to field functionaries.
   ix Ministry of Tribal Affairs issued a circular in 2010 to states and requested them to
       review the cases where the rejection is unduly high. No action has been taken so far as
       per amendment rules in 2012.
   x Conducting of Gram Sabhas and formation of Forest Rights Committees in every
       habitation as per revised guidelines and rules to give opportunities to all eligible
       persons is yet to be taken up
During interviews in the month of February,2014 by the E.I. in connection with this project,
the TW Department officials complained that the DFOs are not signing on the titles (3318
titles to an extent of 6165 acres) approved by the District level committees. The Forest
73 | P a g e
officials on the other hand say that large scale encroachments occurred after FRA, 2006 came
in to force especially in Khammam and Warangal districts, as the forest dwellers are thinking
that their occupations will also be recognised at a later date in a similar way. Therefore, the
eligibility as per FRA, 2006 is required to be verified thoroughly before giving their approval.


Ownership of MFP with Gram Sabha as per PESA: Andhra Pradesh Panchayat Raj
(Amendment) Act, 1998 popularly known as PESA vests ‘the ownership of minor forest
produce with the Gram Panchayat or the as the case may be Gram Sabha’. The Rules were
issued in 2011 after 13 years (G.O.Ms.No. 66, PanchayatRaj and Rural Development
(MDL.I) Department Dated: 24.03.2011) and the elections to Gram Panchayats were held in
2013. Thus there is delay of 15 years in putting the PESA in operation. Discussions with
Presidents of Gram Panchayats in Scheduled areas of Adilabad, Warangal and
Visakhapatnam district in the last three months by the E.I. have revealed that most of them
are not aware of the rights of Gram Sabhas under PESA. Hence they could not exercise their
rights over ownership of MFP under this law.

Non Forest Rural Common lands:Non-Forest Rural common lands include the following:
Public Roads, Parks, Schools, hospitals etc, Walkways (shortcuts) connecting internal roads
with habitations or water sources, fields, temples etc, Kuntas (tanks), lakes etc, Canals and
Canal bunds,Village meeting places (Chavadi),Common Thrashing grounds,Places where
stray cattle are detained (Bandili Doddi),Places allocated for defecation esp. by women in the
nights, Grazing areas, Market Yards, Parking Places in weekly markets and Poramboku (Un-
assed Waste). Non-Forest village common lands were identified in record when these records
were prepared several decades ago. These are treated as government revenue lands. These
commons are included in the village Permanent Register with survey numbers and can be
assigned only on specific order of Government to individual / organisations. Encroachment is
punishable under law. Non-objectionable encroachments are either regularized later or
encroacher is evicted / penalized by imposition of fee. There is no sustained and systematic
monitoring of encroachments.


While common rights are recognised and accepted generally, by way of acceptance, by
convention / custom, however this is not reflected formally in the records (revenue or
forests). Whenever common / group rights are affected, the present policy of Government is
to compensate affected people through R&R measures. There is no formal recording of these

74 | P a g e
rights. The Tree Patta Scheme on government lands, however, did create right on trees
without rights on land. However this scheme did not take off. Conversion of rural agriculture
land to other non-agricultural purposes is regulated by law and regulations such as conversion
of agricultural land for pisci-culture, for non-agricultural purposes of any nature. However,
due to absence of such regulations in the past, there have been adverse effects on land use
planning as well as environment. Farm forestry has also affected land use for agriculture.
There is no regulation prohibiting change of land use within “agriculture sector”. More over
after the abolition of hereditary village officers system, there is no regular mechanism of
maintaining records and their annual verification in Jamabandi. Hence revenue officials
informed that the village revenue records need thorough revision/updating.


A.P. State had a Non Agriculture Land Assessment Act (NALA, 1963) where any use of
agriculture land to non-agriculture purposes had to be done by payment of a special fee. This
Act has now been replaced by AP Agricultural Land (Conversion for non-agriculture
purposes) Act, 2006. There are a series of regulations that restrict rural land transferability
which serve public purpose and are enforced. (E.g.ban on conversion of agriculture land into
fish tanks due to environmental reasons, restrictions on conversion of agricultural land for
non-agricultural purposes etc. Enforcement has now become more stringent as a result of
various directions from Courts (setting up of Coastal Zone Regulatory Authority), setting up
of Committees at district and state level to permit conversions / change of land use.


There are no worthwhile formal rural land use plans. Plans exist only for urban land use.
Whenever the rural land use is to be changed on a large scale, public consultation under EIA
is a must and followed but not with the transparency needed. Land use changes on smaller
scale/individual level are recorded in supplementary register and updated in village
Permanent Register in subsequent years. For individuals change of land use is not regulated
except by collection of a fee. Therefore there are no requirements of public input.


There is no rural land use policy and hence there is no monitoring or assessment of land use
changes. Rural land use changes in smaller units by individuals are more in villages near
urban areas for housing, industry etc. but in the interior villages the changes occur on an
unplanned basis. In villages’ gram panchayats / Director, Town and Country Planning give
permission for housing / other non-agriculture purposes.         As far as pasture lands are
concerned due to land assignment policies the availability has reduced. There is no rezoning
75 | P a g e
plan for rural land use. Therefore, there is no public process to permit change of land use.
Any rights affected have to be asserted in the Court of law only. However, the LAR&R Act
2013 that is effective from January, 1, 2014 provides mechanisms for safeguarding the
interests of affected persons. (Key Informants: Sri Ramana, Special Deputy Collector, (Retd)
and Smt. C.V. Lakshmi, Special Deputy Collector(Retd).


In tribal areas of north coastal Andhra Pradesh, the hill slopes fit for shifting cultivation.
(Podu/Jhum) within the traditional boundary of tribal village are treated as common lands by
the tribal communities as per customary law. The individuals have only the usufruct right
while community owns it. These lands are located in reserve forests or outside. If they are
located in reserve forest, the de jure ownership was with Forest Department only but the de
facto ownership with the community was not generally interfered with till the Forest
Conservation Act, 1980 was enacted. Since then,       the slash and burn cultivation in reserve
forests is not being allowed and the three plot cycle reduced to one plot. Pattas were issued to
tribals over these Podu lands, if they are eligible as per provisions of FRA, 2006. Tribals who
had already grown coffee, cashew and pine apple plantations in their own Podu lands located
outside reserve forests are now opting for coffee and cashew plantations in these FRA lands
on their own choice with wages provided under NREGS and plant material supplied by ITDA
(SCA).

         4.2.2 Dimension wise scoring
LGI: 2.1       Rights to forest and common lands

2 1 1 Forests are clearly identified in law and responsibility for use is clearly assigned-
Score:B

Analysis:

   1. AP Forest Act,1967 provides for clear identification of forest areas with “well-known
      or readily intelligible boundaries, such as roads, rivers, bridges and the like”. 79% of
      forest area was finally declared as Reserve Forests leaving 21% ie. about 30 lakh
      acres without completion of settlement process leading to conflicts between forest
      dwellers and forest officials. In areas where settlement is completed also, there are
      disputes but not many compared to areas not settled.
   2. The implementation is ambiguous as there are several forest revenue boundary
      disputes due to incomplete settlement process.
   3. The responsibility for land use is with Forest Dept. as per this Act .
   4. The role of forest dwellers in protection of forests and the benefits flowing to the
      Forest Protection Committees are also clearly defined as per National Forest policy


76 | P a g e
        1988 and as well as JFM and CFM policies of the state government. There are
        problems in implementation of the JFM/ CFM policies
     5. Score B is therefore most appropriate -highlighted

Expert Investigator Dr.V.N.V.K. Sastry elaborated on the explanation in support of option
‘B’.

It was agreed that 79% of Forests has been finally notified (Reserve Forests) and ambiguity
exists only in 21% of the area identified as forest areas (treated as Protected Forests and un
classed Forests). However in the areas that have been notified as forests, there is clarity on
the responsibility of land use. Hence the score was retained as B as per the consensus.

B: Forests are clearly identified, responsibility for land use is clearly identified but
implementation is ambiguous.

2 1 2 Common lands are clearly identified in law and responsibility for use is clearly
assigned - Score: B

Analysis:

     1. Non-Forest village common lands are identified in record when these records were
        prepared several decades ago. These are treated as government revenue lands as per
        The Andhra Pradesh Land Encroachment Act, 1905. These commons are included in
        the village Permanent Register with survey numbers and can be assigned only on
        specific order of Government to individual / organizations.
     2. The Revenue Department has already commenced identification of 180 varieties of
        lands in the records and has undertaken the task of updating the records and putting it
        in public domain.
     3. Encroachment is punishable under The Andhra Pradesh Land Encroachment Act,
        1905. Non objectionable encroachments are either regularized later or encroacher is
        evicted / penalized by imposition of fee.
     4. However, the Government and local level officials are not vigilant enough to prevent
        encroachment.
     5. There is no sustained and systematic monitoring of encroachments.
     6. Hence score B is most appropriate

Panellists agreed on the point that implementation is ambiguous and submitted supporting
papers on classification of common lands which show that there are 180 varieties of common
lands. The Revenue Department has already commenced identification of these lands in the
records and has undertaken the task of updating the records and putting it in public domain.
There was therefore consensus in support of option B.

2 1 3 Rural group rights are formally recognized and can be enforced- Score: D

Analysis:

1.   Under the A.P. Forest Act, there is provision for recognition of rights. But this process is
     not completed in 30 lakh acres leading to conflict of interest between Forest Department
     and Forest Dwellers.


77 | P a g e
2.    Similarly under Wild Life Protection Act also there is provision for recognition of rights.
      But there are cases of non-recognition of rights in some areas.
3.    Under FRA community rights were conferred on VSS instead of Gram Sabha as per the
      Act. Even these rights were not recorded in forest records.
4.    Rights over village commons are recognized and accepted by way of convention /
      custom. However this is not reflected formally in the revenue records.
5.    Whenever common / group rights are affected, the present policy of Government is to
      compensate affected people through R&R measures.
6.     Score D is most appropriate.

2 1 4 Users’ rights to key natural resources on land (incl. fisheries) are legally recognized
and protected in practice - Score: B

Analysis:

     1. Community’s rights over forests are formally recognized as per FRA, 2006 but only
        some like rights over collection of MFP are really protected.
     2. It is a time taking process to assert the rights due to defects in survey and settlement,
        lack of clear demarcation of boundaries and lack of knowledge and orientation on the
        part of officials of nodal departments.
     3. In case of Village commons, as the lands are treated as government lands, access of
        user is permitted by custom / convention but there is no formal recording of rights.
     4. Score B is most appropriate

2 1 5 Multiple rights over common land and natural resources on these lands can legally
coexist- Score: C

Analysis:
   1. Ownership /user rights over village common land and property, natural resources are
       recognized by convention and not registered except in some cases such as fisheries by
       law.
   2. There is possibility for coexistence of multiple rights over common land and natural
       resources but they are not enforced extensively.
   3. If there is any violation, mechanism to resolve conflict is inadequate and dilatory.
   4. Score C is most appropriate


2 1 6 Multiple rights over the same plot of land and its resources (e.g. trees) can legally
coexist - Score: C

Analysis:
   1. In case of MFP yielding trees, the ownership rights are with government and usufruct
       (collection) rights are with forest dwellers.
   2. There is no mechanism to register rights or resolve disputes
   3. In case of other community forest resources like the sacred groves, the community’s
       rights are respected rather than recorded.
   4. The Tree Patta Scheme sanctioned earlier did create right on trees without rights on
       land. However, this scheme did not take off.
   5. Score C is most appropriate.

78 | P a g e
2 1 7 Multiple rights over land and mining/ other sub-soil resources located on the same
plot can legally coexist -Score: B

Analysis:

   1. Where open cast / underground mining is to be taken up in forest lands, they are
      diverted for non-forestry purposes after obtaining permission of GoI as per FCA,
      1980 (with amendments in 1988).
   2. Forest department continues to be legal owner while lease holders have rights over
      exploitation of resources within the given permissions (esp. time and quantity.
   3. In case of mining in government lands, they are leased to the lease holders. In case of
      private lands, they are acquired by the government and leased to lease holders.
   4. But cases of the agreements not respected by lease holders in practice also occurred
      leading to legal action by forest department/government and approaching courts by
      individuals.
   5. When there are multiple rights, everyone has to respect them. In the event of
      violation, one is forced to assert his rights legally in a Court of Law, as there is no
      adequate and suitable mechanism for dispute resolution. Mr. Laxmi Narasimham
      mentioned that an assignment holder can be given ex gratia in the event that subsoil
      resources in his land are exploited affecting his rights adversely, as he is unaware or
      capable of exploiting the same on his own. Therefore option ‘B’ is a better score. This
      was agreed to unanimously.

2 1 8 Accessible opportunities exist for mapping and recording of group rights - Score: C

Analysis

   1. Accessible opportunities exist for forest lands as well as village commons but
      presently there is no clear mechanism to involve communities for mapping and
      recording of group rights in forest lands.
   2. Group rights or collective tenures can be recorded but it is not being done in a clear
      or affordable manner and leads to hardships.
   3. Officials also do not have complete knowledge of customary law. As of now the
      customary rights are not recorded in forest maps.
   4. The panellists suggested option ‘C’ with the supporting statement that law provides
      rights but is not being recorded. After the discussions, the consensus was for option C
      on grounds that group rights or collective tenures can be recorded but it is not being
      done in a clear or affordable manner and leads to hardships.

2 1 9 Boundary demarcation of communal land- Score: A

Analysis

   1. The boundary demarcation of in all village commons is done by assigning survey
      numbers, however these records and maps are not updated.
   2. But right to use/ derive benefit by individuals in case of dispute can be acquired on
      these lands only by declaration of decree of Court.
   3. In case of forest areas there are boundary disputes due to incomplete settlement
      process only in 21% areas as well as in very small parts of settled areas.

79 | P a g e
    4. Rank ‘A’ is most appropriate because the boundary demarcation is done in majority
       of village commons
All panellists agreed that option ‘A’ is the appropriate ranking as the village maps do clearly
demarcate common lands, however these records and maps are not updated. Therefore option
A was agreed to by consensus.

LG1: 2 2 Effectiveness and equity of rural land use regulations

2 2 1 Restrictions regarding rural land use are justified and enforced - Score: B

Analysis

 1. Conversion of rural agriculture land to other non-agricultural purposes is regulated by
    law and regulations such as conversion of agricultural land for pisci-culture, for non-
    agricultural purposes of any nature. However due to absence of such regulations in the
    past, there have been adverse effects on land use planning as well as environment. Farm
    forestry has also affected land use for agriculture.
 2. There is no regulation prohibiting change of land use within “agriculture sector”.
 3. More over after the abolition of hereditary village officers system, there is no regular
    mechanism of maintaining records and their annual verification in Jamabandi.
 4. Hence revenue officials informed that the village revenue records need thorough
    revision/updating.
 5. While some panellists felt that the system is not transparent and suggested option ‘C’ to
    be a more appropriate score because local government does not take any steps to evict
    the ineligible encroachers. It was however agreed that option ‘B’ is appropriate because
    though law is there, the enforcement is weak. It is unanimously agreed to B.

2 2 2 Restrictions on rural land transferability effectively serve public policy objectives -
Score: B

Analysis

   1. State had a Non Agriculture Land Assessment Act (NALA)1963, where any use of
      agriculture land to non-agriculture purposes had to be done by payment of a special
      fee. This Act has now been replaced by AP Agricultural Land (Conversion for non-
      agriculture purposes) Act, 2006.
   2. There are a series of regulations that restrict rural land transferability which serve
      public purpose and are enforced.(eg.ban on conversion of agriculture land into fish
      tanks due to environmental reasons, restrictions on conversion of agricultural land for
      non-agricultural purposes etc.. There are no restrictions on marginal farmer selling his
      land even though he becomes landless. A Ryot can sell his land to a non-
      agriculturalist and for conversion of this land for non-agricultural purpose by the
      purchaser, permission of government is required. However a sub-tenant cannot sell
      his rights
   3. Enforcement has now become more stringent as a result of various directions from
      Courts (setting up of Coastal Zone Regulatory Authority), setting up of Committees at
      district and state level to permit conversions / change of land use.
   4. Score B is most appropriate.

2 2 3 Rural land use plans are elaborated/changed via public process and resulting
burdens are shared - SCORE: NO SCORE GIVEN

Analysis

  1. There are no worthwhile formal rural land use plans. Plans exist only for urban land
     use. Whenever the rural land use is to be changed on a large scale, public consultation
     under EIA is a must and followed but not with the transparency needed.
  2. Land use changes on smaller scale/individual level are recorded in supplementary
     register and updated in village Permanent Register in subsequent years.
  3. For individuals change of land use is not regulated except by collection of a fee.
     Therefore there are no requirements of public input.
  5. Country planning department does not attend to rural land use planning due to lack of
     sufficient staff.
  6. None of the options fit the actual situation and therefore no score is given.

As such the panellists felt that none of the given options fit the existing situation in the State,
as there are no rural land use plans and public process doesn’t arise. It was mentioned during
the consultations that the Town and Country Planning Department needs to prepare Village
Development Plans but is unable to do so due to severe paucity of staff to undertake the
massive work involved and therefore there is no rural land use planning and public
consultation or sharing of burdens or gains. It was agreed that none of the options fit the
actual situation and therefore no score is given.

2 2 4 Rural lands, the use of which is changed, are swiftly transferred to the destined use -
Score: NO SCORE GIVEN

Analysis

  1. Since there is no rural land use policy, there is no monitoring or assessment of land use
     changes. Rural land use changes in smaller units by individuals are more in villages
     near urban areas for housing, industry etc. but in the interior villages the changes occur
     on an unplanned basis. In village’s gram panchayats / Director, Town and Country
     Planning give permission for housing / other non-agriculture purposes.
  2. As there is no specific data available on this separately, it is not possible to indicate
     percentage.
  3. No score is given due to absence of data.



2 2 5 Rezoning of rural land use follows a public process that safeguards existing rights -
Score: D

Analysis

   1. There is no rezoning plan for rural land use. Therefore there is no public process to
      permit change of land use.
   2. Any rights affected have to be asserted in the Court of law only.

81 | P a g e
   3. However, the LAR&R Act 2013 that is effective from January, 1, 2014 provides
      mechanisms for safeguarding the interests of affected persons.
   4. Score ‘D’ is most appropriate.

2 2 6 For protected rural land use (forest, pastures, wetlands, national parks etc.) plans
correspond to actual use - Score: NO SCORE GIVEN

Analysis

   1. Land such as forests, grazing lands, wet lands and other common property resources
      are under the management of different Departments which have their own
      Departmental budgets and schemes for actual use.
   2. As far as pasture lands are concerned due to land assignment policies the availability
      has reduced.
   3. As no data exists to make a categorical score, no score can be given.

        4.3         Urban Land Use, Planning and development

        4.3.1 Panel Specific Context
As per the Census 2011, the Country's urban population at 377,105,760 constitutes 31.16% of
the total population. The level of urbanization in Andhra Pradesh is 33.49% as per 2011
census, which is 6.19 percentage points higher than that of 200129.
                                                                                No. of UAs/Towns

In Andhra Pradesh the total number of UAs/towns recorded in 2011 is 260 (58 UAs formed
with 61 STs& 90 CTs and 64 STs & 138 CTs independently accounting for the 353 towns in
different urban classes) as against 173 in 2001 showing an increase of 87 in numbers. It is
pertinent to note that the number of villages have come down from 28,123 in 2001 Census to
27,800 in 2011 Census. This is reflected in the increase recorded in number of towns in class
II, IV and Substantial increase in population is recorded in class II towns during the decade 30.


The above statistics clearly indicate the rising pressure on land due to sheer rise in
urbanization in the state. As more and more area is diverted for urban related activities, the
value of land as an asset rises exponentially and the urban land management gains complexity
as a practice. This calls for devising a robust urban land management system for meeting the
future urban growth requirements in the state.


Andhra Pradesh (Andhra Area) Town Planning Act, 1920: Way back in 1920, the
Presidency of Madras observed that;
        -     many municipalities in the Presidency have from time to time devised schemes to
              form new extensions or relieve congestion

     http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011-prov-results/paper2-vol2/data_files/AP/Chapter_IV.pdf
   -   the schemes have often been prepared only after great damage has been done, the
       mischief of which could have been avoided if steps had been taken in time
   -    the schemes usually involved deterrent expenses, which could have been obviated
       by a simple course of anticipating development before it takes place
   -   nothing costs to decide beforehand that a street shall be projected in a certain
       direction and of a certain width instead spending large sums of money to realign and
       widen a street after it has been allowed to grow up in a haphazard way
   -   the principles of betterment contributions or special assessments would be applied and
       part of cost of constructing roads and other works could be charged to the holders of
       properties receiving immediate and direct benefit from the schemes
   -   The schemes should keep the utility, preserve objects of architectural or natural
       beauty,   regulate the architecture and provide open spaces, gardens and recreation
       grounds etc.
With these observations, it was considered desirable to suggest to municipalities through
legislation that they should intelligently anticipate and provide for future development by
framing town planning schemes and to give them power to carry these schemes.


This resulted in the passage of Madras Town Planning Act, 1920, which has been adapted as
Andhra Pradesh (Andhra Area) Town Planning Act, 1920 after the State of Andhra
Pradesh was formed in the year 1956. This Act was followed up with the Andhra Pradesh
Municipalities Act, 1965 that contained certain specific provisions relating to land uses have
been incorporated in Andhra Pradesh Municipalities Act, 1965 which came into force from 2-
4-1965. The APM Act is a consolidated legislation governing the whole state of Andhra
Pradesh and it replaced Andhra Pradesh (Andhra Area) District Municipalities Act, 1920
which governed Andhra Area and Andhra Pradesh (Telangana Area) District Municipalities
Act, 1956 which governed Telangana Area. Sections 268 and 269 of APM Act are relevant.


Hyderabad Municipal Corporation Act, 1955: While municipalities (now including nagar
panchayats) are governed under APM Act, 1965, the municipal corporations are governed
under Hyderabad Municipal Corporation Act, 1955. Chapter XIII containing sections 464 to
479 deal with land use and related matter. The chapter was however repealed during 1975.

Andhra Pradesh Urban Areas (Development) Act, 1975: The urban local bodies (ULBs)
in Andhra Pradesh which are traditionally mandated to undertake certain basic civic functions
like water supply, roads, drains, street lighting and sanitation could not plan for development
of urban areas and regulation of urban growth. In order to provide for the development of
urban areas according to plan and for matters ancillary thereto, Andhra Pradesh Urban Areas
(Development) Act, 1975 was passed by the Legislature of the State during 1975. This Act
repealed Chapter XIII of HMC Act, 1955 Chapter XIII of HMC Act. Since Hyderabad city
and its surrounding areas have been declared as Hyderabad Development Authority under
Andhra Pradesh Urban Areas (Development) Act, 1975, it was felt that Chapter XIII of HMC
Act would be superfluous and therefore was repealed. Subsequently, UDAs were constituted
for Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada (including Guntur) during 1978; and Warangal and
Tirupathi during 1982.


In view of large scale growth of Hyderabad and its surrounding areas in recent years, it was
felt that Hyderabad be developed as a metropolitan area. To establish a Metropolitan
Development Authority for the purpose of planning, coordinating, supervising, promoting
and securing the planned development of Hyderabad Metropolitan Region, the Hyderabad
Metropolitan Development Authority Act has been passed during 2008. Even though the
basic objectives of Urban Development Authorities (of various urban areas) constituted under
AP Urban Areas (Development) Act, 1975 and Hyderabad Metropolitan Development
Authority constituted under 2008 Act are broadly similar, it is necessary to understand them
in terms of relevant Acts.


AP Urban Areas (Development) Act, 1975: Chapter III of the Act deals with Master Plan
and Zonal Development Plans and contains sections 6 to 12 that focus on the modalities for
preparation of the Master Plan, the Zonal Development Plan, Procedure to be followed for
preparation and approval of plans and modifications to be made for the Plans.


The Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) was constituted under the
provisions of Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority Act, 2008. It was formed by
merging the erstwhile Hyderabad Urban Development Authority (HUDA), Hyderabad
Airport Development Authority (HADA), Cyberabad Development Authority (CDA) and
Buddha Poornima Project Authority (BPPA). Its jurisdictional area of 7,257 sq. kms covers
Hyderabad district and 849 villages across Ranga Reddy, Medak, Nalgonda and
86 | P a g e
Mahbubnagar districts. It was set up for the purposes of planning, co-coordinating,
supervising, promoting and securing planned development of the Hyderabad Metropolitan
Region. It coordinates the development activities of the municipal corporations,
municipalities and other local authorities, the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply &
Sewerage Board, the Andhra Pradesh Transmission Corporation, the Andhra Pradesh
Industrial Infrastructure Corporation, the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation,
and other similar bodies.


Before trying to assess or measure land governance through indicators, it is imperative to
clearly understand the relevant acts, policy measures, institutional mechanisms and roles of
various agencies in the urban land sector from good governance perspective.


In AP, Master plan approach is followed to guide urban development and chart the growth
and change in the state in an orderly manner. The Master Plan, which was perceived to be a
process rather than a conclusive statement, provides guidelines for the physical development
of a city or town and guides people in locating their investments and residences in the city. In
short, Master Plan is a design for the physical, social, economic and political framework for
the city, which greatly improves the quality of urban governance. Master plan delineates the
land in the urban region based on the specific purpose for which it is going to be used.


Land use restriction essentially indicates the reservation of certain land for a specific purpose.
Broadly, land can fall under two categories of ownership. In case of private ownership land
restriction is at the owner’s disposal and permits unrestricted exchange of land. In other
cases, public ownership/control and exchange of land use; it is in the form of statutory
provisions relating to the permissible development of land as a means of protecting the public
interest.


As far as land restrictions in urban areas of AP are concerned,AP Municipalities Act, 1965,
section dictates Notification of residential, industrial, commercial etc. land in the
municipality. This is done after consultation with Director of Public Health and Director of
Town Planning and with previous approval of Government. The municipalities notify in the
prescribed manner the localities, divisions, wards, streets or portions of streets in its local
limits which are reserved for residential, industrial, commercial or agricultural purposes.


87 | P a g e
In areas where Urban Development Authorities have been constituted, as per AP Urban
Areas (Development) Act, 1975, the Authority has to prepare a plan in draft and publish it
inviting objections and suggestions from any person on the draft plan. The Authority has to
also consult every local authority within the development area on the draft plan. The
Authority has to consider all objections, suggestions and representations received from the
public or local authorities. After considering the objections and suggestions, the Authority
shall finally prepare the plan and submit to Government for approval. The approach taken by
the state government in AP in preparation of development plans can be called a quasi-
participatory as the de-jure status of participation is not inclusive rather it is of post draft
objection base.
Good governance also requires that the land use restrictions are transparent in nature, change
in land use and management must provide significant benefits for society than just for
specific groups. In AP, any form of land use change from one category to another is notified
and GO (Government order) is passed after a 60 days window for receiving objections by
anyone who is affected by the change and to address them. Once the objections received are
addressed, the change of land use from one category to another is duly authorized for
implementation.
According to AP Urban areas development act, 1975, authorities have to prepare a Master
plan and also detailed zonal plans, also Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority act,
2008, mandates preparation of area development plan which include projects and schemes for
urban reform in specific areas falling under the metropolitan region. Considering this, it is
clear that a hierarchy of regional/sectoral plans exist in AP to guide urban development
within the state. These plans are published on a web based platform for public disclosure as
well.


In spite of many de-jure and de-facto examples of good urban land management practices in
AP, there is immense scope for learning from best practices in the country and adopting
innovative techniques to improve urban land governance in the state.


Background to the dimension analysis:
The land governance indicator 3.1 and subsequent dimensions deal with restrictions on urban
land ownership, transferability and use. In AP, ownership transfers are affected through
regulations like registration and documents under Andhra Pradesh Registration Act 1908.
Under section 32A the encumbrance certificate and the ownership title are required to be
88 | P a g e
produced. The registration and transfer of title is effected in the presence of the owner and
transferee with the signatures, thumb impression and photographs before sub-registrar of the
registration department.


Land use regulations covered under statutory plans [Master plans (general town planning
schemes, town planning schemes)] under the provisions of section 8 AP Town Planning act
1920 shall be published, calling objections and suggestions from the public under rule 29.
The government sanctions the plan after considering duly the objections and suggestions. It is
recommended that the government may invite views and suggestions from neighborhood
communities and civil society groups before preparation of the development plans.


Indicator 3.2 and subsequent dimensions try to assess the transparency of change in land use
regulations and also appraises the benefits provided by them to the public. Any urban
expansion coupled with the provision of infrastructure development in Andhra Pradesh
happens as a transparent process where the public awareness is ensured, as provided under
the statutes of AP Town Planning act 1920, in respect of town extension under Town
planning scheme and zonal development plans under AP Urban areas Act 1975. The process
for land use is as provided under rule 29 of AP Town Planning act 1920 and section 8 of AP
Urban areas (Development) act 1975. Changes in land use will be undertaken only after
considering objections and suggestions from the public. Change in land use involves a
process under the rule 29 of AP Town Planning Act 1920 and section 8 of AP Urban
Development Act 1975 and involves payment of charges for conversion and efforts therein.
As such most of changes would be affected immediately.


Land Governance indicator 3.3 and the dimensions within, seek to capture the efficiency in
the urban land use planning process in the state. National Urban Housing and Habitat policy
2007 envisages for providing “affordable housing for all” (urban poor) under the policy,
measures to promote housing, financial incentives, insisting certain % to the Economically
Weaker Sections & Lower Income Groups (EWS & LIG). The building projects of private
builders etc are envisaged in the policy. For AP, guidelines are provided under G.O No.
MS/589/MA dated 25.09.2009 which specifies the minimum area and % of housing units for
EWS, LIG in the housing projects undertaken by builders. Under JnNURM (Jawaharlal
Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission) reform, atleast 20-25% of developed land has been
earmarked in all housing projects for EWS/LIG. Development authorities like HUDA
89 | P a g e
(Hyderabad urban Development Authority), HADA (Hyderabad Airport Development
Authority), VUDA (Vishakhapatnam Urban Development Authority) & HMDA (Hyderabad
Metropolitan Development Authority) have made provisions for earmarking development
land to a range of 5% to 20% for EWS/LIG housing. Also, Andhra Pradesh Building rules,
2012, were amended by G.O Ms 245 dtd. 30.06.2012, making provisions for EWS/LIG
housing in all Group Housing & Group development projects. Even though there is a policy
for low cost housing the procedural aspects, the participation of needy people and payment
benefiting affects the rate of success and implementation of the policy.
Hyderabad is the largest city in the state; Land use plans (Master plans, Zonal development
plans) for Hyderabad are prepared as per the statutes given in chapter XIV of Municipal act
1956. Urban spatial expansion is guided by the provision of infrastructure. Although, there is
time lag in provision of infrastructure due to constraints of finances, land acquisition and
effective public participation. Same observation dictates the urban planning process in the
next four largest cities of the state. It is also observed that the magnitude of formal housing is
increasing considerably due to planning and development controls in the recent times due to
apartment culture approved layouts and colonies. This trend is bound to increase leading to
more public participation in formal housing. At present the proportion of formal housing is
about 70% – 75%.


The next LGI 3.4 pertains to the speed and requirements for granting building permits. In
Andhra Pradesh, Comprehensive AP building rules are given under G.O no. 168 MA&UD
(MI) dtd. 07.04.2012 which dictates the provisions for residential building permits. The main
reasons for ineffective compliance are lack of public participation, urban leadership, slums
and encroachments. Time limit for disposal of building application submitted under sections
209 to 277 of AP Municipalities act 1965 and chapter XIV of municipal corporation act 1956
and chapter IV of AP Urban Development Act 1975 are 30 days. Government in its G.O MS
503 dtd. 30.04.1987 clearly specifies the time limit for disposing the building applications.
Majority of building applications are disposed off in time. The main reasons for ineffective
compliance are lack of public participation and lack of clearances from concerned
departments.


Finally for panel 3, indicator 3.5 and subsequent dimensions relate to tenure regularization
schemes in urban areas. In AP, urban residential housing is formalized through
Comprehensive AP building rules as given under G.O no. 168 MA&UD (MI) dtd.
90 | P a g e
07.04.2012. As far as informal tenure is concerned, the policy for slum free city provides for
regularization of the land rights and provision for services to the existing informal occupants.
The AP Slum (Identification, Redevelopment, Rehabilitation and Promotion) Act, 2010,
prepared (under approval of Govt.) addresses the various objectives for achieving slum free
urban areas. Chapter 3 of the Act provides for protection of tenural rights of slum dwellers.


Salient features of the chapter are;
Survey and Identification of slum dwellers: The slum dwellers will be enumerated by the
Municipal Commissioner by producing the ration card, voter card, aadhar card etc.
Protection from eviction: A slum dweller will not be evicted or shifted from his living space
and rendered shelter-less without providing him an alternate accommodation.
Assigning Property Rights: The municipality will issue an Identity Card to the slum dweller
for entitlement to the dwelling space.
However, property rights are not assigned to slum dwellers if the land is located on
Hazardous/Objectionable government lands, Lands owned by Central Government, Lands
belonging to Defence Forces, Layout open spaces, parks, green belt zones, conservation
zones, schools, play grounds, health centres and stadiums etc. and lands reserved for any
specific purpose by the Government.


The AP Apartments (Promotion of construction and ownership) Act 1987, which provides for
undivided share of land and the common properties under section 8 & 9, allows effective
management and recording of urban property.

   4.3.2 Dimension-wise analysis and scorecard
The table below describes the indicators relevant to Urban land use, Planning and
Development given in the Land Governance Assessment Framework, World Bank. A
scorecard has been prepared to each indicator and subsequent dimensions based on the
observations and review of literature. The rationale/explanation for choosing a certain
dimension has also been provided.

LGI: 3.1- Restrictions on rights: land rights are not conditional on adherence to
unrealistic standards

3 1 1 Restrictions on urban land ownership/transfer effectively serve public policy
objectives- Score: B


91 | P a g e
Analysis: The AP Land Management Authority under the chairmanship of CCLA, has been
resuming lands which are not being used for the specified purposes. Certain other similar
cases in Vizianagram and Hyderabad of misusing the land were discussed and how the
Government is winning back the land running through litigation.

It is assumed that 90% of urban land use is being misused. Irregularities in the enforcement
of regulations are more around metropolitan regions of APand political forces play a role in
this regard. Panelists pointed out various lapses in the provisions of Acts and drew attention
to the various relaxations that were existing under the Urban Ceiling Act. While critically
appraising legislation, it is important to look at the circumstances under which the Act was
prepared. It is felt that Master plan which was prepared under the Act never delivered its
objectives as there is a lack of paraphernalia (provisions in Acts, finances etc.) to deliver the
objectives. Legislations must have strong enforcement mechanism in order to meet the
objectives. New kinds of land use such as mixed use are being promoted these days. Panelists
agreed that there must be availability of land for industrial housing in areas demarcated for
industrial purposes such as industrial estates, parks etc. Most panellists strongly expressed the
need for buffer zones between industrial zones and other land uses.

3 1 2 Restrictions on urban land use (disaster risk) effectively serve public policy objectives.
Score: B

Analysis: Panel members agreed to the fact that regulations are in place. However other
members opined that even though the restrictions serve public purposes, they are not
enforced.They felt that there is no single comprehensive policy document which documents
the risks and the restrictions that need to be placed on land use for potential disasters in the
urban areas. Panelists felt that some restrictions are there such as permission to construct
above certain heights, drilling bores etc. Certain remedial measures can be taken such as
earthquake resistant buildings. Regulation and laws are there but there is no enforcement of
the same.

Panel 3.2 focuses on transparency of land use restrictions: changes in land use and
management regulations are made in a transparent fashion and provide significant benefits
for society in general rather than just for specific groups.

3 2 1 Process of urban expansion/infrastructure development process is transparent and
respects existing rights. Score: B

Analysis: Panelists informed that there are certain procedures which are followed for
preparation of Master Plans and change of land use. They also informed that earlier it was
published in gazette and there ended the process, however, now govt. publishes the
information in gazette and also on the website, then calls for objections and then after making
appropriate changes passes the order. In Hyderabad, 100% of city is planned according to
Master plan, whereas in smaller towns they are not being implemented.

It was also discussed that in countries like USA, the process is much more democratic and
happens only after neighbourhood discussions etc. It was opined that ‘B’ should be the

92 | P a g e
appropriate score. It was also discussed that in case of remote lands, the process remaining
the same, it is not enforced.

Panelists suggested that the citizens must be able to decide for change in land use for faster
delivery. After the discussions, panelists agreed to ‘B’ as the most appropriate score.

3 2 2 Changes in urban land use plans are based on a clear public process and input by all
stakeholders. Score: B

Analysis: Panelists initiated the discussion by putting forth change in land use of heritage
buildings as an example of unreasonable restrictionon urban land use.After discussions there
was consensus amongst the panel members that 3. 2. 2 shall be graded ‘B’.

3 2 3 Approved requests for change in urban land use are swiftly followed by development
on these parcels of land, Score: A

Analysis: Change in land use involves a process of application through the local body to the
government. After receipt of any objections and suggestions and payment of conversion
charges change in actual land use is permitted. Most of the changes are complied with by the
destined use, however the mechanism to monitor this needs to be strengthened. The panel
consultation reached a consensus that 3.2.3 should be scored A.

LGI: 3.3 - Efficiency in the urban land use planning process: land use plans are current,
implemented, do not drive people into informality, and cope with urban growth.

3 3 1 Policy to ensure delivery of low-cost housing and services exists and is progressively
implemented. Score: B

Analysis: In the panel consultation it was pointed out and was generally agreed by all that
there is a lot of shortage of dwelling units. Government have a number of housing schemes
both affordable as well as for the poor and low income groups. And these schemes have been
taken up extensively throughout the state. AP is in the forefront as far as housing for the poor
and also for middle income groups. The consensus was that a score of B should be given.

3 3 2 Land use planning effectively guides urban spatial expansion in the largest
city.Score: C

Analysis: Hyderabad city is considered here. Land use and spatial expansion are guided by
statutes and also by effective implementation of infrastructure plans. In fact, there is always a
time lag for the provision of infrastructure due to constraints of finances and land acquisition
and want of effective public participation. The panellists reached a consensus that 3. 3. 2
should be scored “C”.
3 3 3 Land use planning effectively guides urban development in the four next largest
cities. Score: C



93 | P a g e
Analysis: The cities of Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada, Guntur and Warangal have been
considered here. The land use and special expansion are guided by statutes and also by
effective implementation of infrastructure plans. However, due to financial and land
acquisition constraints and limitations on public participation, the infrastructure could not be
provided in time.
The panel consultation on dimension 3.3.3 should be scored as “C”.

3 3 4 Planning processes are able to cope with urban growth.Score: B

Analysis:

Formal housing to some extent is achieved due to effective public participation and provision
of infrastructure. Had there been full public participation and better infrastructure, almost all
the new housing would have been planned.

The panel consultation for dimension 3.3.4 unanimously concluded for a score of B.

LGI: 3.4- Speed and predictability of enforcement of restricted land uses: development
permits are granted promptly and based on reasonable requirements.

3 4 1 Provisions for residential building permits are appropriate, affordable and complied
with. Score: B

Analysis: The panelists felt that in order to obtain a building permit, requisite mechanisms
exist and they are affordable and justifiable. However, cases of compliance with building
permits continue to be reported and action against violators is sporadic. Hence, the panel felt
that score of “B” would be appropriate.

3 4 2 A building permit for a residential dwelling can be obtained quickly and at a low cost.

Score: A

Analysis: The statutes provide the clearance of building permits within 3 months and in
almost all cases, it is being complied. In the discussion the panelists generally agreed that the
cost for obtaining permits is high, but decision comes within 3 months. It was informed that
the cost ranges from 5% of land or 7% of land cost as fee. It was also discussed and informed
by the panellists that while taking permission 15% of land has to be mortgaged to the local
authority which gets refunded after a stipulated amount of time.

During the discussions it was also mentioned that 40% of land value is paid as tax. Panelists
opined that measures need to be taken for making building construction affordable for
individuals and developers. It was also indicated that there is no access to funds being
provided by central banks etc. Further it was discussed that cost of structure depends upon
cost of land, so cost of land guides the overall cost of the residential dwelling.



94 | P a g e
Initially it was graded as ‘A’, after the discussions the scoring was found appropriate and was
retained.

3 5 1 Formalization of urban residential housing is feasible and affordable.Score: B

Analysis: The main reason for inadequate compliance is lack of public participation,
pressures of urbanization particularly due to migrant population and lack of adequate
resources to create infrastructure. Initially it was graded as ‘B’, after proper discussions the
scoring was found appropriate and was retained.

3 5 2 In cities with informal tenure, a viable strategy exists for tenure security,
infrastructure, and housing. Score: B

Analysis: The panellists agreed that a strategy exists to regularise land rights and provide
services to existing informal occupants but certain existing regulations have a contrary effect
of giving incentives for new informal occupations. Hence score B was given by consensus.

3 5 3 A condominium regime allows effective management and recording of urban
property. Score: A
Analysis: There is a clear provision under the statute to provide for creation of common
property and its management and its common use by all residents of condominiums,
apartments and layouts. Rights of common property are recorded while granting permissions
and transfers of ownership of the individual property in such common housing such as
staircases, corridors, etc.

Panelists agreed that there is a clear provision provided for condominiums. Initially it was
scored as ‘A’, after discussions the scoring was found appropriate and was retained.

   4.3.3 Policy recommendations
 Panel             Short Term                         Medium & Long term
  No
  3.1      Training should be imparted     Land use plans for all urban areas must be
           periodically to employees in    prepared. The town and country planning

   3.3                                     Since changes occur very fast in urban areas
                                           relating to land use, the land records and
                                           maps should be constantly updated by using
                                           latest technology




95 | P a g e
    4.4        Public Land Management

    4.4.1 Panel specific context
Two main problems associated with public land is that the public land is not defined and
demarcated, and land registry is not updated and mutation is not identified and given
appropriately. All data regarding the public land are not entered into the computer and all
surveys are not yet updated.
Having said that, we realise that all lands held by government shall be for public good since
the people /public are the real owners in democratic governance. All public lands are
government lands, but all government lands are not public lands, accessible and available for
public use. As per Section 2 (I) and (2 ) of the AP land Encroachment Act 1995, public roads,
streets, lanes and paths,(punthas, kalidaari), Bandibaata(cart track), Dandu baata (way for
marchers of army), bridges, ditches, dykes and fences on or beside the same, the bed of the
sea, harbors and creeks below high water mark, the mangroves (Mada forests) and of the
rivers, streams, nalaas, lakes and tanks and all canals and water courses and all standing and
flowing water and all lands situated are the property of the government including railway
lands and land in port limits. Even all public roads and streets vested in local authority are
deemed to be the property of the government.
Lands Accrued to Government through certain legislations
The Bhudan lands, lands taken over by the Government under Inam Abolition Act, Estate
Abolition Act, Ceiling surplus lands surrendered to Government under APLR(COAH) Act
and lands fallen into the fold of Government on account of abolition of zamindars, jagirdars
and other intermediaries are all considered as Public lands. These lands available with the
government were assigned to landless poor agricultural labourers and small and marginal
farmers under different provisions of the Board Standing Orders (BSO), in the form of
heritable pattas.
The assignment policy in Andhra area is governed by BSO 15 and the orders issued in
G.O.Ms. 1407, Revenue Department, dated 25.07.1958 and the orders issued thereon
subsequently, from time to time. Similarly, the assignment policy in Telangana area is
governed by AP (Telangana Area) land Revenue Act 1317 Fasli and orders issued in G.O.Ms.
1406, Revenue Department, dated 25.07.1958.The lands thus assigned are prohibited from
transfer, gift, lease, mortgage or any other alienation to private persons and bodies, in terms
of the AP Assigned Lands (Prohibition of Transfers Act), 1977.



96 | P a g e
Some justifiable concessions were given to ex-servicemen and freedom fighters for sale of
these lands after a period of 10 years from the date of assignment/allotment. The ceiling
surplus lands are being allotted to eligible landless poor as per the proportion prescribed for
SC, ST, BC and minorities on the condition of payment of market value in equal instalments
for a period of 15 years. These lands can be sold after the allottee pays the full market value,
not in lumpsum but in equal instalments as fixed at the time of allotment.


The state has even converted certain unobjectionable government ‘poramboke’ lands into
assessed waste lands and assigned to eligible sivoi jamaidars (landless poor persons who have
been cultivating these lands for over a good deal of time uninterruptedly), duly entitling them
to the piece of land they cultivate. Depending on the need and demand of the eligible sivoi
jamaidars, cultivating unobjectionable ‘Unassessed’ waste lands are also being converted into
‘Assessed waste’ lands and assigned to those who are cultivating, enabling them to access
loans, subsidies and other help extended by the Government. They are given Pattadar
passbooks and title deeds along with Tippons and the Field Measurement Sheets, duly
marking them as ‘Assigned and not transferable’, as an instrument useful for borrowing
loans from government financial institutions. All the above interventions taken by the
Government are in conformity with the directive principles of the state policy enshrined in
the constitution, to ensure respectable living to the landless poor citizens of socially,
educationally and economically weaker sections in villages/rural areas with dignity, enjoying
equal status on par with other social groups in the same village.


Earnest effort to reform and reframe land administration

Land continues to be very vital and critical to any type of advancement of the society i.e.,
social, educational and culturally enhancing the status, standard and quality of life. Around
70% population of our country eking out livelihood on land are knocking at the door of
government, be they legislative, executive, administrative machinery or judicial interpreters
of the constitutional validity of the statutes.
An earnest effort has been made by the AP state when it constituted a land committee called
Koneru Ranga Rao Committee on land administration and Reforms(2004) vide (1)GOMS
977 dt 01-12-2004. (2)GOMS 1091 dt 23-12-2004.
Purpose:-

        (a) To assess overall implementation of land distribution programs.
97 | P a g e
          (b) To suggest measures for effective implementation.
          (c) To suggest required changes and amendments to the Acts/Rules for improved
               enforcement of land related legislations.
          (d) To suggest measures for removal of obstacles in implementation.

Response:-Overwhelming response noticed by the committee during its public hearings,
study tours, field visits from political parties and civil society organizations cutting across
party lines, and Social groups, since land is an emotive issue for all sections of society in both
rural and urban areas.
Equitable distribution of land:-
Efforts of the state for equitable/Justifiable distribution of land by way of several Acts, did
not yield the desired results. Title control of the poor is still elusive in spite of the legislations
like,

        a. A.P.PLR (COAH) Act.
        b. The AP (Andhra Area) Tenancy Act.
        c. The AP Assigned lands (prohibition of transfers)Act.
        d. Inam Abolition Acts converting Inams shrotriyams etc into ryotwari lands
        e. AP Land grabbing prohibition Act.
        f. AP Land encroachment Act
        g. AP Rights in land and pattadar passbooks Act
        h. The AP occupants of Homesteads (conferment of ownership) ACT etc.

    4.4.2 Dimension wise analysis and scoring
Public land differentiates itself and keeps itself away from private land.
A road, rastha, donka, pathway, an irrigation channel, a river, a stream, a tank, a kunta, a
well, all and sundry, being used frequently, generally or always by the general public and the
restriction of which usage, vests with the state, Larger areas/tracks of land like hills, forests,
sea etc fall in the same category. In general, all government land to which the general public
have free access, could be taken as public land for the purposes of the present analysis.
The preparation of inventory of Government (public) land, which is an important
recommendation of the Koneru Ranga Rao Committee (KRCC) is yet to be completed in the
state.
Issues Identified



98 | P a g e
Original survey of land was conducted in the first quarter of the 19th century in the composite
Madras State under ‘Paimash system’. In this system, only holdings were numbered, named
and their measurements were taken from north to south and east to west. Areas and
boundaries were generally taken at that time with a 24 feet chain and the areas were worked
out by ‘Khasra method’ multiplying the means of lengths by the means of breaths. But no
serious attempt was made for mapping i.e. the details on ground.
However, land was re surveyed by adopting the following modern survey methods:

    -   Khasra method, 1858-1865
    -   Simple triangle method, 1866-1877
    -   Triangles coupled with Off sets, 1878-1886
    -   Plain table system, 1887-1891
    -   Block map system, 1892-1896
    -   Ponganur system, 1918-1920
    -   Diagnol and offset system is in vogue at present.

Location, demarcation, measurement, mapping and computation of areas of the holdings
should be done afresh for correct and accurate preparation of fresh Field Measurement Book
(FMB) and land registers. Only clear cut field survey of private land helps in moving forward
specifically paving the way for identification of boundaries of Government land/Public land.
This is very much required in the present scenario since many changes have taken effect on
account of modernization, development and welfare in the light of creating infrastructure
facilities.
The land has undergone several physical changes even on account of natural calamities,
besides the calamitous proportion of human development caused by industrial growth
inimical to environmental conservation. The framework of survey in field has since broken
down as the boundaries shown in the village map and the FMB do not tally with the actual
state of things on ground. Large number of survey marks are found missing in the field and
the maintenance of survey stones work has been forgotten as a systematic and continuous
work which is part and parcel of land administration.


Interventions required
The Government have to constitute survey teams and entrust the work of identification,
demarcation and boundaries with measurements afresh, drawing teams from revenue, forest,


99 | P a g e
mines and geology and other relevant departments for preparation of actual mapping of the
land with measured identifications. The Directorate of Town and Country Planning shall have
its own task force of town surveyors, draughtsmen without depending on the Revenue
Department for deputationists. This exercise will help in preparing inventories of
Government Land and also lands held by patta by private individuals, paving the way for
effective land management. Detailed town surveys of municipalities and survey streets in
gram panchayats have to be taken up for systematic development of streets, drains, sewage,
telecommunication and optic fibre networks.
Field verification of the Government land inventories has to be taken up particularly in view
of boundary disputes between Forest Department and Revenue Department, between Forest
authorities and Tribal people more so, in the light of Forest Rights Act. Clear data with
specific boundaries and measurements on all sides of the Forest/Revenue Land has to be
obtained before placing the same on website for public access.


Management Responsibility
Government land belongs to different departments viz. forest, irrigation, agriculture,
industries, panchayati raj, education, medical and health, APTRANSO and APGENCO and
the like. Therefore the responsibility of protection and maintenance may be shared by all the
departments. The custodian of the above lands in the village where the lands are situated is
field functionary of the Revenue Department called the Village Revenue Officer (VRO),
assisted by Village Revenue Assistant (VRA). They maintain survey number wise details in
Government lands register and often the data is found to be incorrect and incongruous, since,
they have no wherewithal and technical knowledge to measure and record duly planting the
survey marks on ground. With the result, encroachments have become the order of the day.
The Koneru Ranga Rao Committee found the preparation of inventory of Government lands
very essential, both, for the purpose of recording and maintenance at the village level. Hence,
the committee has suggested that inventory of all Government lands be prepared in all the
villages, taking up detailed field verification by forming teams with Revenue officers and
local community.


Since, Government land is being allotted to different departments for development of
infrastructure facilities as part of implementation of Government schemes of the respective
departments viz. forest, irrigation, agriculture, industries, panchayati raj, education, medical
and health, APTRANSO and APGENCO and the like, the Additional Joint Collectors
100 | P a g e
working in the Districts being senior Revenue functionaries may be made Nodal officers,
duly vesting in them the necessary administrative powers in this regard, to protect and
monitor usage of lands allotted to different departments. Inter departmental coordination is
very much required between the Revenue Department (primary custodian of Public land), and
other departments like Forest, Police, Panchayati Raj, Industries, Energy, IT&
Communications, Tourism, Social Welfare, Education, Medical & Health, etc., since, all
developmental projects and welfare schemes take place on land only. Land forms very
essential basis for construction of Administrative complexes, schools, playgrounds,
auditoriums, stadiums, hospitals, industries, waterworks, roads, railways, communications
network and other infrastructural facilities, for development and progress.


LGI-11-:Justification and time efficiency of the acquisition processes
The state acquires land duly invoking the powers of the ‘eminent domain’ for public interest
and after taking the help of emergency provisions U/S 17 of the LA Act, 1894 dispensing
with enquiry stipulated U/S 5A of the same Act. The powers under public domain of the State
have often been misused, catering to the selfish aggrandizement of the private sector. One
classic example of this type of cavalier attitude is evidently seen by social activists, media,
civil society organizations, when acquisition of private land and alienation of
Government/Public land was sought for Special Economic Zones (SEZ) all over the state and
for Thermal power plants in some parts of the state. The way in which the state has exercised
its powers to the exclusive advantage of private corporates to the detriment of public is amply
demonstrated in the allotment of lands to Vodarevu and Nizam Patnam Industrial Corridor
(VANPIC) in Prakasam & Guntur districts. The case is now under Central Bureau of
Investigation (CBI) enquiry. Huge areas of very fertile private lands (with ‘two crops grown
a year’) acquired for ‘public purpose’ through the medium of the Andhra Pradesh Industrial
Infrastructure Corporation (APIIC) were given out for a pittance to private interest groups
against norms, violating rules and stipulations.


The social welfare part of land acquisition has been forgotten except making a passing
reference in section 2(i) (d), (e) and (f). These clauses of section 2 of the application part of
the new Act speaks of housing for certain income groups, planned development or
improvement of existing village sites or any site in urban areas for residential purpose for the
weaker sections in rural and urban areas and also for residential purposes to the poor landless
or to persons residing in areas affected by natural calamities or to PAFs and PDFs of any
101 | P a g e
scheme undertaken by the Government. No specific provision is made for allotment of house
sites to houseless people in rural areas by exercising the powers of ‘eminent domain’, without
which, acquisition of land for house sites to weaker section may not be possible in the light of
the ‘consent (of farmers i.e.75%/80%) concept’ floated for Public Private Partnership projects
and private companies in the new Act. The government has since formulated a Land
Allotment Policy, 2012 vide G.O.Ms. No. 571 Revenue (Assignment I) Department, dated
14.09.2012, to check the adequacy/ inadequacy of land for the requisitioning agency i.e.
Government departments, industrial establishments etc. The government is also relooking at
the allotment made irregularly.


Interventions required
This work of re-verification of land allotment should be expedited and information on cases
of violations should be placed on public website. The guilty have to be sufficiently punished
which will have a salutary effect on other unscrupulous elements in land administration.
The land allotment policy 2012 may include the following:
Instead of keeping land bank in the village for unspecified future needs for a long period of
time, it would be in the fitness of things if those lands are allotted as house sites, examining
case by case on merit to the needy eligible people in the village, municipal town and mandal
headquarters. The Housing Department may take up construction of houses for them under
existing low cost housing schemes. This may stop overcrowding in urban peripheral areas
and help retain a respectable identity in the village for the poor farm labourer on agricultural
activities in villages, duly training them with modern skills of farm technology. This will also
help avoid criticism of dearth of agricultural labourers in the required cultivation season in
rural areas. At Annexure V of the said policy, pertaining to the Department of Social Welfare,
land may be considered for allotment for Backward Communities on the pattern of Ambedkar
Bhavan to Scheduled castes and the same may be named as ‘Phule/Savithribai Bhavan’.
Similarly, allotment of lands to Urdu Ghar and Shaadi Khanas may be considered.
Allotment of land to Aanganwadi centres and livestock sub centres may be considered under
aegis of Women and Child Development and Animal Husbandry Departments respectively.
The land allotment policy suffers from the technical infirmity of assessing land requirement
to different departments, having an eye on future expansions. This exercise has to be taken up
judiciously involving all stakeholders.


Pre-emptive action by private parties owing to threat of land acquisition
102 | P a g e
Pre-emptive action by private parties owing to threat of land acquisition is as old as LA Act
itself. This is basically thought of by land losers for several reasons. To cite a few:

    -   Apprehension of low compensation
    -   Anticipating higher value for their land subsequent to acquisition for projects like
        Irrigation, Infrastructure facilities Roads, Bridges, Cold storages, Hospitals,
        Universities, Colleges etc, the land owners tendentiouslly inclined to stall the LA
        process. Land losers being from weaker sections, having small pieces of agricultural
        land fear losing their source of food. Fear of losing fertile agricultural land capable of
        growing commercial crops.Land suitable for pisci culture, prawn culture, real estate
        and the like, fetching high amounts every season.

Emotional attachment to land, which confers on the land owner, a degree of credibility and
creditability, and the property having mortgage value, is only his ‘own’ land. Coercion is
substituted by empathy when we look at the resettlement and rehabilitation part of the new
LA Act. The Act provides for resettlement of project affected families and project displaced
families, public hearings, participation of local community in selection of Resettlement
centers with all facilities and even better avenues to improve their standard of living etc.


Interventions required
Joint Inspection of lands by the Requisitioning Department and the LAO for the purpose of
peg marking and identification before preparing land plans for placing requisition before the
LAO will solve a host of problems like ownership, tenure, measurements, areas, land value,
structures on the land and their value, crops and likely damages to the crops etc., This also
saves the invaluable time in view of urgency and for expeditious creation of infrastructure
facilities.


Publication in two newspapers may be dispended with as individual notices and prior consent
are now made essential pre-condition for acquisition of the provisions of new Act.Separate
Bench may be created in High court exclusively for LA Cases to expedite matters. The work
pertaining to market value fixation, valuation of trees, estimation of houses/buildings may be
delegated to respective departments of Registration, Engineering Agriculture and Horticulture
with LAO as final authority who passes the Award. This would avoid concentration of power
in one agency and valuation by technically competent department officials independently,


103 | P a g e
would be just and will stand the test of legal competence in the court of law, if referred for
adjudication for higher compensation.


Private genuine sales may also be taken as basis while fixing market value without insisting
upon registration, provided the private sales reasonably reflect local market value. Rationale
and reality may give way to the conventional statistics of three years before the DN Date or
value of similar CST lands      in the vicinity etc. Decretal Charges may be paid by the
requisitioning department which got the land acquired by the state for its use.


LG1-12-Dimension:- Transparency and fairness in payment of compensation.
Transparency and Fairness
As regards transparency and fairness of acquisition it must be said that both are lacking in
practice. The due procedures in LA, such as, issue of notices, land survey, publishing of
intent of LA in local newspapers in vernacular languages etc. appear to be followed
perfunctorily. Land plans, particularly in Irrigation projects, have often been changed to the
benefit of powerful, big and rich farmers from ruling class and caste. Fairness in working out
market value is often the casuality more so, when trees structures and other permanent things
are attached to the land covered by acquisition.
Compensation
The payment of compensation to farmers is by cheques given in the Gramasabha in the
presence of village elders. The process is not that transparent and fair in cases where title of
ownership requires to be decided. There are different set of problems when acquisition covers
Government land under encroachment by cultivation, and by residential structures. In cases
of alienated Assigned lands, difficulties arise when both transferor and transferee are land
less poor (LLPs) from SC/ST categories.            Payment of compensation to Endowment
department and the LLPs who have been cultivating the lands with proven adverse possession
for generations together pose a unique problem, since the enjoyers are not recognized by the
Endowment department as lessees.
Several GOs’ and executive instructions have been issued in this regard. They need to be
relooked at and a codified compendium of instructions be issued standardizing procedures for
guidance of the Land Acquisition Officers working in different projects in different parts of
the state.
Land use Change


104 | P a g e
Land use change is not compensated for in terms of money; but, the PAFs and PDFs who lose
their livelihood on account of shifting of the village are to be supported financially through
bank loans to establish their petty trade and business in the new colony where they get settled
under the R&R package.
Further, better living conditions that those are available in their original place of living are
envisaged in the form of infrastructural facilities, civic amenities like electricity, roads,
schools, protected drinking water, sanitation and drainage, basic medical and health care
facilities etc., in Rehabilitation and Resettlement policy viz., R & R project. However, this
needs to be put in its place to the best satisfaction of displaced families to compensate the
selective loss of their rights and also to neutralize the effects of emotional bondage to the
“My Hills and My Home” psyche of the land losers and dwellers, as any amount of financial
compensation in lieu of loss of ‘working days’ who have lost their livelihood, cannot bring
back the natural credibility and creditability, which they used to have in their original place of
living.


Appeal Avenues: Independent avenues are available for Appeals against the acquisition in
judicial courts only. An effective and efficient mechanism needs to be created at District level
also by vesting powers in District level courts to take up cases at DN stage on merit basis, to
hear and dispose off the cases expeditiously. The traditional conservative time limit placed
for several phases of land acquisition has since been revised and that has come down to 40/45
days to complete the entire process of acquisition from DN stage under section 4(1) to Award
stage.


Timely decisions: Timely decisions regarding complaints about acquisition are not taken in
time. Complaints involving accusations against the ways and means adopted with
discrimination between persons, as to the scale of compensation for land (dry/irrigated
dry/wet and location), residential houses, crop loss, apportionment of compensation package
etc. are usually time consuming exercises in project submersion villages. The Land
Acquisition Officer (LAO) himself takes a look into these petitions and relevant records duly
securing the presence of different Departmental officials for discussion and finalization of
valuation of structures, horticultural crops etc. This can best be taken care of, if some specific
days are exclusively set apart for settling these complaints on the model of ‘Adalats’, of
courts duly adhering to norms and rules for quick settlement of claims and counter claims for
proper/higher compensation.
105 | P a g e
The present scenario of acquisition in the new LA Act, 2013 may hopefully better the
situation in land acquisition for farmers as well as for LAOs, since it is based on consent,
consensus and fairness giving little scope for fraudulent means.
The social welfare part of land acquisition for provision of house sites to weaker sections, for
providing burial grounds, passage to reach burial grounds to SCs and STs, construction of
community halls etc. requires to be re-looked at and streamlined.


Reforming the land holding under the APLR (COAH) Act, 1971

Prior to independence, the land, urban or agricultural, was under the control of a few
individuals. The system of intermediaries like the Zamindars, Jagirdars, Mahalwars etc.
facilitated the concentration of land holdings in the hands of a few. In A.P., although a
beginning was made in the early part of the 20th century to abolish the intermediaries and to
provide a secure tenure in lands to the tenants, it did not gain momentum subsequently.


The State introduced a number of land reform measures since 1950. The laws relating to the
ceiling on land holdings constitute an important step in the state’s efforts to bridge the gap
between the haves and the have-not, in terms of land holdings. The A.P. land Reforms
(Ceiling on Agricultural Holding) Act, 1971 contemplates a ‘family unit’ for purposes of
possessing a standard holding. Such a family unit consists of the wife, husband, their minor
sons and unmarried daughters. It includes a separated minor son. No distinction has been
made between a divided and undivided minor son. A standard holding varies depending on
the nature of land i.e either wet or dry. Wet land is further divided into double crop wet land
and wet land other than double crop wet land.


The standard holding in the case of double crop wet land varies from 10 to 18 acres and in the
case of wet land, from 15 to 27 acres. The standard holding in the case of dry land varies
from 35 to 54 acres. The multifaceted land use has brought in metamorphic change paving
the way for the reform of land administration and reframing the ceiling laws. It is time to
think of proposing reasonably justifiable distribution of land benefits to people, who eke out
their livelihood on land. It is in this background National Land Reform Policy has been
brought out for discussion.




106 | P a g e
Traditional categorization of land on the basis of Class Soil Taram(CST) / Bhaganamay be
substituted with modern land use concept as the land is put to different uses now, other than
agriculture. Major sons and daughters not married may be considered as inclusive members
of the family unlike in the APLR (COAH) Act of 1971.
Taken over land under APLR(COAH) Act 1971:-

These lands are public lands since government has taken possession of these lands from
surplus land holders under the ceiling Act.Land capable of yielding reasonably good returns
either by way of crops, minerals, housing, infrastructure creation, be considered fit for taking
possession by Government under Land Reforms Act for public management, instead of just
accepting whatever the land made available by the declarant for handing over just for the
purpose of statutory compliance of the APLR (COAH) Act.


Land should be allotted on reasonable market value only but not freely. Ratio of allotment be
considered having regard to demographic profile of the particular village, where land is taken
possession. Allotment of land shall be made after approval in the Gramsabha where the land
and the allottees are available. In case eligible beneficiaries are not available, Government
should keep such land in Land bank for public use of the village, where the land is located.No
exemptions be allowed in the guise of gifts, leases and ‘Sthree dhanam’ etc., while working
out the surplus land held by the declarant.


No exceptional concessions be given to MNCs, Corporate, Companies, Industries who
purchase these lands, except with the written explicit approval of the Government with penal
provisions to punish the unscrupulous seller and purchaser, besides initiating punitive action
against the erring officials. This following explains the situation in AP with reference to the
indicator and dimensions and based on the same, discussed the grading of the dimensions.


LGI: 4.1        Identification of public land and clear management: public land ownership
is clearly defined, effectively serves the public purpose, is inventoried, under clear
management responsibilities, and relevant information is publicly accessible.


LGI 4.1.1 Criteria for public land ownership are clearly defined & assigned to the right
level of government - SCORE: B



107 | P a g e
Analysis: While different categories of public land vest with various Govt Departments and
agencies and the management is vested at different levels, transfer and alienation is done by
Govt through instruments such as sale, lease, assignment etc.       However when transfers are
made, questions relating to transparency are often raised in Courts.
Score: ‘B’ i.e. “Public land ownership is justified by provision of public goods at the most
appropriate level of government but management may be discretionary”.


LGI 4.1.2. There is a complete recording of public land. SCORE: A

Analysis: All land records as well as village maps show public lands. More than 90% of
public land is clearly identified on the ground and on maps.


LGI 4.1.3 Information on public land is publicly accessible. SCORE: A

Analysis: Land records do contain information relating to public lands. Land Banks have
been ordered to be created for inventory of public and Govt land. Regulations provide for
non-transfer of certain categories of public land such as burial grounds, kuntas, or village
roads etc. Pursuant to the recommendations of the Koneru Ranga Rao Land Committee, the
government land inventory has been made public on the websites by 7 District Collectors so
far. Registration Department & Revenue Department has inventory of all such lands the
transfer of which is prohibited. All the information in the public land inventory is accessible
to the public.


LGI 4.1.4: The management responsibility for different types of public land is
unambiguously assigned. Score: B
The management responsibility for different types of public land is unambiguously assigned
but this is not always consistent with objectives of equity and efficiency or institutions are not
always properly equipped so that sometimes these are not achieved.


LGI 4.1.5 Responsible public institutions have sufficient resources for their land
management responsibilities. SCORE: C

Analysis: The evolution of effective land management system is yet to take place out of the
present day land revenue system. The Revenue Department has suffered due to inadequate
staff, use of revenue machinery for non-revenue tasks, multiplicity of agencies connected

108 | P a g e
with land, inadequate coordination, paucity of financial resources, non-induction of new
technology in surveys, settlement, updation of maps and lack of management of public land.
Score: C. There are some constraints in the financial and/or human resource capacity but the
system makes most effective use of available resources in managing public lands adequately.


LGI 4.1.6 All essential information on public land allocations to private interests is
publicly accessible. SCORE: C

Analysis: Public lands are under the domain of various Departments and agencies and there is
no single database available so far to access all essential information on public land allocation
to private interests. In recent years due to large scale allocations of public land to private
interests and consequent public outcry, matters of accessibility of information have assumed
importance. CAG, upon examining land allotments between 2006 and 2011, notes:
“State Government did not have the primary data, which is essential for effective land
administration. In the absence of a comprehensive database with regard to land, indicating
the location and utilisation of clear Government land, assigned land and resumed land, in
some cases assigned lands were allotted for other purposes”. Key information for public land
allocations (the locality and area of the land allocations, the parties involved and the financial
terms of the allocation) is recorded or partially recorded but is not publicly accessible.


LGI 4.2.1 There is minimal transfer of public land to private interests. SCORE: D

Analysis: Due to needs of infrastructure development such as airports, ports, roads and
railways, industrial hubs etc, large tracts of Govt / Public land have been alienated for private
purposes. More than 50% of land expropriated in the past 3 years is used for private purposes.


LGI 4.2.2 Acuired Land is Transferred to Destined Use in a Timely Manner. SCORE:
C

Analysis: Due to increased public scrutiny and interventions of Courts, there is now greater
accountability on the part of private parties to utilize transferred lands for destined use.
Score: C - Between 30% and 50% of the land that has been expropriated in the past 3 years
has been transferred to its destined use.




109 | P a g e
LGI 4.2.3 The threat of land acquisition does not lead to pre-emptive action by private
parities. SCORE: B

Analysis: It does in some cases where
   (a) small land is sold / purchased in anticipation of getting higher valuation on
       acquisition
   (b) Agricultural Land surrounding projects is purchased, converted for habitation /
       commercial and sold at a high price
   (c) Erecting structures, planting of orchards, digging borewells, to appreciate the value of
       land
   (d) Preemptive action by land-losers is done to change alignments of roads, canals where
       their lands are likely to be affected.
   (e) They may also go to courts to stall the acquisition process.
These are some of the pre-emptive actions to get enhanced compensation.


LGI 4.3.1 Compensation is provided for expropriation of all rights regardless of their
registration status. SCORE: C

Analysis: Compensation is paid according to the provisions of the law, and specific
dispensations which the Government may provide for. There is a huge body of judicial
decisions regarding the rights of different people who need to be compensated. Compensation,
in kind or in cash, is paid for some unregistered rights (such as possession, occupation etc.),
however those with other unregistered rights (which may include grazing, access, gathering
forest products etc.) are usually not paid.


LGI 4.3.3 Expropriated owners are compensated promptly. SCORE: D

Analysis: Compensation payments can be delayed as a result of reference of cases to Courts
where there is dispute regarding entitlement to receive compensation or where valuation is
disputed. Less than 50% of expropriated land owners receive compensation within one year.


LGI 4.3.4 - There are independent and accessible avenues for appeal against
expropriation SCORE: B

Analysis: Courts are the only forum available for affected persons to question expropriation.
Accessibility of Courts is costly and time consuming. Independent avenues to lodge a

110 | P a g e
complaint against expropriation exist but there are access restrictions (i.e. only accessible by
mid-income and wealthy).


LGI 4.3.5 Timely decisions are made regarding complaints about
expropriation.SCORE: D

Analysis: While the Supreme Court has issued directions regarding disposal of cases within 3
years, however looking at the large pendency of cases in Courts, final resolution could well
be a decade or two. A first instance decision has been reached for less than 30% of the
complaints about expropriation lodged during the last 3 years.

   4.4.3 Policy recommendations
   Panel                      Short Term                           Medium term
    No
    4.1         There must be periodic updation of inventory of all public lands (urban
                and rural)
    4.2         Public lands must be protected from
                encroachments, and from being
                alienated / transferred to other uses.
    4.3         Rights of users (collective and group)
                should be recorded in the land records
    4.4         The inventory of public lands district-
                wise and village-wise should be in the
                public domain and it should be made
                available to the public on payment of a
                nominal fee. A portal should be created
                for this purpose.
    4.5         In urban areas where values of land are
                very high and these lands are susceptible
                to encroachments etc, special cells and
                enforcement machinery needs to be
                provided.


   4.5     Transfer of large tracts of public land for private purposes

   4.5.1 Panel specific context
The roots of eminent domain are based in America which essentially was derived from the
Latin word terra nullius (nobody’s land, which essentially means that a land which is not
burdened by any validly acquired ownership belongs to no one and hence the state is the
logical owner of that land) and in Australia. Ironically Australia’s judiciary has struck down
this principle (Brennan 1995: 16) but India’s policies are still being influenced by the
American principle. The Second Administrative Reforms Commission’s Seventh Report
111 | P a g e
titled “Capacity building for conflict resolution” in chapter 4 on Land Related Issues
mentions the fact that “…possession and ownership of land is sine qua non of social
respectability”.


During colonial times the ‘eminent domain’ principle was used to acquire vast tracts of forest
land. Ironically this aspect has continuation in post independent India as well. There was a
major shift in the application of the land acquisition law in 1984, when the application of
public purpose was extended to further the interests of profit making private companies.31


Although Right to property in India is no more a fundamental right, rather a legal right but
there are other provisions in the constitution especially Article 21 which entails the Right to
have a dignified life which would require the state to take into consideration the equity issues
while taking any decision. Contextualizing it to the issue of land, it means that the transfer of
property from public to private is clear, transparent and operationalized in a competitive way.
It was implicit that the purpose for which land is transferred should have welfare of the
society and their development in mind.32


Figures regarding the development related displacement as a result of land transfers show
that about 60 million people have been displaced since independence (Fernandes, in CSD
2008: 90-93) due to various developmental initiatives of the government. This gains more
significance since India being an agrarian economy majority of the population is dependent
on land for their livelihoods and existence. 33 The 29th report of the Commissioner of
Scheduled Caste and Tribes (Kothari, 1996: 1477) mentions that although ST’s constitute
only 7.5% of the total population of India but their proportion amongst people who have been
impacted due to this involuntary displacement stands at 40%. The impact of this involuntary
displacement is mentioned by Cernia (2000: 3659-78) is that these people fall in ‘major
impoverishment risks’ which entails landlessness, food insecurity, poverty, homelessness,
loss of CPR’s, this stands more so for vulnerable groups.


The issues related to transfer of public land to private use manifested prominently after the
Special Economic Zone Act 2005 was enacted. This essentially resulted in transfer of huge

chunks of public land for private purpose. With respect to AP what become more pertinent is
that the presence of tribal population and their attachment to the land is not just for economic
reasons rather it is deeper and has cultural significance and it’s a way of life for them.
However there have been limitations with respect to the data on transfer of land but there was
an attempt made to figure out the magnitude of land that was being diverted in urban
periphery of Hyderabad and it stands at 90,000 ha (Reddy, 2006)


There have been issues raised in AP due to Pollavaram dam on Godavari river that would
submerge around 270 villages which primarily fall in the scheduled area of Khammam
district, East and West Godavari district, further there have been discontent due to bauxite
mining project in the tribal area of Vishakhapatnam District. 34 There have been mass
agitationswitnessed particularly at Mudigonda in Khammam district. 35 The demands in
this case were as simple as seeking hundred square yard of land for homeless which was not
provided at the cost of SEZ’s. Perhaps majority of land is being diverted due to the pressure
of urbanization (Sharma 2003).


AP has nine districts which are having classified under the constitution as scheduled area.
Some of the most stringent laws that are prevalent here relate to not just curbing the purchase
of land by non-tribal’s from tribal’s rather even non-tribal’s cannot purchase land from non-
tribal’s in these scheduled areas. This explicit recognition for protection of these lands is
essentially focused on preserving the culture and unique identity. The onus of proving that
the land being possessed by non-tribals is not a tribal land lies on the former. However what
is often witnessed that out of 72,000 cases related to land transfer regulations (LTR) till
September 2005 approximately 33,000 were declared in favor of non-tribals. This
essentially shows the plight of vulnerable sections and how there is a gap between law in
book and law in action/implementation.


Ironically in the current rights based approach followed in India there is no explicit
recognition of the Right to Shelter despite being one of the most fundamental rights for
enhancing the wellbeing and prosperity of individuals. Perhaps even the dispute resolution

wing of the state that is the judiciary has not actively advocated for the rights of homeless. In
the infamous case of Almitra Patel vs. Union of India (2000) the Supreme Court ordered
that the provision of alternative sites for hutment dwellers results in rewarding a pick pocket.
This despite the fact that in the current era of judicial activism there are high hopes amongst
the common man from the judicial wing of the state.


Confusion with respect to transfer of land also looms over the description of wasteland and
determining the facts behind it. Chitimitichinis a hamlet which has around 200 houses and is
inhabited by Sugalis which are recognized as STs in AP. They are known aslambadas in
Telengana and banjaras in central India. Around 450 acres of land which was being
cultivated by Sugalis is now been given to Brahmani Steel.36
Ensuring that there is fair transfer of property from public to private players is the fulcrum of
grievance redressal regarding land issues. The premise of welfare state builds on the faith that
citizens have over the state and its operations that needs to be endured. The state needs to
institutionalize the mechanisms which ensure that the transfers are clear, transparent and
competitive. The institutions and policy created should have people’s concern as the basic
premise during formation and operating in long run. This is necessary for sustainable
development.


Present status
The state government has created a body by the name of AP Industrial Infrastructure
Corporation Limited (APIIC) with the aim of rapid development of physical and social
infrastructure to attract private sector participation. 37 APIIC is entrusted with the task of
handling entire funds related to acquisition and R & R activities with respect to industrial
parks or SEZ’s. Government lands is classified into two below mentioned categories -

     1. Two categories of government lands
                      Government land which is unassigned or waste land
                      Assigned Government land (to landless ensuring non-transferable rights)
     2. There is no further categories viz. Gochar, Gramya Jungle etc.

The Land Acquisition process followed in AP is shown in the table below –
       APIIC
       (files requisition for alienation of unassigned and assigned Government land with)
       Collector
       Sends proposals (along with market value of the land) to

       May Revise the market values
       EC recommends to
       Government
       Through and alienation Government Order it grants the land to APIIC


In the process APIIC becomes the free holder of the land. The Socio-Economic Survey and
R&R activities are the responsibilities of government for which funding is being provided by
APIIC.To determine the price and compensation there is a district committee which consists
of all the stakeholders. The base price for determining the final price is essentially registered
land price of the locality considering the critical period which is essentially 3 years duration
prior to the date. Further what are involved in this analysis are the inputs being provided by
stakeholders to arrive at a final price which is determined by the DC. Further the government
encourages “consent award” in which there is a consensus between prices offered by the
government and land owners.38


However there have been cases of irregularities flagged in media relating the transfer of lands
by APIIC. It is quite evident in a lot many sectors that there is a gap between law in book and
law in action same is the case with policies which are being framed on land related issues.
One such project of irregularity in transfer was APIIC-Emaar land case. 39 There were
reports of CAG which indicated that APIIC had allocated approximately 13, 759 ha of public
land for industrial development. But, in the process, APIIC entered into development
agreements that led to furthering the real estate business of private developers using
public land and in the process ignoring the interest of the state.40CAG report for the

financial year ending March 31, 2011 mentioned that the loss to the state in this transfer of
huge chunks of land at low prices was to the tune of Rs. 1784 crore. CAG report mentioned
that during 2006 – 2011 there was transfer of 35,811 ha of land to 1027 beneficiaries and the
process of transfer was ad hoc and arbitrary.


CAG report also flagged that there was thousands of hectares of land which was transferred
keeping political interest in mind. It specifically mentioned that there was transfer of 1261
ha of land for setting up a commercial airport and flying academy. This was in violation of
the Centre’s policy regarding setting up commercial airports. There were no viability studies
done with respect to the project further the fact was not taken into consideration that there is
Kadapa airport which is only 50 Km away.41


There was a thematic audit done on the activities related to APIIC was undertaken covering
the corporate office of APIIC and 8 out of its 16 zonal offices during May-June 2012. This
points out to some of the inadequacies in the process of land acquisition for private players.
There was a case where the acquisition orders by the GoAP was not allocated for 49,046
acres of land however this land was acquired by APIIC in advance. This it seems was worked
out based on tentative market value if land.


Further this thematic audit also revealed that there were irregularities in some of the
allotments like ‘Integrated Vizag Knowledge City’ over 1740 acres of land. This entailed
favor to successful bidder and allottee Unitech Ltd. There were also issues when the land was
allotted to private players below the market price or the acquisition cost. Some examples of
these being East Coast Energy Ltd; MLR Motors Pvt. Ltd.; Krishnapatnam Power
Corporation Ltd.; Kineta Power Pvt. Ltd and Orient Craft Fashion Institute of Technology.
All these combined led to a loss to the tune of Rs. 48.84 crore. The mechanism by which the
deals were struck by APIIC were based on Price Fixation Committee (PFC). But there were
instances where the land was allocated by APIIC below PFC notable amongst these being
J.T.Holdings, Hyderabad Gems Ltd; Aurobindo Pharma Ltd; Hetero Drugs Ltd and Gujarat
NRE Coke Ltd amounting to estimated combined loss of Rs 69.83 crore.

Further analysis of this table also shows that there are differences between the quantum of
land acquired, land allocated and land developed. The overall difference with respect to land
allocated and developed stands at 60 per cent which is quite high.


Present status of the same as per secondary sources of information

Performance audit report “Land Allotment” in AP during 2006-11 submitted by the CAG
India to the Governor under article 151 highlights some of the mechanisms on which land
transfers have been happening in the state.42 The basic intent of this report was to find out
whether the transfer of land was done in a transparent manner and in consistent with the
socio-cultural and environmental interest of the people at large.
The report mentions in Para 4.2 and 4.4 that during the audit period 2006-11 the government
allocated 88492 acres of land to 1027 beneficiaries. The audit was conducted in 11 districts
and what came forward from this was that 459 allotments were made which involved 50,285
acres of land. The audit was conducted for 409 cases and the report mentions that the land
allotments for private purpose didn’t follow a fair, transparent and consistent process.
The allocation of land was done in arbitrary manner and there were irregularities
regarding the prices (LGI 13 (2) for land transfers. The audit report mentions that there
were substantial benefits allocated for private parties. “Audit scrutiny revealed that in the test

checked cases undue benefit of Rs. 1784 crore was given to various entities and persons, due
to the difference in the rates at which land was allotted and the market value as recommended
by the District Collector/ Empowered Committee”.(Para 4.4)


Moreover the report mentions that the state does not have a primary data related to effective
land administration. And in the absence of which what practically happens is that assigned
land is allocated for some other purpose. The state does not have a land use policy which
would prioritize the sector wise the land allocation to further the socio-economic
interest of the state. (Para 3.1)


With respect to the cost of the land alienated also there were 60 cases where the land
alienation price was not realized which amounted to rupees 2,559 crore as on June 2011.

There have been several regulations issued regarding land issues in AP one amongst them is
GO Ms. No. 571 Revenue Department which highlights the existing problems in the land
allocation process. It flags amongst the existence of multiple departments which demand for
requisitioning for land allotment; non-uniformity with respect to fixation of prices of allotted
land; ineffective monitoring mechanism to ensure that the time prescribed and the purpose for

118 | P a g e
which the land was allocated has been used for the same purpose. LGAF 5.2.3 in this regards
mentions that Public institutions transferring land to investors are clearly identified and
regularly audited.


GO Ms. No. 571 Revenue Department the prescribed guidelines explicitly mention the need
for scientific and judicious allotment of land. The guideline says that government land should
be “allocated only for public purpose”. With respect to infrastructure and industry als o the
guidelines say their benefits should largely accrue to the general public.          This is in
consonance with the dimension 5.1.4 which mentions that the public captures benefits arising
from changes in permitted land use.

   4.5.2 Dimension wise analysis and scoring
LGI: 5.1 Transfer of public land to private use follows a clear, transparent, and
competitive process and payments are collected and audited (with the exception of
transfers to improve equity such as land distribution and land for social housing).

5 1 1 Public land transactions are conducted in an open transparent manner. SCORE:B

Analysis:

In AP over the last 3 years there has been reduction in the quantum of transfer of public land
primarily due to Public Interest Litigations in courts and activism by civil society actors.
However, if we consider the past 10-15 years there had been extensive transfers of public
land and the process of such transfers were not by public auction or open tender process.
Nonetheless the only caveat to grade this dimension is that it would not be possible to make a
categorical assessment in terms of proportions.

5 1 2 Payments for public leases are collected SCORE: D

Analysis:

It has been witnessed that often there is no collection of public leases and there is promptness
in their collection often during the time of renewal of leases. There are certain cases viz. the
Bamboo plantation where in the leases were not collected.

However, government order mention that while leasing land the quantum of lease and its
periodicity are mentioned and it has been witnessed that before handing over possession the

119 | P a g e
first instalment is invariably collected. There is clarity on the lease amount stipulated in the
BSO’s and government orders. It is particularly noticed that the collection of leases has been
quite inefficient when the gestation period is long and when private industry is involved.

5 1 3 Public land is transacted at market prices unless guided by equity objectives.
SCORE: B

Analysis:

It was witnessed that while on policy the mandate is to transfer land at market prices but there
are cases where it had been transacted in nominal prices and this stems from government’s
perception of what constitutes public good.

5 1 4 The public captures benefits arising from changes in permitted land use. SCORE: C

Analysis:

However in policy GO. MS. 571 of Revenue Department mentions that the allotment of land
for commercial purpose shall be not just based on market value but also take into
consideration that there is sufficient employment, skill up-gradation to the locals etc. Further
it mentions the need for scientific and judicious allotment of land. The guideline says that
government land should be “allocated only for public purpose”. With respect to infrastructure
and industry also the guidelines say their benefits should largely accrue to the general public.
But in practice it is often witnessed that individuals and investors may get exploitative
benefits and this may be at the cost of public at large.

5 1 5 Policy to improve equity in asset access and use by the poor exists, is implemented
effectively and monitored. SCORE:C

Analysis:

With respect to this it is acknowledged that there is policy in place to ensure that there is
access and use of asset by poor but it is not implemented in spirit. The access element
especially stands true for assets like hospitals, educational institutions etc.

LGI: 5.2 Private investment strategy:

5 .2 .1. Land to be made available to investors is identified transparently and publicly, in
agreement with right holders. SCORE: C

120 | P a g e
Analysis:

In this regard it has been witnessed that due to the activism by civil society there has been
recognition of the need for land transfers being done in a transparent and participatory
manner. In recent times this is particularly observed when large projects affects the rights of
stakeholders, for example there have been cases where there is consultation with fishermen
during building up of port projects, same is the case when power projects or major industrial
investment is made. Moreover recently there has been a policy by government which
mentions the extents of land required for different projects and it also mentions the process of
transfer.

5 2 2 Investments are selected based on economic, socio-cultural and environmental
impacts in an open process SCORE:C

Analysis:
The current paradigm of development requires that any transfers or infrastructure
development should consider environmental impact of the project. However, what the audit
report highlights is that “Government violated the directions of the Supreme Court and its
own orders, in alienating 972.69 acres of water body in Sompetamandal, Srikakulam district
to Nagarjuna Construction Company Infrastructure Holdings Ltd (NCC) (total allotment was
1046.21 acres)” (Para 7.1)


Further the guidelines, G.O. Ms. 571 Revenue Department, explicitly says that
environmentally sensitive and fragile areas like river beds, tank beds, hillocks with
afforestation shall not be alienated or allocated. In the same lines the guidelines mention that
there should not be resumption of land which is allocated to poor for agricultural purpose and
if the resumption is inevitable then apart from the rehabilitation there should be alternate land
allocated to the poor. Moreover, G.O. Ms. No. 86, MA & UD Department Dt. 03.03.06
stipulates that “minimum of 10% of site shall be earmarked for organi zed open space and be
utilized as greenery or soft landscaping etc. and shall be provided over and above the
mandatory open spaces. This space may be in one or more pockets.” Further with respect to
housing colonies also there have been some percentages of houses allocated to SC/ST or
BC’s.




121 | P a g e
The GO. 571 also says that with respect to fixing the cost of land the principles laid down in
BSO-24 should be followed which provides for fixing prices taking into consideration the
purpose of allotment and the nature of organization. It further says that allotment should be
based on market value, ascertained by local enquiry, as recommended by the collector and the
Andhra Pradesh Land Management Authority (APLMA). The officer concerned to determine
the market value within the revenue department Revenue Divisional Officer who determines
market value where total land value up to Rs. 1.00 crore and where it is above Rs. 1.00 crore
District Collector is the competent authority.


The G.O. also mentions the constitution of A.P. Land Management Authority (APLMA)
which shall be concerned with recommending land allotment, monitoring whether land is
utilized for the intended purpose and resumption of land if there are any violations. The
chairman of APLMA would be Chief Commissioner of Land Administration and would
scrutinize all the proposals sent by various departments and approve them.43 The authority
would also undertake assessment of environmental hazards.


5.2.2 This dimension takes into consideration that the investments should take into
consideration both the national and local benefits in this regard. This deal with investments
that need to consider both national and local benefits in this regard the APIIC Industrial Parks
Allotment Regulations 2012 says that while planning an industrial park which entails area to
the size of 250 acres 50% of the gross area should be earmarked for micro, medium and small
enterprises only. It also mandates that there should be 33% rebate with respect to land cost
on the condition that it should not exceed Rs. 10 lakhs for SC’s and ST’s.


In consonance with LGAF 5.2.2 the reservation of plots in the Layout for SC’s and ST’s is
mentioned in the GO Ms. 102 Indl. Parks/SEZ’s to Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes
entrepreneurs on lease basis. It mandates that 16.2% of plots to SC entrepreneurs and 6% to
ST entrepreneurs in the layout to the industrial parks. It further says that the allotment of
land should be on the basis of lease period of 10 years.44

With respect to allotment for SEZ’s the GO mandates a reservation of 16.2% plots t o the SC
entrepreneurs and 6% plots to ST entrepreneurs for a period of three years and lease should
be the only mode of allotment of land.
However, the policy is in place the implementation has been fairly weak.

5 2 3 Public institutions transferring land to investors are clearly identified and regularly
audited SCORE: A

Analysis:

There are public institutions responsible clearly identified for transferring land to investors.
With regard to auditing of such institutions GO. 571 Revenue Department also mentions
about a Land Audit Committee under the Collector in every district which would be
responsible for reviewing various allotments and examining the need for relocation to ensure
that prime land is put to optimum use in the best interest of the government. Moreover there
are provisions in the GO which mandate that there should be adherence to the purpose for
which land is allotted and what activity takes place on that.


5 2 4 Public bodies transferring land to investors share information and coordinate to
minimize and resolve overlaps (including sub-soil). SCORE: A

Analysis:
There has been proper mapping of public bodies which transfer land to investors and they
share the information related to transfers.


5 2 5 Compliance with contractual obligations is regularly monitored and remedial action
taken if needed. SCORE: C

Analysis:
Monitoring and consequent remedial action with respect to compliance with contractual
obligation is weak in the state.


5 2 6 Safeguards effectively reduce the risk of negative effects from large scale land-related
investments. SCORE: C

Analysis:


123 | P a g e
As mentioned in 5. 2 .2 although there is a policy to ensure safeguards like GO. MS. 571 of
Revenue Department which mentions about need for EIA. Further G.O. Ms. No. 86, MA &
UD Department Dt. 03.03.06 stipulates that “minimum of 10% of site shall be earmarked for
organized open space and be utilized as greenery or soft landscaping etc. and shall be
provided over and above the mandatory open spaces. This space may be in one or more
pockets.”However, there were lapses which were cited in the audit report which cited
alienation of 972.69 acres of water body in Sompetamandal, Srikakulam district to Nagarjuna
Construction Company Infrastructure Holdings Ltd (NCC) (total allotment was 1046.21
acres).


5 2 7 The scope for resettlement is clearly circumscribed and procedures exist to deal with
it in line with best practice. SCORE: C

Analysis:
Although the scope for resettlement is clearly circumscribed in various GO’s and policies its
implementation has been fairly weak.



LGI: 5.3: Policy implementation is effective, consistent and transparent and involves local
stakeholders.

5 3 1 Investors provide sufficient information to allow rigorous evaluation of proposed
investments. SCORE: D

Analysis:

With respect to this it is witnessed that there is minimal sharing of information by the
investors which could form the basis of assessing technical viability, community consultation
and availability of resources.

5 3 2 Approval of investment plans follows a clear process with reasonable timelines.
SCORE: B

Analysis:

There are uniform processes with regard to review of investment application related
documents.


124 | P a g e
5 3 3 Right holders and investors negotiate freely and directly with full access to relevant
information. CORE: C

Analysis:

In particular with regards to large projects government has taken into account the rights of
affected people but often the opportunity to negotiate with investors does not necessarily
materialize and the right holders do have to seek judicial intervention.

5 3 4 Contractual provisions regarding benefit sharing are publicly disclosed. SCORE: D

Analysis:

There has been minimal/no public disclosure of benefit sharing through contractual process.

LGI: 5.4 Contracts involving public land are public, easily accessible, with
agreements monitored and enforced.

“APIIC Industrial Parks Allotment Regulations 2012” mentions that the information
regarding the development of a new Industrial Park should be published by APIIC in one
newspaper in English and one in Telugu. The basic purpose of this is to widely publicise the
launch of the Industrial Park and invite applications to file allotment applications.


Further with respect to ensuring that there is wide sharing of information it is mandated that
details of all industrial parks regarding facilities and availability of land for allotment and
further information should be shared regarding rate per sq. mt which is supposed to be hosted
on the web site of APIIC and with the commissioner of Industries. It also mentions that the
vacancy and layout should be shared on the website.

5 4 1 Information on spatial extent and duration of approved concessions is publicly
available. SCORE: C

Analysis:

It has been witnessed that there is no system of disclosure regarding concessions given and
the only time when disclosures are being made is when matters are raised in the assembly or
audit or when court directions are given on public interest litigations.




125 | P a g e
However, as per the GO 571 Revenue Department, APLMA “shall establish an online Land
Bank” this would have comprehensive information on land whether government or allotted
along with accurate survey maps thereof.

5 4 2 Compliance with safeguards on concessions is monitored and enforced effectively
and consistently. SCORE: D

Analysis:

There is no systematic monitoring and enforcement of concessions and safeguards.

5 4 3 Avenues to deal with non-compliance exist and obtain timely and fair decisions.
SCORE: C

Analysis:

Under the contracts there is a possibility of dealing with actions against non-compliance,
further any disputes regarding non-compliance are dealt with under the terms and conditions
of the contract viz. arbitration.

    4.6     Land Information Management – Registry and cadastre

    4.6.1 Panel specific context

Land Records provide the foundation for Land Administration. A Revenue village is the basic
unit of revenue administration. The basic annual land record known as pahani in Telangana
area and Adangal in Andhra and Rayalseema areas of the state is maintained by the Village
Revenue Officer (VRO). The record contains the details of lands in the village including
survey number wise, land parcel wise, details of ownership, occupation, type of soil, type of
crop grown etc. VRO is responsible for the correctness of entry of records. A change in the
entry of revenue records could happen (i) due to death of the owner in which case the change
in the record would be in favour of legal heirs or (ii) due to transfer of land ownership
through purchase or gift. Such a change officially called ‘mutation’ is done by the Tahsildar
who is the Mandal Revenue officer after following due process of enquiry. An annual event
called ‘Jamabandi’ is and when where all village revenue records are verified and approved
by a district level senior officer.
Other important     components of the land records are the Field / Parcel map, the
Village Map, the Record of Rights / Village accounts and the Register of Transactions
maintained by the Sub-Registry. The parcel map provides individual field measurements
for accurate re-fixation of land-holding boundaries and the village map serves as a
key for revenue azmoish work. The Record of Rights (ROR) provide title record for
all private agricultural lands and is updated along with other village accounts, representing
dynamic data on land use. Land being a dynamic entity, changes keep taking place in
ownership, extent and boundaries and classification. Unless these changes are promptly
captured and incorporated in the records, land records tend to get obsolete within no time.
Obsolete or deficient land records do not support conflict resolution and affect
planning and developmental activities. Deficient land records also breed insecurity of title.
Proper maintenance of land records serves both the Government as well as the landholder. It
is inconceivable to think about the following without up-to-date and accurate land
records:
    a) Recognition of the title, boundaries and land-use of a holder;
    b) Collection of land based levies;
    c) Planning by the Government for developmental and welfare activities;
    d) Utilizing land information for various land related activities by Government and Non-
        Government users.

The major deficiencies of the existing Indian Land Records system are
    a) Non-auto updating, thereby intrinsically prone to quick obsolescence;
    b) Maintenance activity distributed among three departments – Survey Department,
        Revenue Department, and the Registration Department which do not have effective
        co-ordination among themselves and function in a stand-alone mode;
    c) Title to land is not guaranteed by the State and is only presumptive in nature;
    d) The process of Registration results in conveyance of only the deed and not the
        title.
    e) Not universally accessible because of localized availability and difficulty in handling
        being bulky, besides real time data not being available.
Land Records modernization has been initiated during the early 1980s when Govt. of India
has funded the process of computerization. Only title record i.e. the Adangal / Pahani in
A.P, has been computerized but not the graphical record i.e., the parcel map and the
village map which are also equally important for up to date maintenance of land
records. Computerized database is not available with the three departments participating
in the maintenance of land records. As such, a registered transaction has no links
with the title register and does not result in the updation of records. In fact even a
non-holder of land can undertake registration because the process of registration does
not warrant an examination of title.


In most States, as in A.P., incorporation of changes in the records has not been done
on a regular basis. As a result most of the records are obsolete. To add to the problem,
land records have become quite old, some of them more than a century old. Due to
continued handling for day-to-day administration, a good part of the records have
crumbled and eventually became unavailable. No efforts have been made to conduct
resurveys to create up –to-date land records for villages, owing to the expensive and
time consuming nature of the resurvey operations.            Further, survey framework on
ground is only partially existing due to large-scale misplacement of survey boundary
marks. No efforts have been made to renew and resurrect missing survey stones on
ground.    These factors have contributed to escalation in civil litigation, arising out of
boundary and title disputes.
It is widely accepted that the land records maintained presently are not up-to-date. There are
several reasons for the present state of affairs.
128 | P a g e
   a) Lack of coordination between Survey, Revenue and Registration Departments
       has resulted in inordinate delays/ failure in communicating between the agencies
       changes responsible for updation.
   b) Easily manageable and promptly retrievable / up-datable computerized land
       information is not available.
   c) Inadequate administrative machinery is unable to cope with the speed at which
       changes take place.


Issues of Survey:
In India, the cadastral system has been in vogue for mapping land. Introduced by the British,
this system requires updating of maps every 30 years. This rule has seldom been followed
because of the complexity of the exercise as well as its cost and resource implications. In
Andhra Pradesh, for instance, the last survey of land records was done in 1920. Out of 130
towns in the State, only about 30 towns have been surveyed till date. There are simply no
survey records for the other towns. With regard to about five million land parcels, 49% of
tippons are in good condition, while the rest of the maps are brittle, faded or torn. In trying to
fulfil these functions over decades and centuries, significant erosion has already taken place
in the quality as well as the quantity of records, and in numerous maladies which have crept
into the system which administers land records.
Disconnect between Revenue Department, Registration and Survey Settlement
Department
The information and service needs concerning private property in the State are currently
handled by four government wings: Survey Department, Revenue Department, Registration
Department and Local bodies.

There is over a dozen archaic pieces of legislation, enacted between 1839 and 1923, that
govern many of the land transactions. By introducing the Title Guarantee System 45 ,
tenure security would be enhanced which would result in increased validity of title
and conflict resolution. In the Indian system of land administration, title to land is not
guaranteed. Revenue records reflect only registered ownership and presumptive title unlike
the system of land administration in countries like Australia, where title is guaranteed
by the State. Here, it is the judiciary that can give finality to title. Due to the presumptive
nature of titles and due to the prevalence of the deeds system of registration under
the Registration Act, security to title is not enjoyed by Indian landholders. Insecurity
about title is more pronounced in areas experiencing rapid urbanization and in urban centres.
The problem is not that acutely felt in the rural areas. Introducing Title Guarantee System in
India is a policy decision to be taken by the Central and the respective State Governments.
The Appu Committee46 which deliberated on the aspect of introducing Torrens System in
India has recommended in 1994 against it because of the attendant statutory,
infrastructural and financial implications. Even if title is not guaranteed by the State,
the present system can still be appropriately redesigned to enhance tenure security to
urban and rural landholders.

Some of the measures that can be initiated are:
   a) Only a registered holder of land shall be eligible to undertake sale transaction
       in the sub-registry.
   b) Authenticity of land title records should be ensured by keeping land
       information accurate and up-to-date at any point of time.
   c) An on-line Land Information System (LIS) should be established, facilitating
       transparency, universal accessibility and auto updation.
   d) Survey framework on ground should be maintained in optimal condition so that
       necessary boundary security is provided to the landholders.
   e) Effective grievance redressal machinery must be established. The single point
       solution to all problems pertaining to land records is maintenance of an integrated
       Land Information System.
The present land administration infrastructure is not suitable for the establishment and
maintenance of Land Information System (LIS) in an integrated manner. Three
different departments participate in the land administration activity without much co-
ordination among them. Except in respect of Registration Department, land administration
process has become an expense-incurring activity with Revenue and Survey Departments.
Though these two departments are also insufficient to cope with the magnitude of the
work, the following measures may remedy the situation.
   a) An integrated Land Information System (LIS) should be established and land
       administration entrusted to a single dedicated agency, the department of land
       administration.
   b) This department should perform all land record functions including the maintenance
       of Land Information System.
   c) A separate department should be entrusted with the discharge of general
       administration and magisterial functions presently entrusted to the Revenue
       department. The existing staffs of M.R.O, Sub-Registry and S&LRs have to be
       merged and reorganized into these two departments.
   d) To render more efficient service, the Land Administration department should be
       made financially self-sustaining. This can be achieved by introducing the user
       charges regime and pricing land information for sale.
Since it takes time to set up the above and for coordination of different wings of the
Government, the following may be done in the interim:
131 | P a g e
On-ground update of land records shall be taken up improving coverage and eliminating
backlogs. On-the-ground updation of records can be achieved only when the systematic
deficiencies of the present land records system are identified and rectified as follows.
   a) All the existing textual and graphical land records should be computerized.
   b) The textual title and other information shall be integrated with the graphical
       parcel information for each village so that full attribute information of each
       land parcel (sy.no/subdivision) of villages is readily accessible.
   c) Wherever records are not available, fresh records should be regenerated by
       undertaking need-based resurveys, employing modern methodology.
   d) Identical land information database should be made available with the
       departments of Survey, Revenue and Registration so that on-line transmission
       and incorporation of changes in title, boundary and
   e) Classification is rendered possible for simultaneous updation of database.
   f) Necessary process reengineering of the administrative procedures of the three
       departments should be made so as to achieve functional integration of various
       procedural formalities of these three departments in respect of up to date maintenance
       of land information.
   g) Appropriate regulatory measures need to be implemented to ensure that the
       landholder whose name is entered in the land records alone is authorized to
       undertake a registered transaction.
   h) Land information should be transparent and accessible to all through single point
       availability and multi point accessibility.
   i) Information kiosks on the lines of “Bhoomi” project of Karnataka and Dh arani
       project of Goa and Mee seva in Andhra Pradesh.


   4.6.2 Dimension wise analysis and scoring


6.1.1 - Land possession by the poor can be formalized in line with local norms in an
efficient and transparent process. SCORE: B:

Analysis shows that there is a clear, practical process for the formal recognition of possession
but this process is not implemented effectively, consistently or transparently. There are
different laws that govern regularization of lands in possession of the poor depending on
whether the land is government or private. The latest category of lands to be added to the list

132 | P a g e
in addition to Government and non Government is forest lands. The analysis below takes
stock of the kinds of lands and their analysis.

a) GOVERNMENT LANDS : Different laws exist for regularization of the different
    categories of government lands. The processes of regularization are clearly laid out. In
    practice however there are certain categories of lands (for instance Government lands)
    where formalization is done not as matter of routine administration but fairly regularly
    mostly in a campaign mode and the state monitors the progress of formalization process.
    In certain type of government lands, for instance Inam lands, while there are well laid out
    procedures there is no systematic attempt at formalization, the processes are far from
    transparent and in many parts of the state formalization under these categories is a
    neglected area in administration. In certain type of government lands, for instance
    endowment lands where even though there were provisions for formalization of
    possession through purchase of lands in the name of the poor who are in possession over
    a period of time, this is not happening, there have been several court orders banning
    formalization of such possessions by the poor.

Government assigned lands: Score B - In case of such lands there is a clear, practical
process for the formal recognition of possession but this process is not implemented
effectively, consistently or transparently. Under the relevant Board Standing Orders
(BSO), the State periodically assigns land to the landless poor, including the following
broad categories:

   (i)     Poramboke/assessed wasteland and un-assessed wasteland;
   (ii)    Kharizgatha;
   (iii)   Rajinama;
   (iv)    Bought in lands;
   (v)     Cattle stand poramboke; and
   (vi)    Ceiling lands (addressed separately below).

The State’s official record of lands assigned to the landless poor show that 4.25 million acres
have been assigned to 2.92 million households (see Table).




133 | P a g e
According to official statistics, Andhra Pradesh has assigned more government land to more
beneficiaries than any other Indian state. Despite the statistics on paper, a significant number
of cases, poor are in cultivation of government lands but their possession is not
regularized. Poor who are in possession of Government lands are called ‘Shivaijamdars ‘ and
there are clear provision for regularizing their possession provided it is formally established
by the local revenue officer that the person/s in possession of the lands are socially and
economically poor. Such type of regularization happens not as a matter of routine but
sporadically mostly in a campaign mode whenever, usually once a year when the
Government takes up a program for ‘distribution of the land to the poor’.

While the process followed is fairly transparent still instead of campaign mode once a year it
would be desirable that such formalization happens as a matter of routine and importantly the
poor are completely aware of their rights and are able to apply to the system and the system
responds within specified timelines which is not the case presently.

The whole scenario is further complicated by the fact that despite the A.P.(POT)
Assignment, 1977, which specifically prohibits transfer of assigned land and allows for
resumption of illegally transferred land, the poor sell their lands due to exigencies in their
families, and the Government again does not resume lands regularly. Here too resumption
is done sporadically. Ensuring of land rights to the poor should be done on a systematic
134 | P a g e
and continuous basis. And the same should be reviewed and details put up on the
website regularly. For development of lands of poor so that lands become productive assets
of the poor the dovetailing of land distribution with the Land Development Programs
should be invariably done.

b) Bhoodan Lands Score B: The Bhoodan (donation of land) movement was started
      by Acharya Vinoba Bhave in the Nalgonda district of Andhra Pradesh and resulted in
      donations of privately held land to the poor. Annexure-II provides the details of the
      land distributed to the poor under the movement. Of the total of 42,199 beneficiaries,
      12,832 are members of Scheduled Tribes, and 4,538 are Backward Castes and
      others. The issues described under the discussion of government assigned lands are
      equally applicable to land received under the Bhoodan movement. The poor who
      have been assigned lands may not be in possession of the land, they may be in
      possession but not have evidence of title, or other circumstances may prevent
      them   from the benefit of the assigned land. Here too a regular mechanism for
      formalization should be followed which is not being done presently.

II. PRIVATE LANDS

2.1     Sada Bainama transactions: Score D: There is no process for formal recognition
   of possession

In every region of the State of Andhra Pradesh, i.e., Telangana, Rayalaseema or Andhra
there are specific cases where the poor have bought the lands from the landowners about 30-
40 years ago, on plain paper (Sadabainama). Since the purchase, the poor have been in
physical possession of these lands and have in almost all the cases been cultivating the lands.
However as the purchase transaction has taken place on plain paper these lands are not
registered in the names of the poor. By virtue of Amendment Act I of 1989, Section 5-A
was inserted, which envisages and enables regularization of certain alienations or other
transfers made or effected otherwise than by registered documents. Sub-Sections (1) to (5) of
Section 5-A and Sub-Rule (1) to (7) of Rule 22 contain the procedure with regard to
enquiry and regularization of unregistered sale transactions.

As per rule 22 the M.R.O shall issue a general notification in Form IX calling for
applications from the persons who are recorded as occupants in Adangal/ Pahani or in
RoR prepared earlier by virtue of alienation or transfer made otherwise than by

135 | P a g e
registration, provided the alienation took place before 31.7.1989. The M.R.O, after
enquiry and on deposit of the amount equal to the registration fees and the stamp duty
that would have been payable had the alienation or transfer been effected by a
registered document, shall issue a certificate, based on which necessary entries shall be
recorded in the Pass Books and Title Deeds. The alienation / transfer shall not be in
contravention to the provisions of the AP Land Reforms (Ceiling on Agricultural
Holdings) Act, 1973, the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976, the AP
Assigned Lands (Prohibition of Transfers) Act, 1977 and the AP Scheduled Area Land
Transfer Regulation, 1959. The last date for receipt of such applications was 31.10.1998. The
above provision has been made with a view to regularize the unregistered sale
transactions made by the ignorant, inarticulate and poor ryots. However many of the poor
due to ignorance of such a provision in law and also due to lack of resources to pay the
registration fee has not regularized the purchase of their lands. Lakhs of acres are involved
in Sadabainama transactions across the state. Thousands of poor do not find their names in
revenue records despite purchasing and being in possession of lands. There is need for
extension of the date for filing claims in Form X to enable all such ryots who have not
availed the facilities earlier. and the Hon’ble Revenue Minister observed that Government
would consider extension of the cut off date. Subsequently the Govt. has extended the date up
to 31stMarch, 2006 but the poor purchasers could not take advantage of it due to lack of
publicity to this extension of time. Case Study done by Indira Kranthi Patham in 3
villages in Adilabad District to understand the nature and the number of poor affected
by the issue of the Sadabainama shows the following data:




136 | P a g e
The issue of Sada Bainama transactions where the poor farmers purchase lands from
land owners on plain papers was studied in some detail in Adilabad district of Andhra
Pradesh 2006. The findings of the study have been captured as below:




The phenomenon of Sadabainama transactions is wide spread. On a conservative estimate
in each of the Telangana districts 1-lakh acres is under Sadabainama transactions. In
coastal districts also the phenomenon of plain paper transactions is fairly wide spread,
going by the report of the Joint Collector, Guntur in the Joint Collectors workshop in
February, 2005 who reported that in Guntur district in one subdivision alone the extent
of lands under sadabainama transactions is 45,000 acres. Across the State an estimated 15-25
Lakh acres is under plain paper transactions. This makes the issue along with the issue
of tenancy and forest revenue border issues one of the foremost in terms of sheer
number of poor who are adversely affected.

From the surveys conducted by the RDOs of the 5 subdivisions and also other sources
it is clear that a majority (70-85%) of the farmers owning lands under Sadabainama
transactions are poor farmers with these lands as the only source of livelihood. On a very
conservative estimate 12 –15 lakh poor farmers despite purchasing lands albeit on plain
paper and being in possession of lands for decades do not enjoy the benefits of being
owners of lands. Considering the extent of lands under plain paper transactions and the
number of poor farmers affected due to the same, it is incumbent on the part of the
State to address the issue immediately. The absence of updated land records and the
resultant litigations is costing    the exchequer of the State 2% of annual GDP
(Mckinsey report). Hence the so called loss of revenue to the State due to regularization

137 | P a g e
of the plain paper transactions of poor farmers which would result in, apart from making
lakhs of poor farmers owners of lands and accrued benefits thereof, updated land records up
to 20 lakh acres reducing the leak from the other side.

Therefore at present there is no law to govern formalization of private lands in occupation of
the poor. And hence this is classified under option D.

6.1.2 - Non-documentary evidence is effectively used to help establish rights - Score: C:
Non-documentary forms of evidence are used to obtain recognition of a claim to property
along with other documents (e.g. tax receipts or informal purchase notes) when other forms
of evidence are not available. They have less strength than the provided documents.

Analysis: During the process of formalization of possession of Government lands by the poor
people in the absence of documentary evidence like entry in local revenue records, revenue
receipts etc a very crucial part of establishing possession of the poor on a particular parcel of
land is through oral enquiry which is a very well laid out procedure of enquiry which forms a
part of the law itself .This oral enquiry known as the local enquiry and is conducted by the
local revenue functionary.

In case of a claim or application or even suo motu for formalization of possession of land
parcel by the poor the concerned revenue official in the absence of any documentary evidence
relies on local enquiry to establish the veracity of such a claim. The functionary physically
visits the site of the land parcel and conducts enquiry on the bonafide of the claim by
verifying whether the claimant is actually in possession of the land, extent of such possession
etc. The official also conducts enquiry with the neighbouring farmers to establish possession,
number of years of such occupation and also the economic status of the claimant as to
whether the claimant is having any other property etc. As a part of the local enquiry written
statements of those locals the functionary has enquired with are taken and these statements
along with the report filed by the enquiring functionary form the formal enquiry report that
establishes possession or otherwise of the claimant.

In fact in all that govern assignment of government lands to the poor and also formalization
of possession whether or not the people in occupation of government lands are poor is
established through local enquiry. In general in the absence of any other documentary
evidence of the economic status of the persons apart from ration cards (which allows access
the subsidized essential commodities) local enquiry is what is relied on by the state.

138 | P a g e
6.1.3 Long-term unchallenged possession is formally recognized. SCORE: A: Legislation
exists to formally recognize long-term, unchallenged possession and this applies to both
public and private land although different rules may apply. There are provisions to recognise
long term possession of Government lands .Under the AP Assignment(POT) Act,1972/7 the
long term possessors of land known as the ‘shivaijamadars’ can be assigned pattas (titles ) to
the land parcel under possession.

Score of A was chosen unanimously and the following Acts like The Andhra Pradesh
Scheduled Areas Ryotwari Settlement Regulation 1970 (Reg. II of 1970) and The Andhra
Pradesh Occupants of Homesteads (Conferment of Ownership) Act, 1976 were cited which
recognise long term unchallenged possession of land. According to the panelists, long term
unchallenged possession is recognised for both public and private.

6.1.4 First-time recording of rights on demand includes proper safeguards and access is
not restricted by high fees - Score: A - On-demand recording of rights includes proper
safeguards to prevent abuse and costs do not exceed 0.5% of the property value.

Analysis: On demand recording of rights does include proper safe guards in that there is a
well laid out procedure under the A.P. Rights in Land and Pattadar Pass Books Act, 1971.

For recording of rights with clear timelines for every step. On application for recording of
rights to a particular land parcel, notices are issued to the affected parties by the Tahsildar
who on a given due date proceeds to the site of the land parcel and conducts a public enquiry
and satisfies himself/herself with the veracity of the claim in the application both on record
and in terms of the physical possession of the land before issuing proceedings for the record
of rights. Appeals and Revisions lie on the decisions of the Recording Authority (Tahsildar)
on recording of rights, to the Revenue Divisional Officer and the Collector. There is no
Stamp Duty or Registration Fee for recording the rights under the A.P. Rights in Land and
Pattadar Pass Books Act, 1971.

The first time recording of rights has been completed for more than 90% of land parcels in
the state. Presently most of the Recording of Rights pertains to land obtained either through
purchase or through inheritance or gift. While there is a well laid out procedure still the
whole procedure depends very much on the enquiry report of the Village Revenue Officer
since the mandal revenue officer almost always depends on this instead of verifying for
himself/herself because of the number of applications for recording of rights .In general there

139 | P a g e
is no adherence to a tight time schedule .This has given rise to an unofficial fee being
collected at the village and mandal levels.

LGI: 6.2        Completeness of the land registry

6.2.1 Total cost of recording a property transfer is low. Score: D

Analysis: While the official fee for recording of property transfer is fixed, it is not done in
time and the whole process is dependent on the local official concerned.Therefore whether
the total cost is 1% or higher depends on the efficacy and the personal integrity of the official
functionary concerned .Of the total cost the unofficial fee would be a major portion. Further
the cost is also a function of the background and economic and social status of the applicant.
For instance if the applicant is a rich and powerful (politically and socially) person then the
chances of his work being done in record time is high as against a person with no influence.

6.2.2 Information held in records is linked to maps that reflect current reality. SCORE: C

Analysis: Survey sub division of land parcel does not happen concurrently with the division
of a land parcel either through sale of a part of land or through inheritance. After the transfer
of land in a person/s or institutions name (which is in the purview of the              Revenue
department), the new owner has to formally apply to the Survey department with a demand
draft for the requisite amount of fee. Normally there is a long queue for survey subdivision
work and the priority with which a particular application is taken is opaque and driven by
monetary and other considerations .Sometimes it takes up to a year to get the survey
subdivision work done as there is a long waitlist for the survey sub division to happen. This
state of affairs is primarily due to the following lacunae:

a) The survey method used presently is the old chain survey method which was followed by
   the British. The GPS and DGPS              and local station forms of survey have been
   experimented with in the state. These methods are yet to make a head way officially in the
   state .The chain method of survey is very time consuming.
b) In many parts of the state the field map books are located in the district Head Quarters and
   a surveyor after being entrusted with a sub division work has to travel to the district Head
   Quarters to collect the required FMB which itself takes time to locate. In some cases
   records are in a state of decay which only complicates matters further. This is despite the
   fact that all FMBs have been scanned .There is no user friendly software to use the
   scanned copies of the FMBs to enable to undertake online subdivision

140 | P a g e
c) There is a shortage of surveyors in the department. The department has been making
   efforts to fulfil the gap by undertaking regular courses to train surveyors .But still the gap
   continues as 1) The work load due to increasing number of transactions is high. 2) For a
   surveyor the remuneration being paid by private players is far more attractive and so
   trained surveyors routinely opt for private real estate jobs.
Further a major reason that the records for privately held land not being reflective readily in
maps is that of a sale transaction through a plain paper transaction. i.e. such a transaction is
not recorded in registries as they are informal sale transactions and therefore does not get sub
divided either. Studies by the Revenue department and the Koneru Ranga Rao committee
have shown that up to 30% of land holdings and area are under such a category.

6.2.3 All relevant private encumbrances are recorded. Score: C

All encumbrances are recorded properly in every Sub-Registrar Office right from the
inception of Sub-Registrar Office. Further the encumbrances from the year 1983 were
computerized and presently the services are entrusted with Mee-Seva Centers. More over the
Encumbrance data is also available with departmental web site www.registration.ap.gov.in

Everyone in the panel was of the view that private encumbrances are recorded but there is
rarely any consistency or reliability in the process. Hence grade C was given on grounds that
relevant private encumbrances are recorded at the instance of the interested parties but the
same is not done suo-motu in a consistent and reliable manner.

6.2.4 All relevant public restrictions or charges are recorded. Score:C: Relevant public
restrictions or charges are recorded but this is not done in a consistent and reliable manner

Analysis: Public Restrictions on land are mainly of two types 1) that of transfer and 2) nature
of use of land. The following classes of lands are prohibited from transfer (a) transfer of
immovable properties under any statue of the State or Central; (b) transfer of immovable
properties owned by State or Central Government; (c) transfer of immovable properties,
owned by Religious and Charitable Endowments falling under the purview of the A.P.
Charitable and Hindu Religious institutions and Endowments Act, 1987 or by Wakf falling
uncle': Wakf Act, 1995; (d) transfer of Agricultural or Urban lands declared as surplus under
A.P. Land Reforms (Ceiling on Agriculture Holding) Act, 1973 or the ULC (Urban Land
Ceiling) Act, 1976; (e) lands which have water bodies etc.



141 | P a g e
All public restrictions mentioned above are recorded in relevant revenue records. For instance
all the categories of lands that are prohibited from transfer are entered in the POT register
maintained at the Tahsildar office .While these registers in general are updated there are
instances however these registers are not updated. Similarly all government lands are
computerised and the information is available on the web. Further details of assignment of
lands is also available in Tahsiladar offices and collectorates. These documents can be
verified at low cost. All land is deemed to be categorized as agricultural and any non-
agricultural use of land (for i.e. Commercial )is prohibited unless officially converted to non-
agricultural land .Details of all such lands are available.

6.2.5 There is a timely response to requests for accessing registry records. Score B: Copies
or extracts of documents recording rights in property can generally be obtained within 1 week
of request.

Analysis: Through the Mee seva centres copies of extracts of documents are generally
available within a week .However certain documents which require local enquiry to be done
by the tahsildar are available within 2 weeks. As per citizens charter a specified time period is
given for each of extracts to be made available which is adhered to in general. The panelists
were of the opinion that some documents are available in 2-3 days. It was felt that only the
documents which are digitized are available within 2-3 days while the ones which are not
may take more than one week. All agreed that through computerization the Mee-Seva centres
the registry of records can be accessed easily by paying fixed fees. It was agreed that the
copies of records can be obtained within a period of one week in most cases.

6.2.6 The registry is searchable. Score: A - The records in the registry can be searched by
both right holder name and parcel. There was unanimous agreement between the panel
members that the records in the registry can be searched both by the right holder name and
parcel. Hence score of A was given.

6.2.7 Land information records are easily accessed. Score: A: Copies or extracts of
documents recording rights in property can be obtained by anyone who pays the necessary
formal fee, if any.

The following documents can be obtained through payment of formal fee within a specified
time period. And the following documents are provided by Meeseva to the citizens to avail
the information

LGI: 6.3           Reliability: Registry information is updated and sufficient to make
meaningful inferences on ownership




143 | P a g e
6.3.1 Information in public registries is synchronized to ensure integrity of rights and
reduce transaction cost. Score: B: Links are in place for all types of public land information
registries but checks on the legitimacy of transactions that affects certain parties' land rights
are only performed ex post. The panel also members agreed that the links are in place for all
types of public land information registries but the checks on the legitimacy of transactions
that affects certain parties land rights are only performed as ex-post. Hence score B was given

6.3.2 Registry information is up-to-date and reflects ground reality. Score C: Between 50%
and 70% of the ownership information in registry/cadaster is up-to-date and reflects ground
reality. A maximum of 70% of land ownership information reflects ground reality. This is
because in the rural areas, especially in case of small holdings belonging to poorer sections of
society transfer of land ownership is through plain paper transactions i.e not through formal
registration .Poor people so as to avoid the high fee of registration enter into informal sale
transactions.

While section 5-A of the A.P R.O.R Act recognises this and has had a provision for
regularising all such informal sale transactions still there is a significant percentage of lands
which are under ownership due to the informal sale transactions(this has been discussed in
detail in previous sections)     since a significant percentage of poor have failed to take
advantage of the window provided by the Government due to ignorance and the Government
itself, despite clear recommendation by the Koneru Ranga Rao Committee to provided a
provision annually for regularising all informal sales , has not extended to date after 2009. It
is estimated that 20-35% of lands are under such transactions and therefore in all such cases
the ownership on record does not reflect field level reality (because not being legal owners of
land the revenue authorities do not enter their names in revenue records).

In case of Government lands also once a land parcel is assigned in the name of a person there
are a significant number of cases where land is sold informally (since official land is
prohibited from transfer) but the ownership on record continues in the name of the original
assignee. In many cases land parcel undergoes two to three land transactions while on record
the owners’ name is unchanged.. Sometimes land ownership passes on to legal heirs but the
name will be that of original assignee. This is true for nearly 35 lakh acres of Government
land assigned to the poor. There is no record maintained by revenue department of non
agricultural lands .It is the municipal administration department who have the details and
these details are fairly accurate.

LGI: 6.4 Cost-effectiveness and sustainability: land administration services are provided in
cost-effective ways that are sustainable in the long term.

6.4.1 The registry is financially sustainable through fee collection to finance its operations.
Score: A:

Analysis: In the present model of giving information on land registry by collection of fee the
whole system has been outsourced to a third party agency (except in 2 districts where the
revenue department gets a lion’s share of the fee). The revenue model is such that a lion share
of the fee collected goes to the private player, a designated percentage goes to the IT
department and another to the Revenue Department.

So in that sense there is no connect between the revenue earnings from fee collected and the
operating costs of the Department itself since the operating costs of the Department have a
separate budget head met by the Government.

But yes the revenue earned is greater than the operating costs of the Mee Seva centre.

6.4.2 Investment in land administration is sufficient to cope with demand for high quality
services. Score C:

Analysis: While there are no studies or analysis that has been done to understand the demand
for high quality services,clearly the current investment is sufficient to maintain medium
service standards but it does not allow to proactively adopt new developments. In fact the
present rate of investments (Human and physical capital) is not sufficient to comprehensively
address the lacunae that are presently there for having a correct and transparent registry. For
example to adopt modern methods of survey, better infrastructure in Revenue Offices,
adequate number of      functionaries, conducting of regular training to staff, an IEC for the
general public on the various rules and regulations and also their rights and most importantly
modification and possible repealing of such provisions in the existing Acts which are
relevant.

LGI: 6.5        Fees are determined transparently to cover the cost of service provision
6.5.1 Fees have a clear rationale, their schedule is public, and all payments are accounted
for. Score A




145 | P a g e
Analysis: The fee structure is transparent and schedule of fee for different services is
exhibited in every Mee Seva centre. The fee is paid through challan in designated branches of
SBI & SBH. Accounts are automatically reconciled.

6.5.2 Informal payments are discouraged. SCORE B:

Analysis: The system of issuing of registry documents is completely different in different
departments (except in to districts) in that a citizen applies for a registry document in a Mee
Seva centre which are set up across the district and the application is forwarded to the
concerned official functionary who then prepares the required document following due
procedure of law and sends the certificate to the Mee Seva centre which then issues the
certificate. In the whole system, the informal payment within the department is discouraged.
The charges and fees for all the transactions at Mee Seva centres are public and the major
part of transactions is done through bank drafts so that cash transactions are discouraged.
However a major problem lies with the third parties that act on behalf of the applicants who
have liaison with the officers of the department to speed up the work and provide information
which through legal way would take time or not be available. The department has not been
successful in curtailing the role of third parties where most of the informal payments are
exchanged. Informal payments are pervasive in the land administration department and there
have been very less cases of effective action against illegal staff behaviour. However, the
other panellists reiterated the fact that there are stringent rules and regulations to check
deviant behaviour but disciplinary action and prosecution leaves a lot to be desired. The
panel was of view that though corruption is a big issue and informal payments are
discouraged as there is a vigilance department which is supposed to carry out regular checks
and raids. But there are many weaknesses in taking swift and deterrent action.

6.5.3 Service standards are published and regularly monitored. Score B:

Analysis: Service standards have been published via Citizen Charter but a regular monitoring
mechanism is missing in the department,especially between the time application is given to
the concerned department and finally giving the certificate. The panelists discussed citizen
charters and the timelines however the adherence to the covenants in the charters is not
actively monitored. It was agreed that score of B would be appropriate.

   4.7     Land Valuation and Taxation

   4.7.3 Panel specific context
Land as a factor of production occupies a major place in the production and promotion of
livelihoods. Both state and local governments are appropriate authorities to levy taxes on land
and property. Taxation on land and property has become a point of interest in recent days.
This is particularly due to the increasing revenue demands from the local governments. The
pace of urbanization has also resulted in more revenue demands from the Urban Local Bodies
or ULBs. As governments move towards a path of fiscal consolidation and better resource
mobilisation, boosting tax by the local governments become imperative. The revenues from
property tax can only be increased if there is an acceptance for the property tax by the people.
If this has to be achieved there should be transparency in valuation of land and property for
the purpose of taxation. Increasing cost of collection has become a major concern for local
bodies. Steep increase in the compliance cost, especially for tax collecting authorities has
reduced the efficiency of property tax.


This chapter outlines the history of evolution of tax related to land in AP, major taxes on land
and property in practice in the state of Andhra Pradesh, the gaps in policy and practice and
some possible suggestions that can be explored to overcome the gaps. This chapter places an
emphasis on the property valuation and taxation in Andhra Pradesh while identifying the
taxes related to land and property as falling under the purview of the study. Cesses related to
the use of land resources are also included to give a larger picture about the extent of non-tax
cost related to land and its resources. Stamp duty is also included in the purview of the study
as it is also related to the land and other immovable properties which come under the ambit of
the state as per the Indian Stamp Act of 1899. More over Supreme Court has also observed
that stamp duty is a form of tax.


There are 2 major dimensions which relate to the Land Valuation and Taxation. They are
(1)Transparency of valuations: valuations are based on clear principles, applied uniformly,
updated regularly, and publicly accessible and (2) Collection efficiency: land and property
taxes are collected and the yield from doing so exceeds collection cost. This chapter treats
both the dimensions together and tries to outline the context of taxes related to property and
land in AP.
The major taxes on land and property in the State are detailed below. Due to changing
economic use of land some of these taxes have been either amended or discontinued by the
appropriate authorities.


Property tax in Urban Local Bodies of Andhra Pradesh:
Property tax is levied by all Municipalities / Municipal Corporations.
Property Tax is one of the main sources of revenue for the ULB. Residential and Non-
residential (Commercial) properties, situated within the limits of ULB, are assessed for tax.
Based on such assessments, taxes are levied on the property owners. The information
regarding all the new constructions, existing construction and modifications to the property, if
any, are being provided by the Town Planning Department for making necessary changes to
tax assessment. The citizen has to register with the urban local body for taxation and
assessments are made based on the physical dimensions of the property and other parameters..


The Revenue section of the ULB/Municipal body is responsible for administration of
property taxation for that respective ULB. Property tax is assessed for each property located
in the limits of the ULB based on the Annual Rental Value and the Taxation rate. The Annual
Rental Value of a property is calculated based on parameters like Plinth area, zonal location
of the property, Residential/Non-residential status, age of the property, type of construction
and other parameters applicable to specific situations. The Town planning section of the ULB
provides all the details of the property with reference to its physical status and modifications.


   a) Levying Property Tax without hindrance
All local bodies must be fully enabled to levy property tax (including tax for all types of
residential and commercial properties) and any hindrance in this regard must be removed.
Having examined the inadequacies and wide variations in the levy and collection of property
tax system in the country and its potential to mobilise resources which will enable them to
provide civic services, the 13th Finance Commission recommended that the urban local
bodies should be enabled to levy property tax without any restrictions both on residential and
commercial properties. The state government should certify to this extent to demonstrate
compliance.




149 | P a g e
   b) Cap on Taxing Powers
The powers to levy and collection of property tax by the urban local bodies are incorporated
in the Municipal Acts and the Rules made there under. Generally, the municipal councils are
empowered by the respective Acts to levy a percentage of the annual rental value of lands and
buildings or both as decided by the municipal council. Despite such provisions, states impose
certain restrictions or limitations on the council’s discretion by fixing the percentage of the
rental value on lands and buildings. For example, in Andhra Pradesh, percentage of property
tax to be fixed by the councils shall be such that the incidence of property tax together with
the education tax and library cess shall not exceed 25% of the annual rental value in case of
residential buildings and 33% in case of non-residential buildings. This imposes a limitation
on the discretion of urban local bodies.


   c) Exemptions
The Municipal Acts provide for exemption of property tax for certain categories of buildings
and lands like places of worship, recognized educational institutions, etc. This is apart from
central government properties exempted under the Constitution. However, apart from the
statutorily exempted buildings, state governments often exempt through executive
instructions some other categories also like houses of serving or retired military personnel.
This restricts the powers of the urban local bodies to levy property tax which results in loss of
income which is not often compensated by the state government.


   d) Waiver of Penal Interest
The Municipal Acts provides, in some states, for the levy of penal interest on the delayed
payments of property tax. However, the state governments, through executive instructions
waive the penal interest as one time measures and this was repeated in subsequent years as
well cutting the powers of the urban local bodies.


Though, it is argued that such waivers are aimed at motivating the defaulters to pay the
property tax by saving the interest, and to facilitate the urban local bodies to garner more
resources through property tax, this eats into the discretionary powers of the local bodies. In
one state, the C&AG in its report suggested that such onetime measures are recurring year
after year and felt that the best remedy against the defaulters is to take the penal action

     e) Restrictions on Revision of Property Tax
During the revision of property tax periodically, the Rules or executive instructions impose
certain restrictions on enhancement of tax. For example, in Andhra Pradesh, as per the
instructions which now have been repealed, the enhancement on revision should not exceed
75% in case of residential buildings and 100% and 150% in respect of non-residential
buildings, which are more than 25 years old and less than 25 years old respectively. These
rules besides limiting the levy lead to discrimination. The state Governments need to examine
such restrictive clauses in the municipal laws and ensure that they are removed to enable the
urban local bodies to levy and collect property tax which is in their domain. Or else, in all
such cases the state government need to compensate and periodically revise the compensation
and Compliance Certification by the state government that the hindrances to levy property
tax by local bodies have been removed.


Key State and National Acts impacting the Taxation:
Various Acts and provisions of law governing the property taxation in urban local bodies of
AP are:         A.P. Municipalities Act, 1965, Hyderabad Municipal Corporation Act, 1955,
Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Act, 2008, A.P. Urban Areas (Development) Act,
1975, A.P. Agricultural Land (Conversion to Non Agricultural Purposes) Act, 2006, A.P.
Town Planning Act, 1920, and the Government Orders issued from time to time.


It is governed in specific by Sections 81 to 95 of APM Act(1965), Rules 6 to 16 of Taxation
Rules (Schedule II of the Act) and Assessment of Taxes Rules, 1990 issued in GO
Ms.No.438 MA dated 29-10-1990. The rate of taxation is fixed by a council and the rates
shall not exceed 25 percent of annual rent for Residential buildings, and 33 percent of annual
rent for Non-residential buildings. As already noted the rate of taxation is fixed based on the
annual rental value (ARV).47 Such a system of valuation for taxation had many problems in it.
The rent of a building was determined by a slew of factors which could not be captured
always by the annual rental value. There was considerable discretion in the calculation of rent
of the owner occupied houses. Due to the involvement of many non-economic factors it was
becoming impossible to fix the annual rental value on an objective basis. This leads to the

The annual rental value of a building is determined having due regard to the rent received in respect thereof, that is the actual rent received,
or receivable on a hypothetical basis (market rent). In cases where the rent is fixed by the rent control act of 1960, the Annual Rental Value
shall not exceed the amount of rent so fixed. In case of owner occupied buildings the Annual Rental Value shall be on the basis of
hypothetical rent the building will fetch in the open market.


151 | P a g e
complaints of arbitrariness. In order to eliminate such drawbacks to a possible extent the law
was amended in 1989 through which a set of criteria’s were identified to calculate the tax
liability on the property. They are: Location, Nature of use, Plinth area, Type of construction,
Age of building.


These changes were brought about to ensure efficiency and transparency in tax administration.
This made sure that same tax is paid on similar buildings in same locality which are used for
similar purpose. It also delinked rent control act from payment of property tax. It provided
relief to the buildings constructed under Weaker Section Housing Scheme and to owner
occupied residential buildings. At the heart of the changes brought about in 1989 and
subsequent years was procedural simplification and efficiency.


In order to arrive at rational methodology in using location as a criteria in determining tax,
the entire municipal area was divided in two different locations based on factors such as
proximity to market, availability of civic amenities and proximity to educational and medical
institutions, banks and other public offices etc. the buildings are demarcated based on the
type of construction depending on the material used for roofing. Different uses identified for
classifying buildings based on the nature of use were residential, Public Use, Shops,
Shopping Complexes, Hospitals and Nursing Homes etc. different categories of buildings are
identified depending on the variables mentioned above. The annual rental value based on the
new methodology is calculated through a sample survey to find the prevailing rent for each
category of building. The annual rental value is calculated for per square meter of plinth
area.Exemption from payment of property tax is given to Places set apart for public worship,
recognised educational institutions and houses constructed for urban poor. This new method
of calculating annual rental value was implemented in all municipalities of the state of
Andhra Pradesh from October first 1993. It has increased the general acceptance of property
tax and have reduced complaints drastically. The revenue accruing from the property tax has
increased since its implementation.


Vacant Land Tax in Andhra Pradesh:
Andhra Pradesh also has a vacant land tax. The vacant lands within the limits of the ULB are
also taxed based on certain criteria. The vacant lands are identified and assessed for fixation
of a Vacant Land Tax, which is levied on the owner of the particular vacant land by the
Revenue Section of the ULB. The main functions/processes of the Revenue section with
152 | P a g e
reference to Vacant Land Tax are as follows: Receipt of application for assessment,
inspection, processing of the application, Issue of notices to owner of vacant lands
assessment of the Vacant Land Tax, Issue of demand notices, Collection of taxes and
maintenance of the records.Receipt of application for title transfer, inspection, processing and
recording of title transfer and collection of title transfer fee.


In G.O.Ms.No.23 M.A., dt.17.1.2007, Government have issued amendment to rule 9(1) of
A.P. Municipalities (Assessment of taxes) of Rules, 1990 where in Vacant Land Tax shall be
levied at 0.20% of the capital value of the land in case of Municipalities. As per
G.O.Ms.No.538 of MA&UD, dt.29-10-2001, the Vacant Land Tax shall be levied at 0.5% of
the capital value of the land in case of Municipal Corporations.


Property Taxation in Rural Local Bodies of Andhra Pradesh: The local bodies of the
Panchayat Raj system in the state Andhra Pradesh earn their revenue from different sources.
Some of the most important sources of revenue for the Panchayats of Andhra Pradesh are the
Direct taxes such as house tax and license fee, which are levied by the village panchayats.
Transferred revenues like land cess, entertainment tax, add-ons on stamp duties etc. that are
initially collected by the government. There are about 21823 panchayats which operate from
the respective districts of the state.


The said panchayats also levy taxes on property in the form of house taxes. House tax is
levied on the basis of Annual Rental value or capital value basis
Prior to 2000-2001 general revision of house tax was done once in 5 years. From 2000-2001
onwards house tax is increased at a flat rate of 5% every year. In rural areas the buildings
such as cattle sheds, poultry sheds, etc are exempted from house tax.


Tax on conversion of agriculture land to non-agriculture purpose:
The Government of Andhra Pradesh has passed The Andhra Pradesh Agricultural Land
(conversion for non-agricultural purposes) Act,2006 (the Act) for regulating the conversion
of agricultural land in the state of Andhra Pradesh to non-agricultural purposes and for
matters connected therewith or incidental thereto and to repeal the Andhra Pradesh Non-




153 | P a g e
Agricultural Land Assessment Act (NALA),1963.48As per the Andhra Pradesh Agriculture
Land (Conversion for Non-agriculture purposes) Act, 2006, any owner converting
agricultural land for non-agricultural purposes should pay 10 per cent of the basic value
towards conversion fee. If the land has already been converted for non-agricultural purposes
illegally before January, 2006, they would have to pay fifty per cent fee as penal amount
apart from the conversion fee. Each time when an agriculture land is converted to a non-
agriculture purpose, permission has to be sought from government for the same. Conversion
permission request can be issued, rejected in full or part by the competent authority.


This Act is not applicable to Lands owned by the State Government, Lands owned by a local
authority and used for any communal purposes so long as the land is not used for commercial
purposes, Lands used for religious or charitable purposes and Lands used by owner for
household industries involving traditional occupation(not exceeding one acre). The
implementation of Agriculture Land (Conversion for Non-agriculture purposes) Act is
expected to boost the revenue of the government to a certain extent.

Water tax :Water tax is levied by government in lieu of the land revenue in the state of AP.
The Andhra Pradesh Water Tax Act providing for the levy of water tax on lands irrigated by
Government sources of irrigation came into effect from 01-07-1996.


This Act was amended in 1997 with a view to raising the rates of water tax and extending the
levy of water tax to aquaculture. G.O.Ms.No.115, Revenue (LR-3) Department, Dated:13-02-
2001, provides for distribution of 10 percent of Water Tax to Gram Panchayats. The existing
rates of water charges are as follows:




48
 The NALA act came in to force in 1963. The NALA tax is payable on land used other than for agriculture. The rate of tax depended on
two factors namely nature of use (commercial/residential) and population. As the revenue from NALA was not much and NALA being
outdated, the tax was abolished in 2006.

beneficiaries of the schemes in the above mentioned areas.


Stamp duty on Property Transactions in Andhra Pradesh:
The Indian Stamp Act is concerned with the non-judicial stamps.49 These stamps are used in
respect of the instruments charged under the Act. The Stamp Act levies stamp duty on certain
instruments. The stamp duty mentioned in this Act is mandatory in nature and there are penal

49
  The non-judicial stamps are classified in to impressed stamps and adhesive stamps. The adhesive stamps are further classified in to
adhesive stamps (rule 13 of stamp rules) and special adhesive stamps (rule 17 of stamp rules).

156 | P a g e
provisions for the non-compliance or violation of the Act and Rules. The concept of stamp
duty has undergone revolutionary change since the implementation of the Stamp Act. The
stamp duty is no longer payable only by the usage of stamps only, and government now
permits payment of duty in cash(section 10-A A.P. act 8 of 1998). At present most of the
stamp duty is collected in the form of money. There were a slew of acts and laws Regulation
VI of 1797, which was introduced in the province of Bengal which gradually formed the
basis for the enactment of the present act related to stamp duty that is act 2 of 1899.


The Stamp Act is a fiscal enactment aimed at the augmentation of revenues of the state and
the primary objective of the Act is not to regulate the transaction between the parties. The
stamp duty is levied when a document is executed. The Stamp Act consists of 88 sections
spanning across eight chapters. It is in chapter two that matters regarding to the methods of
valuation for the purpose of duty is mentioned. Section 3 is the enabling provision for the
instruments chargeable with duty. It stipulates that every instrument shall be chargeable with
duty as mentioned in Schedule I-A as applicable to the respective state. Sections 4, 5 and 6
lay down the principles as to how different types of instruments are chargeable.


All the stamp duty does not fall under the purview of a single government. The authority to
levy stamp duty is divided between the state and the union governments. The instruments on
which the union government has the authority to levy stamp duty is mentioned in entry 91 of
the union list in Indian constitution and they will be shown in Schedule I of the Act and the
instruments on which the state has the authority to levy stamp duty is mentioned in entry 63
of state list in the Indian constitution50and they will be shown in Schedule I-A of the Act. The
power to amend or alter the rate of stamp duty on all documents mentioned other than in
entry 91 of union list is within the jurisdiction of the state. The Indian stamp act 1899 has
undergone many amendments since its implementation. States also went for many
amendments in the Act resulting in the consolidating of Act in that specific area or bringing
altogether a new statute.


In Andhra Pradesh state it was the Indian Stamp Act 1899 as amended Madras Act of 1922
continued to be in operation in the parts of erstwhile Madras State, while the Telangana area
continued to be governed by the Hyderabad Stamp Act. After the formation of the state in


50
     See url: http://dor.gov.in/stampintro accessed on 06/02/2014.

157 | P a g e
1956, it was felt that the entire state should be brought under a single Stamp Act. This
resulted in the enactment of Indians Stamp (A.P. Extension and Amendment) Act, 1959 (VII
of 1959) by which the Indian Stamp Act was extended to the Telangana area.


The state of Andhra Pradesh too undertook many amendments so as to make changes in the
rates of stamp duty. The A.P. Act X of 1967 has revised the stamp duties in respect of certain
instruments and inserted Sec. 75-A, and substituted Sec. 78. The A.P. Act XXII of 1971
inserted Sec. 47- A and effected several amendments to the other provisions of the Act;
including Sch. I-A. The Sch. I-A, was finally replaced by A.P. Act XX of 1974. Further
amendments were undertaken by Act 17 of 1986, Act 1 of 1992, act 21 of 1995 etc. Further
amendments were brought in by A.P. Acts 31 of 1997, 8 of 1998, 14 of 1999, 16 of 2002, 8
of 2003 and 19 of 2005. In 1989 the state also passed the LA bill 14 of 1989.


The amendments brought in 1986 was crucial in augmenting the revenue of the state and the
main objective of this amendment was to enable the state to recover any deficit in the stamp
duty paid by the citizen at the time of payment of the stamp duty. Before this amendment, the
only way to recover the deficit in stamp duty was voluntary payment by the citizen. Before
1986, the stamp duty payable was same in spite of a difference in the location of the property.
It was estimated that the taxpaying capacity of the citizen is higher in urban area. Necessary
amendments were made to capture the increase in the property prices in urban areas and to
have different rates of stamp duty depending on the location of the property. The amendment
of 1989 was to increase the rate of stamp duty on items mentioned in schedule 1A keeping in
view of the inflation in the economy. The amendments brought through Act 21 of 1995 were
also to rationalise the rates of certain instruments mentioned under schedule 1A of Indian
Stamp Act 1899. Amendment of 1998 was brought to streamline and tighten the system and
arrest leakage of stamp revenue. A provision was inserted to make sure that any officer
appointed by the government can inspect the property and verify that no revenue is lost for
the government and all the facts affecting the chargeability of the instrument is verified.
Further it was felt necessary that the guideline values provided by the government to the
collector and the registering parties should be given some statutory backing.


Introduction of Section 47-A in Indian Stamp Act, 1899 :
A) In order to combat undervaluation and consequent evasion of stamp duty a new provision,
section 47-A, was introduced in the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, in its application to the State of
158 | P a g e
Andhra Pradesh. It is in force with effect from 16-08-1975. This Section is made applicable
to Conveyance, Exchange, Gifts, Partition and Settlement. According to this provision
whenever any document of above nature is presented for registration and if the Registration
Officer has reason to believe that true market value has not been set-forth, he shall send a
reference to the ‘Collector’ after registration. The ‘Collector’ in turn shall determine the
correct market value and recover the loss in stamp duty, if any. (A new amendment that the
document should be kept pending till the collector finalizes action under section 47-A is in
the offing. ‘Releases’ are also being included for this purpose under that Section)


B) According to Section 47-A of Indian Stamp Act, 1899, where a Sub-Registrar has reason
to believe that the market value of property involved in a document coming within the
purview of that section has not been truly set-forth, he has to take appropriate action. In order
to exercise his reasoning fairly and justly, without being capricious, he is equipped with
details of the values of properties, rural and urban, These values are fixed after elaborate
enquires, spot inspections, verification of Revenue and Municipal Records, previous
registration statics and detailed consultations with all those who were likely to be familiar
with values such as Revenue and Municipal Officials, Village officers, Panchayat Executive
Officers etc. After ascertaining the values as above they are noted in Registers intended for
both rural and urban areas which are known as “Basic Registers’. The Registering Officer
will consult these registers while determining the market value for documents presented
before him. The values in these registers are subject to revision from time to time.


c) As regards buildings and constructed portions, the Inspectors General of Registration and
Stamps provides the Registering Officers with guidelines based on nature of construction,
facilities available, age of the building etc., after getting the particulars from Roads and
Building Authorities. These guidelines are also revised from time to time. The Collector
authorized under Sec. 47-A of the Act after enquiry shall determine the market value.He shall
follow the Andhra Pradesh Stamp (Prevention of under valuation of Instruments) Rules, 1975
in determining the value of the properties


D) Market Value Scheme: its impact on Revenue Realization:
With a view to curb under valuation of properties on the part of the registering public the
“Market Value Scheme” was introduced w.e.f.16.08.1975 by introducing section 47-A in the
Indian Stamp Act, 1899 by Art.22 of 1971 under the provisions of section 47-A it is
159 | P a g e
mandatory on the part of the registering public to pay “Stamp Duty” on the prevailing Market
Value of the property as on the date of execution of the instrument in respect of conveyance
exchange, gift partition, settlement and release. In respect of instrument of sale, the stamp
duty is payable on the Market Value or consideration whichever is higher.


When the Market Value Scheme was first formulated Basic Registers containing the
prevailing Market Values were prepared and provided to the Registering Officers for
reference. The values furnished in the Basic Register were intended to be guidelines to the
registering public as well as the Sub-Registrars for assessing the stamp duty payable on the
instrument.But these basic registers were not having any legal status and the judiciary have
quite often commented on their not having legal status as the registers were prepared basing
on executive instructions. From 1975 to 1986 if a party does not agree with value of the basic
register, S.R used to register the document and then refer the same to the Collectors u/s. 47-A
for determination of Market Value. During 1975 to 1986, 1,48,417documents were referred
to the Collectors and all the cases were determined with an amount of Rs.23,80,34,496/-


In the year 1986 Stamp Act was amended and as per the amendment if the party disagree
with the basic value the Sub-Registrar may keep the document pending and refer the matter
to the Collector u/s. 47-A for determination.


E) Legal Status to Market Value Guidelines:
In the year 1998 through Act 8 of 1998 an amendment was made to the Stamp Act and
agreement relating to construction, development, sale of immovable property, power of
Attorney given for sale development were also brought under the ambit of section 47-A.
Moreover legal status was given to the Market Value Guidelines through the above
amendment to prepare guidelines by the Government from time to time.


If party has not adopted the Market Value Guidelines prepared by the Government Sub-
Registrar may keep the document pending but a condition was laid down to pay an amount
equal to 50% of the deficit stamp duty arrived at by the Sub-Registrar is deposited by the
party concerned.After determination by Collector if party prefers an appeal difference of
amount if any also has to be paid by the person after deducting the amount already deposited
by him.


160 | P a g e
F) Revision by the Inspector General:
Through Act14 of 1999 and Act 19 of 2005 suo-motu review powers were give to the IG on
the orders passed by the Collectors u/s. 47-A.


Rules and Guidelines
In the year 1975 rules were framed as prevention of under valuation rules to determine the
Market Value by the Collector u/s. 47-A (Copy annexed ).
Since the time of origin of Market Value Scheme in the year 1975 instructions / guidelines
were issued from time to time for revising the basic values on percentage basis and also after
field study and exercise by the departmental committees.As per the provisions u/s 47-A (8 of
1998) the Government have issued “A.P. Revision of Market Value Guidelines Rules, 1998”
vide GO MS No. 301 Revenue (Regn.I) Department, dt:04.05.1998.


Subsequently certain amendments were also made to the said rules (Copy annexed).Since
1975 structure rates were also prepared to assess the value of buildings.So far from 1975 to
2013 about 15 general revisions have taken palace.In the year 2010 major changes were made
to the structure and preparation of Market Value Guidelines. In rural areas village was taken
as unit and classification wise values were fixed like Dry, Wet, Garden and Sy.No. wise
values were fixed for the lands abutting National Highways, State high ways and Gardens fit
for house sites etc.In case of urban areas, area wise values for residential properties were
fixed by taking WARD – BLOCK – LOCALITY as unit and Door Number wise values were
fixed for commercial properties.


Classifications of properties were also reduced in rural areas from 28 to 8.Steps were taken to
reduce the number of slabs in values and there by enhanced minimum values. For the first
time composite value for the apartments was also fixed duly taking land and structure as
criteria and the same is being successfully implemented since 01.08.2010.In the year 2013
Floor wise composite values were proposed for commercial properties to match the realistic
values (ground, first and others). For the first time proposed values were put to public notice
through web and on the notice boards at Sub-Registrar Offices (SROs) to call for the
objections / suggestions and 301suggestions were received from the public 100 objections
were accepted fully and 44objections were sustained partially and 157 objections were
rejected.

Taxation Institutional analysis: The two major property tax assessment, levy and collection
departments are the Municipal administration Department and the Registration and Stamps
Department.


Municipal administration Department: There is a separate section/department in the
municipality for assisting the Commissioner in assessment of taxes, collection of taxes and to
make effective efforts for collection of taxes. The section/department consists of
   -    Deputy/Asst. Commissioner
   -    Revenue Officer
   -    Revenue Inspector
   -    Bill/Tax Collector




162 | P a g e
Registration and Stamps Department:
Organisation:
Secretariat Level: A separate Minister is holding the Registration and Stamps Department in
the State. Principal Secretary to Government is the Head in the Government level assisted by
one Joint Secretary, One Deputy Secretary and two Assistant Secretaries. There are 3
Sections that deal with matters related to the Department in the Secretariat.


State Level: Commissioner and Inspector General is the Head of the Department who acts as
Chief Controlling Revenue Authority (CCRA). The C&IG is assisted by 2 Additional I.Gs, 3
Joint IGs and 7 Assistant IGs.


Zonal Level: Deputy Inspector General is the Head of the Zonal administration which
consists of 1 or 2 districts usually. He is the appointing authority and disciplinary authority
for the Sub-Registrars and Senior Assistants. For administrative convenience 18 registration
zones are created in the State.


District Level: District Registrar(DR) is the Head of the District administration. He is the
overall in charge of the district administration. He is the appointing authority for Junior
Assistants and the other lower staff. The DR is the Registration authority for Societies and
Firms in the district. For administrative convenience 38 Registration Districts are created in
the 23 Revenue Districts in the State.


Sub District Level: There are 432 Sub-districts (Sub-Registrar offices) across the State. Each
Sub-district is headed by a Sub-Registrar. The Sub-Registrar registers the documents issues.
He is also the Registrar of Marriages under the Hindu marriages Act and Marriage Officer
under the Special Marriage Act.


In many countries separate authorities are created for land valuation and for titling. One of
the models that could be replicated in the country could be the Australian model which is
considered to be the ideal.

   4.7.2 Dimension wise analysis and scoring
LGI: 7.1      Transparency of valuations: valuations are based on clear
principles, applied uniformly, updated regularly, and publicly accessible.
Describe the process of fixing and revising land valuation.

7 1 1 There is a clear process of property valuation. SCORE: B - The assessment of
land/property for tax or compensation purposes reflects market prices, but there are 25-50%
differences between recorded values and market prices across different uses and types of
users; valuation rolls are updated regularly.

Analysis: The data shows that the taxation and valuation policies are not scientific and that
the valuation is often made on an adhoc basis mainly to increase revenues of government.
This has resulted in fixing the values in an arbitrary manner leading to creation of an artificial
inflation. They further observed that in the existing system there is no relation between the
rental value and the value fixed for taxation. They claimed that this is an arbitrary practice.
The valuations and taxations policy should be dynamic and be synchronized to the market
situations. The percentage of difference between recorded values and market prices would be
around 30 %.

7 1 2 Valuation rolls are publicly accessible. SCORE: A

Analysis: The score of A is considered suiting this indicator as given in the above analysis on
land valuation and taxation. There is a policy that valuation rolls be publicly accessible and
this policy is effective for all properties that are considered for taxation

LGI: 7.2 Collection efficiency: land and property taxes are collected and the yield
from doing so exceeds collection cost

7 2 1 Exemptions from property taxes payment are justified and transparent. SCORE: C:

Analysis: Exemptions given are not always transparent and not applied in a consistent
manner. Hence the exemptions to the payment of land/property taxes are not always clearly
based on equity or efficiency grounds and are not always applied in a transparent and
consistent manner. Detailed analysis has been given in the chapter above

7 2 2 All property holders liable to pay property tax are listed on the tax roll. SCORE A

Analysis: The properties liable for payment of taxes are listed in the records of the concerned
authorities, like municipalities and gram panchayats. And taxation authorities do have the tax
rolls with all property holders recorded there in. Hence more than 80% of property holders
liable for land/property tax are listed on the tax roll

7 2 3 Assessed property taxes are collected. SCORE: A –

Analysis: The collection efficiency is more than 80%. Hence more than 80% of assessed
land/property taxes are collected. Details have been given in the chapter.

164 | P a g e
7 2 4 Receipts from property tax exceed the cost of collection. Score: A

Analysis: The panellists observed that tax collection is quite prompt in Hyderabad. But it is
not true for all the municipalities. It was agreed by consensus that the amount of property tax
collected exceeds the cost of staff by a factor of more than 5. Hence, the amount of property
taxes collected exceeds the cost of staff in charge of collection by a factor of more than 5.

           the access              by   revisions should not be

    4.8     Dispute resolution

    4.8.1 Panel specific context
Black’s Law Dictionary defines ‘land’ to mean : In the most general sense, comprehends
any ground, soil or earth whatsoever, including rocks. ‘Land’ may include any estate or
interest in lands, either legal or equitable, as well as easements and incorporeal
hereditaments. Different legislations in the State of Andhra Pradesh, define ‘land’
contextually according to intendment and purport therein. The same have been discussed
extenstively in the context of the earlier chapters. For legal purposes the various definitions
come into play based on the conxt of litigation and dispute.


Rights on land: The rights attached to the land can be broadly categorized as under :
   i)      Absolute Rights: Absolute Right envisages the right to possess, enjoy, alienate in
           any manner, destroy etc in the manner in which the owner/ holder of the property
           likes.
   ii)     Limited Rights: Limited Rights restrict the enjoyment of land by the holder of the
           property according to the terms of vesting or settlement.
   iii)    Common Rights: Common Rights are enjoyable by community at large and the
           beneficiaries are floating.
   iv)     Customary Rights: Customary Rights are acquired by way of long usage and as per
           custom prevalent in the area.
   v)      Contingent Rights: Contingent rights are acquired depending upon the happening
           of certain events.
Modes of acquisition of right to the land: Every right involves title and source from which
it is derived. The title is defective antecedent of which the right is a dejure consequent. A
title is defined by Sir Edward Coke, titulus est justa causa possidendi id quod nostrum est; or,
it is the means whereby the owner of lands has the just possession of his property. Titles are
of two kinds, being either original (de-novo) or derivative (transitory). The original title are
those which create a right de-novo. The derivative title are those which transfer rights to a
new owner.As the facts confer rights, so they take them away. All the rights are perishable
and transient. The facts, which confer rights called investitive facts. And the facts which
cause the loss of rights called the divestitive facts.




166 | P a g e
The right to the land may be by virtue of an Instrument (i.e. proprietary right) or by
possession (i.e. prescriptive right or right by adverse possession). In Telangana area, the
Settlement Land Records were prepared under Chapter-VII of the A.P. (Telangana Area)
Land Revenue Act, 1317 Fasli, and called Sethwar & Wasool Baqui and held to be the
document of title of a owner. 51 In Andhra area, settlement records are prepared by A.P.
Survey and Boundaries Act, 1923 and called Diglot.


Land Disputes: Land conflict can be defined as a social fact in which at least two parties are
involved, the roots of which are different interests over the property rights to land: the right to
use the land, to manage the land, to generate an income from the land, to exclude others from
the land, to transfer it and the right to compensation for it. A land conflict, therefore, can be
understood as a misuse, restriction or dispute over property rights to land.52 Thus one can say
that a dispute arises when there is a threat to any of the rights attached to land listed above.


Land Dispute typology: The Land conflicts may be between two Private individuals or
between Private individual/s or the Government. The companies, registered societies/ bodies
and deities are treated as Individual Juristic person. Land conflicts are likely to arise under
the following circumstances.
          i)         Title
          ii)        Identity of the land.
          iii)       Boundaries of the land.
          iv)        Inheritance / succession.
          v)         Partition.
          vi)        Possession and enjoyment.
          vii)       Community Rights.
          viii)      Administration & Management
          ix)        Enforcement of agreements relating to land (Specific performances)
          x)         Payment of Compensation for Acquired land
          xi)        Claims as regards to charged property
          xii)       Claims as regards to limited rights like easements, fishing etc.

Formal Dispute Resolution Forums:             The formal forums for adjudication of disputes
are: i) Civil Courts; ii) Special Tribunals/ Revenue Courts constituted under the Special
Enactments. As regards of disputes of civil nature, normally the adjudication of the disputes
are done by the civil courts. The Civil Courts in State of Andhra Pradesh were constituted
under the AP Civil Courts Act, 1972. The provisions of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 and
A.P. Civil Rules of practice govern the procedure in respect of civil suits.


Under the Special Enactments, independent forums for adjudication of disputes arising
thereunder are created and their jurisdiction is mutually exclusive. Some of the special
enactments expressly excluded the jurisdiction of civil courts.


Thus in State of Andhra Pradesh, it can be said that the jurisdiction of each of the
adjudicatory authorities are well defined and wherever the power is conferred on an authority
to adjudicate the dispute falling within special enactments, jurisdiction of other forums is
excluded in order to prohibit the parties to indulge in forum shopping.


The following table attempts to capture the Enactments, which provide forums having
exclusive jurisdiction over the subject matters of the disputes arising there under and
provision for appeal/ revision and period for filing of case.

While attempts to obtain data regarding court cases pending at different levels did not bear
fruit, however the Chief Judge City Civil Court, Hyderabad has furnished certain data
which is thus: –

1.    Proportion of Land Dispute Cases to other cases in the last ten years 223

2.    No. of Land related disputes that are settled in the first instance 2114
      Court itself and the period taken for such resolution               2 years
3.    No. of pending land conflicts; total pending cases                  10514


Taking this information into account and estimating the pendency of cases in all the district
courts as well as the high court one may conclude that the pendency of cases involving land
are substantial. The field level experience of SERP which attempted to capture data regarding
land related disputes concerning the rural poor (SC’s) also shows that the pendency is huge
and with legal counselling and assistance, a lot of cases can be avoided from being taken to
the courts.

applicable legal matters, and decisions can be appealed against.


811There is clear assignment of responsibility for conflict resolution. SCORE: A -

Analysis: There are no parallel avenues for conflict resolution or if parallel avenues exist,
responsibilities are clearly assigned and widely known and explicit rules for shifting from one
to the other are in place to minimise the scope for forum shopping. The reaons for the same
are given in the above analysis.


812 Conflict resolution mechanisms are accessible to the public. SCORE: A

Analysis: Even under the special enactments, the adjudicatory authorities are available locally
and are accessible to aggrieved parties. Hence institutions for providing first instance of
conflict resolution are accessible at the local level in the majority of communities.


813 Mutually accepted agreements reached through informal dispute resolution systems
are encouraged. SCORE: A

Analysis: The panellists felt that the informal disputes may be termed as non judicial and
non- Quasi Judicial. It was felt that whatever decision is arrived at, it must get formal
recognition by law. The panellists were of the opinion that there was no need for additional
forums, as it would be a waste of resources. There is a need to make the existing
mechanisms more efficient. It was suggested that the Lok Adalat system may be introduced
compulsorily in every adjudication process relating to land disputes. It was also mentioned
that it was important for categorization of cases and simple cases relating to land boundary
disputes or recording of pattadars etc. can be quickly disposed off through convenient,
expeditious and cost-effective process. The score of A that had been given was unanimously
agreed to.


8.1.4 There is an accessible, affordable and timely process for appealing disputed rulings.
SCORE: C

Analysis: Limitations to file appeals and revisions, the EI and panelists agreed that the
options given which talk about dispute resolution in timely manner as well. Except AP Land
Grabbing (Prohibition) Act, 1982, no enactment stipulates time limit for disposal . Hence it
was agreed that Score of C may be appropriate. Accordingly score C was given.


8.2.1 Land disputes constitute a small proportion of cases in the formal legal system.
SCORE: C

Analysis: While there is no statistical data available for all the courts with the panel, it was
opined that more than 50% cases are related to land disputes. This assessment was made on
approximation basis, taking to consideration the field experience of the panelists.


8.2.2 Conflicts in the formal system are resolved in a timely manner. SCORE: D

Analysis: The EI stated that there were several reasons for delay in disposal of cases like
vacancy in appointments of judge etc. A panellist, Retd. Justice also felt that delays can be
curbed if the judicial officers take more interest in the expeditious disposal of the cases.
Another panellist, an Advocate suggested that to curb the litigations, it is necessary to reduce
the stamp duty and registration charges so as to encourage the common public to obtain
proper title documents. It was also suggested that whenever registration is done, the phodi or
subdivision of survey number should be made compulsory and there should be exclusive
authority for the adjudication of revenue and land related matters. Another panelits, MRO
suggested for the reintroduction of Jamabandi for construction of perfect title records relating
to land. The panel unanimously agreed for the score of D as it was felt that the delays do exist
and affect the disposal of cases in a timely manner.

823There are few long-standing (> 5 years) land conflicts. SCORE: D




175 | P a g e
Analysis: While no data is available relating to pending cases in all the courts as regards land
conflicts, all the panelists opined that the share of long-standing land conflicts is greater than
20% of the total pending land disputes in courts. Hence all agreed upon Score of D.

Conclusion
Every enactment has specifically provided time within which claims, appeals and revisions
are to be filed. The maximum period of limitation provided under the special enactments is
90 days and minimum period is 30 days except in case of civil suits which are governed by
the Limitation Act, 1963 and the suits arising under the AP Surveys and Boundaries Act,
1923, where the limitation prescribed is 3 years. Wherever limitation is not provided under
special enactments, the courts have held that it should be brought within a reasonable time-
reasonable time being 3 months. Therefore, there exists a process for disposing disputes in a
timely manner.


Informal dispute resolution mechanisms : Informal dispute resolution mechanisms are
those which are non-judicial and non-quasi judicial in the sense that the adjudication of the
disputes is not done by a Judiciary/ by a Quasi Judicial Authority under any Act. The
informal dispute resolutions are in vogue in the State of AP since ages. Normally, in villages,
the disputes are being taken to village elders or community elders for resolution. The verdict
if accepted, the dispute is not carried any further. In cases where the verdict is not accepted
by any of the parties to the dispute, it shall be adjudicated by taking the matters to civil court
or the forums provided under the special enactments.
A provision is made under the amended provisions of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 for
resolution of disputes by informal means. Section 89 of CPC contemplates that where it
appears to the court that there exists an element of settlement which may be acceptable to
parties, the court shall formulate the terms of settlement and give them to the parties for their
observation and also refer the same for

     a) arbitration
     b) Conciliation
     c) Judicial settlement including settlement through Lok Adalats
     d) Mediation

Order XXIII of CPC enables a party to withdraw the suit. In case of compromise, the parties
may report the same to the court for recording the compromise. Order XXIII, Rule 3
mandates the court that in cases where it is alleged by one party and denied by the other that

176 | P a g e
the adjustment of satisfaction has been arrived at, the courts shall decide the question
forthwith without granting adjournment.


Therefore it can be said that there is a local, informal dispute resolution system that resolves
significant number of conflicts in an effective and equitable manner and which is recognized
in the formal judicial or administrative dispute resolution system.

Revenue Administration and Land Management in AP

During the pre-independence period the state has been ruled by the British and the Nizam in
the Coastal region and Telangana respectively which had their imprint on the administration
respective areas. When the erstwhile state of Andhra Pradesh was formed in 1956 an
Integrated Board of Revenue was formed that also had inherited the functions and powers of
Hyderabad Board also. However in the year 1977 the Board of Revenue was replaced by
Commissioners in consonance with A.P. Board of Revenue (Replacement by Commissioners)
Act, 1977. 54 In the year 1999 Commissioner Land Revenue was re-designated as Chief
Commissioner of Land Administration (CCLA).55 Structure of revenue administration in the
state is shown in the diagram that follows.

property in Andhra Pradesh are handled by Revenue, Survey and Registration Departments
and Local bodies. The Revenue Department maintains ownership and possession records
(pahani/adangal, RoR, khatauni etc.) pertaining mainly to collection of land revenue. The
Survey Department maintains graphical records (village maps/tippons/FMBs) and textual
records (sethwar/diglott, RSR register). Only the title record i.e., the Adangal / Pahani in
A.P, has been computerized but not the graphical record i.e., the parcel map and the
village map which are also equally important for up-to-date maintenance of land
records. The Registration Department keeps land transaction records in the form of deeds
executed on stamp paper (sale, purchase, gift). And these are computerized in recent years.
Local bodies maintain property registers, primarily for collection of taxes. 56. However an
Integarted computerized                  database       is    not        available   with   the   three   departments
participating in the maintenance of land records.

Land Survey and Records: In Andhra Pradesh, the last survey of land records was done in
1920. Since then not much change is done in terms of records updation. Out of about 5
million land parcels, 49% of tippons are in good condition while the others are in torn
conditions. Due to improper and defective land records, it is estimated that 2% of rural, 5% of
urban and 28% of semi urban areas are embroiled in lands disputes and never-ending
litigation. As per the data available in the Survey Dept the pendency in individual survey is
23% during 2013.

Detailed Town Survey of some Municipalities and Survey of streets in some Panchayats were
done in Andhra Region. The detailed Town Survey in Municipalities and street Survey in
Panchayats will be done only when the Municipalities are prepared to pay 2/3rd cost of survey
and Panchayats are prepared to pay 1/3rd cost of survey and resolutions are passed to that
effect and sent to the Director of Settlements, Survey and Land Records. This survey was
done only in a few Municipalities and Panchayats. Out of 130 towns in the State, only about
30 towns have been surveyed till date. There are simply no survey records for the other
towns.


In respect of Telangana region, detailed Town Survey of the twin cities only was done in
1966-70 57 . SaadaBainama (or Plain Paper Transactions)is one of the most predominant

illegal yet prevalent practices prevailing in entire Andhra Pradesh where the poor farmers
purchase lands from land owners and extended on plain paper. This aspect has been dealt
with extensively under panel 6.

   4.9.2 Dimension wise analysis and scoring


LGI 9.1.1: Land policy formulation, implementation and arbitration are separated to avoid
conflict of interest. SCORE: A

Analysis: There was a consensus about the earlier scoring A. Panelists observed that there is
no comprehensive state-wide policy but there exists individual department policies He
suggested for setting up separate state-wide body with Chief Secretary as the head to
formulate land policies and ensure implementation. In situations that can entail conflicts of
interest or are sensitive to abuse (Eg. Transfers of land rights), there is a clear separation in
the roles of policy formulation, implementation and arbitration.

LGI 9.1.2: Responsibilities of ministries and agencies dealing with land do not overlap
(horizontal overlap). SCORE: B

Analysis: The panel had a general agreement that there could be slight overlaps of agencies
dealing with the land. The mandated responsibilities of the various authorities dealing with
land administration issues are defined with a limited amount of overlap with those of other
land sector agencies but there are few problems.

LGI 9.1.3: Administrative (vertical) overlap is avoided. SCORE: A

Analysis: The Expert Investigator pointed out that various departments having lands under
their control are responsible for the administration of their lands. Hence there is no
overlapping in administration of land-related responsibilities between different levels of
administration and government. The panel consented for the initial score Assignment of land-
related responsibilities between the different levels of administration and government is clear
and non-overlapping.

LGI 9.1.4: Land right and use information is shared by public bodies; key parts are
regularly reported on and publicly accessible. SCORE: B

Analysis: The panel has opined that the Information related to rights in land is available to
interested institutions and altogether this information is available at reasonable cost, it is not
readily accessible as the information is not maintained in a uniform way.

The participants in the panel discussion observed that the new initiatives like Webland is
helping in the accessibility of land related documents but still they are not giving open access
to the public. All information cannot be accessed by the common man directly, for that they
need to give special request to the authority. Hence the panel agreed that information related
to rights in land is available to interested institutions and although this information is

185 | P a g e
available at reasonable cost, it is not readily accessible as the information is not maintained in
a uniform way.

LGI 9.1.5: Overlaps of rights (based on tenure typology) are minimal and do not cause
friction or dispute. SCORE: C

Analysis: The legal framework and procedure for land-related matters (incl. renewable and
subsoil resources) are fully consistent but there may be differences in the way complaints and
grievance redress are handled.

The discussants completely agreed upon the fact that there are many overlaps in the rights
and also pointed out that how these rights are creating frictions between the parties is a very
important concern. The panel discussed the fact that in a parcel of land if minerals are
observed the land owner does not get the rights over the minerals. He has rights only to take
crops. This leads to disputes. The Legal framework and procedures for land-related matters
(incl. renewable and subsoil resources) deal with land-related matters very differently but
have functioning mechanisms for redressing overlap in place.

LGI 9.1.6: Ambiguity in institutional mandates (based on Institutional map) does not
cause problems. SCORE: B

Analysis: With minor exceptions, the processes applied by public institutions dealing with
land are fully integrated and consistent.

LGI 9.2.1: Land Policies and regulations are developed in a participatory manner
involving all relevant stakeholders. SCORE: C

Analysis: The panel opined that there is no comprehensive land policy and those decisions
that affect some sections of the community are made without prior consultation. Policy exists
or can be inferred by the existing legislation but it is incomplete (some key aspects are
missing or only covers part of the country such as only urban or only rural areas) and
decisions that affect some sections of the community are made without prior consultation.

LGI 9.2.2: Land Policies address equity and poverty reduction goals progress onwards
these is publicly monitored. SCORE: C

Analysis: The panelists stated that most land legislations enacted have a pro-poor and equity
bias. However, the implementation of these laws is indifferent and incomplete. Land policies
incorporate some equity and poverty objectives but these are not regularly and meaningfully
monitored.

LGI 9.2.3: Land policies address ecological and environmental goals, progress towards
these is publicly monitored. SCORE: C

Analysis: The existing land policies incorporate some ecology and environmental principles
into consideration but these are not monitored regularly and in a meaningful way. Land
policies incorporate some ecology and environmental sustainability objectives but these are
not regularly and meaningfully monitored.

186 | P a g e
LGI 9.2.4: The implementation of land policy is costed, matched with benefits and
adequately resourced. SCORE: C

Analysis: The implementation of land policy is not fully costed and/or to implement the
policy there are serious inadequacies in at least one area of budget, resources or institutional
capacity. The implementation of land policy is not fully costed and/or to implement the
policy there are serious inadequacies in at least one area of budget, resources or institutional
capacity.

LGI 9.2.5: There is regular and public reporting indicating progress in policy
implementation. SCORE: C

Analysis: The EI explained that in the state there is system of periodical reporting of land
related issues in the legislature as well as before standing committee during budget sessions,
however it is not monitored and tracked in a proper way. The panel consented for the initial
score C (C: Formal land institutions report on land policy implementation but in a way that
does not allow meaningful tracking of progress across different areas or in a sporadic way.)

LGI 9.2.6: Land policies help to improve land use by low- income groups and those who
experienced injustice. SCORE: B

Analysis: The EI stated that there are different schemes to assign lands and house sites to land
less poor to improve their livelihood, however the execution part is not effective. Policy is in
place to improve access to and productive use of assets by poor and marginalized groups, is
applied in practice, but is not effective.

LGI 9.2.7: Land policies proactively and effectively reduce future disaster risk. SCORE: D

Analysis: There is no policy in place to prevent settlement in high risks areas or anticipated
future risks.

           possible for simultaneous updation of database.
           Gram Sabhas should be involved in survey
           operations and should be main agency for
           ground truth. Mutations in undisputed cases
           should be done by Gram Sabha at local level.

   9.11                                                       There is need for codification of existing land related laws which are

   9.13    Land subdivisions (Land parcels) are the most
           frequent land disputes which can be settled by
           using latest EST and GIS technologies which
           can reduce the cost of survey and settlements.
           Similarly technology can play very effective
           role in accessing the documents and clearances
           required for settling the land issues. Karnataka
           has successfully used the IT platform to
           improve the access to services by making the
           information on survey and registrations
           available at the doorstep of the beneficiaries.

   9.15                                                       There is a dire need to build up the capacities of tahsildars/MROs using
                                                              latest Technology and skills for quick disposal of revenue work.

     5 GOOD PRACTICES OF LAND GOVERNANCE IN THE STATE


 Enactment of Inam Abolition Act:
 In the post-independence era The Andhra Pradesh (Telangana Area) Inam Abolition Act,
1955 and The Andhra Pradesh Inams (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Act 1956 are
one of the most proactive Acts which came into existence in the country as part of the land
reforms. Under these Acts the Inamdaris were abolished and in turn pattas were granted to the
individual ryots who were under cultivation of the land.

Implementation of Jagir Abolition Act:
Under the Hyderabad (Abolition of Jagirs) Regulation of 1949 read with Hyderabad Jagirs
(Commutation) Regulation of 1950) all the jagirs numbering 951 and covering an area of
approximately 12,000 square miles have been abolished. The total estimated compensation
for abolition of Jagirs in Telangana area is Rs.1,078 lakhs58.

Tenancy Law in Telangana
In the Telangana Area, a very progressive reform undertaken was to grant ownership rights to
protected tenants under section 38 E of the Tenancy Act. In no other state were tenants
conferred with ownership rights. The policy and the practice of awarding the tenancts rights
are not fool proof and are informal. As per the KRR report “almost 100% of tenants continue
on informal tenancy”. A survey undertaken in Andhra area for the KRR committee report
also shows the same results.

Distribution of Government land for agriculture purpose and for house
sites

Andhra Pradesh is the first State in the country to distribute the largest extent of land to the
landless poor in the recent years. The State Government which began land distribution to the
landless poor from 1955 onwards and has achieved a figure of 39.25 lakh acres till 2004.
From 2004-2013, Andhra Pradesh registered                                disbursement of a total of 7,75,451
acres to 5,49,934 beneficiaries out of which 1,77,895 acres distributed to 1,53,341 SCs and
2,41,729 acres distributed to 1,35,169 STs. The Andhra Pradesh government has created a

  Implementation of Land Reforms A Review by the Land Reforms Implementation Committee of the
National Development Council, Planning Commission, Government of India, New Delhi, August, 1966:
Report submitted by Shri Ameer Raza, Joint Secretary, Planning Commission on implementation of Land Reforms in Andhra Pradesh
record in distribution of land in 6 phases from 2004 to 201359. State Government had since
2004 spent a sum of Rs.599 crore under the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF)
schemes to develop and bring under cultivation 3.49 lakh acres of land distributed to the
landless poor. Further the land distributed to landless poor is linked up with NREGS
programme to transform the lands cultivable60.


Besides the distribution of land for agricultural purpose, Government of AP has undertaken
the distribution of house sites to landless poor as one of the most important programme. The
Revenue Department takes up the acquisition part whereas the Social Welfare Department
provides the budget for acquisition of the house sites. Houses were constructed on these sites
under a programme called INDIRAMMA (IAY). Since 1957 to 2006 an extent of 3.57 lakh
acres of land has been acquired and distributed to 79.45 lakh families. Under INDIRAMMA
(IAY) programme from 2006-07 to 2012-13 a total of 35722 acres of land was acquired and
distributed to7.68 lakh families61.


Enactment off AP Assigned Lands (Prohibition of Transfer) Act, 1977

Government of AP has enacted The Andhra Pradesh Assigned lands (Prevention and
Transfer) Act – the POTA Act in 1977 with an objective of preventing the lands or house
sites assigned by the Government to the landless poor by selling or transferring to others.


Land Grabbing (Prohibition) Act, 1982

To curb the actions of grabbing the land belonging to the government, local authority, a
religious or charitable institution or endowment, including wakf or any other private person
by unlawful persons individually or by groups, Government of AP has enacted Land
Grabbing (Prohibition) Act, 1982. The most important provisions of this Act are (1)
redelivery of the Grabbed land to the owner; (2) Compensation and 3) cost of redelivery U/s .
7-A (5) and 8(7). GOAP had constituted a Special Court at state level with powers of a Civil
Court for speedy processing of land grabbing cases and this special court has the powers to
award compensation by the land grabber to the lawful owner.

Regularization of encroachments on Government lands:
Government of AP regularized the unauthorized unobjectionable occupations of Government
land i.e., encroachments from time to time in a regular manner. In case of poor persons,
encroachment will be regularized and the land allotted at free of cost. Persons above poverty
line, land will be given on payment of market value, surcharge, etc. GO Ms Nos 515, 631,
166 of Revenue Department are some such instances in recent times.

Regularization of Unauthorized layouts:
Government of AP had introduced Layout Regularization Scheme which is intended to help
the people by bringing the unapproved layouts into the planning fold by getting them
regulated and to enable them to get building permission. GOAP had framed certain rules and
issued series of GOs from time to time to regularize the unapproved layouts by paying some
penalty. 1) G.O. Ms.No.902; 2) G.O. Ms.No.113; 3) G.O. Ms.No.880 and; 4) G.O.
Ms.No.589, of MA& UD department contain the details of the scheme.


The scheme is applicable to the plots in unapproved layouts which are located within Urban
Development Authority Area, Municipalities, Municipal Corporations and Gram Panchayats
falling in Master plan limits of respective Municipalities in Andhra Pradesh. It is applicable
to the plots in unapproved layouts which are registered prior to 31.12.2007 i.e. date of
notification of the Rules in A.P Gazette. LRS is not applicable to Encroachment on
Government Lands, Surplus land declared under Urban Land Ceiling Regulation Act/
Agriculture Land Ceiling Act / Land resumed under A.P Assigned lands (POT) Act, Tank
beds and Sikham Lands, Areas Covered under G.O.Ms No 111 MA&UD, etc.



Loan and Other Benefits Eligibility Cards (LEC):

The Koneru Ranga Rao Land Committee has recommended to issue Loan Eligibility Cards to
the tenants on their self declaration only. By accepting the committee’s recommendation t o
protect and extend support to the tenants, Govt of AP has promulgated an Ordinance which
was enacted as AP Licensed Cultivators Act, 2011.


As per the Act the licensed cultivator shall be entitled to enter his name in the register for
loan and other benefits. On such entry in the records, he/she is entitled for Loan Eligibility
and other Benefits. The Loan Eligibility Cards (LEC) are issued for a period of one year and


193 | P a g e
renewed thereafter. It can be said that government have taken a bold initiative to protect the
tenant farmers by issuing LEC cards. Despite many hurdles it enabled the tenants to access
credit from Banks and other financial institutions to some extent.



Bhoobharathi programme :
Due to difficulties in land survey and land records the citizens are facing problems in
protecting their properties or obtaining quality services from the government agencies. To
resolve these issues for the first time in India, a pilot project called the Integrated Land
Information System ILIS - BhooBharati was started in Nizamabad district vide G O No 158
Rev dt 28.1.05. The key features of this project are Providing Conclusive titles, Title
registration, Integration of services & creation of a single and dedicated Agency, Digitization
& Auto updation, Self-sustaining Revenue model.

   1) Conclusive titles: Emphasis has been given to bring the paradigm shift in land
       administration from regulatory and revenue collecting system to one that gave a clear
       and conclusive title to all rural and urban properties.
   2) Title registration: So far in India the registrations take place for the documents of
       deeds of the properties. But the project aimed to register the titles of the deeds which
       will ensure the legal authenticity of the property. The registrar should verify the titles
       of the transferor before the registration takes place. The crux of the system is that only
       the legal owner will be entitled to transfer the property.
   3) Integration of services & creation of a single & dedicated Agency: The present system
       of multiple Government departments maintaining land records would be replaced by a
       single dedicated agency, which will create, maintain and deliver all property related
       services
   4) Digitization & Auto updation: All records will be maintained in digital form and
       processes will be designed in such a way that as the transactions occur, records will be
       updated automatically. Entire data will be maintained in a central repository.
   5) Self-sustaining Revenue model: User charges would be introduced for any revenue
       service provided to citizens to make it a self sustaining body.

This system also would provide the services like
      Information Services
      Document Issue Services


194 | P a g e
            Transaction Services
            Other Services

The Information Services provides the citizens the information on Title search, Transaction
history, Map search, Document Search, Building and Layout Plans, Land Use, Crop
Information, Market Valuation.
Under Document Information Services, Bhoo Bharati would provide the certificates like Title
Certificate, Land Parcel Map, Land Use Certificate, Adangal Certificate (Crop Information)
Market Valuation Certificate, Map/ Layout Plan Extracts of Archived Documents, etc.
Transaction Services are those services which lead to a change in the records of
Bhoo Bharati.
Under this project entire Nizamabad district is planned to be resurveyed using latest survey
technologies like Aerial Photogrammetry, Electronic Total Station and DGP followed by
enquiry and recording of conclusive title. The entire process covers agricultural, residential
and communal lands both in rural and urban areas. The entire records would be surveyed and
computerized, revenue and registration services could be delivered through a single window
system which will facilitate easy access to reliable land records. So far agricultural land in
922 villages covering an area of 13,83,537 acres was re-surveyed. Out of 8,79,792 Land
Parcel Maps (LPMs) generated, around 8,77.718 were distributed to the land owners. The
aerial photography of entire district of Nizamabad covering 6690 Sq. Kms(6300 Sq. Kms. in
rural area and 390 Sq. Kms. in urban area) out of a total of about 8,000 sq.kms area was
completed. At present updation and incorporations of corrections suggested by the field level
team in test check reports of 239 villages are being taken up.62

   2. Under the LA Act GoAP adopted a system of consent awards which has reduced
       litigation considerably. Committee at district level and also at state level negotiates
       with the land holders on quantum of compensation.
   3. AP is also known for Single Window Clearance Mechanism with deemed clearances.
       Perhaps AP is the first state to institutionalize this through an Act in 2002.

MeeSeva Project:

Given its larger vision of creating an IT enabled citizen centric governance framework, the
Government of Andhra Pradesh launched the MeeSeva initiative in November 2011.
MeeSeva is an integrated service delivery model for providing government services to
citizens through \'one-stop\' centres. MeeSeva in its current state has evolved from Andhra
Pradesh\'s other e-governance initiatives like eSeva, APOnline, and the Common Service
Centres (CSCs)established under the National e-Governance Plan. Though these centres
eased the process of paying utility bills, the citizens of Andhra Pradesh had to make many
rounds of concerned government departments to acquire the different government documents.
During this process citizens became prey to touts and agents who would harass them in return
of a promise to get them the desired documents on time. Further, the processing of
applications in concerned departments was done manually by verifying various paper records.
This entire process was highly time-consuming. Under this system the absence of a stipulated
time-frame for service delivery and any system of monitoring citizen requests resulted in a
lack of transparency in government functioning. In order to address these continuing
problems in service delivery, MeeSeva was launched to seamlessly integrate service delivery
in the state from end to end, using web based architecture for linking databases across
departments. The objective of MeeSeva is as follows:
      To electronically provide services to citizens in a convenient, efficient and timely
       manner through a web based application.
      To bring service delivery to the doorsteps of citizens by establishing a wide network
       of MeeSeva centres
      To enhance transparency and accountability in the functioning of government
       departments by digitizing records and enabling day to day monitoring through
       electronic reports.
      To build an end-to-end integrated electronic service delivery eco-system and bring the
       government and citizens closer


196 | P a g e
MeeSeva was implemented in Andhra Pradesh by adopting the following steps:
         Establishing a legal framework with the passing of the Andhra Pradesh Information
          Technology (Electronic Service Delivery, ESD) Rules, 2011
         Building a stakeholder network between the implementing agencies, appointing AP
          Online as the technology provider, signing Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with
          participating departments and converging existing service delivery channels/kiosks
         Digitization of government records
         Technology development and integration of front-end and back-end applications
         Categorization of services into those that require backend processing and those that
          don't
         Issuance of MeeSeva guidelines to address for logistical preparation of service
          delivery centres.
As of now there are 295 services provided through MeeSeva spread across 29 departments.
Citizens can pay a minimal service fee at the MeeSeva counters to avail these services.

Computer Aided Administration of Registration Department (CARD) – It is a decentralized
and simple digital property registration system. It expedites the registration process, provides
certificates and helps in market valuation of properties.64

Registry on village walls-Taking information to the people:
Almost always the discourse about information in public domain has veered around
computerisation of land registry and
placing them in a web enabled platform
.While there is absolutely no taking way
the criticality and importance of such an
exercise and indeed it must be said that it
is a very essential step for any kind of
good governance. However what we
understand as placing information in
public domain is not the millions of poor
understand in the villages. For them unfortunately a computerised data base ,while it does if
the system is standardised enough (like it is in most parts of the country) gives them a

guarantee of delivery of certain records ,it still does not imply understanding of or
accessibility of land registry.


In district of Warangal in        the years of 2011-12 and 2012-13 an exercise of taking
information to the people i.e., placing the land registry in public domain in the true sense was
taken up with some very stunning results. The district administration with an objective of (i)
cleansing and updating land records whereby the entries reflect the field reality faithfully (ii)
ensure easy and timely access of revenue records to the public, and (iii) to establish
transparent system of maintaining and updation land records, has taken up work in the
following four phases-


PHASE-I-Desk level updation:
Details available with the Tahsildar / Revenue Divisional Officers / District Collector /
Special Collector, LA, SRSP & JCR GLIP, Commissioner, Endowments and Wakf
authorities were updated in the pahanies at the desk level. Mutation by means of assignment
/ alienation / Land acquisition / Endowments / Wakf in the district were also done. A special
mutation week was conducted, wherein applications were invited from the public for
mutation. (Approximately 50,000 applications were received).
PHASE – II – Field updation by holding Gram/Ward Sabhas:-
In each mandal, 2 to 3 special teams were constituted with the VROs / RIs / Tahsildar who
have updated the pahanies by holding Grama sabhas / Ward sabhas at the village and
habitation level. While taking into the consideration of claims and objections, the special
team has also inspected the fields wherever required and the pahani updated in the owner and
occupier columns.      The applications for mutations were also enquired into. The above
exercise was carried out in two rounds with a gap of 2 weeks.


PHASE – III – Computerization of updated pahani:-
All the computers of Tahsildars’ offices were pooled at divisional level for computerization
of the updated pahanies.


PHASE–IV: Holding of gramsabhas to freeze the record for the year 2008-09:-
The village pahani has been published and after the statutory time reading out the same in the
village chavadi by the Tahsildar in a Grama sabha has been done and the pahanies frozen.


198 | P a g e
PHASE-V: Counters at Tahsildar offices for issue of Revenue records across the counter: -
‘BHOOMI’ counters have been set up in each of the tahsildar offices for issue of
computerized copies of land records at all Tahsildars’ offices across the counter. Till date
about 4 lakh computer pahanies have been issued to the farmers. Pattadar Pass Books are
also being issued online.


The system of issue of computer pahanies ensured ready access of land records to farmers.
Still it was observed that the land record was not completely updated –at times due to local
political pressure at times due to
negligence. However a deeper and a
more pernicious issue that belies any
effort made in the direction of an
updated land record is the issue of
the insecure land rights of the poor.
A significant percentage of the poor
are not legal owners of the land that
they till, which means that their
names do not find entries as land owners (or even as occupants in most cases) in the land
records. This leaves them outside the network of state programs like institutional funding,
crop insurance etc. Ensuring land rights to the poor is a set of administrative processes that
need to be taken up under different Land Acts, an exercise which is being carried out in
Warangal. Two major impediments exist in doing this - on one hand the ignorance of the
poor people on the modalities of getting their name into the ‘occupant and owner ‘and indeed
on the whole aspect of ‘getting the ownership of land’ and on the other the natural inclination
of the functionaries within the system to hold onto (and worse deny) information as a means
of power.


Placing of land records in public domain would be an important step to address the above
mentioned issues. An exercise of painting the 7 important columns of the pahanis (including
survey number, total extent of land, name of owner, names of occupants, extents etc.,) on the
village walls was carried out. Subsequent to the painting gramsabhas were conducted. In the
gramsabhas several farmers filed applications for correction of pahani entries. While there
was angst and protests amongst those whose names was not featured as owners/occupants on
the whole the villagers welcomed the move to place land record details in public domain.
199 | P a g e
Such a public display increased awareness of public and generated discussion and debate
about the land ownership details, whereabouts of government land etc and ensured that
people demanded for their rights and entitlements and forced the revenue administration to
correct the record. Against the backdrop of the public information, land literacy became
meaningful and relevant. This is truly information in the public domain.

3). Bhoomi Project by SERP: Bhoomi is to ensure that the land rights of poor especially
dalits and tribals are secured by putting in place a sensitive support mechanism for fighting
out the land issues and simultaneously assist the government in reaching the poor by
maintaining a robust database of land particulars of poor.
Recognizing the enormous burden faced by poor small and marginal farmers in accessing
their land rights, SERP has kept in place, a sensitive support mechanism for resolving their
pending land related issues amicably in convergence with the mainstream revenue
department. It is a multipronged approach where the SHG federations are also putting in
place support structures like land centers where required information and records are made
available, a panel of lawyers to help them fight out their court cases, a group of youth from
the community trained in survey etc. to handle the issue from all the angles. An offline
software application was developed for capturing the land information of more than 18 lakh
farmers with exclusive focus on SC/ST lands along with the land issues and the entire
database has already been made available in web for the use of other government departments
to reach out the poor.
BhuBharti Project; a unique project in Nizamabad: The current system of Land
Administration is fraught with many shortcomings. The current system provides for deeds
registration does not put any responsibility on any public authority while issuing the title only
to the owner on transfer of property. There is no record of ownership of the property and its
incumbent upon the buyer to investigate the titles which always remain uncertain and
inconclusive.. The registration system provides for its registration where anybody can

200 | P a g e
register, anything can be registered and a property can be registered any number of times.
The registration record has no linkage with the revenue record or graphical record maintained
by the Survey department. There are four departments’ viz., Registration Department,
Revenue Department, Survey Department and Municipal Bodies handling information and
transactions about land and there is little coordination on them. Most of the survey records
have become outdated due to non-updating and have de-generated due to their age. As a
result of these deficiencies in Land Records, citizens are facing serious difficulties in
safeguarding their properties, enforcing their rights or obtaining quality service from
Government agencies.
“BHU BHARATI” encompasses all of Survey Department, immoveable property registration
of Registration Department, Land Record maintenance of Revenue Department and property
tax and layout record maintenance of local bodies. Procedures were re-engineered in such a
way that the new system was capable of auto Updation and there was no necessity for
repeating survey and title recording en masse in future.

    6 CONCLUSIONS
The hallmark of good administration is the establishment of sound governance which is both
accountable and transparent. Governance involves a clear understanding and articulation of
rights and responsibilities, recognition and protection of these rights and enforcement of the
rights and accountability towards liabilities/duties and the ability of citizens to enjoy the
rights as per the laws. Infringement of law needs to be detected and stringent action taken
against those who violate the laws and jeopardize the assertion and protection of the rights of
the citizens.

At the time of independence the country inherited a sound system of administration right
from the village level upwards. Over the decades after independence the country embarked
on ushering development and welfare. However, concentration on welfare and
implementation of various schemes relating to development and welfare resulted in a neglect
of establishing a concomitant system and framework of governance. Apart from tinkering
with the existing administrative and institutional framework, no substantial investments were
made to strengthen the administrative framework. In fact there was neglect both in terms of
investments of resources, technology and manpower. The administrative structures and the
framework proved unequal to the tasks of delivery and the result was that there is
considerable lament about the state of affairs politically and administratively. There cannot
be a strong super-structure if the foundations are weak.
There cannot be a better delivery of welfare unless the administrative machinery is
adequately trained and oriented towards welfare and is able to effectively and efficiently
deliver the schemes of development and welfare.
Land is the primary resource for development and welfare. Land is required for agriculture,
housing, industry and a sound land administration system is required to ensure that various
sectors of the economy get adequate inputs from land. Development needs have thrown up
greater demand for land. Even welfare has a strong input of land as majority of the population
still subsists on land for agriculture as a means of livelihood. The poor and marginalized
sections of the population require land not only for livelihood but also for housing. With
industrialization availability of land has become a major source of concern and migration of
the population from rural areas to urban areas is posing great challenges to meet the housing
needs of the people.
Historically the revenue department is primarily concerned with land. The department
administers land.It implements laws which grant rights to people particularly rights of

202 | P a g e
ownership, occupancy and transferability of such rights. The Revenue Department is
entrusted with the task of protecting the tenure rights and adjudicating any disputes relating to
such tenure rights. However over time the department of revenue lost its primacy in the entire
scheme of administration particularly from the district level downwards to the village level.
The Revenue Department is presently saddled with multifarious responsibilities which take
away the bulk of the time of the officials at the cost of the basic land revenue administration.
There is gross inadequacy of personnel at various levels, the orientation of these personnel
has also become inadequate and the human resource development through training has taken
a low priority. The state of land records is dismal to say the least. The result of the lack of
upto date land records has had a debilitating effect on protection and enforcement of rights in
land and the judicial system has also become un-equal to the task of delivering effective and
affordable justice.
There is no gainsaying the fact that urgent measures are required to strengthen the land
governance mechanisms in the state. Comprehensive reforms are required to make land
governance effective and efficient. Starting from the building up of land records, recording of
various types of tenures on rights, affording protection to these rights and setting up of
mechanism to protect and realize the rights, there is need to strengthen the institutional
framework required for good governance.
The land revenue department must change its orientation and become a land governance
department. It must be equipped to deal with the emerging demands for land for purposes of
industry, housing and continue to ensure that land for agriculture is adequately available for
food production. There is need for preparation of land development plans both for rural and
urban areas. These land plans should reflect the policy of government to promote
development of industry & trade, and must address the environmental concerns. If
inadequacy of resources is a major problem in strengthening governance structure of land
revenue administration, it may be worthwhile to raise resources through measures of taxation.
Land revenue particularly form the larger land owners, and from those cultivators who grow
commercial crops can be enhanced so also income tax on agriculture income can be thought
of though such measures may prove to be politically inconvenient.
However, hard decisions are required and should overcome political expediency. Forest areas
need to be protected and land under forest should be increased through afforestation of lands.
The rights of the indigenous people namely tribals need to be clearly defined and protected so
as to be in sync with forestry policy. The various laws relating to tenures need to be
implemented effectively and the right-holders should be able to access justice in an
203 | P a g e
affordable manner. From presumptive titles a concerted effort needs to be made to provide
for legal titles in land to the rights-holders.
The system of dispute resolution and dispensation of justice needs to be strengthened with
more courts, dedicated quasi-judicial authorities such as tribunals etc and justice should be
rendered in a timely manner.
Various land laws need to be revisited and in keeping with the present trends of liberalisation
and market economy, the land market should become free and a vibrant tool for development
and welfare.

                B: Public input is sought in preparing and amending land
                use plans and the public responses are used by the official
                body responsible for finalizing the new plans, but the

                Formalization of urban residential housing is feasible and
                affordable.
                B: The requirements for formalizing housing in urban
                areas are clear, straight-forward, and affordable but are

                C: There are significant constraints in the financial
                and/or human resource capacity but the system makes
                effective use of limited available resources, with limited

                All essential information on public land allocations to
                private interests is publicly accessible.
                C: Key information for public land allocations (the
                locality and area of the land allocations, the parties
                involved and the financial terms of the allocation) is

4    2    1 There is minimal transfer of acquired land to private
            interests.
            D: More than 50% of land acquired in the past 3 years is
            used for private purposes.
            Acquired land is transferred to destined use in a timely
            manner.
            C: Between 30% and 50% of the land that has been
            acquired in the past 3 years has been transferred to its
 4    2   2 destined use.
            The threat of land acquisition does not lead to pre-
            emptive action by private parties.

            Compensation is provided for the acquisition of all rights
            regardless of their recording status.
            C: Compensation, in kind or in cash, is paid for some
            unrecorded rights (such as possession, occupation etc.),
            however those with other unrecorded rights (which may
            include grazing, access, gathering forest products etc.)
4    3    1 are usually not paid.
            Land use change resulting in selective loss of rights there
            is compensated for.
            D: Where people lose rights as a result of land use
            change outside the acquisition process, compensation is
4    3    2 not paid.
            Acquired owners are compensated promptly.
            D: Less than 50% of acquired land owners receive
4    3    3 compensation within one year.
            There are independent and accessible avenues for appeal
            against acquisition.
            B: Independent avenues to lodge a complaint against
            acquisition exist but there are access restrictions (i.e.
4    3    4 only accessible by mid-income and wealthy).
            Timely decisions are made regarding complaints about
            acquisition.
            D: A first instance decision has been reached for less
            than 30% of the complaints about acquisition lodged

                  years through sale or lease through public auction or

                collected from private parties on the lease of public
                lands.
                Public land is transacted at market prices unless guided
                by equity objectives.
                B: Public land is generally divested at market prices in
                a transparent process, but this only applies to a
                particular type of investor (e.g. domestic only or
5    1     3    foreign only) and for certain purposes only.
                The public captures benefits arising from changes in
                permitted land use.
                C: Mechanisms to allow the public to capture
                significant share of the gains from changing land use
5    1     4    are rarely used and applied in a discretionary manner.
                Policy to improve equity in asset access and use by the
                poor exists, is implemented effectively and monitored.
                C: Policy is in place to improve access to and
                productive use of assets by poor and marginalized
5    1     5    groups but is not enforced
                Land to be made available to investors is identified
                transparently and publicly, in agreement with right
                holders.
                C: A policy to identify land that can be made available
                to investors exists, based on ad hoc assessment of land
                potential and limited consultation with communities
5    2     1    and is applied in more than 90% of identified cases.
                Investments are selected based on economic, socio-
                cultural and environmental impacts in an open process
                C: Process is in place but many investments go ahead
                that are either not according to the policy or despite
5    2     2    unfavorable outcomes.
                Public institutions transferring land to investors are
                clearly identified and regularly audited
                A: Institutions to make decisions are clearly identified
                and have the necessary capacity (incl. resources for
                field verification) and strong incentives in ensuring
                socially beneficial outcomes in a way that minimizes
5    2     3    transaction costs.
                Public bodies transferring land to investors share
                information and coordinate to minimize and resolve
                overlaps (including sub-soil).
                A: A policy is in place for effective inter-ministerial
                coordination to ensure that decisions on land use and
                land rights are well coordinated across sectors, and are

                Compliance with contractual obligations is regularly
                monitored and remedial action taken if needed.
                C: Monitoring of compliance is limited or only part of

                Safeguards effectively reduce the risk of negative
                effects from large scale land-related investments.
                C: Safeguards (EIA, SIA, etc.) are partly in line with
5    2     6    global best practice
                The scope for resettlement is clearly circumscribed and
                procedures exist to deal with it in line with best
                practice.
                C: Resettlement policy exists, but is only in part of the
5    2     7    cases applied.
                Investors provide sufficient information to allow
                rigorous evaluation of proposed investments.
                D: Investors' business plans (application materials) is
                insufficient to assess technical viability, community
5    3     1    consultation, and availability of resources
                Approval of investment plans follows a clear process
                with reasonable timelines.
                B: All investment application related documents are
                reviewed according to a uniform process and receive a
5    3     2    response within 6 months of date of submission
                Right holders and investors negotiate freely and directly
                with full access to relevant information.
                C: Those holding rights to land with potential for
                investment have incentives to properly negotiate but
                their rights are unclear or opportunities to obtain
5    3     3    relevant information or assistance do not exist.
                Contractual provisions regarding benefit sharing are
                publicly disclosed.
                D: The majority of contractual arrangements do not
5    3     4    include information on benefit sharing
                Information on spatial extent and duration of approved
                concessions is publicly available.
                C: Spatial information and temporal information is
                available to relevant government institutions but not
5    4     1    accessible on a routine basis by private parties.
                Compliance with safeguards on concessions is
                monitored and enforced effectively and consistently.
                D: There is little third-party monitoring of investors'
                compliance with safeguards and mechanisms to quickly
                and effectively ensure adherence are virtually non-
5    4     2    existent.
                Avenues to deal with non-compliance exist and obtain
                timely and fair decisions.
                C: There is little third-party monitoring of investors'
                compliance with contractual provisions and
                mechanisms to quickly and effectively reach arbitration
                are difficult to access for affected communities but
5    4     3    work for investors.

                B: There is a clear, practical process for the formal
                recognition of possession but this process is not
                implemented effectively, consistently or transparently.
                Non-documentary evidence is effectively used to help
                establish rights.
                C: Non-documentary forms of evidence are used to
                obtain recognition of a claim to property along with
                other documents (e.g. tax receipts or informal purchase
                notes) when other forms of evidence are not available.
6     1    2    They have less strength than the provided documents.
                Long-term unchallenged possession is formally
                recognized.
                A: Legislation exists to formally recognize long-term,
                unchallenged possession and this applies to both public
6     1    3    and private land although different rules may apply.
                First-time recording of rights on demand includes
                proper safeguards and access is not restricted by high
                fees.
                A: On-demand recording of rights includes proper
                safeguards to prevent abuse and costs do not exceed
6     1    4    0.5% of the property value.
                Total cost of recording a property transfer is low.
                D: The total cost for recording a property transfer is
6     2    1    equal to or greater than 5% of the property value.
                Information held in records is linked to maps that reflect
                current reality.
                C: Between 50% and 70% of the cost privately held
                land recorded in the registry are readily identifiable in
6     2    2    maps ( spatial records)
                All relevant private encumbrances are recorded.
                C: Relevant private encumbrances are recorded but this

                All relevant public restrictions or charges are recorded.
                C: Relevant public restrictions or charges are recorded
6     2    4    but this is not done in a consistent and reliable manner.
                There is a timely response to requests for accessing
                registry records.
                B: Copies or extracts of documents recording rights in
                property can generally be obtained within 1 week of
6     2    5    request.
                The registry is searchable.
                A: The records in the registry can be searched by both
6     2    6    right holder name and parcel.
6     2    7    Land information records are easily accessed.

                Information in public registries is synchronized to
                ensure integrity of rights and reduce transaction cost. B:
                Links are in place for all types of public land
                information registries but checks on the legitimacy of
                transactions that affects certain parties' land rights are
6     3    1    only performed ex post.
                Registry information is up-to-date and reflects ground
                reality.
                C: Between 50% and 70% of the ownership information
                in registry/cadaster is up-to-date and reflects ground
6     3    2    reality.
                The registry is financially sustainable through fee
                collection to finance its operations.
                A: The total fees collected by the registry exceed the
                total registry operating costs. (Total operating costs
                include all non-capital investment costs (i.e. salaries
                and wages, materials, transportation, etc.) associated
6     4    1    with registry operating costs.)
                Investment in land administration is sufficient to cope
                with demand for high quality services.
                C: Human resources and physical capital investment
                are sufficient to maintain medium service standards but
                does not allow to proactively adapt to new
6     4    2    developments.
                Fees have a clear rationale, their schedule is public, and
                all payments are accounted for.
                A: A clear rationale and schedule of fees for different
                services is publicly accessible and receipts are issued
6     5    1    for all transactions.
                Informal payments are discouraged.
                B: Mechanisms to detect and deal with illegal staff
                behavior exist in all registry offices but cases are not
6     5    2    systematically or promptly dealt with.
                Service standards are published and regularly
                monitored.
                B: There are published service standards, but the
                registry does not actively monitor its performance
6     5    3    against these standards.

                 There is a clear process of property valuation.
                 B: The assessment of land/property for tax or
                 compensation purposes reflects market prices, but there

                 Valuation rolls are publicly accessible.
                 A: There is a policy that valuation rolls be publicly
                 accessible and this policy is effective for all properties
7    1   2       that are considered for taxation.
                 Exemptions from property taxes payment are justified and
                 transparent.
                 C: The exemptions to the payment of land/property taxes
                 are not always clearly based on equity or efficiency
                 grounds and are not always applied in a transparent and

7    2   3       collected.
                 Receipts from property tax exceed the cost of collection.

                  A: There are no parallel avenues for conflict resolution
                  or, if parallel avenues exist, responsibilities are clearly
                  assigned and widely known and explicit rules for

                C: A process exists to appeal rulings on land cases at
                high cost and the process takes a long time/ the costs
8    1    4     are low but the process takes a long time.
                Land disputes constitute a small proportion of cases in
                the formal legal system.
                C: Land disputes in the formal court system are between
8    2    1     30% and 50% of the total court cases.
                Conflicts in the formal system are resolved in a timely
                manner.
                D: A decision in a land-related conflict is reached in the
                first instance court within 2 year or more for 90% of
8    2    2     cases
                There are few long-standing (> 5 years) land conflicts.
                D: The share of long-standing land conflicts is greater
 8 2    3       than 20% of the total pending land dispute court cases.
PANEL 9
 P   D    I                        Indicator description                          Scoring
                                                                                A B C D
                Land policy formulation, implementation and arbitration are
                separated to avoid conflict of interest.
                A: In situations that can entail conflicts of interest or are
                sensitive to abuse (e.g. transfers of land rights) there is a
                clear separation in the roles of policy formulation,
9    1   1      implementation and arbitration.
                Responsibilities of the ministries and agencies dealing with
                land do not overlap (horizontal overlap).
                B: The mandated responsibilities of the various authorities
                dealing with land administration issues are defined with a
                limited amount of overlap with those of other land sector
9    1   2      agencies but there are few problems.
                Administrative (vertical) overlap is avoided.
                A: Assignment of land-related responsibilities between the
                different levels of administration and government is clear
9    1   3      and non-overlapping.
                Land right and use information is shared by public bodies;
                key parts are regularly reported on and publicly accessible.
                B: Information related to rights in land is available to
                interested institutions and although this information is
                available at reasonable cost, it is not readily accessible as
9    1   4      the information is not maintained in a uniform way.

216 | P a g e
                Overlaps of rights (based on tenure typology) are minimal
                and       do     not      cause    friction     or     dispute.
                C: The Legal framework and procedures for land-related
                matters (incl. renewable and subsoil resources) deal with
                land-related matters very differently but have functioning
9    1   5      mechanisms for redressing overlap in place.
                Ambiguity in institutional mandates (based on institutional
                map) does not cause problems.
                B: With minor exceptions, the processes applied by public
                institutions dealing with land are fully integrated and
9    1   6      consistent.
                Land policies and regulations are developed in a
                participatory manner involving all relevant stakeholders.
                C: Policy exists or can be inferred by the existing legislation
                but it is incomplete (some key aspects are missing or only
                covers part of the country such as only urban or only rural
                areas) and decisions that affect some sections of the
9    2   1      community are made without prior consultation.
                Land policies address equity and poverty reduction goals;
                progress towards these is publicly monitored.
                C: Land policies incorporate some equity and poverty
                objectives but these are not regularly and meaningfully
9    2   2      monitored.
                Land policies address ecological and environmental goals;
                progress towards these is publicly monitored.
                C: Land policies incorporate some ecology and
                environmental sustainability objectives but these are not
9    2   3      regularly and meaningfully monitored.
                The implementation of land policy is costed, matched with
                benefits and adequately resourced.
                C: The implementation of land policy is not fully costed
                and/or to implement the policy there are serious
                inadequacies in at least one area of budget, resources or
9    2   4      institutional capacity.
                There is regular and public reporting indicating progress in
                policy implementation.
                C: Formal land institutions report on land policy
                implementation but in a way that does not allow meaningful
                tracking of progress across different areas or in a sporadic
9    2   5      way.
                Land policies help to improve land use by low-income
                groups and those who experienced injustice.
                B: Policy is in place to improve access to and productive
                use of assets by poor and marginalized groups, is applied in
9    2   6      practice, but is not effective
                Land policies proactively and effectively reduce future
                disaster risk.
                D: No policy is in place to prevent settlement in high risks
9    2   7      areas or anticipated future risks.
