Measuring poverty in Africa remains a challenge.
  The coverage, comparability, and quality of household surveys to monitor living standards
• 
  have improved. Still, by 2012, only 27 of the region’s 48 countries had conducted at least two
  comparable surveys since 1990 to track poverty.
  Regular and good-quality GDP, price, and census data are also lacking.
• 
  Technical approaches can fill in some gaps, but there is no good alternative to regular and
• 
  good-quality data. A regionwide effort to strengthen Africa’s statistics is called for.

Poverty in Africa may be lower than current estimates suggest,
but more people are poor today than in 1990.
  The latest estimates from the World Bank show that the share of Africans who are poor fell
• 
  from 57 percent in 1990 to 43 percent in 2012. Limiting estimates to comparable surveys,
  drawing on nonconsumption surveys, and applying alternative price deflators suggest that
  poverty may have declined by even more.
  Nonetheless, even given the most optimistic estimates, still many more people are poor
• 
  because of population growth: more than 330 million in 2012, up from about 280 million
  in 1990.
  Poverty reduction has been slowest in fragile countries, and rural areas remain much poorer,
• 
  although the urban-rural gap has narrowed. Chronic poverty is substantial.

Nonmonetary dimensions of poverty have been improving.
  Health, nutrition, education, and empowerment have improved; and violence has diminished.
• 
  But the challenges remain enormous: more than two in five adults are still illiterate, and the
• 
  quality of schooling is often low; after a decade of relative peace, conflict is on the rise.
  Nonmonetary welfare indicators are weaker in resource-rich countries, conditional on
• 
  income, pointing to the unmet potential of natural resource wealth.

Inequality in Africa has many dimensions.
  The data do not reveal a systematic increase in inequality across countries in Africa. But these
• 
  data do not capture extremely wealthy Africans, whose numbers and wealth are increasing.
  Spatial inequalities (differences between urban and rural areas and across regions) are large.
• 
  I ntergenerational mobility in areas such as education and occupation has improved, but
• 
  mobility is still low and perpetuates inequality.

    The World Bank Group is committed to reducing its environmental footprint. In support of this
    commitment, the Publishing and Knowledge Division leverages electronic publishing options
    and print-on-demand technology, which is located in regional hubs worldwide. Together, these
    initiatives enable print runs to be lowered and shipping distances decreased, resulting in reduced
    paper consumption, chemical use, greenhouse gas emissions, and waste.
       The Publishing and Knowledge Division follows the recommended standards for paper use
    set by the Green Press Initiative. The majority of our books are printed on Forest Stewardship
    Council (FSC)–certified paper, with nearly all containing 50–100 percent recycled content. The
    recycled fiber in our book paper is either unbleached or bleached using totally chlorine-free
    (TCF), processed chlorine-free (PCF), or enhanced elemental chlorine-free (EECF) processes.

“Our knowledge of global poverty has long been compromised by inadequacies in the
    underlying data, in which people report how much they spend. This is nowhere more true
    than in Africa, where national accounts data are also very weak. So I am delighted that this
    report and the World Bank are directing serious attention to these issues and hope that,
    before too long, our basic database will be much stronger than it is today. In the meantime,
    this report provides an insightful synthesis of what is known about poverty in Africa today,
    in both its monetary and nonmonetary dimensions.”

“Drawing on data to profile well-being in Africa is no easy task. I strongly commend the
    efforts of synchronizing and reviewing many data sources in this report. It sheds a bright
    light—based on data—on the poverty profile of Sub-Saharan African countries over time.
	      Looking forward, it is critical that we continue the work of strengthening Africa’s statistics
    and filling in data gaps that this report carefully outlines. While investing in consumption
    data is paramount, strengthening the methodological and analytical capacity for measuring
    nonmonetary dimensions of poverty must also be given a due priority. We need to
    focus on the multidimensions of well-being, but without high-quality and frequent data,
    knowledge gaps will remain.”

“Following Africa’s rise, are people better off? Scrutinizing the available information, this
    report does an exemplary job of addressing this pertinent question. It also draws our
    attention to the seminal crisis at the heart of global decision making around development
    issues—the crisis of poor data. Bad data feed bad management, weak accountability, loss
    of resources, and then, bad results. Embracing the more and better data agenda is key for
    better governance and faster poverty reduction.”
