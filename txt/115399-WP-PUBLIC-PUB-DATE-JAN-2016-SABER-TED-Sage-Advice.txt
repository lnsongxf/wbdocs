This series of studies focuses on aspects of

College Center for International Higher Education.

The Center brings an international consciousness
to the analysis of higher education. We believe that
an international perspective will contribute to
enlightened policy and practice. To serve this
goal, the Center produces International Higher
Education (a quarterly publication), books, and
other publications; sponsors conferences; and
welcomes visiting scholars. We have a special
concern for academic institutions in the Jesuit
tradition worldwide and, more broadly, with
Catholic universities.

The Center promotes dialogue and cooperation
among academic institutions throughout the
world. We believe that the future depends on
effective collaboration and the creation of an
international community focused on the
improvement of higher education in the
public interest.

I  t is my great pleasure to present the first issue of

aspects of research and analysis undertaken by the

T         he idea of establishing an international adviso-
