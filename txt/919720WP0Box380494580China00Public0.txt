THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number

                    China made starting a business less costly by exempting micro
DB2013              and small companies from paying several administrative fees
                    from January 2012 to December 2014.

China is a set of specific procedures—the
bureaucratic and legal steps that an entrepreneur
must complete to incorporate and register a new                 Legal form: Limited Liability Company

Following is a detailed summary of those procedures,            Start-up Capital: 10 times GNI per capita
along with the associated time and cost. These
procedures are those that apply to a company

“standardized company”) used by Doing Business in
collecting the data (see the section in this chapter on
what the indicators measure).

       Obtain a notice of pre-approval of the company name

       The applicant picks up the application for company name pre-approval
       from the local Administration of Industry and Commerce (AIC), or
       otherwise, downloads the form from AIC’s Web site. The applicant can
       be the representative designated by all the shareholders or the agent
       entrusted by all the shareholders. The completed application form shall
       be signed by all shareholders of the company. The application form
       together with the business licenses or other registration certificates (if
       the shareholders are companies or other eligible entities) and the
       photocopy of the identity card of the individual shareholders shall be
       filed with the AIC. Effective July 1, 2004, enterprise name registration
       must follow the amended State Administration of Industry and                  1 day           no charge

       Commerce (SAIC) rules (that is, the new Enterprise Name Registration
       Administration Implementing Measures, or qi ye ming cheng deng ji
       guan li shi shi ban fa). According to the new registration rules, if the
       applicant goes directly to the AIC, a proposed company name is
       approved or rejected on the spot. This is newly regulated by Article 24
       of the aforementioned measures and is implemented in practice.
       However if the application is made through mail, fax, email, etc, the
       proposed company name will be approved or rejected within 15 days.

      calculated as follows:                                                        1 day      CNY 156,021

      1. Designing step: if the budgetary estimate of the project design is less
      than CNY 5,000,000.00, the cost is calculated as 0.44 % (1,279,322 x
      0.44%= CNY 5,629) of the budgetary estimate of the project design.
      2. Building and repairing step: if the budgetary estimate of the project
      building and repairing is less than CNY 5,000,000.00, the cost is
      calculated as 3.3% (1,279,322 x 3.3% = CNY 42,217.6) of the budgetary
      estimate. The new value is CNY 42,217.6 + CNY 5,629 = CNY 47,846.6.

      * Hire an authorized supervision agency

      There is no uniform price for hiring a supervisor. The cost should be
      calculated as follows:
      1. Designing step: if the budgetary estimate of the project design is less
      than CNY 5,000,000.00, the cost is calculated as 0.44% of the budgetary
      estimate of the project design.
      2. Building and repairing step: if the budgetary estimate of the project
      building and repairing is less than CNY 5,000,000.00, the cost is
      calculated as 3.3% of the budgetary estimate.                                 1 day      CNY 156,021

      3. Additionally builders need to pay CNY 60.00 per square meter for
      designs to be presented to the People's Civil Defense office.

      These calculations are according to the Notice on the Standard of
      Industry-Directed Price for the Construction Supervision Agency Fees of

      "Private ownership of land is not permitted in China; all land is subject to
      either State ownership or collective ownership. However, a private party
      is entitled to obtain the right to use the land. Regarding the State-owned
      land, there are two types of land use rights, the “granted land use right”
      and the “allocated land use right”. The difference is that the granted land
      use right is limited in time against payment, whereas the allocated land
      use right is usually given for free with no time limit, but for specific
      purposes only. A private party also may transfer to another private party
      the granted land use right. The allocated land use right cannot be
      commercially transferable before being converted into granted land use
      right. In this case, the land is used for commercial purposes. Usually
      land for commercial use is owned by the State, and the relevant land use
      right is the State-owned land use right. As to the term of the land use
      right in this case the buyer, who will use the land for commercial
      purposes, will only get 40 years as the initial term (as maximum unless it
      extends the granted land use rights at the end of the 40 year period by
      paying to the State the additional land price) minus the period from the
      granting date from the State to the date of the transfer to ABC. If the
      land is zoned for industrial use or warehousing use rather than for
      commercial use, the maximum land tenure should be 50 years. There is
      a standard form sale and purchase agreement formulated by
      government authorities and is required to be used in practice. The
      contents of the standard form agreement may be revised or                         7 days

  The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is
defined as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall distribution for all years included in the analysis. It is calculated and adjusted on a
yearly basis. The threshold is not based on any economic theory of an “optimal tax rate” that minimizes distortions or maximizes efficiency in the tax
system of an economy overall. Instead, it is mainly empirical in nature, set at the lower end of the distribution of tax rates levied on medium-size
enterprises in the manufacturing sector as observed through the paying taxes indicators. This reduces the bias in the indicators toward economies
that do not need to levy significant taxes on companies like the Doing Business standardized case study company because they raise public revenue
in other ways—for example, through taxes on foreign companies, through taxes on sectors other than manufacturing or from natural resources (all
of which are outside the scope of the methodology). This year’s threshold is 26.1%.

TRADING ACROSS BORDERS
In today’s globalized world, making trade between          WHAT THE TRADING ACROSS BORDERS

burdensome customs procedures, inefficient port
operations and inadequate infrastructure all lead to        Documents required to export and import
extra costs and delays for exporters and importers,         (number)
stifling trade potential. Research shows that                Bank documents
exporters in developing countries gain more from a

reduction in the tariffs applied to their products in        Port and terminal handling documents

Doing Business measures the time and cost                    Obtaining, filling out and submitting all the

of trading across borders is determined by sorting
their distance to frontier scores for trading across         Inland transport and handling
borders. These scores are the simple average of the          Customs clearance and inspections
distance to frontier scores for each of the component

Doing Business collects data on the existence of unemployment protection schemes as well as data on whether
employers are legally required to provide health insurance for employees with permanent contracts.


Doing Business also assesses the mechanisms available to resolve labor disputes. More specifically, it collects data
on what courts would be competent to hear labor disputes and whether the competent court is specialized in
resolving labor disputes.
