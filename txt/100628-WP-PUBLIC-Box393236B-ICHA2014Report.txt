                              Foreword

           Dr. Jim Yong Kim, President, World Bank Group
The World Bank Group’s mission is guided by two goals: ending extreme pov-
erty by 2030 and boosting shared prosperity. Corruption is a significant obstacle
to achieving these objectives. For example, it reduces low- and middle-income
countries’ ability to finance their own development because of illicit financial
flows. In fragile states, corruption fuels insecurity and stands in the way of stable
and effective governance. It can also make developing countries more vulnerable
to extreme weather events and health epidemics by further undermining weak
response systems.
    The biennial meeting of the World Bank Group’s International Corruption
Hunters Alliance (IHCA) is a critical part of our anti-corruption activities. Every
two years, more than 350 members of the Alliance come to Washington, D.C.,
to discuss cutting-edge issues and tactics for combatting corruption. Attendees
include attorneys general, chief prosecutors, and senior government officials
from anti-corruption and development agencies from more than 130 countries.
The conference provides them the opportunity to share experience and knowl-
edge, and build transnational enforcement and prevention networks. It empowers
Alliance members to tackle a constantly evolving and cross-border threat to our
development goals.
    The Report on the 2014 Third Biennial Meeting of the International Corruption
Hunters Alliance (the Report) captures the current thinking on the most pressing
issues in combatting corruption. Chief among them is stopping illicit financial
flows – an important part of going from billions of dollars in Official Development
Assistance to the trillions in development spending needed to finance the
Sustainable Development Goals. Estimates suggest these flows far exceed foreign
aid and foreign direct investment. The proceeds of corruption contribute to these
illicit flows, and money stolen from one country can be too easily transferred to
another for safekeeping. Tax evasion, organized crime, the illegal trade in natural
resources, and the trafficking of drugs, weapons and humans all depend on these
illicit transactions.
    The Report’s contents are based on presentations and discussions that occurred
during the 21 sessions of the 2014 ICHA meeting. It reflects the most up-to-date
knowledge of World Bank Group specialists in governance, asset recovery, inter-
national law and investigations, as well as experts and thought-leaders from the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; the U.N. Office
on Drugs and Crime; the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF); the Extractives
Industry Transparency Initiative; Global Witness; the International Consortium

of Investigative Journalists; the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and
Malaria; and various national law enforcement authorities.
   Despite the ICHA’s success in fostering knowledge sharing and global cooper-
ation, we have much work ahead of us in our fight against corruption. In 2010,
41 percent of ICHA participants believed that fraud and corruption were systemic
in their countries; in 2014, that number had increased to over 50 percent. And
more than 40 percent believe that impunity for engaging in corruption is also sys-
temic. We cannot accept that corruption is a cost of governing – it harms the poor
and the vulnerable, and prevents them from achieving their full potential. The
knowledge in this report contributes to the global capacity to fight corruption. It
helps focus our efforts on areas where we know we can effect change, moving us
closer to an era where impunity for corruption ceases to exist.

          Leonard Frank McCarthy, Vice President, Integrity,
                        World Bank Group
Good morning ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the World Bank. Thank
you all for joining us at this timely and exciting event.
   It is my honor to extend special welcomes to His Royal Highness The Duke of
Cambridge and to World Bank President Dr. Jim Yong Kim.
   It is not every day that we have men of your stature speaking to the Corruption
Hunters Alliance. Your presence here signifies promise and enthusiasm for the
task at hand. Thank you for lending your name to this Alliance.
   Our attendees today include 382 heads and senior members of anticorruption
enforcement authorities and representatives of international organizations from
130 countries. Bringing together so many of us can only intensify our mutual
resolve in the war on corruption.
   In December 2013 Dr. Kim called corruption one of the most pressing issues facing
developing countries. A few years ago he asked me if the World Bank Group was really
doing best it could at fighting corruption. He probed into the depth of the world’s
replication systems and identified the failure to address corruption as a malpractice.
   Dr. Kim has since reiterated the need for everyone committed to development
to inject urgency into the global anticorruption movement—and here at the
World  Bank Group, he has paved the way for greater use of preventive science
against crime and corruption.
   Under his watch, we continue to toil with difficult cases, seeking the kind of
results that provide solutions. Dr. Kim has presided over a massive transformation
of the World Bank Group, in which the pursuit of corruption is a central tenet of
his presidency.
   His approach personifies the change that the Bank Group wants to be in the
battle against corruption. Dr. Kim, we look forward to your address.
   Thank you.

                     Opening Address
           Dr. Jim Yong Kim, President, World Bank Group
Good morning and a warm welcome  to all our distinguished guests at this
third biennial meeting of the World Bank Group’s International Corruption
Hunters Alliance. We’re especially honored to have with us His Royal Highness
The Duke of Cambridge. I also want to welcome The Right Honorable William
Hague, His Grace The Duke of Westminster, and other eminent visitors.
    To The Duke of Cambridge, I want to extend a special thank you for all that
you—and your father and grandfather before you—have done to bring attention
to international conservation. We all owe you a special debt of gratitude for your
determination in rooting out and breaking apart the entrenched corruption in the
illegal wildlife trade.
    You have a lot in common with many other people in this room. You are a
corruption hunter. You are part of a very special club—a club of people who are
ethically and morally motivated to fight corruption to protect the most vulnerable,
whether it’s the world’s poorest people or its endangered wildlife. We welcome you
as an especially distinguished member of this esteemed group and look forward to
working with you to root out corruption in all its forms.
    And for those in the audience, thank you for all that you do. Your presence here
helps bring much-needed attention to serious issues and, I believe, will inspire
meaningful action in the years ahead.
    Eleven years ago tomorrow, 45 countries signed the United Nations Convention
Against Corruption. People who have been fighting corruption a long time will
tell you that the adoption of that convention was a watershed moment—putting
corruption on the global agenda.
    These days, the media report major revelations about corruption almost every
day. Yet corruption’s devastating effects on the world’s poorest people are usu-
ally overlooked—until disaster strikes, when it becomes impossible not to notice
that poor people are hit the hardest. It is hard to forget the 2012 garment fac-
tory fire in Bangladesh that killed 112 workers—reminding us how bribes weaken
regulations. And before that, a spate of natural disasters reminded us how all the
­
little holes left by the rot of corruption—from shoddy infrastructure to poorly
trained civil servants—can lead to utter collapse.
    The World Bank Group has two main goals: ending extreme poverty by 2030 and
boosting shared prosperity for the poorest 40 percent of the population. We knew that
setting such ambitious goals would require us to step up our fight against corruption
in its many forms. Corruption may be one of the most blatant expressions of inequal-
ity in global society—a long-running zero-sum game with increasingly higher stakes.
    Bank Group projects must continue to serve as the standard bearer for clean
business. We need to be alert, respond immediately when things go wrong, learn

from our experiences, and ensure that mistakes don’t happen again. Controversy
is inevitable. But we have to be vigilant that the voices we pay closest attention to
represent the best interests of our most important clients: the more than 1 billion
people around the world living on less than $1.25 a day.
   We believe that our support to country-led efforts is critical to turning the tide
against corruption, and we’ve recently restructured the World Bank Group to
better meet this need. One of our new practice groups has more than 800 experts
­
dedicated to helping countries enhance their governance. Good governance means
delivering public services effectively and efficiently; it forges trust between states
and citizens. Weak governance enables corruption to thrive. A major challenge for
the Bank Group is to get our knowledge and tools to the right people at the right
time, and to fully leverage opportunities for reform. Chile has turned the corner
on corruption in just one decade. By working with other countries on the cusp of
change, the next decade could significantly shift the landscape for anticorruption
efforts—and, so, for better development outcomes overall.
   Many countries have found innovative ways to both foster good governance
and stamp out corruption. Social audits give citizens and communities a formal
role in monitoring and oversight. Similarly, Colombia’s High Level Reporting
Mechanism gives companies interacting with the public sector a direct link to the
central ­government to bring the highest level of accountability to public and pri-
vate projects. And every day, customs authorities in the Philippines post all items
they clear—helping empower watchdog groups.
   Unfortunately, innovation and capitalizing on opportunity are also tools used
by those on the wrong side of the law. Corruption schemes tainting Bank Group
projects have become increasingly sophisticated and transnational. Our multilat-
eral counterparts and client countries tell us the same stories, and longstanding
jurisdictional hurdles and financial secrecy further complicate things. It’s clear
that we—and by “we” I mean every one of us—need to strengthen anticorruption
initiatives both in and across countries.
   That is precisely why the World Bank Group, with support from Australia,
Denmark, and Norway, created the International Corruption Hunters Alliance.
Every two years the Alliance brings together people from around the world who
are on the front lines of enforcing the anticorruption agenda. We engage in what is
happening at a multilateral level, provide access to the latest anticorruption tools
and information, and foster a dialogue that drives our collective efforts to beat
corruption.
   There has been much debate about how to quantify and stem illicit financial
flows, one of the main topics that you will be covering during this three-day
­
conference. But the general consensus is that illicit financial flows exceed aid and
foreign direct investment. So what we need is more action. I challenge the corrup-
tion hunters to do their part. Freeze, forfeit, and recover stolen assets to disrupt
the flow of corrupted funds. When money is lost to kleptocrats, developed and

developing countries share the responsibility for ensuring that at least some of it
makes its way back to citizens.
   I realize that this will be a serious challenge. Entrenched interests do not crum-
ble easily, even when faced with widespread opposition. The inroads that the
world makes against corruption are often small relative to the magnitude of the
problem—but the inroads are real.
   For instance, a few years ago thousands of people took to the streets in Indonesia
to demonstrate their support for the Eradication of Corruption Commission.
CEOs of major corporations often tell us that cleaning up their businesses increases
their profits. And I’ve seen coalitions such as Publish What You Pay, the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative, and the Construction Sector Transparency
Initiative boost the demand for transparency.
   You have all chosen a complex, difficult profession, and you know that progress
can be cut short by the volatility of a changing world. And it is rare to have water-
shed moments like the one we experienced 11 years ago with the adoption of the
UN Convention Against Corruption. You are all pioneers, and I urge you to con-
tinue to forcefully bend the arc of history in the right direction. You are the ones
who have been and will continue to change the world when it comes to combating
corruption.
   I now have the pleasure and honor of yielding the floor to a man who doesn’t
need an introduction. Your Royal Highness, from the moment your visit was
announced, we’ve been flooded with requests for invitations to this morning’s
event. We’re all so impressed with your heartfelt commitment to stopping crime
against wildlife. The intersection with corruption and dirty money are undeniable,
and the implications for sustainable, inclusive development are clear.
   Thank you, Sir, for your leadership on this issue.
   Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming His Royal Highness The
Duke of Cambridge.

4                                                    Ending Impunity for Corruption
                       Keynote Speech
    His Royal Highness Prince William, The Duke of Cambridge
Dr. Kim, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your extremely warm welcome
on this, my first visit to Washington. I am grateful for the opportunity to talk to
you about a subject extremely close to my heart: the illegal wildlife trade.
   The World Bank is a fitting place to make this speech, founded as it was not only
on expertise, but also on ideals. At its birth 70 years ago, it was a Bank created for a
war-shocked world, to reconstruct the shattered economies of Europe and so pre-
vent future conflict. But even then the World Bank had a wider purpose: to raise
living standards everywhere and, in the words of John Maynard Keynes, “to make
the resources of the world more fully available to all mankind.”
   That task of worldwide development remains a noble ideal and a vital service
to humanity.
   As you know, huge progress has been made. In our lifetimes, millions of
people will lift themselves out of poverty. But stubborn impediments to devel-
­
opment remain, of which corruption is one of the most persistent and damaging.
Tomorrow is the United Nations Anti-Corruption Day, and I pay tribute to the
courageous individuals who labor against corruption worldwide—often risking
their jobs and even their lives.
   At its heart, all corruption is an abuse of power; the pursuit of money or influ-
ence at the expense of society as a whole. Worst of all, it weighs most heavily on
the world’s poorest and most powerless people. It deepens their hardships, stifles
their opportunities, distorts justice, and undermines development. Where cor-
rupt hands tear down faster than clean hands can build, escaping from the trap of
poverty or conflict is much more difficult.
­
   In my view, one of the most insidious forms of corruption and criminality in
the world today is the illegal wildlife trade. Criminal gangs turn vast profits from
the illegal killing or capture of wildlife. Armed groups and terrorists swap poached
ivory for guns. And middlemen oil the wheels of the trade in return for reward.
Together they loot our planet to feed mankind’s ignorant cravings for exotic pets,
trinkets, cures, and ornaments derived from the world’s vanishing and irreplace-
able species.
   I was inspired by my grandfather and my father, who have championed inter-
national conservation for more than 50 years. They helped foster a revolution in
attitudes toward our natural environment. From them I learned that our relation-
ship with nature and wildlife goes to the heart of our identity as human beings:
from our basic survival to our appreciation of beauty and our connection to all
other living things.
   Seen in this light, the extinction of any of the world’s species of animals is a loss to
all humanity. But wildlife crime also goes to the heart of our security. It recognizes


Ending Impunity for Corruption                                                           5
neither national borders nor national interests. It distorts economic development,
undermines the rule of law, and fuels sources of conflict. Unchecked, it can be a
factor in the spread of infectious diseases—with a devastating toll.
   This illegal trade threatens to wipe out the natural endowment of affected
nations by depriving future generations of their heritage, and of their right to
develop those resources in legitimate ways. Indeed, it suits traffickers that areas
rich in natural resources remain underdeveloped or conflict-ridden, so that they
can go on plundering without restriction.
   Ladies and gentlemen, it is wrong that children growing up in countries vulner-
able to wildlife crime are losing their birthright to fuel the greed of international
criminals—and that those children will face greater hardship and insecurity as this
crime keeps them mired in poverty.
   Over the past decade the illegal wildlife trade has mutated from low-level,
opportunistic crime to large-scale activity by international criminal networks.
Such trade is exceeded in value only by the illegal market for drugs, arms, and
trafficked human beings, and generates as much as $20 billion a year in illegal
profits—profits that are used to fund organized criminal networks and nonstate
armed groups. I don’t need to tell you that such activities have alarming implica-
tions for global security. And this trade is on the rise.
   According to the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL),
recent seizures of illegal wildlife products are the largest ever seen. In 2011 the
17 largest seizures by customs officials netted a staggering 27,000 kilograms of
ivory—equivalent to the tusks of at least 3,000 elephants. As these figures suggest,
traffickers are taking advantage of globalization, hiding wildlife products among
the huge flows of goods across borders, and exploiting technology—from helicop-
ters and precision weapons to the borderless markets of the Internet.
   As wildlife crime has become more organized and more sophisticated, requir-
ing specialized skills, it has become even more brutal. Over the past 10 years more
than 1,000 rangers working to protect wildlife have been killed. That means, on
average, two rangers being murdered every week for a decade.
   Because rare animal populations are shrinking, demand is surging, with the
perverse effect of making trafficked wildlife more valuable. Some endangered
­
­
species are now literally worth more than their weight in gold, which makes it
even  harder for governments and international bodies to counter this trade.
For example, according to some reports, in China and Southeast Asia the whole-
sale street price of ivory has skyrocketed from $5 to $2,100 a kilogram in the past
25 years. And these higher prices are reflected in increases in poaching.
   In South Africa in 2007, poachers killed 13 rhinos. In 2012 they killed more
than 600. In 2013 more than 20,000 elephants were killed in Africa, with the num-
ber poached now exceeding the number born. And there are only 3,200 tigers left
in the wild. I could go on.

   The cumulative effect of wildlife crime is shocking. Over the past 100 years the
abundance of the world’s species has dropped by almost a third. Such a dramatic
drop impoverishes all of us.
   We need new efforts to drive wildlife trafficking from our lands, seas, and skies.
And time is not on our side.
   Over the past two years the Royal Foundation has brought together seven of
the world’s preeminent conservation organizations into a new collaboration called
United for Wildlife, of which I am proud to be President. We work alongside
others in a wide range of areas—from protecting endangered species through
antipoaching programs, to sponsoring projects to reduce the demand for wildlife
products, to supporting efforts to strengthen legal systems, to providing support
for local communities.
   But increasingly, our work has highlighted the desperate need for international
cooperation to combat wildlife trafficking. Last year the Royal Foundation com-
missioned a report by TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network. It found
that even though national law enforcement is improving and shipments are being
seized, loopholes and shifting trade patterns mean that the volume of the trade has
not fallen by much. The report also brought to light the hidden routes and means
of wildlife trafficking—from small-scale smuggling in suitcases to vast shipments
by airplanes or freight containers.
   In addition, the report revealed that private actors are often ignorant of their
role in the trade chain. A rhino tusk sawn off in East Africa ends up in the hands
of consumers thousands of miles away in Asia, Europe, or the United States, often
having crossed multiple borders without the knowledge of those transporting
them.
   If we are to crack down on wildlife crime, this trade must be stifled.
   Thus I am very pleased to tell you that, under the auspices of United for
Wildlife, an international taskforce is being formed to work with the transport
industry—from airlines to shipping lines—to examine the industry’s role in illegal
wildlife trade and identify how it can help break the chain between suppliers and
consumers.
   The taskforce will bring together key partners and representatives of the trans-
port industry, supported by expert legal advice. It will draw together existing evi-
dence and information about the illegal wildlife trade, identify gaps in knowledge,
and commission research to fill those gaps. The taskforce will call on companies
to implement zero tolerance policies towards illegal wildlife trade. Criminals can
exploit weak and corrupt standards—so, working together, we must raise those
standards.
   I am delighted that William Hague, the former British Foreign Secretary and
Chair of the London Conference on the Illegal Wildlife Trade held earlier this year,
is here today and has agreed to chair this new taskforce. Within a year the taskforce

will be working with the transport industry to develop recommendations on how
it can help shut down wildlife trafficking trade routes—with the sole intention that
the implementation of these recommendations will lead to a tangible, significant
reduction in illegal wildlife trade.
    Cooperation is our greatest weapon against the poachers and traffickers who
rely on evading individual national initiatives. By taking a truly international
approach, we can get one step ahead of them.
    Our collective goal must be to curtail the wildlife trade by making it harder:
denying traffickers access to transportation, erecting barriers to their illegal activ-
ities, and holding people accountable for their actions. Those who look the other
way, or spend the illicit proceeds of these crimes, must be held to account.
    Some people may say that this task is impossibly difficult. It is true that like any
organized crime, the illegal wildlife trade is a many-headed hydra. Tackling it will
be a complex challenge.
    But complexity brings out the best in human ingenuity. Here in America, for
example, the groundbreaking Fish and Wildlife Service Forensics Laboratory is
the world’s only lab devoted to crimes against wildlife, capable of extracting DNA
from trafficked goods that can be used to trace traffickers. Another highly com-
mendable example is in China, where the government has been working with local
NGOs to curb the trade in shark fins. There is also great potential for applying data
analytics to model and predict trade flows.
    Furthermore, recent research on behalf of Born Free USA shows that transit
points are fairly concentrated along the supply chain from Africa to Asian con-
sumer markets. The bulk of the trade might involve as few as 100–200 shipping
containers a year, 10 “chokepoint” transshipment ports, and 3 airports. If we can
identify those transit points, enforce regulation, and cooperate with the private
sector, we can start to clamp down on illegal wildlife trafficking.
    Some members of the private sector are already leading the way. Air
New Zealand recently set an important precedent on the transport of wildlife
parts by banning the carriage of shark fins on its planes—regardless of whether
they were legally obtained. Many other airlines followed its lead, and though
some imposed a less stringent standard requiring a permit for all shark fins, such
actions show the powerful role that the private sector can play in interrupting
the supply chain—if they choose to do so.
    In criminal justice, INTERPOL recently issued a list of nine fugitives most
wanted for environmental crime, spearheading a stronger institutional response
to wildlife crime. The United for Wildlife taskforce will build on these positive
developments to encourage global action to shatter the illegal wildlife trade.
    As we consider the growing threat to wildlife, the corrosive impact of the trade
on human dignity and development worldwide, and all the means we have to
combat it, we should be utterly determined to see this goal through to success.

             Integrity Vice Presidency, World Bank Group
The focus of the 2014 ICHA meeting was on “following the money” to combat
the vast illicit outflows that are hampering economic development and poverty
reduction, and on ending impunity for corruption. “Ending impunity” is intended
to capture the objectives of both enforcement and accountability measures. This
year we shared know-how and experiences in the use of both traditional and alter-
native approaches to fighting corruption. Our hope was to encourage participants
to think out of the box, to identify new and innovative tools to help anti-corruption
practitioners from around the world in our shared global fight against corruption.
   This conference is the result of the collective work of the World Bank Group’s
Integrity Vice Presidency, the Global Governance Practice, the Stolen Asset
Recovery (StAR) Initiative, Financial Market Integrity, the Risk, Finance and
Strategy Group of the International Finance Corporation, as well as the contribu-
tions of numerous individual experts and speakers from across the World Bank
Group and around the globe. I would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to all
who contributed time and expertise to make this event possible. Thank you for a
very productive meeting, and a learning experience for all.

When companies bribe public officials—domestic or foreign—it has direct
and damaging social and economic consequences. Contracts are not awarded to
the most qualified suppliers. Prices get inflated. Substandard materials or con-
struction methods are used to cover bribe payments. And environmental safe-
guards are ignored or eroded.
   As a result, public trust in government weakens and opportunities for legitimate
players in business markets are damaged. The OECD Convention on Combating
Bribery, U.K. Bribery Act, and U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act are vital pil-
lars of global efforts to curb cross-border bribery. But recent assessments of their
enforcement and effects show that much remains to be done.1 The global law
enforcement community—including members of the International Corruption
Hunters Alliance (ICHA)—has a vital role to play in stepping up the enforcement
and effectiveness of these instruments.
   The 41 countries that are party to the OECD convention account for about two-
thirds of global exports. Yet a recent assessment by Transparency International
found that 15 years after that Convention went into force, 22 of those countries
were doing little or nothing to enforce it, and 8 had only ­limited enforcement.2
   Enforcement of the U.K. Bribery Act and U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act has
largely affected payers rather than recipients of bribes. Recent studies by StAR and
U4 have examined how national authorities could use these instruments to help
launch investigations (including parallel investigations), step up domestic prose-
cutions, and engage in settlement discussions or proceedings.
   This session featured a moderated discussion and open question and answer
session on the following topics:

••   What should ICHA members know about recent trends in enforcement and
     the expected international impacts of antibribery legislation?
••   What should ICHA members know about the OECD convention and about
     stepping up its enforcement?
••   What is the reach and what are the possible implications for national author-
     ities of the U.K. and U.S. foreign antibribery laws?
••   How can ICHA members use all of these instruments to help initiate investi-
     gations and pursue domestic prosecutions?
••   What tools and techniques should national authorities be enhancing to use
     these instruments?

  Increased enforcement and participation not only by the parties to the OECD
convention but also by additional countries could have enormous impacts,

including a shift in global views on corruption. Better cooperation among national
law enforcement authorities is vital to making this happen.
    The panelists also discussed the legal underpinnings of international anticor-
ruption investigations and prosecutions in the United Kingdom and United States.
These include the the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) which prohibits
transnational bribery, the U.K. Bribery Act, which prohibits U.K. companies and
individuals from bribing foreign officials; and the U.S. Kleptocracy Asset Recovery
Initiative, through which the U.S. government executes forfeitures of property that
was wrongfully obtained—including through bribery. The panelists provided a
detailed tutorial on what the laws require and how they deliver successful enforce-
ment outcomes.
    Though the U.K. and U.S. laws are national instruments, they have international
implications. For instance, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act applies to both U.S.
entities and to foreign entities doing business in the United States. Mr. Kahn dis-
cussed how formal and informal information sharing with law enforcement agen-
cies in several jurisdictions recently helped the U.S. Department of Justice bring
charges against four foreign individuals and ­ several companies.
    In addition, through its Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative, the United
States not only initiates its own asset forfeiture actions, but also enforces foreign
­governments’ forfeiture judgments in the United States. For example, the Initiative
 recently enforced a U.K. restraint order of more than $7 million against a former
 governor of Nigeria.



Recommendations to strengthen
cooperation in the fight against
cross-border bribery
Given the increasing trends in cross-border bribery, the panelists recommended
strengthening international cooperation among national authorities by means of
the following:

••   Maintain active conversations and relationships with foreign counterparts.
••   Take advantage of resources available under existing legal frameworks—
     including treaties, global networks, and foreign bribery enforcement actions.
••   Use foreign antibribery instruments to help launch their own investigations,
     step up domestic prosecutions, and engage in settlement discussions or
     proceedings.

In recent years the importance  of curbing illicit financial flows has been
receiving  increasing attention. Though the amount of such flows remains a
source of dispute, they are believed to significantly exceed aid and foreign direct
investment. Illicit financial flows are both a drain on development and a symptom
­
   corruption—undermining growth and shared prosperity.
of ­
   Opened by Sri Mulyani Indrawati, Managing Director and Chief Operating
Officer of the World Bank Group, this session highlighted the importance of
curbing illicit financial flows (IFFs), including as a symptom of corruption and
underlying illegal or unethical activities that negatively impact growth and shared
prosperity.
   Moderated by Jamila Trindle (Foreign Policy), the session brought together
complementary perspectives on this multi-faceted and challenging topic:

••   Civil society’s views, expectations and advocacy were highlighted by Robert
     Palmer who stressed in particular the critical importance to deliver concrete
     progress on beneficial ownership—and more generally enhanced transpar-
     ency around financial flows, both in developed and developing countries;
••   Giovanni Kessler brought the law enforcement perspective, stressing how taking
     action against criminals and their ill-gotten gains is both a needed response to
     specific criminal activities, but also a deterrence signal that crime does not pay;
••   Jennifer Fowler highlighted the priority given by a major financial center like
     the US to tackle financial crime and illicit finance, through the mobilization
     of all relevant instruments, and the leadership taken by the US—with the G7
     and the G20—to foster global progress.

    Panelists stressed the importance to act both on the illegal underlying activities
and on the associated money flows, and how critical international cooperation is to
results. In addition to providing anticorruption and law enforcement practitioners
the opportunity to better grasp the linkages between illicit financial flows, cor-
ruption and more generally action against organized crime, the session provided
a bird-eye’s view of the wealth of on-going global, regional and national initia-
tives relevant to addressing IFF—not least by bringing together sometimes discon-
nected agendas (for instance, the importance to foster cooperation between law
enforcement, anticorruption authorities and tax authorities). The practical exam-
ples put forward by the panelists in their opening statements and during the rich
“questions and answers” also allowed participants to consider the strong conver-
gence between panelists on the objectives and outcomes pursued, while realizing
the on-going discussions on the various tools and paths available to achieve them.
    At a time where the post-2015 development agenda and the Financing for
Development agenda generate a sense of urgency in addressing the challenge of
Illicit Financial Flows, this session contributed to a stronger appreciation of the
scale and complexity of the problem, while putting at the forefront the need for
action and to mobilize a multiplicity of actors to achieve lasting impact.

22                                              Ending Impunity for Corruption
Addressing conflict and fragility is high on the World Bank Group’s agenda
for ending extreme poverty by 2030. The Bank knows that ending extreme poverty
will greatly depend on the progress made in fragile and conflict-affected states—
and that effective management of natural resources is one of the biggest challenges
facing such states.
   Exploitation of high-value natural resources—including oil, gas, minerals,
and timber—is often a key factor in triggering, prolonging, and financing violent
­
conflict around the world. Violent conflict is most likely to occur when:

••   Local communities are systematically excluded from decision-making
     processes.
••   Economic benefits are concentrated in the hands of a few.
••   Activities associated with extractive industries are at odds with local social,
     cultural, religious, and environmental norms, or align with preexisting
     tensions.

   The price paid by societies threatened by, undergoing, or emerging from natural
resource–related violence is evidenced in the lives lost to or touched by conflict,
and amplified by fractured relationships, weakened institutions, and destroyed
infrastructure.
   As the world’s population continues to grow and the demand for resources con-
tinues to rise, high-value resources in fragile states are becoming the next frontier
for an intensified resource scramble. At least 80 percent of fragile states (as defined
by the OECD) contain high-value natural resources of strategic relevance to the
global economy.
   Harnessing resource wealth is a mixed blessing for fragile states and post-­
conflict countries. On the one hand, it has the potential to self-finance transfor-
mative development. But it can also be a missed opportunity of tragic proportions
because these countries also have the lowest capacity to capture the many bene-
fits of natural resources without triggering new sources of conflict, causing major
environmental degradation, or unleashing the “resource curse.”
   Weak management in the natural resource sector—and the opportunities it
engenders for corruption—is a key factor in triggering, financing, and prolonging
conflicts. As countries and companies compete at an unprecedented pace to secure
exploration licenses and concessions, fragile states are particularly vulnerable to
poor contract terms, nontransparent decisionmaking, and corruption. Corruption
risks can occur at every step of the value chain, from awarding contracts to deter-
mining how revenues are spent. Yet fragile states have only one chance to get
resource transformation right. Success offers the potential for stability and
­
development—while failure holds the potential for conflict, increased fragility,
and perpetual aid dependence.
   To prevent natural resource wealth from being pillaged and plundered,
many fragile states are seeking international assistance to adopt innovative,

forward-­ looking policies and safeguards to protect and manage their resource
endowments. Efforts include promoting transparency and accountability in reve-
­
nue management, developing mechanisms to resolve conflicts, involving the pub-
lic in decisionmaking, and ensuring the fair distribution of benefits. Put simply,
the goal is to capitalize on the promise of natural resources while avoiding the
peril.
   The session featured a moderated discussion with expert practitioners sharing
lessons with ICHA members on:

••   The types of corruption risks in the extractives sector.
••   The opportunities for corruption that arise in the extractives value chain.
••   Possible approaches and opportunities for addressing and mitigating these
     risks.

The session was highlighted by extensive discussions from both speakers on recent
advances in information flows on contracts and revenues related to extractive
industries in fragile states. Transnational efforts such as the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative, Publish What You Pay, and Open Contracting have
broken new ground in tracking natural resource contract provisions, revenue, and
­
use. Such information should be extremely valuable in preventing, identifying,
and sanctioning corruption.
   Eddie Rich presented examples from Ghana, Liberia, and Nigeria where infor-
mation disclosed through the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative was
used to identify missing revenue and the failure by government officials to follow
legally mandated procedures. Daniel Kaufmann presented data from the Resource
Governance Index—produced by the Natural Resource Governance Institute—
which showed that 80 percent of governments do not meet basic governance stan-
dards in extractive industries.
   The subsequent discussion focused on how better information flows and data
analysis in extractive industries could support anticorruption efforts in fragile
states. For maximum impact, anticorruption authorities must know about infor-
mation sources and use information when determining where to focus their inves-
tigative efforts. Information initiatives also create platforms for anticorruption
coalitions linking nonstate actors, government officials, and private firms.
   Information on corruption in extractive industries can also be used by offi-
cials in developed countries through the enforcement of foreign anticorruption
laws, such as the U.K. Bribery Act and U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Many
­
participants were quick to identify challenges in obtaining the type of information
required to identify and prosecute specific transgressions and the need to expand
on the promising work that has begun.

This session discussed corruption remedies beyond criminal investigations
and prosecutions. It began with a roundtable discussion of nonprosecutorial
options, followed by the presentation of a detailed case study on using civil actions
to recover stolen assets, based on a new publications by the Stolen Asset Recovery
Initiative, Public Wrongs, Private Actions (https://star.worldbank.org/star/publication​
/­public-wrongs-private-actions)
   The roundtable discussion generated the following broad recommendations:

••    To combat corruption successfully, authorities must engage in prevention, edu-
      cation, detection, and enforcement. Each of these elements, standing alone, is
      insufficient. But combined, creative efforts on all these fronts can achieve results.
••    Prevention should promote transparency. It should include analyses of
      gaps in regulations and procedures, particularly for state-owned enterprises.
      And would benefit from the inclusion of civil society participation in procure-
      ment, as occurs in Mexico and Rwanda, and in project supervision, where an
      informed civil society and the press can serve as watchdogs.
••    Enforcement should include restitution, particularly in cases involving theft
      of public funds. Given the importance of swift action in such cases, asset
      recovery should be allowed before related criminal actions are completed.
••    Because a range of tools are needed to fight corruption, enforcement authori-
      ties must be legally authorized to use all of them. Authorities should not face
      prohibitions on filing noncriminal cases or face restrictions on when such
      cases can be filed.
••    Because timely enforcement is essential to ending impunity, specialized anti-
      corruption courts may be needed. Such courts could be at the national level,
      as is the case in Cameroon, for example. The suggestion of an international
      anticorruption court was raised (a paper by U.S. District Judge Mark Wolf was
      shared with participants). One challenge for the creation of an international
      court is that some officials may be immune from prosecution while in office,
      and so initially subject only to impeachment.



     Why make greater use of civil remedies?
     •	   Lower standard of proof (often preponderance of evidence);
     •	   Specifically address the financial consequences of corruption;
     •	   A claim for damages is specifically useful to overcome problems where
          the link between the (stolen) asset and the (illegal) misconduct is weak;
     •	   “Deeper pockets” to sue (and more of them) extend the scope of poten-
          tial defendants and liabilities to intermediaries and enablers;
     •	   Well adapted to jurisdictions where criminal liability does not extend to
          corporations and only individuals are subject to criminal prosecutions.

Time, immunity, and impunity: practical
implications for asset recovery
••   Parties pursuing a civil action might seek to have assets frozen in other juris-
     dictions, but those freezes are time-limited. Thus efficient resolution of the
     underlying case is critical to ensuring that an asset freeze remains effective.
••   Laws that extend immunity to public officials may preclude enforcement of
     foreign judgments against those officials. This can limit the results of suits
     brought overseas if the assets being sought for recovery are in the official’s
     home country.
••   Kenya has a flexible tool under which restitution can be ordered in any case
     where a public official’s stated assets are disproportionate to his or her legal
     sources of income. This approach may merit consideration in other jurisdictions.

Much of the focus on fighting corruption  is on prosecuting the bribe
makers and bribe takers. But corruption prevention efforts should also focus on
reducing risks in government agencies and public administration—the people and
processes that develop policies and provide services to citizens. This session pre-
sented innovative approaches to changing a culture of impunity and managing
the risks of corruption in public administration, drawing on experiences from a
selection of middle- and high-income economies.
   The tools and approaches presented in this session build on common key
principles used in fighting corruption: transparency, accountability, and partici-
­
pation (TAP).

••   A new anticorruption law in Italy, for example, focuses prevention at both the
     agency level (by requiring the development of anticorruption plans and the
     identification of risks), and at the individual level (by requiring formal anti-
     corruption training for all public servants). The National School of Public
     Administration in Italy has been charged with helping agencies develop
     their plans and with designing anticorruption training courses, with some
     assistance from the World Bank.
••   Latvia’s anticorruption authority, the Corruption Prevention and
     Combating Bureau (KNAB), takes a more holistic approach to address-
     ing corruption in public administration. The Bureau enforces the country’s
     conflict of interest law, reviews public officials’ disclosures, raises public
     ­
     awareness, and develops training programs in addition to investigating cor-
     ruption allegations. The bureau also uses citizen perception surveys to help
     focus its corruption prevention activities on agencies and offices that pose the
     greatest corruption risks.
••   The Republic of Korea’s Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission
     (ACRC) plays a more direct role in preventing corruption in public
     administration. Through its corruption impact assessments, the commission
     ­
     reviews agencies’ proposed laws and regulations and recommends revisions
     to reduce corruption risks. Like Latvia’s anticorruption authority, the ACRC
     uses public perception surveys to identify agency-level corruption risks,
     then conducts agency-level integrity assessments and provides integrity con-
     sulting services to help agencies improve their policies and practices. The
     ACRC also helps enforce the country’s Code of Conduct for Public Officials
     by developing integrity training courses that are mandatory for promotion
     in the civil service.

Common objectives
Some recurring themes among the activities discussed during the session were
each country’s efforts to:

••   Operationalize the Transparency, Accountability and Participation (TAP)
     concepts;
••   Focus on concrete tools and measures to help civil servants reduce the risk of
     corruption;
••   Change the culture of impunity;
••   Monitor results.

Big data is one of the fastest-growing buzz terms in recent memory. A lot
of the news about big data is alarming—from hacking to leaks to stolen informa-
tion. But can the power of big data be used for good?
   Corruption fighters everywhere are waking up to the potential of all kinds of data:
big data, open data, and data analytics to transform how anticorruption authorities
can detect, investigate, and better monitor corruption risks in development financ-
ing, public spending, and government contracts. Can answers to investigators’ ques-
tions be found in big data sources? And if so, how do we find them?
   There are a wide range of data mining sources and methods available to anticor-
ruption practitioners, although data analytics and visualization to identify corrup-
tion risks is still an emerging field. This session presented a number of approaches
to inform and inspire participants about the potential of these tools and their pos-
sible applications in ICHA members’ own jurisdictions.
   Sheila Coronel chaired the session and provided an introduction to open data
and the growing impact of data analytics in holding governments and institutions
accountable. She asked the audience how big data should be used to obtain evi-
dence of wrongdoing.

The Pen is Mightier than the Sword
Journalists are doing some of the most interesting and effective work involving data
and corruption. Marina Walker Guevara discussed the Offshore Leaks Database
(https://offshoreleaks.icij.org) which provided public access to data on more than
100,000 offshore shell companies, trusts, and funds. One hundred journalists ana-
lyzed these data for nine months, then began publishing their ­  findings—revealing

the hidden dealings of the rich and powerful, including the banks that facilitated
the deals and hid the money.
  In such cases the keys to effecting change are:

••   Delivering a useful source of data to the public;
••   Providing an easy way to work with it;
••   Putting the data in the hands of people with local knowledge who can see
     patterns that would not otherwise be noticed.

Finding the haystack before the needle
What should you do when you think you have no data? Dr. Mihaly Fazekas dis-
cussed using procurement bidding data to evaluate public procurement perfor-
mance. Data collection and database building are the first steps. In Hungary,
government administrative data are plentiful, but it needs a lot of work to system-
ize and scrub it to become usable for analysis.
    Once the data are assembled, the main challenge is to ask the right questions
and decide which data to use. The key types of data for analyzing corruption risk
include procurement data, company data, ownership and management data, and
data on public officials. Dr. Fazekas presented a methodology for identifying indi-
cators of institutional corruption that he and his colleagues developed by analyz-
ing large volumes of public administrative data. The Hungary analysis revealed
government favoritism of companies through data patterns on “surprise” ­   winners
and losers of procurement processes (Corruption Research Center Budapest
http://www.crcb.eu)
    Dr. Fazekas will be working at Cambridge University to launch the Digital
Whistleblower project (www.hertie-school.org/facultyandresearch/research-projects​
/­research-projects/digiwhist/) which will compile and coordinate data from 35
European countries to try to identify red flags in public procurement. Dr Fazekas
was winner of the 2014 U4 Proxy Challenge on Indicators of Corruption www​.u4​

Money laundering, tax evasion, and health
Professor Alvaro J. Riascos Villegas (www.alvaroriascos.com) presented his recent
work on mining administrative government health data in Colombia to detect
anomalous claims and transactions, and presented plans for a new project he is
developing in partnership with Colombia’s Financial Intelligence Unit to detect
money laundering risks using government data.
   This research focuses on mining government datasets to improve pol-
icymaking. Colombia has a wealth of administrative information. The key to
finding indicators is to compare data results against expectations—that is, aver-
ages under ­similar circumstances. A wide variety of challenges and risks were

computing power, and guarding against data that are manipulated, misreported,
and may contain errors.

It’s who you know
Professor Eric Rozier presented a methodology for examining procurement and
investigation data using public data. His work was supported by a partnership with
the World Bank Group’s Integrity Vice Presidency and the Data Science for Social
Good program (www.dssg.io, http://dataengineering.org/research/home/) at the
University of Chicago in collaboration with the University of Cincinnati.
   The project is seeking to identify patterns indicative of where—and where not—
to investigate possible corruption. Lessons from the project include:

••    One of the most important categories of information when examining pro-
      curement data for indicators of collusion and corruption is on the companies
      not chosen.
••    Unique identifiers for vendors or suppliers make any analysis easier and more
      accurate, and name disambiguation is a necessary part of any analysis.
••    An important predictive feature is a company’s proximity to “bad actor”
      companies (such as how often they appear as co-bidders or in co-bidding
      networks).

Ending Impunity for Corruption                                             35
Globally, more attention is being paid to the need for more effective m­ echanisms
to facilitate reporting and protect whistleblowers who report ­   corruption. Civil
society groups and concerned individuals are increasingly becoming engaged
in unveiling corruption by public officials or in transactions that involve public
money. This is creating an opportunity and a demand for ­    governments to facili-
tate reporting and to provide reassurances to whistleblowers that they will be pro-
tected from retaliation as a consequence of their vigilance.
   How best to do this will differ across jurisdictions and cultures. There is a
growing body of advice on good practices, particularly from jurisdictions with
well-established mechanisms for protecting workplace whistleblowers or public
interest disclosures. Helped by the momentum provided by the implementation
of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC), anticorruption
authorities around the world are working to strengthen their reporting mecha-
nisms and—in many cases—identify strategies for implementing new whistle-
blower protection laws and channels.
   A number of core questions or concerns are coming into focus for governments
and international development actors. These include questions such as the following:
••    What is meant by whistleblower protection in the context of corruption reporting?
••    What are some of the challenges in implementing protections? What are some
      emerging good practices?
••    Can rewards or bounties enhance the impacts of whistleblower systems?
••    What are some of the emerging practices in reporting tools and technologies?
••    What are some innovations in the uses of IT tools to facilitate reporting and
      the protection of the identity of reporting persons?
••    What valuable lessons can be applied from OECD countries and recent public
      interest disclosure laws to more challenging corruption reporting environments?
••    Should anonymous reporting be allowed or encouraged?
••    How can anticorruption authorities build the trust and engagement of citizen
      whistleblowers to enhance the impact of reporting channels?
   This session addressed some of these questions with examples of experiences
from two jurisdictions—Peru and Bhutan—and the perspectives of two interna-
tional organizations—the UNODC and the OECD.

     Highlights from the discussion included the following:


Peru—Contraloría General de la República
    (Office of the Inspector General)
Carla Salazar Lui Lam, General Secretary
The whistleblower protection law was passed in Peru in 2010. Protections apply
to those who report fraud and corruption to the Inspector General’s Office (IGO).

36                                                     Ending Impunity for Corruption
Public attitudes and confidence are a challenge. Surveys prior to the new legis-
lation showed Peruvians were not used to reporting corruption allegations and/
or were scared to report. They also had little confidence in public institutions
responsible for handling allegations of fraud and corruption. Even more of a
challenge is that tolerance levels for high levels of corruption appeared to have
increased.
   To address the above challenges, in 2010 the IGO introduced the National
System for Handling Allegations of Fraud and Corruption (Sistema Nacional
de Atención de Denuncias, SINAD). SINAD operates both at the National and
Regional levels, and is certified under ISO 2001. The IGO also launched a cam-
paign raising awareness among voters that “Whoever votes for corruption, isn’t a
victim of corruption but its accomplice.”

Protections and incentives under the legal framework in Peru encompass mea-
sures such as the following:

••   Job stability—protection from dismissal for those who report allegations of
     fraud and corruption;
••   Rewards for those who report allegations of fraud and corruption (up to 50%
     of fines imposed);
••   Protection of the whistleblower’s identity (each reporting person is assigned
     an identification number);
••   Protection against retaliation;
••   Mitigation for those who admit to having been involved in wrongdoing.

   Reporting levels have increased since the introduction of the National
System  for Handling Allegations of Fraud and Corruption (SINAD). The IGO
has also found that outreach to civil society groups has improved the quality of
complaints.
   Continued efforts to strengthen the system are based on the premise that
whistleblower protection systems should be based on the actual needs that whis-
tleblowers experience in a given jurisdictions. As such, areas for ongoing develop-
ment in Peru include the following:

••   Making it possible to submit anonymous complaints, which are currently not
     admissible for initiating investigations;
••   Sanctions for those who disclose information about whistleblowers who are
     cooperating with investigators: it is common practice for the media to access
     and publish information about complainants/whistleblowers;
••   Ensure legal aid is available to whistleblowers who end up being sued or pros-
     ecuted as a result of their good faith disclosure;
••   Extending current whistleblower protections to private sector executives
     and employees and to companies (the legislation protects individuals, not
     companies). A proposal currently being considered, for example, would


Ending Impunity for Corruption                                                  37
     automatically grant a permit/authorization requested by a company if that
     company reports the solicitation of a bribe by a public official;
••   Creating a monitoring entity (Entidad de Control Laboral) to protect whistle-
     blowers from labor retaliation;
••   Identify suitable special protection measures to deal with cases that involve
     organized crime.



     Bhutan—Anti-Corruption Commission
Dorji Thinlay, Director
Bhutan does not have stand-alone legislation for whistleblower protection, but
has aligned its laws with the UNCAC (Bhutan has not yet ratified the UNCAC.)
Whistleblowers are the eyes and ears of the Anticorruption Commission. With
a population of only 700,000 people, protecting whistleblowers is perhaps even
more challenging: “How to protect whistleblowers in a small country where every-
body knows everybody.”

Anonymous complaints are accepted (encompassed in the Anticorruption Act of
2011); the objective being to encourage complainants to come forward: the ACC
is interested in the facts of the case, more than the identity of the complainant.
Interestingly, the proportion of anonymous complaints has declined from 84% in
2006, when the ACC was launched, to 44% in 2013. Increased confidence in the
ACC’s handling of complaint information is a possible contributing factor.

Confidentiality: The Commission is responsible for protecting the strict confi-
dentiality of the identity of the complainant. This can be done by holding ex-parte

Retaliation is a crime. Retaliation against a complainant constitutes a criminal
offense and can be prosecuted.

The United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) now has 172 States
Parties. The UNCAC includes specific provisions for the protection of reporting
persons (“whistleblowers”) under articles 15–42, including “measures and sys-
tems to facilitate reporting” as well as “measures to provide protection against

unjustified treatment for any person who reports in good faith.” Protections apply
both to the public and private sectors.

Witnesses vs Whistleblowers. The protection of witnesses and expert witnesses
(Article 32) and reporting persons (Article 33) are dealt with separately in the
UNCAC because of the different circumstances faced by each. Protection for
reporting persons (“whistleblowers”) are wider than for the protection of witnesses.

Civil society engagement. Articles 5-14 of the UNCAC include provisions aimed
at fostering civil society participation in monitoring integrity;

Some lessons learned from monitoring the implementation of the UNCAC:

••   Different States Parties have different approaches to whistleblower protection.
     Some countries accept anonymous complaints, others do not; some extend
     protection to the private sector, whereas other countries only protect public
     officials who report allegations;
••   Many member states lack institutions responsible for monitoring the enforce-
     ment of whistleblower protections;
••   Some member states do not have the institutional capacity or mechanisms in
     place to protect whistleblowers;
••   Many countries still need to reform their legislation to comply with the pro-
     visions of the UNCAC

  UNODC is preparing a publication on whistleblower protections to assist States
Parties in their implementation of the UNCAC.

••   A clear distinction needs to made between whistleblower and witness
     protection. The two are often conflated in policy discussions, but are very
     ­
     ­
     different. The objective of whistleblower protection is to encourage people to
     report allegations. The importance of this is underscored by a private sector
     study which showed 60% of potential complainants expressed fear of work-
     place retaliation. Other reasons people gave for not reporting included the
     belief that no action would result from their report, and a desire not to nega-
     tively affect peers. It is important to address these barriers so as to encourage
     reporting.
••   Facilitating reporting is also very important. The G20 has issued Guiding
     Principles on whistleblower protection. These include the need for reporting


Ending Impunity for Corruption                                                     39
     guidelines and protections to be widely accessible and expressed in plain
     language.
••   There is a wide variety in international practice: some countries have ded-
     icated legislation protecting whistleblowers, others do not. The OECD is
     preparing to publish model legislation that will compile best practices in
     whistleblower protection. This will assist countries that are developing or
     strengthening their laws. Although difficult, it would be very interesting to
     assess the degree to which whistleblower protection laws have an impact on
     reporting. Experiences in Peru for example—described above—indicate that
     an increase in reporting was experienced after the introduction of the elec-
     tronic reporting system—SINAD.
••   For reporting mechanisms to have an impact, there needs to be a change in
     culture as well. Again, this varies across jurisdictions. But in many contexts
     what needs to happen is for reporting corruption to be perceived as accept-
     able and the normal way of doing things.

Integrity compliance now forms  an integral part of national and global
standards and practices applicable to the private sector. These include the US
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the related US federal sentencing guidelines,
which provide for a detailed description of what is to be considered an effective
compliance and ethics program. The more recent UK Bribery Act added a new
dimension on integrity compliance by expanding the scope of the Act beyond an
individual transaction or event, to consider the corporate environment in which
the corruption took place, and by adopting the concept of “pre-existing adequate
procedures” a company may have in place to prevent corruption. Similarly, integ-
rity compliance is specifically endorsed and encouraged by UNCAC; the OECD
Good Practice Guidance on Internal Controls, Ethics and Compliance; the
International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Rules on Combating Corruption; the
World Economic Forum (WEF) Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (PACI)
Principles for Countering Bribery; World Bank Group Integrity Compliance
Guidelines; the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Anti-Corruption
Code of Conduct for Business; and the Transparency International Business
Principles for Countering Bribery.
   The national and global standards, regulations, and incentives promoting integ-
rity compliance are responsible in large measure for the growing trend among
private entities worldwide to make integrity compliance programs a core part of
­
their operating frameworks. The assumptions underlying this regulatory trend,
increasingly endorsed by the emerging experience, is that such programs enhance
the integrity of private sector actors and transactions through increased transpar-
ency, greater company vigilance, cultural shifts towards higher ethics and integ-
rity, more effective risk mitigation, and closer collaboration with enforcement
authorities, including through more timely disclosures. The experience also shows
that, to  be effective, such programs must be adapted to the specific reality and
operations of each company and promote implementation of concrete solutions
that best fit the company’s unique business, structure and risk exposure.
   Learning from the experience to date, and faced with the impact of increas-
ing regulation and expectations in the integrity compliance area, private compa-
nies operating globally have called on legislators and standard-setting bodies to
streamline integrity compliance requirements, do more to create a level playing
field and provide incentives for businesses that invest in integrity, and reflect the
necessary flexibility to enable adequate customization of integrity compliance pro-
grams to fit the varying sizes, structures and risk exposure of different compa-
nies. The marketplace has also responded to the growing demand for integrity
compliance solutions with various certification options by a range of private enti-
ties and professional associations. While the tools and guides often developed by
entities promoting certification may be useful particularly for smaller companies,
seeking to reduce the time and cost associated with the development of custom-
ized integrity compliance programs, the panel warned that certification needs to


42                                                   Ending Impunity for Corruption
be approached with great caution to avoid the mainstreaming of cookie-cutter
approaches, bureaucratic processes and box-ticking exercises, which are not syn-
onymous with effective integrity compliance programs.
   Another area discussed by the panel focused on the challenges faced by pri-
vate companies when dealing with public entities that are not subject to the same
standards in the integrity compliance area, including state owned enterprises and
other public participants in public investment projects. The panel noted some
interesting developments in this area, including the effort to introduce integrity
standards for public entities, currently underway in the Province of Quebec,
Canada, in response to the corruption and collusion scandals involving both the
private and public sectors.
   The panel members also emphasized the importance of collective action in
which the support of international organizations like the World Bank Group can
play a key role. The experience of the Maersk-initiated Maritime Anti-Corruption
Network (MACN) in Nigeria, described by its chair, Ms. Müller Torbrand, was
brought forward as a great example of collective action involving the network
members, the public sector, and civil society, which is delivering promising results.
The panel also stressed that collective action is especially beneficial to smaller
companies which often need to leverage resources and share the costs of compli-
ance. The panel therefore called on the World Bank Group to do more in this area
and work with its public and private sector partners to support integrity compli-
ance efforts through the promotion of the right incentives, tools and appropriate
integrity standards.

Governments invest enormous sums to promote, maintain, and restore the health
of their citizens. But fraud and corruption—in the purchase of medicines and medical
supplies, delivery of medical services, or responses to health crises—undermine prog-
ress, make citizens distrust their governments, weaken healthcare systems, and can
result in prolonged illness and suffering, premature death, and massive financial losses.
   Raising awareness of integrity risks in the health sector is among the priorities
of the World Bank Group’s Integrity Vice Presidency. The Vice Presidency recently
released an overview of some of the key issues in the health sector, based on its
experience and relevant literature.
   The session focused on two areas. The first related to combating corruption in
supply chains for medicines and medical devices. The panel discussed approaches
and agreed that timely information sharing as well as coordinated and focused col-
laboration among relevant stakeholders can make a difference in the fight against
substandard, spurious, falsely labeled, falsified, and counterfeit medical products.
   The second topic dealt with corruption during health crises. The recent out-
break of Ebola in Liberia and Sierra Leone was used as an example of how fraud
and corruption undermine health systems and can seriously hamper the ability
of countries to respond to health crises. The panel agreed that involving integ-
rity institutions in countries early on and focusing on preventive activities can
enhance transparency in how aid money is used and increase the effectiveness of
efforts to respond to such crises.


Substandard, spurious, falsely labeled,
falsified, and counterfeit medical products
Substandard, spurious, falsely labeled, falsified, and counterfeit medical products
were the main topic of the session. Corruption, a major enabling factor in the
proliferation of such products, can take a wide variety of forms, from petty—or
large—bribes at ports to rigged bids on major procurements. In this fight, the panel
called for holistic, multi-stakeholder approaches to prevention and enforcement.
   The panel agreed that such products affect both developed and developing coun-
tries, and raised concerns about the possible links between such products and terrorist

activities. They agreed that the issues related to corrupted and corruption in medi-
cines and medical devices can be found in nearly every jurisdiction and can involve
expensive branded as well as generic drugs. Moreover, lifesaving medications are
increasingly under attack, including those to treat HIV/AIDS, cardiovascular disease,
cancer, tuberculosis, malaria, and many other afflictions. Such medications are often
falsified with few or no active ingredients. Vaccines have also recently been targeted.
   Panel members offered examples such as fake antimalarial medicines that carried
the World Health Organization logo—yet when tested, drugs proved to have no active
ingredients. These products were said to still be circulating in some African markets
and had been found in a number of hospitals and clinics. The panel explained how the
potentially high profits to be made from the sale of such medications have attracted
the attention of transnational criminal organizations. The illicit trafficking and sale of
counterfeit goods provides criminals with a significant source of income that is chan-
neled toward further production of fakes or finance other criminal or terrorist activities.
   The panel argued that efforts to mitigate such risks should focus on:

••   Prevention, to try to minimize the scope of the problem.
••   Detection, to identify them quickly before they spread and become engrained.
••   Response, such as successful prosecutions that result in meaningful convic-
     tions, not just arrests. Collaboration between national authorities can offer a
     lot in successful case prosecutions.

   In addition, data sharing needs to be faster and subject to fewer restrictions.
Healthcare priorities demand rapid dissemination of data between agencies to
ensure that potentially dangerous products are quickly withdrawn from the ­market.
Though enforcement agencies often want to safeguard ongoing investigations and
remain cautious about sharing information, informal data sharing is often the fast-
est way to ensure interagency collaboration between enforcement officials.
   The panelists noted that all the institutions faced serious dilemmas in deciding when
and how to take action. On the one hand, it is important to get information circulating
as soon as possible to save lives. But early notifications often allow criminals to destroy
evidence and evade investigation. Balancing the two is challenging but crucial.
   Again: holistic approaches are essential. Securing supply chains requires much
more consistency in the enforcement of rules, laws, and regulations. Beyond dis-
seminating information, the panel discussed that a concerted effort should include
reviews of existing systems, such as training investigators and prosecutors or even
strengthening existing laws. Though challenging, the enforcement community
must not shy away from it; the donor community should also be ready to help.
   To that end, a group of concerned entities—including the World Health
Organization, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, U.S. Agency for International
Development, and World Bank Group—are creating a voluntary collaboration hub
under a Global Steering Committee to be hosted by the Global Fund. The goal is to
promote awareness of the issues raised by substandard, spurious, falsely labeled,

falsified, and counterfeit medical products and to generate support for action.
Several working groups will focus on issues such as sharing data and knowledge,
bolstering enforcement, and addressing regulatory issues. Relevant information
will be disseminated through the ICHA network.


Corruption contributes to the length and
severity of health epidemics
The outbreak of Ebola in Liberia and Sierra Leone raised the question of how
much corruption contributes to such epidemics. Commissioners from the Anti-
Corruption Authorities of both countries argued that corruption seriously hinders
the ability of countries to adequately respond to health crisis in several ways:

••   Corruption undermines health systems. The absence of strong, trusted health
     systems increases a country’s vulnerability to health risks. The speakers argued
     that the health systems in both countries had been weakened by widespread
     corruption long before the Ebola outbreak. Despite millions of dollars hav-
     ing been spent on healthcare, basic equipment and supplies were still lacking.
     Petty corruption and absenteeism had further eroded peoples’ faith in the
     systems. As a result, the emergency response to the outbreak was slow, inade-
     quate, and itself at risk of further losses to fraud and corruption.
••   Emergency funds channeled through weak systems with low accountability may
     be lost to corruption. The international community responds to emergency
     health situations by mobilizing funds, medicine, equipment, and other forms
     of assistance. To avoid losses of aid funds, both speakers called for transpar-
     ency and tight fiscal monitoring. Donors should publish what they fund.
     Recipient countries should publish what they receive and what they spend.
     And anticorruption agencies should be seen as allies in these efforts.
••   A history of corruption in a country undermines trust. At the local level, some peo-
     ple believed that their government had come up with Ebola as a way to extract
     support from foreign donors. Even when Ebola had claimed too many lives to
     be discounted as a government-invented scam, ordinary citizens were slow to
     follow government directions on how to avoid risks, identify cases, and inform
     healthcare services. In a few cases, healthcare workers were victims of violence
     from communities. At the international level, a lack of trust led to slow-moving
     aid—resulting in delays that allowed the epidemic to spread further.

   Overall, emphasis was placed on the importance of involving integrity insti-
tutions, such as anticorruption agencies, as early as possible whenever there are
suspicions of abuse in the health sector. In addition to their investigative powers,
such institutions can implement preventive programs and help track the progress
of other actors in enforcement processes.

StAR estimated in 2011 that only $5 billion of the assets stolen by high-ranking
public officials—also known as politically exposed persons—had been repatriated
in the previous 15 years, a small fraction of the $20–40 billion estimated to have
been stolen each year over the same period. This huge gap shows that a number
of barriers still hinder asset recovery, despite early hopes that the United Nations
Convention Against Corruption could address them. Working with asset recovery
practitioners, StAR identified 29 barriers—legal, operational, and institutional—
and recommended actions for overcoming them. The findings were published by
StAR as the Barriers to Asset Recovery.
   Since 2011, the Arab Spring and Ukraine crisis have brought corruption and
asset recovery to the fore of the international agenda. Massive money laundering
cases are often perpetrated by highly, if not the highest, ranked public officials.
Panelists were asked to explore how the landscape has changed in light of recent
cases, and to discuss innovative solutions for overcoming old and new barriers
alike.
   The discussions demonstrated that some progress has been made in addressing
some barriers. In Ukraine, for example, administrative freezes—essentially orders
by foreign governments to banks and other entities to freeze assets—enabled the
rapid freezing of assets without the requirement of a judicial order or mutual legal
assistance request. In addition, practitioners acknowledged how coordination
with foreign counterparts—whether between financial intelligence units, police,
or prosecutors—had helped overcome barriers.
   Still, many barriers remain and have been difficult to overcome. Among the
various obstacles to asset recovery that were discussed, those most emphasized
included identifying the beneficial owner and untangling complex structures
involving companies from a number of foreign jurisdictions, international coop-
eration, and impunity.
   The complex ownership structures created by politically exposed persons
to  shield beneficial ownership continue to impede efforts to trace assets.
These  structures are complicated by the many jurisdictions involved, the
lack  of beneficial ownership information available from reporting entities,
the lack of  information from financial institutions captured or controlled by
politically exposed persons, the use of financial and nonfinancial intermediar-
­
ies, and the use of family members or associates acting on behalf of the polit-
ically exposed person—all of which need to be identified and linked to that
person.
   The panelists discussed some of the red flags they had observed in analyzing
these schemes and emphasized the importance of strong anti–money launder-
ing laws in providing the tools needed to unravel beneficial ownership, such as
monitoring and reporting of transactions of politically exposed persons and high-
risk customers, powers to freeze assets and monitor bank accounts, international
cooperation, and parallel investigations.

   Limited international cooperation continues to impede asset recovery efforts
at both the investigative stage (gathering of information and intelligence to trace
and freeze assets) and the collection of evidence for trial (mutual legal assistance).
Traditional barriers continue to include the differences in legal traditions and dif-
ficulty in understanding Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) requirements, arduous
procedural and evidentiary requirements of some jurisdictions, unreasonable
delays, and unbalanced notice requirements of some jurisdictions that result in the
tipping-off of perpetrators. Panelists emphasized how better informal cooperation
or pre-MLA cooperation (such as between financial intelligence units, police, and
prosecutors) continues to be an important requirement for overcoming some of
these barriers.
   Finally, the panel discussed how impunity continues to derail investigations,
particularly in developing countries. An indicted individual can typically be the
one who for years was the chief of an agency called on to disclose books, reveal
secrets, and provide evidence. This problem is even more complicated when per-
petrators have been holding power long enough to establish an intricate network
of relationships, based on business and power, that responds to rules of personal
fear and solidarity. In many cases the inaccuracy of information and the unreli-
ability of sources result in prosecutorial failure—undermining domestic efforts to
pursue cases and impeding efforts that may be occurring in foreign jurisdictions.

Financial disclosure by public officials is essential in the fight against cor-
ruption and can help build a climate of integrity in public service. Financial dis-
closure systems are receiving more attention and recognition from anticorruption
practitioners and policymakers because they combine prevention and detection
in a single tool. Financial disclosure data can trigger an investigation and provide
supporting evidence for an ongoing one. Such data can help detect incompatibili-
ties, abuse of power, illicit wealth, and can even provide useful leads to trace assets.
Its potential uses keep expanding. Yet in many countries the use of disclosures
could be expanded and made more systematic.
   The goal of this session was to provide participants with a new perspective on
financial disclosure data and to equip them with a better understanding of their
potential use in investigations. The session focused on the experiences of practi-
tioners from different regions that have used financial disclosures in investigations
of unethical behavior, conflicts of interest, and corruption-related offenses. The
panel put special emphasis on how disclosures were used to support investiga-
tions, providing practical recommendations. The panel also engaged in an open
dialogue with participants to encourage discussions on alternative uses of the data,
methodologies for analysis, first-hand experiences, and challenges faced.
   A poll conducted during the session showed an interesting sample of global
trends in asset disclosure. About three-quarters of participants said that they have
a functional financial disclosure system in their countries, and more than half said
that they had submitted a financial disclosure form in their official capacity. Even
though most participants are familiar with asset disclosure systems, the poll also
showed that there is still room for growth and improvement.
   About 72 percent of the participants rated the effectiveness of the asset decla-
ration system in their countries as between medium and very low. When asked
about possible areas for improvement, the highest number of participants selected
strengthening the verification/screening of the content of declarations. Finally,
only 34 percent of participants replied that they sometimes used the information
from financial disclosures in their anticorruption work, while 30 percent said that
they never used such information. These results show how, in most countries,
the wealth of information contained in asset declarations is underused—and its
potential use in investigations has yet to be fully realized.

The private sector’s role as an active player in the fight against corruption has
not been analyzed and understood enough within the anticorruption community.
Yet efforts by business people and leaders to support governments in reducing
corruption are multiplying around the world.
   This session presented selected experiences on how practitioners from the pri-
vate sector and law enforcement agencies have collaborated to develop new tools
to combat corruption. Three practitioners discussed a variety of programs that
built on the key principles used to address corruption—transparency, account-
ability, and participation, or TAP—and that involve private sector actors for their
successful implementation.
   The session shared the experiences of the Fluor Corporation, which has been
active in promoting the role of businesses in promoting integrity and addressing
corruption. That was complemented by the experiences of organizations that have
developed initiatives aimed at supporting a more active private sector role in fight-
ing corruption and by colleagues from law enforcement agencies that have worked
closely with business people.
   The common thread across this discussion was the novel approach that some
in the private sector have taken as active agents in supporting the fight against
corruption. This panel offered participants a new approach to fighting corruption
and changing the culture of impunity by empowering the private sector through
knowledge and collaboration.

Financial and social network analysis is increasingly necessary in complex
corruption investigations. Banking systems and social media are inherently made
up of networks. These networks—collections of connections—have an emergent
shape that can help identify suspicious patterns or influential individuals that
may be of interest. As such, financial and social network analysis has increasingly
become an essential aspect of complex corruption investigations.
   Such analysis is often aided by sophisticated commercial software, which may
require significant financial and training investment by agencies. This session
sought to provide participants with an introduction to a free, open-source appli-
cation for network analysis in complex corruption investigations as an alterna-
tive to more resource-intensive software. Participants explored the capability of
NodeXL, a free open-source application for Microsoft® Excel® for the visual display
and analysis of networks.
   NodeXL was developed by a team at Microsoft Research led by Dr. Marc A.
Smith, now Chief Social Scientist at Connected Action Consulting Group. During
the session, Dr. Smith introduced the value and basic principles of social net-
work analysis and explored its applications as part of corruption investigations.
Participants had the opportunity to use NodeXL using a sample dataset to perform
a basic network analysis, then visualize the data analyzed.

All corruption cases  have an asso-
ciated tax offense, providing a strong
rationale for using tax investigations
to fight corruption. Bribes are usually
declared under other labels to be tax
deductible, or off-the-books money
and accounts are used to pay the bribes.
Both alternatives open perpetrators up
for investigations and prosecutions for
tax evasion and other offenses. In a mini-survey of the ICHA network conducted
prior to the conference, 71 percent of responding agencies said they were man-
dated to pursue a tax crime case if it also had an element of corruption.
    But the requirement that the tax crime be directly linked to corruption might
not be sufficient, because corruption can be politically sensitive and hard to prove.
One solution can be to expand the mandate of anticorruption authorities, allow-
ing them to investigate and prosecute collateral crimes like tax evasion even if
corruption charges are dropped. In a poll at the session, 72 percent of participants
confirmed their support for this solution. (ICHA members can find the com-
plete poll results on the World Bank Group’s ICHA Collaboration Page: https://­
collaboration.worldbank.org/groups/international-corruption-hunters-alliance).
    Tax data can be a powerful tool, but they are not easily accessed. Tax authorities
have access to income statements of individuals and corporations, and customs
authorities have a rich dataset of import and export quantities and values. In many
countries such information is digitized, allowing for powerful analysis to detect
illicit enrichment. But privacy laws severely restrict anticorruption authorities
from accessing the data and what the data can be used for. In a mini-survey of the
ICHA network conducted before the conference, half of responding agencies said
they had access to tax data, though it is likely that it is available only on request and
not directly accessible before an investigation.
    Collaboration between anticorruption and tax authorities is crucial. Acknowledging
that each agency has unique skills and tools at their disposal, agencies should coordi-
nate their efforts at fighting crime. At the lowest level, investigators can foster collab-
oration by inviting other agencies to join in field operations, where all agencies taking
part do what they normally do and findings are shared in debriefings. A general rule
of thumb for successful collaboration is to “leave your badge at the door.” In a poll at
the session, nearly all the participants agreed that anticorruption and tax authorities
should have a formal mechanism for communication and collaboration.
    A truly integrated approach can yield great results, as in the Bhutanese Samtse
Mining case, where restitution equaled $3 per capita. Several senior public officials
in the mining sector abused their positions when allocating licenses and monitor-
ing mining operations—violating both corruption and tax laws. Anticorruption
and tax authorities jointly investigated and prosecuted several public officials and


Ending Impunity for Corruption                                                         59
businessmen on counts of corruption and tax crime. The case resulted in criminal
and civil convictions and generated $2.7 million in restitution. (ICHA members can
find the Bhutan case study on the World Bank Group’s ICHA Collaboration Page).
   There is a need to conduct joint national or regional threat assessments. Even
in jurisdictions with established procedures for case-based collaboration between
anticorruption and tax authorities, joint threat assessments are rare—both across
agencies and borders. Uganda has established a regional collaboration with
Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Tanzania, while the Nordic countries are develop-
ing a methodology for a regional tax crime threat assessment.
   Better training for detecting red flags can boost capacity and competence among
anticorruption and tax authorities. Corruption investigations can be time-­consuming,
and proceedings before cases are heard in court can be lengthy. Financial investiga-
tions are inherently complex, and lack of leadership can exacerbate the capacity chal-
lenges of anticorruption authorities. Enhanced training on red flags can induce timely
referral of cases between anticorruption and tax authorities and improve the hit rate of
both types of agencies. In the poll at the session, 96 percent of participants said that tax
investigators should be trained in detecting corruption red flags, while 89 percent said
that anticorruption investigators should be trained in detecting tax evasion red flags.
   Reducing bank secrecy, holding service providers accountable, and establishing
informal networks are deemed important in fighting cross-border crime. A recent
project by the Danish Customs and Tax Administration shows how difficult it can
be to obtain information from domestic banks—even for a specialized revenue
authority in a developed country. (ICHA members can find a project report on the
World Bank Group’s ICHA Collaboration Page). In Denmark the solution was to
allow the tax authorities to fine the directors of domestic banks personally, signifi-
cantly expediting the process of obtaining bank information. Extensive analysis
of transactions of Danish nationals and companies with links to secrecy jurisdic-
tions has yielded almost $400 million in tax adjustments, equivalent to almost
$7 ­million per full-time employee dedicated to the project.
   Denmark recently published an action plan on tax evasion that included, among
other things, steps to make service providers like lawyers, accountants, and bank-
ers more accountable. In recent years U.S. enforcement authorities have success-
fully prosecuted a number of service providers, among them several major banks.
Informal networks among law enforcement officials and other ­          stakeholders—like
the ICHA—are vital to fight transnational crime.
   The main messages from this session were that:
••   Anticorruption authorities should be enabled to investigate tax crime cases—
     and other economic crimes—even if corruption charges are dropped.
••   Anticorruption and tax authorities should have a formal mechanism for com-
     munication and collaboration.
••   Tax investigators should be trained to detect red flags for corruption.
••   Anticorruption investigators should be trained to detect red flags for tax evasion.

ICHA participants agreed that crimes against natural resources and the envi-
ronment are a serious threat to sustainable development and the livelihoods of
people where such crimes occur. Prevention, investigation, and prosecution of
these crimes is hampered by a shortage of law enforcement personnel in coun-
tries where poaching happens, and limited expertise in handling information
and ­intelligence. Furthermore, the illegal wildlife trade is often facilitated by well-­
organized criminal groups well versed in corrupt practices.
   Moreover, the unique features of natural resource management are not well
understood by law enforcement and anticorruption agencies, due to a lack
of appreciation for the significance of the harm they cause, and because of the
entrenched and politically connected special interests that drive the trade.



DNA analysis leads to identification of
trafficking hot spots
Africa’s elephant ivory poaching crisis provides a basic foundation to further
understand the dynamics of corruption activities surrounding wildlife crime.
Through the analysis of elephant ivory DNA conducted by Dr. Sam Wasser at the
University of Washington, two poaching hotspots have been identified—one in
Tanzania, the other in Gabon. These hotspots service the majority of internation-
ally trafficked elephant ivory.



Analysis of trade routes reveals patterns
and techniques in trafficking
Analysis of trade patterns and routes, as outlined by Varun Vira, allows for a com-
prehensive overview of the various mechanisms that facilitate this aspect of wildlife
crime. It also illustrates the involvement of corrupt high-level government officials
and their interaction with key players in the illicit ivory trade, from middlemen in
the source country to entrepreneurial criminal kingpins in consumer countries.



ICHA members agree on need for
intelligence network and task force
To effectively respond to this transnational criminal activity, there is a need to
create an intelligence network with accompanying governance models to enhance
the ability of law enforcement agencies to expose areas of opportunities and
vulnerabilities for corruption.
­

   This system, as outlined by intelligence expert Rob Fahlman, would enable a
prioritized overview of enforcement, conservation, and protection action to better
limit opportunities for corruption on a national and international level, and would
help connect key stakeholders to address corruption issues surrounding African
elephant poaching and ivory trafficking. The techniques, lessons, and foren-
sic insights developed in the African ivory poaching context can be shared and
extrapolated to wider investigative efforts into corruption surrounding broader
wildlife and forestry problems.
   ICHA conference attendees welcomed the idea of establishing a joint wildlife
crime investigative task force to be led by a recognized law enforcement orga-
nization. It was agreed the task force should be composed of experts from both
law enforcement offices and wildlife agencies, supported by government agencies
representing the full range of police, wildlife, customs, financial intelligence, and
other enforcement areas with relevant experience and expertise.
   As part of this approach, conference participants were asked to designate
national focal points to work with law enforcement organizations to define terms
of reference and operating procedures to make the task force operational as soon
as possible, so as to support investigations, information gathering, and develop-
ing intelligence that could assist in the arrest of high-level criminals involved in
the international ivory trade, and disrupt and dismantle their organizations and
networks.

Prevention is a key pillar of
anticorruption efforts.  This
is recognized by the United
Nations Convention Against
Corruption (UNCAC), which
sets out extensive provisions on
the ways and means for preven-
tive measures in the public and
private sectors and for the estab-
lishment by States Parties of a
“preventive anticorruption body
or bodies.”



Corruption prevention: multiple
approaches to a common goal
Though most enforcement authorities and specialized anticorruption authorities
(ACAs) include prevention in their core mandate, there is a wide variation in how
agencies approach these goals.
   Some focus on generating and disseminating knowledge about preventing
corruption. Others play a role in formulating corruption prevention policies and
monitoring their implementation.
   Some focus chiefly on the public sector. Others partner with nonstate actors
(including the private sector, civil society organizations, communities, and indi-
viduals) to pursue their preventive efforts.
   There has also been some rethinking of traditional preventive approaches, with
increasing reliance on technology to expand their reach.
   This session sought to provide an opportunity for an exchange of practi-
cal knowledge and experiences among agencies active in prevention. It was
informed by the results of an ICHA mini-survey completed before the confer-
ence on the role of enforcement authorities in preventing corruption (ICHA
members can find the survey results on the World Bank Group’s ICHA collab-
oration page).

Learning from other agencies’ prevention
experiences: core questions; a sample
of findings
The questions posed in the survey and discussed in this session included the
following:

••   What are the main challenges agencies face when implementing their preven-
     tive mandate?
••   What are the critical factors for the success of preventive functions?
••   Which specific tools and activities have been most successful—and why?
••   How do agencies resolve tensions between investigative and preventive
     mandates?
••   How can agencies best partner for prevention with other government agen-
     cies and nonstate actors?

  The panelists addressed these questions with examples from their jurisdictions,
presenting a wide range of prevention activities and institutional frameworks,
including best practices and lessons.

Corruption Vulnerability Assessments
For example, in the Philippines, the Office of the Ombudsman is empowered to
implement a wide range of prevention activities, including its innovative Integrity
Development Reviews, which consist of corruption resistance reviews and corrup-
tion vulnerability assessments.

Multi-Agency Coordination
In Berlin the preventive function of the Anti-Corruption Central Office is part of
an Anti-Corruption Working Group comprising various government ministries,
the State Bureau of Investigation, the Tax Offenses Investigation Service, and the
State Cartel Authority. The working group has the power to develop anticorrup-
tion strategies, analyze corruption-prone areas, coordinate among institutions,
and develop legislation and guidelines.

Building Partnerships and Coalitions
Kenya’s Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has a similar mandate. Its
­
innovative work in promoting and establishing coalitions and partnerships
with  the private sector and civil society drew particular attention from the
audience.

Tailor-Made Approaches to the Local Context and to Good
Governance Goals
One panel member emphasized that prevention is the best way to promote good
governance at all levels—so long as it is supported by political will and leadership.
As well, when establishing an anticorruption body, there is no one-size-fits-all
solution, and the strategy and institutional framework must be adjusted to the
country context.

Need for Greater Investments and Collaboration in Prevention
A key message endorsed by all the panelists is the need for enforcement agencies
to enhance investments in prevention activities and to strike a better balance with
their traditional investigative role. In addition, given the cross-sector nature of
corruption, a multi-stakeholder approach that involves all institutions is needed.
As a consequence, it was agreed that a network of prevention specialists would be
launched under the umbrella of ICHA network.

The session introduced social media as an effective platform for connecting
and engaging anticorruption leaders with advocates and citizens to bring greater
prominence to issues and challenges around integrity compliance, ethical behav-
ior, and the rule of law.



How social media can amplify
anticorruption efforts
Thanks to their blogging experience and use of other social media tools such as
Twitter and LinkedIn to complement their outreach efforts, the panelists made a
good case for how social media can be used to amplify anticorruption momentum
and accelerate progress in the implementation of the United Nations Convention
Against Corruption and of national laws. More specifically, the use of social media
by corruption hunters can support their efforts in:

••   Reaching different audiences with insights on breaking corruption stories.
••   Promoting and raising awareness of successes and challenges in managing
     corruption risks.
••   Mobilizing support, especially among young people—a major force for
     advocacy in the fight against corruption.
     ­



Ingredients for success in blogging
The panelists highlighted some criteria that define success in using social media,
particularly for anyone interested in blogging.

••   Establishing a credible online presence by updating your blog regularly, inviting
     and accepting debate and diversity of opinions, being transparent and factu-
     ally accurate, and acknowledging mistakes.
••   Linking and promoting your blog to other social media tools (such as Twitter
     and LinkedIn) to reach a broader audience in different regions.
••   Not attempting to blog unless you’re a good writer, because otherwise your
     chances of success are slim.
••   Making a dedicated commitment to blogging and responding to blog comments.
••   Staying in touch with your audience.

Data scientists working for universities, NGOs, think tanks, and the World Bank
exhibited posters on their anticorruption data analytics projects.
   ICHA members were invited to join the data teams in the World Bank atrium,
view the posters, listen to brief presentations, and ask questions about how data
analytics works and how these techniques and opportunities could help them
achieve anticorruption objectives in their jurisdictions.

What Does Corruption Look Like?
Elisabeth Wiramidjaja, Alexandra Habershon Ph.D., and Francis Gagnon,
Integrity Vice Presidency, World Bank Group
   To identify potential cases of fraud and corruption in World Bank financed
operations the World Bank Group currently relies mostly on complaints or allega-
tions. To enable a more proactive detection of integrity risks and potential inves-
tigative leads, the World Bank’s Integrity Vice Presidency (INT) is exploring new
methods using data analysis. The main source of data for fraud and corruption
analysis comes from the procurement of goods and services. Analysis of procure-
ment records can reveal patterns that may be indicative of integrity risks, particu-
larly collusion and corruption (as defined below).

     INT investigates and pursues sanctions for the following offenses:

Corruption: Offering, giving, receiving or soliciting anything of value to influence
improperly the actions of another party.

Collusion: an arrangement between two or more parties designed to achieve an
improper purpose

Coercion: impairing, harming or threatening to impair or harm any party to
influence improperly the actions of a party.

Fraud: any misrepresentation that misleads or attempts to mislead a party to
obtain a financial or other benefit

   The problem
   Detecting potential collusion, corruption, and fraud in procurment information to help investigators target suspicious
   and anomalous behaviors which might be the hallmark of collusion, and to triage accusations based on the analyzed
   risk of collusion to better focus investigative resources.

   The solutions: tracking companies
   We developed an interactive dashboard for World Bank investigators to track a company’s activity across countries,
   sectors, and time. Using this tool, investigators can:

   future contracts.                                                                                                                                         In partnership with
 • These risk forecasts can allow World Bank investigators to be more proactive in

The problem
One of the principal issues with the analysis of large data sets
involves the cleaning of qualitative data, such as company
names or other identiﬁers, to identify duplicate data, overlaps
between dissimilar data, and identiﬁcation of misleading
overlaps. We need to know who’s who in order to compare the
entities. Hence, we need a single name for each unique entity,
and a way to diﬀerentiate truly diﬀerent entities.

The solutions
How to go about it? Manual work would take forever. We need
an automatic solution to go through the more than 500,000
entries in even the reasonably small data set we have worked                                                                                       Large computing power is necessary to resolve

other data associated with the instance of the identiﬁer in                                                                                        entities in the World Bank data set.

The OECD Foreign Bribery Report – launched in December 2014 – seeks to illus-
trate the crime of foreign bribery in real terms. It ‘measures’, for the first time,
the crime of transnational corruption based on analysis of data emerging from
foreign bribery enforcement actions concluded since the entry into force of the
OECD Anti-Bribery Convention in 1999. This session presented and discussed
the findings of the report.

                  This session presented  a training program developed by the World Bank’s
                  Integrity Vice Presidency (INT) in partnership with instructors from the George
                  Washington University Law School and simulation experts from the University of
                  Maryland ICONS program. The two week online program “Operational Skills
                  for International Corruption Hunters” guides teams through a simulated inves-
                  tigation involving a complex financial corruption scenario, asset tracing, money
                  laundering, confiscation of illicit proceeds, evidence organization and trial prepa-
                  ration. A module on using open source information provides tips on making the
                  best used of the Internet. 
                     Tailored for the needs of ICHA members to replicate real-world investigative
                  actions and decisions, this online 40-hour training program combines teamwork to
                  solve a simulated corruption investigation, video lectures, hands-on tasks such as the
                  creation of an evidence log, and real-time interactions with expert i ­nstructors. The
                  course was first piloted in English and French, connecting teams from anticorrup-
                  tion agencies in Botswana, Tanzania, Sierra Leone and Senegal with expert instruc-
                  tors from the George Washington University Law School and simulation experts
                  from the University of Maryland ICONS Program. It has since been implemented (in
                  English) with teams from ICHA member agencies in the Philippines and Singapore
                  and (English and Spanish) with teams in Chile, Peru, Costa Rica and the Dominican
                  Republic.

Records are the clearest and most durable evidence of any government’s
policies, operations, decisions, and activities. They should provide the fundamen-
tal basis for preventing corruption and building integrity in public spending and
delivering government services. The problems encountered in managing records
in a paper-based environment continue in many countries. As digital information
systems replace paper-based systems, digital records must supply the evidence
needed for anticorruption investigations to hold governments and public officials
accountable.
   This session sought to identify good practices for digital records management
for anticorruption authorities and to identify strategies for strengthening coun-
tries’ records systems to better support the availability and integrity of the evi-
dence needed for the investigative work of anticorruption agencies.




     Box 1  Supervizor software
     Supervizor software allows users to view information on the budgets and
     budget users, management, and ownership structure of firms and publicly
     owned companies. It also discloses transactions worth more than 2,000
     euros, including transfers to or from selected budget users, accounting
     entries of payments from and transfers to tax havens. The types of informa-
     tion and analysis possible include:
     •	 Financial flow analysis.
     •	 Structure of spending (based on accounting entries).
     •	 Data from annual reports combined with data from database of public
          sector payments.
     •	 Visualization of ownership and founder relationships.
     •	 Tax debtors receiving funds from the public sector.
     •	 Public procurement analysis.
     •	 Links between the database of conflict of interest restrictions for public
          officials with a database of payments from public bodies (to detect pro-
          hibited business) and business registry (to detect which officials should
          report business restrictions but fail to do so).

Protecting the integrity of the digital
environment
Anne Thurston spoke about managing digital records as essential documentary
evidence for anticorruption. Protecting access and integrity in the digital envi-
ronment is difficult but increasingly essential. Digital media deteriorate, software
changes, and hardware becomes obsolete. The risk is that if digital records are not
managed properly, their integrity and value as legal evidence can be compromised.
Thurston also noted that records professionals around the world have collaborated
to define coherent international standards on a control framework of laws, poli-
cies, and procedures needed to support the capture, management, and security of
digital records as evidence of policies, actions, and transactions. The standards,
including ISO 15489: International Standard on Records Management, provide
a missing piece in the anticorruption agenda and are increasingly important in a
rapidly changing digital environment.



Managing digital documents in corruption
investigations
Anders Hjorth Agerskov discussed records management challenges in corrup-
tion investigations. Chain of custody practices can be compromised by loss of
evidence and the physical deterioration of records. Digital records are spread
across various media, making them difficult to locate, analyze, and control in the
absence of a properly established evidence management system. Investigations are
severely undermined by missing information and assets, the improper destruction
of records, and lack of sanctions and oversight over records management in the
public and private sectors.



Using software to enhance digital
document management: experiences
in Slovenia
Peter Premrl presented Supervizor, an online application for monitoring expenses
of public bodies used by the Commission for the Prevention of Corruption in
Slovenia to demonstrate what can be done when good records are available (see
box). Data from records are pulled from various public agencies. Findings from
a Supervizor analysis conducted by the commission revealed a strong correlation

between changes in government and money disbursements from state budget
users to a limited number of companies. It also showed extreme inflexibility of
the market for certain services (such as information technology services, phar-
maceutical products, and construction works), as well as the existence of a group
of companies highly dependent on financial transfers from state budget users (for
example, if they receive a great amount of their income from the state budget),
constituting a noticeable risk of corruption.




     Box 2  Guidelines for Managing Records Created in the
     Investigative and Litigation Process
     1.	 Financial and securities regulators must ensure that (a) record-
         keeping policies and procedures are regularly updated to address
         organizational changes and meet the emergent requirements of the
         organization, and that (b) staff properly use and rely on the organi-
         zation’s document management system for the creation, storage, or
         tracking (e.g., of physical evidence such as a hard drive) of investiga-
         tive records.
     2.	 Each financial and securities regulator should have a Case Management
         Unit to log incoming evidence, account for evidence created, monitor
         storage, and conduct audits of case files.
     3.	 Organizations need to consider using technology (e.g., barcode or
         RFID) to track evidence.
     4.	 For electronically-stored information (ESI) that is at high-risk of degra-
         dation, financial and securities regulators need to create a preservation
         policy/plan.
     5.	 Organizations must have a clear understanding of the purposes of each
         electronic recordkeeping system employed, as well as the authorities of
         its records and evidence management systems.
     6.	 Each financial and securities regular must clearly define what it means
         by “evidence” in its retention and disposition schedules. Evidence
         should be defined as all records, documents, or materials (regardless
         of form or format) collected or created during the investigation and
         litigation processes.
     7.	 When tracking evidence, organizations should consider using at least
         three different documents: evidence receipt log, evidence room track-
         ing log, and an exhibit log.
     8.	 Each financial and securities organization should periodically review
         its position on outsourcing the scanning of evidentiary documents in
         light of a risk-based assessment framework.

Using digital records to enhance
transparency: experiences in Romania
Silviu Popa addressed the information technology solutions adopted by the
National Integrity Agency of Romania to support its income and asset disclosure
activities. The agency adopted a strategic approach to information technology
integration that consisted of two goals: enhancing agency capacity and promoting
transparency. Information technology solutions for capacity building included an
information management system designed specifically for income and asset dis-
closure, and a document management system that serves as an archive. In terms
of transparency, electronic submission was instituted for income and asset disclo-
sures, and a public portal was implemented for the release of information from
disclosure forms. As a result of these digital record systems, all investigations can
be carried out electronically. But constraints on the implementation of compre-
hensive digital solutions include costs, security, and sustainability of records, and
intra-agency collaboration across technological platforms.


Guidelines for managing digital records:
good practice examples
Victoria Lemieux presented research on guidelines for managing records created
in investigative and litigation processes. The research was conducted in 2011 in
the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada with the goal of establishing
good practices for the management of investigative records. Eight main guide-
lines emerged from the research, encapsulating the good practices from a sur-
vey of financial regulators with investigative powers and covering issues such as
the designation of responsible authorities, preservation plans for digital degrada-
tion, methods for tracking evidence, and clear definitions of relevant terminology
(see box).
   Prominent themes that emerged from the discussion focused on the agreement
that records are fundamental to evidence. Furthermore, it was agreed that existing
international records standards can be an important implementing guide, and that
record-keeping should be regularly monitored to ensure availability and integrity.
Another prominent theme entailed the challenges of using digital records as evi-
dence in cases of fraud and corruption. Participants noted that courts were reluc-
tant to accept digital evidence even if laws allowed for it. In other cases, it was
noted that laws needed to be updated to permit the introduction of such evidence.
Participants were concerned that the inability to adduce digital evidence could
pose a barrier to prosecuting cases of corruption and fraud, as criminals rarely
leave a paper trail and tend to use digital forms of communication.


Ending Impunity for Corruption                                                    87
   To identify good digital records management practices for anticorruption
authorities and to identify strategies for strengthening countries’ records and legal
systems to better support the availability, integrity, and use of the evidence needed
for the investigative work of anticorruption agencies, it was suggested that a com-
munity of practice be established to share standards, examples of legal frameworks
and provisions, experiences of countries with strong records laws, and exemplary
methodologies and techniques for record-keeping in investigations.
