Summary
Ghana’s overall macroeconomic conditions have deteriorated further in 2014 with large twin-deficits lingering, fueling
government debt and inflation, a sharp depreciation of its currency, and a weaker pace of economic growth.

The fiscal deficit remains the biggest source of vulnerability in the Ghanaian economy. Preliminary figures show the fiscal deficit
was 9.2% of GDP in the first half of 2014, driven by the high wage bill and rising interest costs. The wage bill grew 25.7% (y-o-y)
during the first half of 2014 despite promised measures to contain it, while interest payments reached 5% of GDP. Total
domestic revenue collections were dragged down by a contraction in non-tax revenue while tax revenue only increased slightly
to 15.6 % of GDP. With large expenditures planned for the second half of the year, the deficit is projected to be around 10% of
GDP, above the government’s 8.8% target for 2014.

The government continued to add to its stock of public debt to finance the fiscal deficit. Public debt reached 58% of GDP in
August 2014, excluding the stock of arrears and SOE’s debt. If the public debt figure is modified to include these two factors and
the Eurobond issued in mid-September, the stock of public debt would exceed 70% of GDP.

Domestic financing of the fiscal deficit has been provided via the Bank of Ghana’s (BoG) expansion of net credit to the
government and SOEs. In fact, the BoG financed the entire fiscal deficit during the first quarter of 2014. The monetary expansion
was sterilized through open market operations and monetary tightening (300 bps in 2014). Interest rates on 91-day Treasury
bills reached 25% in August.

Headline inflation was 15.9% in August 2014 up from 13.5% in December 2013 due to adjustments in prices of petroleum and
utilities, plus rising prices of imported products following depreciation of the Ghanaian Cedi since January 2013. As a result, non-
food inflation reached 24% and producer price inflation 48.3%; while food inflation remained subdued at 5.1%.

Ghana’s external imbalance persisted in 2014. While the current account deficit remained around 10% of GDP (first half of 2014)
financing was particularly challenging. Despite the robust FDI inflows, the financial account significantly weakened following net
outflows of portfolio investment and short-term capital. As a result, the Ghanaian cedi depreciated against the US dollar by 35%
on the official interbank market, but by 43% on the forex bureau market by July. Net international reserves had declined to
$601 million in June 2014, covering only 12 days of imports of goods and services. International reserves will get a boost from
the Ghana Cocoa Board (Cocobod) loan of US$1.7billion and recently issued $1 billion Eurobond. Ghana issued its third 10-year
Eurobond in mid-September with a yield of 8.25%. While the yield was slightly lower than 8.5% that Ghana paid last August, it
was significantly higher than the 5.375% Ivory Coast paid for the 10-year $500 million Eurobond issued in July 2014. Spreads on
Ghana’s existing sovereign bonds have narrowed slightly in September after the Ghanaian government officially requested
assistance from the IMF.

Macroeconomic challenges continue to weigh on economic growth. In first quarter, growth was lower at 6.7% compared to 9%
in the first quarter of 2013. GDP growth already slowed down to 7.1% in 2013 and is expected to remain subdued around 6.0 %
for the full year 2014. Slower growth and higher inflation could easily erase recent gains in poverty reduction. Official data
shows the poverty rate decreased to 24% in 2013 from 31% in 2006, making it very likely that Ghana meets the goal of halving
poverty rates by 2015. However, there is a great disparity in poverty levels across the country. For instance, in rural areas, 38%
of the population is poor, while in the urban areas only 11%. Geographically, the disparity is even larger with 55% of the Rural
Savannah population living below the poverty line, compared to 3.5% of the population in Greater Accra Metropolitan area.
Inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, increased from 41.9 in 2006 to 42.3 in 2013. Poverty reduction in Ghana is linked
to developments in the labor market, where the participation rates increased substantially and the share of agriculture
employment (with the lowest wages in the economy) decreased. The reported unemployment rate at 4.4% is extremely low, but
the figure has to be interpreted with great caution due to the substantial size of the informal sector. In addition,
underemployment reached 33 percent. A careful analysis of the determinants of poverty and inequality, and their interaction
with labor market variables is just beginning, as the 2013 surveys were just released. However, these preliminary findings
highlight how critical are Ghana’s policy decisions over the next 12 months to pursue more inclusive and stable growth. Urgent
efforts are needed to build a more predictable policy environment that facilitates diversification from capital intensive activities
in extractive industries towards more labor and land intensive activities in the agriculture and services sectors.

Note:
Inequality - Income Gini: A summary measure of the extent to which the actual distribution of income, consumption expenditure, or a related variable differs from a hypothetical distribution in which each person receives
an identical share. The coefficient is a measure of the inequality of a distribution: a percentage of 0 expresses total equality and a percentage of 100 expresses maximal inequality.
Life expectancy (yrs): Life expectancy at a specific age is the average number of additional years that a person of that age could expect to live if current mortality levels observed for ages above that age were to continue
for the rest of that person’s life. In particular, life expectancy at birth is the average number of years a newborn would live if current age-specific mortality rates were to continue.
Human Development Index (HDI): Summary measure for assessing long-term progress in basic dimensions of human development. In 2010 HDI was calculated for 169 countries.
Doing Business Indicators: Provide objective measures of business regulations for local firms in 183 countries.
World Bank Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA): Rates the policy and institutional performance of approximately 135 IBRD and IDA recipient countries. Ratings range from 1 (unsatisfactory for an extended
