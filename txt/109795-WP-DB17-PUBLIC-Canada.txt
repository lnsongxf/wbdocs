This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business

STARTING A BUSINESS
What are the details?
Underlying the indicators shown in this chapter for

Canada is a set of specific procedures—the
bureaucratic and legal steps that an entrepreneur
must complete to incorporate and register a new                   Legal form: Private Corporation

       File for federal incorporation and provincial registration via
       Industry Canada’s online Electronic Filing Centre

       To file for incorporation electronically (via Online Filing Centre), the cost
       is CAD 200. There is no fee for the provincial registration in Ontario.
       Electronic filing for incorporating a business is 1 day and the Business
       Number is sent to the company within 5 days.

       The following documents are required to file for federal incorporation
       and provincial registration:
       1. Form 1: Articles of Incorporation
       2. Form 2: Initial Registered Office Address and First Board of Directors
       3. Provincial registration form.
        While extra-provincial registration in Ontario, Newfoundland and
       Labrador, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan can be done at the same time
   1   when the documents for federal incorporation are filed (via Joint                1 day           CAD 200
       Online Registration System), generally, a federal company that intends
       to conduct business in other Canadian province would need to register
       in that province individually. See, for example, Part 11 of the Business
       Corporations Act (British Columbia).

       Four incorporation options available:
       1. Incorporation of a numbered name corporation, e.g. 1234567 Canada
       Inc.
       If the company is incorporating under a name, rather than a number, a
       name search report must be obtained at a cost of CAD 21.47. The
       search report and articles must be filed within 90 days of the
       production of the name search report.
       2. Incorporation of a corporation with a name pre-approved by
       Corporations Canada (a NUANS® search in electronic format is
       required to accompany the submission) or

        3. Incorporation of a corporation where name approval is to be sought
        (a NUANS® search in electronic format is required to accompany the
        submission);
        4. Incorporation of a numbered name corporation that has been pre-

        It is a same day service, if you submit the forms online prior to 1PM, the
        incorporation certificate should be provided on the same day by 5PM.

        Once a corporation is created, the corporation's information is
        transmitted to the Canada Revenue Agency which then transmits back
        the Business Number with the corporate income tax account number.
        This number can be accessed within a day from the online database of

        is mandatory prior to requesting a building permit. The zoning
        certificate costs 25% of the total prescribed building permit fee.
        Once the application has been received and payment is made,
        the application will be circulated to city divisions and external

      The municipality forwards the site plan to the fire department for
      approval. On some occasions, a City councilor will get involved in
      the review of the site plan and community consultation may be
      requested by the Planner. The process can take anywhere from 3
      month to 9 months depending on the complexity of the site
      plan, political interests, and on how often the applicant needs to
      revise the plan to meet the City's desired revisions. Once
      approved, the City often has conditions that need to be met
      before building permit can be obtained.

      Obtain building permit

      The building permit is issued by the City of Toronto. BuildCo
      must post the building permit on the construction site. In certain
      cases, the process of reviewing the building permit application
      can be started by the City before the site plan is approved. The
      City can issue a temporary building permit at that time. However,
      the final building permit cannot be issued before the site
      approval is granted. The building permit and the site plan
      approval are granted by different municipal departments. The
      site plan approval entails verifying planning compliance with the
      city bylaws (for instance, if enough parking spaces are included
      in the plans). In contrast, the building permit application review    15 days      CAD 14,541

      Submit final design to Toronto Hydro and await offer to connect

      The customer’s private consultants will provide Toronto Hydro with the
      final design drawings and requirements. Toronto Hydro prepares an
      Offer to Connect, which includes the connection charges and schedule of
      work. During this time Toronto Hydro will check for feeder capacity,
      prepares the design scope and cost, and present the customer with an
      offer to connect.
      The OTC outlines the cost of the project and the responsibilities of each
      party.

      After the Offer to Connect is issued, the applicant must sign and comply

      After the estimate has been issued a part of the external connection
      works are carried out by Toronto Hydro. The works will most likely
      include the following: (a) Extend the overhead primary feeder cables
      down the street by installing a new pole line up to the point that is in
      line with the customer's building. (b) From an overhead feeder install a
      primary riser switch and fusing at the pole. (c) Construct underground        80 calendar days     CAD 44,363

      Install underground primary cable from the riser switch to the
      padmounted structure. (e) Install padmounted transformer. (f) Make
      primary and secondary connection at padmounted transformer. The
      connection fees paid to Toronto Hydro include: engineering design,
      labor, material, equipment, overhead costs (including administration and
      inspection). The utility will obtain an excavation permit for the part of the
      work which is their responsibility.

      Toronto Hydro performs an economic evaluation on the "expansion"
      portion of the connection and the forecasted revenue of connecting this
      customer. In this case, the customer will have to provide a security
      deposit known as an Expansion Deposit. This expansion deposit will be
      returned to the customer, if the customer reaches its demand of 140 kVA
      within the first five years (i.e. after each year a portion of the expansion
      deposit will be given back relative to the demand realized). For the case
      study, the customer will receive the full amount back after the first year
      of operation.

      Await completion of external works by contractor

      While Toronto Hydro finishes its part of the connection works an
      electrical contractor proceeds with his part of the works. The
      contractor's work includes: a) Install padmounted structure on customer
      property. (b) Construct underground ducts from padmounted structure

      Await and receive inspection of internal wiring

      An inspection of internal wiring is required and can be performed by the
      Electrical Safety Authority at any time during rough in and final stages of
      the process so there are at least two inspections of the internal wiring.
      The inspection would be performed by the Electrical Safety Authority,

      Await final inspection, meter installation and final connection

      Once Toronto Hydro receives the connection authorization, the final
      inspection is performed during meter installation and the final
      connection can be made. There is no separate supply contract to be             7 calendar days       CAD 0

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

Doing Business 2017 presents the data for the labor
market regulation indicators in an annex. The report
does not present rankings of economies on these
indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance
to frontier score or ranking on the ease of doing
business. Detailed data collected on labor market
regulation are available on the Doing Business website
(http://www.doingbusiness.org). The data on labor
market regulation are based on a detailed questionnaire
on employment regulations that is completed by local
lawyers and public officials. Employment laws and
regulations as well as secondary sources are reviewed to
ensure accuracy.

To make the data comparable across economies, several
assumptions about the worker and the business are
used.

The worker:
       Is a cashier in a supermarket or grocery store,
        age 19, with one year of work experience.
       Is a full-time employee.
       Is not a member of the labor union, unless
        membership is mandatory.
The business:
       Is a limited liability company (or the equivalent
        in the economy).
       Operates a supermarket or grocery store in the
        economy’s largest business city. For 11
        economies the data are also collected for the
        second largest business city.

       Is subject to collective bargaining agreements if
        such agreements cover more than 50% of the

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
