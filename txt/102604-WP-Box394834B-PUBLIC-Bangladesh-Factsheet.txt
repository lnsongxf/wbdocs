community water supply by making capital finance available and
encouraging the full recovery of operating costs. The Government
of Bangladesh (GoB) and the World Bank, under Bangladesh Water Supply Program Project (BWSPP) and Social Investment Program
Project (SIPP), planned to provide nearly 300 villages and a few small towns with piped water, using POs/sponsors–NGOs, contractors,
community-based organizations (CBOs).
In sanitation, on the other hand, the coverage figure has improved to over 80% of households by 2006. This has been achieved by the keen
interest and support of GoB and more importantly, with the significant support from small-scale private latrine producers. Many NGOs and
donor agencies are assisting the Government. The GoB has set the national goal to achieve universal sanitation by 2010.

SITUATION ASSESSMENT

 Policy and Regulatory Environment                                                                       RATING: Challenged

 l    There is no specific policy to promote domestic private sector provisioning. Local Governments and the National
      Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE) need to adopt a policy for engaging community organizations, NGOs and
      private sector including DPSP to provide WSS services to poor.
 l    Private providers are regulated through licensing and also for quality testing by Bangladesh Standard Testing Institute
      (BSTI). But there are still many who are not registered and therefore, could not be regulated.
 l    Water tariff is regulated by Local Government Institutions (LGIs) with the endorsement of the Ministry of Local Government
      Rural Development and Cooperatives (MoLGRD&Cs).
 l    Consumers are able to give and receive feedback on service policy/quality through Citizens Charter, but there is no clear
      incentive on the part of provider to respond.


 Market and Business Infrastructure                                                                      RATING: High Improved

 l    Competition is low because the people want more support from government service providers, although the Government
      desires more private sector involvement.
 l    Expansion by DPSPs is hampered by lack of access to financing.
 l    Access to water resources is regulated by Water Supply and Sewerage Authorities in the larger cities and the rest by the
      respective LGIs (Pourashavas and Union Parishads).


 Domestic Provider Performance (Optional)                                                                RATING: High Improved

 l    Generally, private sector providers are providing adequate and affordable service in the rural areas.
 l    Staff are semi-skilled professionals who would benefit from technical, commercial, financial and management training for
      skills enhancement.




KEY OPPORTUNITIES

 Opportunities for enhancing DPSP activity in the next three years (2009-2012):

 1 Clear policy pronouncements and the development of institutional frameworks for private sector participation (PSP) in water
   and sanitation are necessary. These can be further supported by regular dialogues with utilities and government agencies.
 2 An International Finance Corporation (IFC) study mapped the small-scale service providers of water supply and sanitation
   services in Dhaka. This data can serve as basis for generating broader momentum around a collective approach to
   small-scale providers (SSPs) and their coordination with the water utility. An International Development Association (IDA)-
   funded project (near appraisal) to improve sewerage and drainage in Dhaka will also address the opportunity of the water
   utility to contract with SSPs to expand services in slum areas.
 3 Financing institutions need to be motivated to lend to private service providers. At present, they prefer lending to
   industries. Possible partners for this undertaking would be the Department of Finance, the World Bank and Local Water
   Utilities Administration.
