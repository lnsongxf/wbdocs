     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES :
     Limited access to quality inputs at affordable prices is a key constraint to higher agricultural productivity in Afghanistan. The agricultural inputs delivery network re-
     mains underdeveloped, weakly regulated, and distorted, requiring investments and action at the institutional, policy and farm levels.
     The project will build institutional capacity in the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation (MAIL) required for overseeing input quality control, safety and reliabil-
     ity, and availability.
     It will support the infrastructure and human resources needed to exercise and enforce quality control for fertilizers and other agro-chemicals, and improve functioning
     and transition of the seed sector toward a market for certified wheat seed with minimal external support.
     The project objective is to strengthen institutional capacity for the safety and reliability of agricultural inputs and the sustainable production of certified wheat seed.
     The components are:
     ■■     Improved Wheat Seed Production supports (a) varietal selection and production of breeder seed; (b) production of foundation and registered seed; and (c)
            coordination of the seed sector.
     ■■     Plant Quarantine Networks and Quality Control of Agro-chemicals supports enhancement of MAIL capacity to implement the quality control of agro-chemicals,
            including: (a) establishment of an office for pesticides registration; (b) construction of various laboratories; (c) provision of pesticide bio-efficacy trial equipment;
            and (d) strengthening the fertilizer quality control inspection system.
     ■■     Input Delivery Systems supports the analysis of the recipient’s current agricultural input delivery systems and assists in the development of an action plan for
            investment activities in inputs delivery systems.
     ■■     Project Management and Monitoring supports management and monitoring of the project.
     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■     Designs for the renovation of all the target research and quarantine stations were completed. Civil work contracts for the renovation of 5 research farms have been
            awarded and physical works have begun.
     ■■     Ninety improved lines have been grown in the 3rd (final) year of trials and the best will be entered for registration during 2016. These include varieties suitable
            for irrigated and rain-fed conditions.
     ■■     A wide range of supporting trials, including 1,904 lines tested for disease screening (against a target of 200) and 42 Agronomic experiments (target 28) covering
            seed rate, planting date, planting method, fertilizer rates, water stress have been carried out according to the agreed program.
     ■■     On the Legal Reform Program, the parliament has finally approved the Plant Protection and Quarantine Law which is now awaiting presidential endorsement.
     ■■     Following objections in Parliament, the Pesticides Law which had been approved via a decree by the President has now been referred back to Parliament for
            consideration and approval. The project has also drafted a regulation to support the Fertilizer Law

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The project aims to improve connectivity across the Hindukush mountain range between Bamiyan and Kabul, through Afghanistan’s mineral belt and a part of its
     agricultural heartland. This will spur economic development, support one of the planned “Resource Corridors”, foster domestic and regional trade by strengthen-ing
     the transport network and promote social integration by reducing time and cost of travelling, particularly for the poorer citizens of the central, northern and southern
     provinces. The project also directly eliminates the existing transport bottleneck for the development of some agricultural and mining areas which is likely to create jobs
     for many Afghans.
     The project development objective is to improve road transport connectivity across the Hindukush mountain range
     ■■     Road construction and rehabilitation. Component 1 will include (i) civil works for the construction of the B2B road and the rehabilitation of the Salang road and
            tunnel, (ii) consulting services, including for the supervision of works for the same roads and for regular technical audits by an independent inter-national auditor
            to verify that road works have been executed in compliance with the technical specifications, and (iii) goods, which will include a small number of equipment
            items which MPW may need to keep the two roads open during the project period.
     ■■     Institutional support and project management. This component will be comprised of several subcomponents including road safety, implementation of asset
            management arrangements for the roads, community engagement, training and capacity building, and project management support.
     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
     ■■     Reduction in average travel time for trucks on the Baghlan to Bamiyan road.
     ■■     Year-round usability of the Baghlan to Bamiyan road.
     ■■     Reduce Road Fatality Rate on the B2B road and Salang pass.
     ■■     Sustainable mechanism put in place for the management, maintenance and operation of the two project roads.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Two decades of civil war severely damaged Afghan road network at all levels: regional and national highways, provincial roads and local access roads. Prolonged conflict
denied most of the rural population access to essential social services including markets, health centers, schools and government offices.
Formulated in 2002, the National Emergency Employment Program funded short-term employment through restoration of the dilapidated rural infrastructure. This
initiative evolved into the National Rural Access Program from 2005, with a strong focus on the provision of year-round rural access to basic social services.
More than 11,000 km of rural roads and related drainage structures have been upgraded or rehabilitated under these programs through four projects financed
through IDA, ARTF, and other funds.
The objective of the Afghanistan Rural Access Project is to enable rural communities to benefit from all-season road access to basic services and facilities. Compo-nents
are:
■■     Improvement and maintenance of secondary roads: Supports rehabilitation of about 1,000 km roads; 250 km of upgrading existing pavement to bituminous
       standard; about 1,000 km of routine and periodic maintenance of paved and unpaved secondary roads, and construction of about 1,000 linear meters of bridges.
■■     Improvement and maintenance of tertiary roads: Will support about 1,300 km of rehabilitation and 2,000 km of routine and periodic maintenance of tertiary
       roads, and construction of about 1,600 linear meters of bridges.
■■     Program planning and development, institutional strengthening and program coordination support: Will support human resource and institutional capacity
       building, program monitoring and evaluation, and program development activities.
KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■     Construction of 600 km of secondary gravel roads, 200 km of secondary asphalt roads and over 1000 linear meters of secondary bridges;
■■     Construction of 1200 km of tertiary roads and 1300 linear meters of tertiary bridges;
■■     Routine maintenance of 1,300 secondary road and periodic maintenance of 132 km of secondary road;
■■     Routine maintenance of 3,250 km of tertiary road and periodic maintenance of 1000 km of tertiary road;
■■     Establishment of new GIS based network planning;
■■     Roll out of first nationwide inventory and condition survey of rural roads.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Over 75 percent of the Afghan population live in rural areas where agriculture is the primary activity and contributes about one-third of GDP. But poor govern-ance,
     weak factor markets, inadequate marketing infrastructure, ineffective business development services, and poor post-harvest practices limit the develop-ment potential
     of this sector.

     The Afghanistan Rural Enterprise Development Project aims to ensure the social, economic, and political well-being of rural communities, especially the poor and the
     most vulnerable, while stimulating the integration of rural communities within the economy.

     The overall development objective of the project is to improve employment opportunities and income of rural men and women, and the sustainability of target-ed
     local enterprises. Components are:
     ■■     Community-led enterprise development: Creates savings groups, enterprise groups and village savings and loans associations. These institutions are assisted
            in building their own capacities, increasing the value of trade; ensuring production is oriented towards identified market opportunities, and creat-ing access to
            credit through internal lending.
     ■■     Small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) development: Supports the emergence of a stronger SME sector with improved trading linkages with the rural econ-
            omy and adequate access to financial services. The project finances a sequenced approach for SME support, i.e. identifying key value chains in each province,
            working with the stakeholders to identify choke points constricting growth, identifying opportunities for value chain linkages and defining skill gaps.
     ■■     Project implementation support: Project management, monitoring and evaluation.
     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■     The project is currently undergoing an Additional Financing of $4.7 million and an extension of the closing date up to June 30, 2017. The project has so far
            established 5,832 saving groups (52 percent female), 510 Village Saving and Loan Associations (VSLAs), and 1,623 Enterprise Groups (65 percent fe-male). It has
            supported 571 (13 percent female) Small Medium Enterprises.
     ■■     The project beneficiaries have saved over AFG 250 million and have internally lent over AFG 255 million to over 20,000 borrowers (54% females) with a recovery
            rate of over 95%. The project has emerged as the leading rural financial services provider.
     ■■     A total of six Provincial Situations Analysis (PSA) are completed and 10 PSAs are underway. A total of 113 pastoral nomads referred to as Kochies and 143 Persons
            With Different abilities (PWDs) were supported to enhance their enterprise development skills and productivity. As whole, more than 60,000 direct and indirect
            jobs were created.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
A coordinated funding mechanism to support Afghan reconstruction is essential to help the country return to normalcy.

Such an instrument needs to be aligned with national priorities, should promote transparency and accountability of reconstruction assistance, and reinforce the
national budget as the primary policy instrument.

The international community and the Afghan government have recognized that the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) should be used to fund the essential
recurrent costs required for the government to function effectively.

The objective of the recurrent cost component of the ARTF is to provide a coordinated financing mechanism enabling the Afghan government to make predicta-
ble, timely, and accurate payments for approved recurrent costs related to salaries and wages of civil servants, and non- security related government operating and
maintenance expenditures.
Components are:
■■     Reimbursements of civil servant salaries: Establish an amount via grant renewals for reimbursement of civilian expenditures. With the assistance of a third party
       monitoring agent, the government submissions are then reviewed to determine that these have met the eligibility criteria.
■■     Reimbursement of operating and maintenance costs: Establish an amount via grant renewals for reimbursement of civilian expenditures. With the assis-tance of
       a third party monitoring agent, the government submissions are then reviewed to determine that these have met the eligibility criteria.
■■     Incentive program: Introduced in 2009, it refers to a series of policy actions and revenue benchmarks agreed to between the World Bank and the govern-ment
       that align with development priorities and which, if attained, entitle the government to an agreed amount of additional funding for the first two components.
KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■     Over 14 years, the project has disbursed nearly $4.1 billion against legitimate recurrent costs in a timely fashion.
■■     The process provided an opportunity for donors to conduct monitoring of all civilian costs for adherence to financial and eligibility standards.
■■     The incentive component led to significant reforms in revenue generation, public sector governance, and private sector development.
KEY PARTNERS:
Government of Afghanistan, all the ARTF donors (34 countries).

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The Capacity Building for Results Facility (CBR) is a key ARTF investment that supports government in developing its internal human capacity, organizational structures
     and functions over the medium term to improve service delivery to the population. It is demand driven and open to all line ministries and independent agencies.
     Based on pre-agreed criteria including service delivery potential and reform readiness, line ministries and agencies are grouped as either Category 1 (high priority) or
     Category 2. Category 1 ministries/agencies receive full CBR reform support whereas Category 2 ministries receive foundational (“CBR—readiness”) inputs designed to
     upgrade them to Category 1.
     Both Category 1 and Category 2 CBR ministries/agencies must develop a comprehensive reform plan (to be implemented with existing donor and government
     resources) with a results framework to which it is held accountable.
     CBR enables a ministry/agency to hire skilled Afghans into civil service positions at more competitive rates.

     The project’s development objective is to improve the capacity and performance of priority line ministries and independent agencies in selected reform areas.

     Components are:
     ■■     Technical Assistance Facility in Support of Civil Service Reform: Provides short-term technical assistance to support the participating ministries and agencies to
            develop and implement their reform plans.
     ■■     Building Human Resources: Supports the continued implementation of broad civil service reform efforts and placement of critical managerial and profes-sional
            staff resources in participating line ministries.
     ■■     Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation: Focuses on overall project management, monitoring and reporting, and consultancy services for appraisal and
            review of implementation progress and results of Capacity Building for Results programs.
     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■     Nine of thirteen priority ministries/agencies as well as five Category 2 ministries/agencies have approved and are implementing CBR reform programs. Two more
            Category 1 and one more Category 2 ministries/agencies have developed CBR reform programs that are currently under approved.
     ■■     Recruitment of senior and mid-level civil servants funded through CBR is progressing; a total of 222 positions have been selected through CBR with around 750
            more in various stages of recruitment.
     ■■     CBR has also been a front-leader for and is supporting salary harmonization efforts for donor-funded consultants (NTA).

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The Second Education Quality Improvement Program (EQUIP II) has expanded the scope of education sector investments into a national, multi-donor supported project
that is fully aligned with the vision and goals set out by the Ministry of Education.
Institutionally, EQUIP II seeks to consolidate the following implementation systems: (i) the community and school-based management education system; (ii) the
supervision and monitoring systems through the provincial and district education departments’ teams; and (iii) the systems, procedures and skills within key
departments of the Ministry of Education to continue to guide education services in a systematic and results-oriented approach.

The objective of the Project is to assist the Recipient in increasing equitable access to quality basic education – especially for girls. The project Components are:
School Grants provided to develop linkages between schools, communities, and local governments while supporting and empowering schools and communi-ties as
local education managers. Infrastructure Development School Grants provided to rehabilitate and construct schools using community participation and community
based decision making for small school and national competitive bidding for larger and more complex buildings. Teacher and Principal Training and Education: The
objective of this component is to create sustainable systems which will increase the level of professional knowledge and skills of educators throughout Afghanistan
by providing training to teachers and principals. Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation: The objective of this component is to build on and support the
existing administrative structures in MOE as well as at the provincial and district levels, and establish and implement an M&E system for the project.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■     There are 8.7 million children enrolled in schools in General Education in Afghanistan of which 3.4 million are girls. The number of Teaching Assistants financed
       under the EQUIP project has been substantially reduced from approximately 1,500 to 695. All of these now follow the CBR scale and subse-quently the National
       Technical Assistance (NTA) scale.
■■     Under both phases of the Education Quality Improvement Program, social mobilization activities have resulted in the establishment of 14,932 school Shuras
       (community-based consultative bodies)
■■     16,588 schools have received Quality Enhancement Grants for purchase of school supplies, laboratory equipment, and other purposes.
■■     154,699 teachers have been trained in INSETs 1-5, of which 35 percent teachers are female

modernization of the Afghanistan national payment system to facilitate payments within the country; (iii) support for the development of the Afghanistan Institute of
Banking and Finance; and (iv) technical assistance and training for project implementation.

In May 2016, a level 2 restructuring of the project was undertaken to extend the closing date of the project from June 30, 2016 to June 30, 2018 to give DAB and the
project team enough time to complete implementation of ongoing activities under the original project and preparation of the new Additional Financing, requested
by the Government.
The project assists DAB in developing action plans for improved banking supervision and to establish key building blocks of financial sector infrastructure: payment
system, movable collateral and public credit registry. Components and subcomponents are:
■■     Strengthening of DAB’s capacity: This component includes i) financial, portfolio and institutional audit of 10 commercial banks operating in Afghanistan, ii) Stock
       taking on capacity building efforts on financial supervision over the last 10 years and development and implementation of a capacity building plan to sustain-
       ably strengthen the Financial Supervision Department; iii) Review of banking regulation framework, and iv) Development and implementation of action plans
       following audits of commercial banks
■■     Development of the financial sector infrastructure: This component involves modernization of the national payment system, and support to the Afghanistan
       Institute of Banking and Finance.
■■     Technical assistance and training for project implementation
KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■     Under this project a fully-fledged audit of the key 10 commercial banks operating in Afghanistan was completed and provided DAB with detailed and thorough
       guidance on the state of financial stability within the banking system.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Since 2002, Afghanistan has made considerable progress in telecommunications connectivity, and mobile telephony has become widespread. A high-capacity fiber optic
     backbone network connects many provinces and provides international connectivity to neighboring countries. The information and communications technology (ICT)
     sector offers opportunities to expand the reach and delivery of government services and stimulate private sector-led economic growth and em-ployment generation.
     This Project builds on the strong growth seen thus far in mobile services to expand service delivery while accelerating expansion and improvements in backbone
     network connectivity. It also seeks to expand broadband connectivity and accelerate the development of the local private sector IT industry.
     The goal is to expand connectivity, encourage widespread use of mobile applications in strategic sectors in the government, and support the development of the local
     information technology (IT) industry.
     Components are:
     ■■     Expanding connectivity: Finances the expansion of the national backbone network by 1,000 km and supports the creation of an enabling policy and regula-tory
            environment to increase the reach of high quality mobile telephone and Internet services to more users.
     ■■     Mainstreaming mobile applications: Supports activities that build on the high penetration of mobile telephones in Afghanistan to expand the reach and improve
            the quality of public services and applications that support program management.
     ■■     IT industry development: Supports the definition of an IT sector development policy; an IT skills development program to expand the pool of skilled IT profes-
            sionals as a key building block for sector development in Afghanistan; and the setting up of an incubator for ICT firms in the ICT Village.
     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■     The deployment of the fiber optical backbone network in the North East section was completed and handed over to Afghan Telecom. Work on the central route
            to Yakawlang is almost completed, and contracts for Kunar, Kapisa, Ghulam Khan Office and Bamiyan-Mazar-e-Sharif routes have been signed. Im-plementation
            progress will be closely monitored by MCIT and the Bank team.
     ■■     The m-Government service delivery platform (Mobile Platform) was soft launched on Afghan Telecom’s network. Selected m-Government Application and Services
            are expected to be launched through all GSM/3G Operators of Afghanistan for selected Ministries, after the MoUs are signed with the MNOs and the selected
            Ministries by MCIT in October, 2016. Implementation of the Innovation Support Program (US$1m) continues to be slow due to limited level of partic-ipation by
            ICT Professionals of the Country and there is a significant need for capacity building of the potential beneficiaries. To date, over 2,300 people (in-cluding 400
            Females) have been provided ICT skills training. The incubator program is progressing well, with 20 startups already active. MCIT and the ICT institute are encour-
            aged to develop internal capacities to ensure sustainability of the program beyond the project closing.

       for at least two dams
■■     Water Resources Management and Development: Continued support for restoration of the hydromet data collection networks, technical support for hydrom-et
       data analysis and update of river basin management plan for the key river basins
■■     Project management and capacity building: Includes (i) project management and construction supervision; (ii) support for capacity building; and (iii) incre-
       mental contract staff.
KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■     A total of 98 irrigation schemes have been rehabilitated, benefiting 100,000 ha of irrigation command area (compared to the end project target of 300,000 ha)
       and 63,000 farmers.
■■     Feasibility studies of 6 small dams in the northern river basin have been completed. Detailed social and environmental studies will be done.
■■     Regular data collection is under way from 127 hydrological stations and 56 snow and meteorological stations at various locations on the five-river basin and work
       started on an annual Hydrology Book. Forty cableway stations for flow measurement at selected hydrology stations are installed.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The Afghanistan New Market Development Project (ANMDP) is the first World Bank funded project to be implemented by Ministry of Commerce and Industries since
     the World Bank’s re-engagement in Afghanistan. It seeks to support the development of the Afghan private sector.
     The objective is to help revitalize private sector activities in the four major cities – Kabul, Mazar-e-Sharif, Jalalabad, and Herat – by providing business development and
     technical assistance to support private firms’ initiative to gain market knowledge, improve product quality and processing technologies, and increase their presence
     in both domestic and export markets.

     Components are:
     ■■     Facility for New Market Development: Establishes a cost-sharing mechanism to support small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and business associa-tions
            to access business development services in order to enhance productive capacity and encourage innovation through product or market diversification.
     ■■     Project implementation support and technical assistance to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MOCI): Supports MOCI with: (i) the establishment and opera-
            tion of a project management unit for the New Market Development Project; and (ii) technical assistance to develop a strategic plan to access support from the
            recently approved Afghanistan Capacity Building for Results (CBR) Facility.
     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■     ANMDP has largely met its development objectives as measured by the monitoring indicators.
     ■■     Based on the latest information provided by GIZ IS, there are indications of significant progress towards achieving the ANMDP PDO and its associated results tar-
            gets. Under the ANMDP, the Facility for New Market Development (FNMD) was launched in March 2013 and in the two and a half years of its core imple-mentation,
            received 1,050 applications across the four cities of Kabul, Mazar-e-Sharif, Jalalabad and Herat.
     ■■     To date, 376 firms against a revised target of 375 and 54 associations against a revised target of 30 have been assisted. Sales have increased by an aver-age of 24
            percent against a target of 20 percent over pre-grants levels across the four cities. 1,516 jobs, of which 30 percent are filled by women, have been created against
            a target of 1500 of which 5 percent were targeted at women.
     ■■     21 new or improved products have been introduced and 25 new international markets entered against a target of 20 new/improved products created or new
            markets entered. Out of the total funding envelope of US$ 11.2 million for matching grant to SMEs and US$ 0.8 million for Business Planning Supplemen-tary
            Program Assistance under the FNMD component of the current Project, approximately US$ 10.3 million has been reimbursed to SMEs to date.
     ■■     Throughout the three-year implementation period, FNMD was well established, recognized by the private sector, and active in Kabul, Mazar, Herat and Jalalabad.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The agriculture sector accounts for 31 percent of GDP, but provides employment to 59 percent of the labor force. The government’s strategy for economic growth and
poverty reduction includes development of perennial horticulture and livestock as key activities.
The project will build on achievements made by a previous initiative in promoting adoption of improved production practices. Its main focus will be on effectively
graduating from an emergency phase and into a development approach.
The objective is to promote adoption of improved production practices by target farmers, with the gradual rollout of farmer-oriented agricultural services, delivery
systems and investment support.
Components are:
■■     Horticultural production: Provides target beneficiaries with demand-driven extension and productive investment support, including organizational support (e.g.,
       orchard management, value addition and marketing) for farmers and extension support for the successful adoption of improved technology.
■■     Animal production and health: Provides beneficiaries with investment support for animal production and animal health, and extension support for adopting
       improved technology packages. It also supports public investments for the establishment of an animal health surveillance and control system, and in the devel-
       opment of improved models of intervention through trials and studies to inform policy on possible future private investment.
■■     Implementation management and technical assistance: Supports implementation management at national and regional levels, and technical assistance to
       inform implementation, policy development and capacity building at the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation, and Livestock.
KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■     Reached over 287,205 farmers and herders of which 119,694 are women, introducing improved production practices, extension services and technologies.
       Financed the establishment of 12,595 ha of improved land in 28 provinces. Rehabilitated more than 70,000 ha of orchards and established 58,116 kitchen
       gardening schemes.
■■     To date, 358 raisin drying houses have been completed and an additional 639 houses are planned to be completed by the end of 2016. Construction was com-
       pleted of 403 water harvest structures that are being used by farmers with a high level of satisfaction.
■■     89,090 farmers (57,150 female and 31,940 male) have been organized into 1,590 producer groups, including poultry producer groups, to receive regular train-
       ing in animal production and health practices.
■■     Under the National Brucellosis Control Program in 360 districts 1,250,880 young female calves and over 6,279,200 young female sheep and goats have been
       vaccinated.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The National Solidarity Program (NSP) is a flagship program of the government of Afghanistan and is currently operating in all 34 provinces. The Afghan govern-ment
     launched NSP to lay the foundation for a sustainable form of inclusive local governance, rural reconstruction, and poverty alleviation. In late 2015, the National Unity
     Government began the ‘Jobs for Peace’ initiative and the NSP was the first to respond by creating the ‘Maintenance Cash Grants (MCG) scheme’ that would demonstrate
     to the rural populations the presence and ability of the GoA to continue to deliver services and benefits. By working through CDCs it also supports the sustainability of
     these local institutions as development platforms across the country.

     The objective is to build, strengthen, and maintain community development councils (CDCs) as effective institutions for local governance and socioeconomic
     development. The project components are:
     ■■     Capacity building: Establish CDCs to (i) function as village-level governance bodies for continued empowerment of village communities; and (ii) facilitate com-
            munities’ participation in the various sector programs operating in rural areas.
     ■■     Community grants for economic and social development: Provide block grants to communities to fund priority investment schemes (sub-projects) for rural and
            social development.
     ■■     Project implementation: Support the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development’s overall management and oversight of NSP.
     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■     Since 2003, NSP has successfully established CDCs in over 35,000 communities, and supported subsequent rounds of CDC elections in over 11,500 of these
            communities. Over 450,000 CDC members have been elected, registered and trained in a variety of areas. Over 1.23 million community members have also
            been trained to support the CDCs with project management and/or operations and maintenance.
     ■■     NSP has completed over 84,000 community level infrastructure schemes in all three phases which has resulted in greater access to services. Over 53,300 kilo-
            meters of road was constructed and 310 km rehabilitated; over 11.7 million people were provided with access to improved water sources and a further 86,300
            improved community water points were constructed; 32 MW of power was generated; over 524,000 hectares of land was brought under irrigation or provided
            with irrigation and drainage services, and 1,974 classrooms were built. All these sub-projects have generated over 52 million days of paid short term employment
            for skilled and unskilled workers.
     ■■     Since December 2015, the MCG has rolled out equitably across the country to 45 districts in 12 provinces (Baghlan, Balkh, Farah, Faryab, Herat, Jawzjan, Kanda-
            har, Khost, Kunarha, Kunduz, Laghman, and Nangarhar) that had high underemployment rates. As of August 2016, US$35 million has been disbursed as small
            US$10,000 grants directly to 3,900 CDCs, who administer the funds and select skilled and unskilled workers from the poorest households.
     ■■     As of July 2016 a total of 1.9 million labor days have been generated, and with an additional financing of US$57 million the MCG is expected to roll out to all
            Provinces and will have created over 11 million paid-for-labor-days that will directly benefit over 440,000 households. Efforts are being made to target the poorest
            households and provide food security through 2-3 months of income generation during the lean periods in the year.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Most irrigation schemes in Afghanistan are operating at 25 percent efficiency, as compared to the norm of 40-60 percent elsewhere in South Asia. Water loss occurs
at farm level because the absence of proper farm-level irrigation systems (basins, furrows) leads to wastage of water supplied from the watercourses. Under the
Agriculture Production and Productivity Program, the first step is to improve agricultural productivity by reducing water loss in tertiary canals and proper on-farm water
management practices. An Additional Financing of about $45 million from ARFT has been granted.

The objective is to improve agricultural productivity in project areas by enhancing the efficiency of water used.

Components are:
The objective is to improve agricultural productivity in project areas by enhancing the efficiency of water used.

Components are:
■■     On-farm water management: Carries out social mobilization for the establishment of irrigation associations (IAs) in the project areas, including the provision of: (i)
       training to communities in organization and management of IAs; (ii) facilitation services for communities to develop the IAs’ internal legal rules and regulations;
       (iii) assistance to IAs to be registered under the Water Law; (iv) technical training to IAs; and (v) carrying out engineering surveys and infrastruc-ture improvements
       to small irrigation schemes, or tertiary canals, covering approximately 10,000 hectares in the project areas.
■■     Support for Agricultural and Water Productivity Enhancement, aiming at exploiting irrigation potentials through demonstration and technical training at the
       on-farm level.
■■     Institutional strengthening and capacity building: Develops institutional capacity at the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock (MAIL) to plan, de-sign,
       implement and monitor on-farm water management programs. Supports the construction of five office buildings to accommodate the ministry’s irriga-tion direc-
       torate and staff at five regional centers in Kabul, Herat, Mazar-e-Sharif, Baghlan and Jalalabad.
■■     Project management, coordination, monitoring and evaluation: Strengthens institutional capacity at the ministry for project implementation, monitoring and
       evaluation by establishing and maintaining a project implementation unit comprising a Kabul-based core team, five project area teams, and internationally
       recruited experts.
KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■     Land productivity of wheat and other crops has increased by 15 percent, while water productivity of wheat and other crops also increased by 10 percent and ir-
       rigated area by 10 percent.
■■     Physical rehabilitation of irrigation schemes exceeded its target with good quality and within the project budget allocation and timeline: as of now, 100 irrigation
       schemes (mostly informal) have been rehabilitated covering a total of 19,000 hectares of irrigation command area.
■■     Establishment of 175 irrigation associations (IAs) has been completed. The IAs are based on the traditional Mirab system and have taken up the responsibilities
       for operation and maintenance.
■■     A robust impact has been observed on increasing agriculture production with relatively modest investment costs (on average less than $500 per hectare).

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Building core public financial management (PFM) capacity in government has been one of the fundamental thrusts of the Bank’s interim support strategy for
     Afghanistan. The Bank has gained valuable insight on PFM issues in Afghanistan through IDA-funded technical assistance projects and extensive analytical work.
     In the wake of discussions between the government and the donor community on a planned transition for Afghanistan to take greater responsibility in managing the
     reconstruction agenda, the government prepared and shared with donors at the Kabul Donor Conference in June, 2010 a PFM “roadmap”. It is guided by the vision that
     (i) policies that reflect the aspirations and needs of the Afghan people drive the government budget; (ii) a government budget assigns responsibility for development
     outcomes; (iii) efficient public finance and equitable allocation of resources sustain economic development; and (iv) accountable civil servants and equitable delivery
     of services build citizens’ trust in government.
     On February 10, 2016, Additional Financing of $41.125million was approved to help finance the costs associated with scaling up successful activities and sustain some
     achieved results in the project.
     PFMR II’s original development objective is to strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of Afghanistan’s procurement, treasury, and audit systems”. The project
     components are:
     ■■     Procurement reform: Introduces procurement reform aimed at enhancing procurement facilitation, capacity building in line ministries and provinces, and insti-
            tutional development.
     ■■     Financial Management Reform: Financial management reform: Supports financial management reform in treasury operations and system development, human
            resources capacity development, professional accountant organization, and line ministry public financial management assessments.
     ■■     Audit reform and performance: Supports reforms and performance improvement through training for internal and external Audit. Reform management: Sup-
            ports monitoring technical assistance and reporting on benchmarks of the PFM roadmap.
     ■■     Revenue Mobilization: Support to the Afghanistan Revenue Department for maintenance of computerized tax system, implementation of tax related initia-tives
            and design & implementation of its new organizational structure.
     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■     The legal framework underpinning public financial management in Afghanistan has been established. The government now prepares and passes a compre-
            hensive budget in an orderly and transparent manner.
     ■■     A government–wide integrated financial management information system is in place and is being upgraded.
     ■■     Project support to Afghanistan’s centralized procurement oversight has been mobilized and National Procurement Authority, as the successor to the Procure-ment
            Policy Unit, continues to assist with the reorganization, development and assessment of procurement units in the line ministries. External audit is now engaged
            in performance audit and is committed to developing a mechanism for citizens’ participation in the audit.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The project seeks to help the Government to put the justice system on a sustainable path for long-term results, and where possible improve service delivery through
discrete inputs designed to inform and incentivize eventual reform of the justice sector. The Justice Service Delivery Project beneficiaries include the Supreme Court,
the Ministry of Justice, and the Attorney General’s Office and – through support to these institutions – the people of Afghanistan, who will benefit from increased access
to legal services.

A project restructuring was completed in June, 2016 which resulted in partial cancellation of S$60.5 million out of the US$85.5m originally approved for the project
thereby, reducing the project’s commitment amount to US$25 million. The PDO and project components, however remain the same.

The objective is to increase access to and use of legal services through balancing demand and supply of core services and increasing the productivity of providers
through: (i) aligning the structure, organization, processes and capacities of judicial institutions to contemporary needs of users; and (iii) easing access to legal
information for legal professionals, judicial institutions and the broader public. The components are:
■■     Legal Empowerment
■■     Organization and Capacity of Justice Institutions
■■     Implementation Capacity.
KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■     The level of legal aid provision has been increased with the project facilitating 65 legal aid providers across the country each expected to handle 10 cases per
       month. Legal Aid Offices were established in the four pilot provinces (Kabul, Herat, Logar, and Bamyan) targeted by the project.
■■     Complementary to this, libraries have been established by the project in each of these provinces, and a legal information center is close to completion with the
       necessary IT equipment procured and installed, and staffing needs for the center are in process of being recruited. The project has also supported training for 125
       judges, with training of a further 40 judges scheduled.
■■     The project has completed a limited number of renovation and construction activities to create an appropriate working environment for justice institutions. These
       include courts and prosecutor’s offices in the four pilot provinces, and a Ministry of Justice (MOJ) Sub-office in the Dehsabz District of Kabul. Construc-tion of new
       MOJ headquarters and renovation of its old headquarters (within the same compound) are ongoing, while procurement process for an urban court in Kandahar
       and one in Parwan has concluded with construction soon to commence.
■■     Several activities expected to help lay the foundation for eventual reform of the justice sector, such as Justice Institutions Mapping, HRM Strategy Develop-ment
       and Training Needs Assessment, are in process.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The Afghan formal social protection system consists largely of a pension scheme for public sector employees, military, police and a Martyrs and Disabled Pension
Program. In addition, a social safety net encompasses a number of government and donor schemes that transfer cash and in-kind benefits to various groups.

In pensions (including the Public Pension and the Martyrs and Disabled programs), the Government’s objectives are to ensure fiscal sustainability of the public pension
program, to provide improved and streamlined services to the beneficiaries, modernize programs’ administration, increase transparency , and reduce error, fraud, and
corruption. In safety nets, the government aims to build systems for a poverty targeted national safety net program.

The project’s goals are to improve the administration of the public pension schemes, and develop administrative systems for safety net interventions, with a focus on
targeting and benefit payment delivery systems, while delivering cash benefits to the poorest families in specific pilot districts. Project Components are:

Pensions: Supports the design of new administrative arrangements for the public pension system and modernization of the existing pension systems, including the
Martyrs and Disabled Pension.

Safety Nets: Supports designing and piloting of targeting and delivery systems to establish a poverty-targeted cash transfer;

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■     Key elements of a reformed and modernized Public Sector Pension System, which includes a revised institutional and human resources structure of the Pension
       Department, a set of simplified business processes, a comprehensive new Management Information System, fiscal forecasting models for revenues and expen-
       ditures, and a new chart of accounts of the pension system, are in place. Recently, a bio-metric identification and verification system with one win-dow operation
       facility started working at the Central Pension Department in Kabul. Around seventy five thousand pensioners are registered at the new Man-agement Informa-
       tion System (MIS) at the center and are paid through bank accounts. The MIS is rolled out to two provincial pension departments namely Balkh and Nangarhar.
■■     A multi-phased safety net cash transfer pilot has been designed, implemented and evaluated. In the new phase, a new targeting methodology of computer-ized
       registration of poor households in five districts and benefit payments through mobile money operators and commercial banks was successfully imple-mented.
       Around twelve thousand selected poor families (68,000 individuals) benefited from the cash benefits. The pilot project will deliver two more rounds of benefits
       to these families until June 2017.
■■     The pilot program over the past five years has provided support in cash transfers to over 28,000 poor and vulnerable families (around 148,000 individuals) in
       thirteen selected districts in ten provinces.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The original project had three components: (i) distribution system rehabilitation - rehabilitation of the distribution system in Charikar, Gulbahar, and Jabul-es-Seraj
     (in Parwan province); and Pul-e-Khumri (in Baghlan province); (ii) rehabilitation of transmission switchyards at the Mahipar and Naghlu hydropower stations on the
     Kabul River; and (iii) institutional capacity building and project management – project implementation support to the Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) and the
     recruitment/retention of a Project Management Firm (PMF).

     Under the additional financing the implementation of components under the original project will be completed by covering the cost overrun, and by restructuring
     project implementation by components.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■     Since the additional financing became effective on 31 July 2015, the responsibility for the implementation of the Project was passed from the Ministry of Energy
            and Water (MEW) to Afghanistan’s power utility Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS). The hand-over of management responsibilities between MEW and DABS
            is complete, but there are now delays in the ongoing distribution and switchyard contracts. The World Bank team and teams from MEW and DABS are collaborating
            to address the situation.
     ■■     700 kilometers of Distribution lines have been constructed or rehabilitated under the project. An assessment of km installed under the two contracts of this com-
            ponent shows that about 12 percent more distribution lines were built than originally envisaged under the contract. Also, under institutional capacity building,
            energy efficiency and project management support are mostly complete.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The KMDP Grant for US$110 million was approved on April, 2014 and became effective on April 15, 2014. As of April 9, 2015, within one year of effectiveness,
disbursements stand at US$28.29million (25.45%). The PDOs remain highly relevant for Kabul, a city with over 70% of its population in unplanned settlements.
KMDP’s cost effective methodology enables equitable service delivery, strengthens the social capital of the beneficiary communities and continues to entrench a
culture of community participation in decision making over public expenditures that directly impacts the community. The likelihood of achieving end-of-project as well
as intermediate PDOs indicator targets is high. The PDO is rated “satisfactory”.

The Project Development Objectives are to: (i) Increase access to basic municipal services in selected residential areas of Kabul city; (ii) Redesign KM’s Financial
Management system to support better service delivery; and (iii) Enable early response in the event of an eligible emergency.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■     Effective for just over a year, implementation of the KMDP Grant is progressing well, and it is expected to achieve the indicator targets at the project outcome level
       and at the intermediate level by the closing date.
■■     Grant disbursements stand at US$28.29 million (25.45%) and KMDP commitments at US$38.4 million (34.9%). By December 31, 2016, cumulative expendi-
       tures by KMDP within twenty months of effectiveness of the Grant are expected to be about US$38.4million (about 34%).
■■     There are about 445,000 direct beneficiaries, 40 % of the target number, about half from upgrading and half from trunk roads. There are 156,111 indirect benefi-
       ciaries, including students, teachers and staff of several schools and institutions of higher education that are located within the upgraded areas. About 73 percent
       of the beneficiaries are women and children. 14,850 tree saplings have been planted in 29 gozars, used for urban communities, with community contributions;
       and community solid waste collection mechanisms are functioning in most of the gozars. The works executed have generated 1,119,190 man-days of temporary
       employment.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Unprecedented population growth in Kabul, large-scale destruction of the city’s infrastructure during the war, followed by a growing concentration of security related
     activity has exacerbated the backlog of infrastructure deficiency in a city that harbors the capital functions of the country: A city originally planned for less than one
     million people, is now ranked 86th among the world’s largest agglomerations. The capacity of the existing road network is diminished further by an astronomical
     growth in the number of motor vehicles that is today double the 300,000 vehicles the network was designed for. The result is extreme congestion which is further
     exacerbated by security related encroachments and road closures.Urban productivity of Kabul is deeply impacted by inadequate transport services: Although Kabul’s
     existing urban road network, initially planned and developed in 1960s with technical support from the Former Soviet Union, provides generous widths, road surfac-es
     have deteriorated due to age, poor maintenance, severe weather conditions, and the lack of proper drainage. 55 percent of the network is in need for rehabilita-tion.
     More than 61 percent of the urban population accesses their homes through unpaved roads. The result is poor access to jobs and services, low mobility of passenger
     and freight movement, congestion, increased road accident rates, and productivity losses.
     The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to improve road conditions and traffic flows in selected corridors of Kabul City.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■     - Initial activities including survey, design review and procurement of civil works started during the preparation of the project. As of August 15th, 2016, the imple-
            mentation of the four NCB civil works contracts (Lot 1, 2, 3, & 4) is completed and the roads are opened to the traffic. The implementation progress for the ICB Lot
            5 & 6 stands at 55%. The procurement process for Lot-7 is in the final stages of the bids evaluation. The procurement of Lot-8 (final lot) is planned to be started in
            the next 3 months. The design work for Wazir Abad canal is expected to be completed by December 2016.
     ■■     Under Component B, the consultancy for area accessibility and streets function optimization of Kabul city is under the final stages of the procurement review. The
            Terms of Reference (TOR) for the design and review of the 40 KM of new roads network is finalized and the roads are identified. The TOR for the Public Transport
            Demand study is prepared and ready for stakeholders’ consultation.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The Afghan power system is small, fragmented and underdeveloped but demand is growing rapidly. Despite considerable progress in building power infrastruc-ture
over the last decade, the estimated grid-based electricity covers only about 20 - 25 percent of the population, mainly in the urban areas and along a few transmission
corridors.

Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS), the state-owned power utility, lacks solid management, which led to overstaffing and under-qualification of staff; poor
customer service; lacking billing and collection; and below cost-recovery tariffs

The project’s development objective is to improve the capacity of DABS to plan and implement new investments, and to enhance operation and maintenance of the
Afghan electricity distribution system. The Project has two components:
■■     DABS staff capacity building. The objective of this component is to support DABS’ capacity to plan and implement new investments in distribution systems and tor
       operate and maintain the investments properly.
■■     Training Center development. This component supports development of a training center in Kabul. Currently DABS does not have any training facility for its staff,
       and this has been identified as a critical gap in its overall capacity building efforts.
KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
■■     Distribution investment project(s) of a USD 50 million planned and prepared using new standards and designs based on good international practice ad-justed
       for local conditions.
■■     Annual O&M plans for six major load centers prepared and implemented using new procedures based on good international practice adjusted for local conditions.
■■     80 percent of DABS planning and O&M staff with improved skills through the project supported training and use of new training center.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
      Hydropower provides 94.6 percent of domestically generated electricity with an installed capacity of 254 MW. In mid-2015 there were 12 hydropower plants in
     Afghanistan, not counting the over 5,000 off-grid micro hydropower plants constructed under the National Solidarity Program (NSP). The two largest among those
     are Naghlu Hydropower Plant (NHPP) at 94 MW installed capacity and Mahipar Hydropower Plant at 66 MW installed capacity. The NHPP was first commis-sioned in
     1967 and is located on the confluence of the Panjshir and Kabul Rivers in the Surobi District, Kabul Province, about 80 km east of Kabul. This project addresses critical
     rehabilitation needs at the Naghlu Plant

     The project development objective (PDO) is to improve dam safety and to increase the supply of electricity at the Naghlu Hydropower Plant.
     ■■     Mechanical, Electrical, and Electromechanical Works. This component complements the rehabilitation of the electrical and electromechanical parts of the plant
            previously undertaken and ensures their sustainable operation.
     ■■     Dam Safety and Power Generation Improvement. This component aims to ensure the safe operation of the dam through dam safety audit and safety im-prove-
            ment measures as well as optimization of power generation.
     ■■     Environmental and Social Sustainability, Project Management Support, and Future Project Preparation. This component includes local development assis-tance in
            support of benefit sharing with local communities and support toward environmental and social management ensuring that the DABS receives ad-vice on good
            international practices.
     KEY RESULTS EXPECTED:
     ■■     Improvement in the generation capacity (in MW) of Unit 1 in the NHPP
     ■■     Reduction in the total number of forced power outages in the NHPP
     ■■     Establishment of dam safety plans and periodic audits in accordance with international best practices
     ■■     Implementation of dam safety measures as recommended in dam safety audit reports
     ■■     Development of O&M procedures and guidelines that are in line with international best practices

PROJECT BACKGROUND:
As the Ministry of Finance (MoF) advances this structural reform agenda, its need for specialized knowledge support will grow. This is especially the case in the interim
as MOF formulates specific reform plans, policies and strategies for which technical assistance needs become more acute and require the production of specific
independent analysis. The purpose of the proposed Technical Assistance Facility is therefore to support MOF’s reform planning. Specifically the TAF is required to
support the implementation of the Five Year Plan for two Directorates General. The TAF is proposed to provide a flexible facility that allows MOF to quickly procure the
necessary inputs including (but not limited to) skills, to support strengthened processes and substantive pieces of work contributing specifical-ly to strengthening: (i)
Macro Fiscal Policy Management; and (ii) Budget Planning.

The development objective is to strengthen the fiscal management and the budget planning performance of Government of Afghanistan.
■■     Supporting the Continuous Improvement of the Performance of the Macro Fiscal Performance Directorate General. This component is focused on strength-ening
       MFPD’s institutional capacity to effectively carry out its mandated activities.
■■     Supporting the Continuous Improvement of the Programs Implementation and Coordination General Directorate. This component is focused on strengthen-ing
       the institutional capacity of PICGD to effectively carry out its mandated activities set out in detail in its Five Year Rolling Plan.
KEY RESULTS EXPECTED:
■■     Development and implementation of medium term fiscal framework
■■     Development and implementation of forward estimates framework
■■     National budget allocation determined by National Development Strategy

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     It is widely acknowledged that Afghanistan’s growth is constrained by the incidence of poverty, high illiteracy, and the lack of a skilled labor force. This proposed project
     directly links literacy and skills development by designing interventions that improve access to skills for illiterate and unskilled young Afghan men and women. The
     project will incentivize non-formal training providers to provide quality training to Afghan men and women and increase their job placement rates. Subsequently, the
     project shall promote entrepreneurship among youth to help improve their welfare status.
     To increase the potential for employment and higher earnings of targeted young Afghan women and men in rural and semi-urban areas through non-formal skills
     training”

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The Afghanistan Secured Lending Project is part of the Financial Infrastructure Program in the MENA region. IFC’s access to finance advisory services in the MENA region,
through its Secured Transactions and Collateral Registries Team, assists government clients in developing the appropriate legal and institutional frame-works to allow
and encourage the use of movable assets as collateral for loans.
At inception of the project, the results from the Doing Business ranking on the Ease of Getting Credit, a measure of credit information sharing and legal rights of
borrowers and lenders, showed that the financial sector in Afghanistan was not able to meet the needs of small firms or individuals – Afghanistan ranked 179th out of
181 countries in 2009.

The overall objective of the project is to achieve sustained development of the financial sector by increasing private sector access to finance, particularly credit, in the
MENA region, by strengthening lender rights in movable assets.

In Afghanistan, the project operates under three components: a) legislative reform resulting in enactment or amendment of laws and regulations to enhance rights
of creditors of movable assets; b) creation of a functioning movable asset registry to enable lenders to effectively file a notice related to their proprietary rights, and
c) awareness raising and capacity building activities to increase knowledge among stakeholders about the benefits of well-functioning secured financing systems.
The overall program targets are to benefit 250 micro, small and medium enterprises with expanded access to finance, facilitate $13 million in financing to small and
medium enterprises (secured with movable property as collateral) and an overall $30 million in financing facilitated.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■     Two new pieces of legislation: an act on secured transactions in movable property and the regulation for operating the registry were adopted.
■■     Collateral Registry established in 2013 with 3869 new registrations as at May 2015.
■■     Improvements in the ranking of Afghanistan from ‘0’ to ’9 ’on the “Strength of Legal Rights Index” a subset of the “Ease of Getting Credit” ranking of Doing Busi-
       ness in 2015. Further in 2015, Afghanistan was ranked 89th out of 189 countries on the Doing Business “Ease of Getting Credit” ranking
■■     Establishment of the Afghanistan Institute of Banking and Finance in November 2010.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The private sector in Afghanistan still lacks a sufficient level of capacity and understanding of good business skills and practices.

This lack of knowledge affects the ability of the private sector to grow or to export which in turn affects economic growth. The business development services (BDS)/
management skills training market, while having improved its capacity to deliver high quality training using material customized to the local business environment,
is still underdeveloped and requires further assistance to enable it to orient itself towards the private sector and its training needs.

IFC has been contributing to the development of management capacity in both the public and private sector with its Business Edge (DFID funded) management
training program for the past four years (September 2008 to March 2013).

The overall goal of the project is to enhance the business performance and increase the revenue of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) by develop-ing their
managerial capacities using IFC’s Business Edge (BE) product.

The project will build the capacity of local training providers to deliver BE management training to 5,200 individuals (of which 1,820 are women) reaching 520 MSMEs.

Approximately 77 percent of the targets (4,000 individuals trained) will be reached by project completion (June 30, 2016) and 23 percent of targets (1,200) will be
reached within three years of post-project completion (by June 30, 2019).

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■     From inception in September 2008 to June 30, 2015, the project has delivered training to 9,056 people including 3,935 (43 percent) women and reached 801
       MSMEs. The impact assessment indicated that 91 percent of the private sector respondents expressed a positive impact of the BE training on company perfor-
       mance.
■■     Under the current project, since April 1, 2013 to June 2015, the project has delivered training to 5,604 people including 2,724 (48.6 percent) women and reached
       547 MSMEs. In 2014, two impact assessment surveys were conducted to determine the impact of BE training on unemployed individuals and im-pact of Business
       Thematic Radio programs sponsored by IFC on businesses.
■■      Results show:
■■     68 percent of the trained individuals stated that the training helped them in getting jobs;
■■     8 percent individuals reported that the training helped them in setting up their own businesses.
■■     Of the 608 respondents surveyed, 76 percent individual employed the skills and ideas acquired from the radio programs and most of them reported positive
       impact of the programs on their businesses.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The Afghanistan Construction Permits Reform Project, launched in May 2014, aims to support the Afghan government as it revamps the way construction permits are
     issued across the country. IFC will help officials simplify the often time-consuming permitting process and advise the government as it develops new permit-ting laws.
     The changes, planned for the provinces at the national and subnational levels, are designed to spur the growth of Afghanistan’s construction sector, a vital part of the
     country’s economy. That, in turn, is expected to increase the supply of affordable housing at a time when the demand for new homes is growing quickly. The project is
     part of a wider IFC effort to help diversify Afghanistan’s economy and spur growth across the nation.

     The objective of this project is to develop a simplified yet effective construction permit system and regulatory framework that will improve the government’s efficiency
     and capacity to issue construction permits. By doing so, the private sector will benefit from reduced costs through the easing of permitting bottlenecks, which hamper
     the ability of the growing housing sector in Afghanistan to meet demand.

     The new framework will also allow the government to retroactively formalize unpermitted buildings. The project aims to reduce the time it takes to obtain con-struction
     permits from the current 334 days to 180 days; reduce the number of procedures from 15 to nine; and improve the capacity of civil servants operating the process.

     Changes are expected to increase both the efficiency and capacity of the Kabul Municipality to issue construction permits and, hence, increase applications under the
     reformed permits system by 40 percent.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■     Implementation of the legal and regulatory recommended procedures has started which paves the way for the improved CP process as well as ensuring the health
            and safety of various structures built within the limits set by the Kabul City Master Plan.
     ■■     The time for obtaining Construction Permits in Kabul Municipality was reduced for residential permits from 52 to 6 steps and for commercial high rise buildings
            from 122 steps to 16. The Construction Permit processes have been streamlined.
     ■■     Kabul Municipality staff members at technical and managerial levels completed a tailor made training program.
     ■■     The project completed the CP software customization and launched it online on August 2016. The new web-based online system allows the private sector to obtain
            the permits online for the first time in Afghanistan. A wide-scale awareness raising campaign on improved Construction Permit process has been completed.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     This project builds on the success of a previous successful IFC intervention in the horticulture sector, Afghanistan Horticulture Exports Development, which helped
     farmers to adopt best agriculture practices for two major export commodities (raisins and pomegranates).
     The project will focus on improving farmers’ skills and expanding market opportunities for Afghan agriculture commodities through improving access to export mar-
     kets, and strengthening the overall value chain, including processing opportunities for grade B fruits.
     The project will reach out to farmers located in remote locations, leveraging the skills of the extension workers association established and trained in the previous
     project. These farmers will be integrated into the supply chain of large fruit exporting and processing firms in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, these lead agribusinesses will
     be supported in becoming compliant with global standards required for access to high-end markets for food products.

     The overall objective of the project is to increase the supply of fresh and processed fruits, through improved compliance with market standards, and integration of
     farmers into the value chain of lead agribusiness firms, giving them access to wider market opportunities.

     The project will initially start its activities in Kandahar province, building on the success of the previous project, while assessing the potential of expanding to other
     provinces in Afghanistan. Components include:

     Extension workers association aimed to set up and roll out a Sustainable business model for a lead firm to obtain sustainable supply of fruits from smallholder farmers
     by development of business relationship with extension workers.

     Farmer Technical Assistance aimed to improve the capacity of 1,000 farmers in fruit production, harvest and post-harvest handing and are integrated the farmers into
     the lead firm’s supply chain (through contract farming agreement between farmer producer groups and lead firm)

     Lead firm contract farming and trade facilitation aimed to support a Lead firm in implementation of the contract farming system with farmers in their supply chain as
     well as established an overseas Marketing Agent for export market expansion.

     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
     ■■     Through the established network of extension workers in Kandahar, provide technical assistance to 1,000 farmers and integrate them into lead firms’ supply
            chain. By completion, at least 800 farmers are expected to adopt improved practices and comply with market standards.
     ■■     Through improved compliance with market standards at the farmer level, increase the volume and value of fruits sold to lead firms. By completion, benefitting
            farmers are expected to sell a cumulative volume of 9.6 million kg of fruit totaling a value of $5.06 million to lead firms.
     ■■     Through supporting lead firms to access new markets and obtaining at least four new contracts with new buyers, generate a total of $2.05 million additional net
            profit from the export of fresh and processed fruit by completion.
     KEY PARTNERS:
     Large fruit processing companies in Afghanistan, the Extension Workers Association, local NGOs, organizations engaged in supporting the agribusiness sector in
     Afghanistan, and potential global buyers (IFC and non-IFC investment clients).

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The private sector in Afghanistan still lacks a sufficient level of capacity and understanding of good business skills and practices.

This lack of knowledge affects the ability of the private sector to grow or to export which in turn affects economic growth. The business development services (BDS)/
management skills training market, while having improved its capacity to deliver high quality training using material customized to the local business environment,
is still underdeveloped and requires further assistance to enable it to orient itself towards the private sector and its training needs.

IFC has been contributing to the development of management capacity in both the public and private sector with its Business Edge (DFID funded) management
training program for the past four years (September 2008 to March 2013).

The overall goal of the project is to enhance the business performance and increase the revenue of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) by develop-ing their
managerial capacities using IFC’s Business Edge (BE) product.

The project will build the capacity of local training providers to deliver BE management training to 5,200 individuals (of which 1,820 are women) reaching 520 MSMEs.

Approximately 77 percent of the targets (4,000 individuals trained) will be reached by project completion (June 30, 2016) and 23 percent of targets (1,200) will be
reached within three years of post-project completion (by June 30, 2019).

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■     From inception in September 2008 to June 30, 2015, the project has delivered training to 9,056 people including 3,935 (43 percent) women and reached 801
       MSMEs. The impact assessment indicated that 91 percent of the private sector respondents expressed a positive impact of the BE training on company perfor-
       mance.
■■     Under the current project, since April 1, 2013 to June 2015, the project has delivered training to 5,604 people including 2,724 (48.6 percent) women and reached
       547 MSMEs. In 2014, two impact assessment surveys were conducted to determine the impact of BE training on unemployed individuals and im-pact of Business
       Thematic Radio programs sponsored by IFC on businesses.
Results show:
■■     68 percent of the trained individuals stated that the training helped them in getting jobs;
■■     8 percent individuals reported that the training helped them in setting up their own businesses.
■■     Of the 608 respondents surveyed, 76 percent individual employed the skills and ideas acquired from the radio programs and most of them reported positive
       impact of the programs on their businesses.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Dairy products are a major source of protein in Afghanistan. However, the dairy sector was largely destroyed during the Afghan civil war and has yet to fully recover.
     Imported dairy products have gained the majority of the market share in large metropolitan areas including Kabul.
     Supporting the livestock and local dairy industries has been a priority for the Afghan government as well as international development organizations. However,
     domestic producers continue to find it difficult to compete with imported products in terms of both quality and quantity.
     The MIGA guarantee of €1.34 million to investors in Mido Dairy Production Co covers direct equity against the risks of Transfer Restriction, Expropriation and War and
     Civil Disturbance for up to 10 years.
     From both the country and sector perspectives, MIGA is playing an important role in facilitating private investment to promote the technical know-how and in-vestment
     needed to develop this sector in a conflict-affected country.
     The project entails the establishment of a joint venture company in Afghanistan, Mido Dairy Production Co (‘MIDO’ or ‘the Company) with a dairy processing plant,
     located in the suburbs of Kabul, which will produce and distribute high-quality dairy products such as milk and yogurt, primarily to Kabul.

     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
     ■■     The generation of 20-25 new permanent jobs.	
     ■■     €1.2 million over the 7 years of operation in taxes and fees.
     ■■     27.9 percent economic rate of return.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The aim is to boost the production of cashmere. Currently Afghanistan exports around 1,000 metric tons (MT) of cashmere on an annual basis. The main trade center is
Herat, where a handful of exporters gather to purchase the cashmere from farmers.
The project was initially supported by the Afghanistan Small and Medium Enterprise Development program, funded by USAID. In 2011, this program provided funding
to Traitex Belgium (“Traitex”) and Cashmere Fibres International (“CFI”), the largest dehairer of Afghan cashmere, to set up operations in Afghanistan in order to increase
the value-added within the country and to promote the development of the sector.

Traitex, based in Verviers, Belgium, is an independent processing company that scours and carbonizes wool and cashmere. In June 2013, MIGA issued a guarantee of
$1.7 million to Traitex to cover equity and shareholder loans provided to Traitex Afghanistan against the risks of Transfer Restriction, Expropriation, and War and Civil
Disturbance for a period of up to 10 years. MIGA also provided a guarantee of $308,750 to Sodintec, a third party investor in Traitex Afghanistan, for the same tenor
and against the same risks.

From both the country and sector perspectives, MIGA is playing an important role in facilitating private investment to promote the technical know-how and invest-ment
needed to develop this sector in a conflict-affected country.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■     Generation of 35 permanent jobs directly, as well as supporting many hundreds of cashmere farmers indirectly.
■■     Generating $35,000 in taxes and fees annually.
■■     Achieving a 20.6 percent economic rate of return.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     In 2002, following decades of armed conflict, Afghanistan had a barely functioning and severely limited communications network. In early 2007, IFC and MIGA
     made a commitment to provide support directly to the most recent (third) mobile operator, MTN Group (then Areeba Afghanistan). IFC initially made an investment
     commitment in Areeba Afghanistan in 2006, which was later replaced by a larger investment facility to MTN Afghanistan comprising an equity investment of $13.5
     million and senior debt of $65 million in order to finance the expansion of MTN’s operations. MIGA initially issued a guarantee of $74.5 million to cover the direct
     equity investment of $85 million in Afghanistan. The coverage was for 15 years against two risks: i) transfer and convertibility re-striction, and ii) expropriation. The
     Afghanistan Investment Guarantee Facility (AIGF), managed by MIGA, provided $2 million of first loss. In 2011, when MTN Group expanded its network, MIGA increased
     its coverage by $82.1m. This brought MIGA’s total gross coverage to $156.6 million, in addition to the $2 million layer provided by AIGF. IFC exited its equity investment
     in July 2013 and the debt will be fully repaid in September 2015. In June 2016, the MIGA contracts guaranteeing the shareholder loans expired without renewal.

     From both a country and sector perspective, MIGA and IFC are playing an important role in facilitating south-south investment to promote the expansion of
     telecommunications infrastructure in a conflict-affected country, increasing the availability and affordability of communication services in Afghanistan. Fur-thermore,
     IFC’s investment has been supporting the expansion of telecom services into semi-urban and rural areas of Afghanistan. MIGA can mobilize addi-tional capacity in the
     private insurance market through its reinsurance arrangements. MIGA’s establishment of the AIGF, a first loss fund, with the help of other donor countries, has helped
     bring down the risk of the transaction, making it more attractive for the private reinsurance market.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■     With MIGA guarantee coverage and IFC’s investment and advisory support, MTN has been able to exceed expectations and reach over five million subscribers,
            close to a one-third market share.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The formal sector in Afghanistan is still in a formative stage, since the reopening of the economy to international business in 2002-2003. The economy is domi-nated
by informal enterprises. Registered firms are young and small: half of them have been operating for 4 years or less, and 91 percent of them have a maxi-mum of 5
employees. Economic growth is estimated to have fallen to 2 percent in 2014, from 3.7 percent in 2013 and an average of 9 percent during 2003-12; the growth
outlook for 2015 remains weak. Some of the major challenges that Afghanistan faces in the immediate and medium term are: restoring confidence and creating
private-sector jobs; and strengthening cohesion and service delivery.

This project will cover the measurement of 4 Doing Business indicators that are actionable at the local level and where subnational differences are likely to occur:
starting a business, dealing with construction permits, registering property and getting electricity. Even in countries characterized by centralized public sector like
Afghanistan, these areas show subnational differences at the regulatory level and/or in how the national regulations are implemented in practice. The benchmarking
will include 4 of the largest cities in addition to Kabul that serve as regional economic centers: Herat, Mazar e-Sharif, Kandahar, Jalalabad, Kabul.
The objective of the project is to support the Government of Afghanistan to advance regulatory reforms at the subnational level to foster a better business-enabling
regulatory environment across the country. It will do so by producing a Subnational Doing Business (SNDB) report which benchmarks business regula-tions and their
implementation on 4 key Doing Business indicators (Starting a business, Registering property, Dealing with construction permits and Getting electricity) across 4
municipalities (Herat, Mazar e-Sharif, Kandahar, Jalalabad) as well as Kabul.
The report: (i) allows comparability among municipalities in Afghanistan and with 189 economies worldwide; (ii) identifies regulatory constraints in detail and
highlights good practices; (iii) provides in-depth analysis and detailed policy recommendations on how to improve the areas measured; (iv) promotes peer to peer
learning through the sharing of good practices; (v) and motivates governments to reform by repeating the measurement over time. A 2nd round of Subna-tional Doing
Business benchmarking starting in 2018, will update the measurements and document the reforms undertaken, which were motivated by the first benchmarking
round in each of the cities. It will also provide further reform recommendations.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■     Conducted a scoping mission in Kabul in May 2015, to present the project to the National Government authorities and to identify private sector profession-als and
       local consulting firms to organize the data collection process.
■■     Completed the selection and contractual arrangements with the coordinating firm in charge of supporting the data collection.
■■     Trained staff from the coordinating firm on the indicators methodology.
■■     Completed the first stage of the data collection, which included distribution of questionnaires (to the private and public sector), interviews and desk re-searches.
■■     Held the “Right of Reply” meetings in Kabul (April 2016) with local government officials and relevant agencies to discuss the preliminary findings of the project
       with the competent local authorities of the 4 cities measured on a confidential basis.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The World Bank Group, fosters sustainable economic growth in developing countries by providing advisory services to businesses and governments aimed at specific
     aspects of private sector development, including supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, enhancing access to finance, improving the business enabling
     environment, supporting privatization and public-private partnerships and promoting environmental and social sustainable practices. Advisory services are delivered
     through the Trade and Competitiveness Global Practice in South Asia Region (SAR).
     An analysis conducted by IFC Advisory in December 2013 revealed that starting a business at the subnational level is a very complex, unwieldy and time-consuming
     process and is a severe impediment to investment at the subnational level. This analysis recommended a fundamental rethinking of the strict system of starting a
     business enforced by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MoCI) at the subnational level. Evidence collected from interviews with business man-agers at the
     subnational level, as well as with MoCI officials, indicated that the procedures for obtaining a business license and registration required a minimum of several weeks,
     and might extend to a few months. This is significantly slower than the 2 – 3 days currently required to complete the same process in Kabul.
     Building on the reforms achieved in phase I of Afghanistan Licensing Reform Project, the overall goal of Phase II is to support the Ministry of Commerce and Industry
     in promoting an investment climate conducive to private sector growth. The projects aims to achieve the following objectives by project completion:
     ■■     Business Registration and Licensing including establishing further streamlined processes and successfully rolling out the business registration and licensing
            reforms conducted in Kabul to MoCI offices at the provincial level in light of international best practices.
     ■■     Renewal of Business Licensing through increasing efficiency and sustainability for the renewal process of business licensing in the MoF, and increasing the
            number of firms that benefit from reformed licensing requirements as measured by the number of renewed licenses by 20% (3 years post project comple-tion).
     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■     Four-day study tour for the Senior Management of MoCI and ACBRIP in Tbilisi, Georgia to visit the key agencies in Georgia that have successfully imple-mented
            the key reforms and understand how Georgia was able to tackle similar political and social challenges.
     ■■     Signing Memorandum of Understanding with Ministry of Commerce and Industry to have the MOCI full commitment for the project deliverables and ensure the
            project sustainability.
     ■■     Completion of the Assessment Stage of the Project to have detailed Process Analysis of 16 provinces, based on which the next two stages of the Project will be
            executed.
     ■■     Completion of the ICT Infrastructure and Capacity Survey for the ACBRIP’s Central Office (Kabul) and provincial offices in cooperation between NETLINKS LTD, the
            staff of the MOCI, and other involved entities.
     ■■     Documented the history and evolution of the Afghan Central Business Registry since 2008 in line with international good practice as well as the future goals and
            potentials of the Registry. As result of the report the Government of Afghanistan assigned a high level commission that includes Ministry of Fi-nance, Ministry
            of Commerce and Afghanistan Investment Support Agency to come up with a strategic merger plan for the AISA and MOCI-ACBRIP business licenses that will be
            issued under One Stop Shop.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
First Microfinance Bank Afghanistan (“FMFB-A” or the “Bank”) was founded in 2003, and it was the first bank to be licensed in Afghanistan under the new law. It was
founded by the Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development (“AKFED”) and subsequently both IFC and KfW became shareholders, while the Aga Khan Agency for Micro-
finance (“AKAM”) replaced AKFED as the principal shareholder & Sponsor of the Bank. FMFB-A commenced business in May 2004 in Kabul and it is regulated by the
Central Bank (Da Afghanistan Bank, “DAB”). FMFB-A offers micro loans, SME loans and deposit taking solutions to micro entrepreneurs in Afghanistan’s urban and rural
areas and stands as the largest regulated microfinance lender in the country.

IFC’s involvement with FMFB-A commenced in 2002, with an original equity investment of $1.0 million for a stake of 16.7 percent. During 2012, IFC participated in the
Bank’s rights issue subscription (amounting to $ 6.8 million) on a prorate basis to the tune of $ 1.1 million. During this rights issue subscription, AKAM has brought
in its sister agency the Aga Khan Foundation-US (“AKF-US”) as shareholder in the Bank. As a result, the shareholding of the Bank is now changed, with AKAM holding a
39.2 percent stake, KfW at 32.3 percent, IFC at 16.7 percent & AKF-US holding a 11.8 percent share in the Bank.
 (i) To create the first commercially sustainable micro-finance institution in Afghanistan contributing to the development of micro-finance as a viable and attractive
commercial activity, and providing financial services to the poor and underserved.
(ii) To contribute to the reconstruction and economic development of Afghanistan by providing financing to the most dynamic sector of the fledgling economy - micro
and small businesses.
(iii) To develop the financial sector by providing basic financial services currently not available in the market. The project is expected to contribute to overall financial
sector reform by giving an example of a best-practice institution and supporting the Interim Authority in developing the evolving legal and regulatory framework.

KEY RESULTS EXPECTED:
FMFB-A has had a big impact on development as the leading microfinance bank in Afghanistan. The Bank is known for its solid financial performance and improving
profitability backed by a growing loan book & sound asset quality despite operating in a tough macroeconomic and fragile security environment. It has developed and
implemented an E&S system which allows it to screen its portfolio and provide lending on a social and environmentally responsible basis.

■■     Net Loan Portfolio - $ 60.8 million
