THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW

environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in p ractice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.

       The founder swears before a Commissioner for Oaths

       A company founder (director, secretary, or solicitor) must attest on the
       statutory incorporation form that the company has complied with the
       relevant provisions of the Irish Companies Acts. The founder swears
       before a commissioner for oaths or a practicing solicitor. Moreover, the    1 day             EUR 10

       File necessary materials with the Companies Registration Office
       (CRO)

       A founder may register a company at the Companies Registration Office
       (CRO) by three methods:
       1. The CORE registration system, in which the papers for incorporation                    EUR 50 for with
       are lodged in print and electronic form. Under this scheme, the                             pre-approved
       memorandum and articles of association must be submitted in CRO•                         memorandum and

       2. A “Fe Phrainn” system, in which (as detailed in the first method) the
       incorporation documents are submitted to the CRO in a preapproved
       format. Under this method, however, documents are submitted in print
       form only, and the CRO incorporates the company within 10 working
       days.
       3. An alternate system in which the incorporation documents are

                                                                                     Time to

                                                                                    complete
      submitted to the CRO in print form, but the memorandum and articles
      of association are not in a preapproved format. In this instance, the
      CRO incorporates the company in 2–4 weeks.

      To access the first two systems, to the company founder must apply to
      the CRO for an access number and have the memorandum and articles
      of association approved in advance. Usually only professional agencies
      use the expedited systems.

      Necessary documents for limited companies:
      • Memorandum and articles of association.
      • List of directors, secretary, and subscribers.
      • Statement of nominal (authorized) and issued share capital and
      consideration paid.
      • Notice of registered office.
      • Statement of the main business activities and the address where they
      will be carried out, contained in a statutory notice sent to the CRO.

      Forms can be downloaded from the CRO Web site. For all methods, a
      CRO Form A1 must be submitted with details of the company name, the
      first election of directors and secretary, and the subscribers to the
      memorandum and articles of association; the authorized and issued
      share capital; and the registered office and the details of the location in
      the state where the central administration and the main company
      activities are proposed to be undertaken. The memorandum and
      articles of association, signed by the subscriber shareholders, will also
      be submitted to the CRO.

      As of April 2006 professional incorporators do not have to reregister
      the preapproved memorandum and articles of association - When using
      the CORE system only those pages that are company specific of the
      pre-approved memorandum and articles of association need be
      submitted with an application to incorporate a company. The Company
      Law Enforcement Act 2001 had already made provisions for the
      registration of a pro forma or model memorandum and articles of
      association. Pursuant to the new provisions, these documents, once
      registered, may be referenced and need not be filed with every new
      incorporation.

      Since September, 2009, it is possible to reserve the proposed company
      name in advance of submitting the incorporation papers. The
      advantage of this is that it avoids the rejection of the proposed name
      by the Companies Registration Office either because it has already been
      taken or because it is inappropriate for some other reason (such as
      public policy). There is a fee charged of EUR 25 but this fee is then
      taken off the incorporation fee meaning that there is in effect no cost.

      A registration fee of EUR 100 is charged for each model memorandum
      and articles of association registered with the Office. However, the use
      of the model company incorporation documents, using the CRO disk
      system, will result in a reduced incorporation fee of EUR 50. The
      company registration fee for procedures other than the new ones is
      EUR 100.

      location or the characteristics of the environmental impacts from the
      development, that the development is likely to have a significant effect
      on the environment.

      If the local planning authority considers that the development is likely
      to have a significant effect on a site protected under the Habitats or
      Birds Directives (or sites proposed for protection under the Habitats or
      Birds Directives), it may also be necessary to submit an 'appropriate
      assessment' of the predicted impacts of the proposed development on
      the relevant protected site(s).

      According to Development Contribution Scheme 2013 - 2015 (under
      Section 48, Planning & Development Act, 2000 as amended), BuildCo is
      required to pay a general contribution fee in respect of general public
      infrastructure and facilities benefiting development in the area of the
      planning authority.

      The time specified by law (55 days) represents the minimum statutory
      time period within which the planning authority may, at first instance,
      make a decision on the planning application. This time period may be,
      and in most cases is, exceeded by the relevant local planning authority
      requesting further information from the applicant. A valid request for
      further information has the effect of stopping time running against the
      planning authority.

      However, in practice it takes around 90 days in practice, on the basis
      that a request for further information is made by the planning
      authority. This period does not include the time for appeal of the
      decision made by the local planning authority at first instance. An
      appeal against the decision made by the local planning authority may
      be made to the planning appeals board (An Bord Pleanála) within 4
      weeks of the date of the decision of the local planning authority. The
      appeal process, which may include an oral hearing, may delay the
      commencement of construction between 4-8 months or even more.

      Pursuant to Regulation 6 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work
      Regulations, 2006, BuildCo must appoint in writing for every project:
      • A competent project supervisor for the design process
      • A competent project supervisor for the construction stage

      Pursuant to Regulation 10 of the Regulations, BuildCo has a duty to
      give notice in writing to the Health and Safety Authority in their
      approved forms (Forms AF1 & AF2) of these appointments. The forms
      are to be sent by registered post to the Health and Safety Authority,
      Metropolitan Building. BuildCo must receive written confirmation of
      acceptance of the appointments.

      Provision of these forms is required under the relevant health and
      safety legislation, and is therefore a procedure that must be complied
      with.

      * Request and obtain fire safety certificate

      A fire safety certificate is required before a building may be lawfully
      occupied. In order to ensure that the design and construction is in
      accordance with the relevant statutory fire safety requirements, an
      application for the fire safety certificate should be made prior to
      construction or, at a minimum, 90 days prior to completion, to prevent
      any delay in the occupation of the building.

      The application must be accompanied by a fire safety report, drawings
      and specifications and the relevant fee. A revised fire safety certificate
      may be required where planning permission is granted for a revised
      design or where a significant revision is made to the design for which a
      fire safety certificate has been granted.

      It is important that the full application fee accompany the application
      for a fire safety certificate, as the application may otherwise be deemed
      invalid and returned by the local authority.

      Builders have the option to commence development without waiting               78 days       EUR 3,772

      until a Fire Safety Certificate is issued, according to the 7 Day Notice I.
      351 of 2009 Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2009).

      Once a firm submits a valid application for a fire safety certificate, it
      may submit a 7-day notice to the local planning authority and sign a
      statutory declaration that Part B (Fire Safety) requirements will be
      complied with. Once this is carried out and upon expiration of the 7-
      day period, the developer can commence development without waiting
      for the fire safety certificate to be issued.

      However, the 7-day notice can only be submitted where a valid
      application for a fire safety certificate is made. A fire safety certificate
      will still have to be issued for the development. The time period for the
      issuance of a fire safety certificate remains (up to) 78 days.

      * Request and obtain a disability access certificate

      Since January 2010, all buildings have to obtain a disability access
      certificate. An architect or other professional prepares the access
      certificate application to confirm that the design of the building meets
      the recommendations of Part M of the Building Control Regulations.
      The Building Control Authority (Local Authority) reviews the application
      and proceeds to issue the certificate if it is in order.                       60 days       EUR 800
5
      To avoid potentially expensive remedial work, it would be considered
      good practice to apply for the certificate at the same time as the fire
      safety certificate, thereby ensuring that the certificate and any
      conditions pertaining to it are known prior to the commencement of
      works.

      A building may not be operated or occupied unless such a certificate

      Submit seven-day notice prior to beginning construction

      According to The Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 (the
      Regulations), which came into effect on 1 March 2014, a
      commencement notice or seven-day notice must be submitted to the
      building control authority. A 7 day notice is similar to a
      Commencement Notice and may be used for works, which require a
      Fire Safety Certificate, when the works need to start before the
      Certificate is granted. Any Commencement Notice/7-day notice
      submitted after the 1st March 2014, which come within the scope of S.I.

        The client applies for electricity connection and awaits estimate of
        connection fees from Electricity Supply Board (ESB) Networks

        The client needs to first obtain an Ordnance Survey map (scale 1:2500-
        1:10560) that shows the location of their new premises, and a detailed
        site plan (scale 1:100-1:500) showing the new premises. Both of the
        above should be already available. Photocopies are acceptable.

        The customer completes an ESBN Application Form (NC3) available on
        utility's Website and submits this to ESB Networks with load details and
        an Ordance Survey Map as detailed above.

        * The client obtains external inspection from Electricity Supply
        Board (ESB) Networks

        After the completed application has been received, the client’s business
        and site details will be set up on ESB’s system. The client then receives an
        acknowledgement with a reference number.

        agreement includes:
        • The Meter Point Reference Number (MPRN) for the client’s new
        premises. This is a unique reference number that identifies the client’s
        connection point to the electricity network.

      The customer mails their payment and connection agreement to ESB
      Networks Services Bureau. Check, postal order, and bank drafts, but no
      cash, are acceptable.
      Once these have been received and the client has signed a Connection
      Agreement with the utility, ESB Networks can commence construction
      work on the electricity infrastructure required for the premises.
      ESB Networks will also need to apply for a Road Opening License at the

      * The electrician in charge of the internal wiring sends an Electrical
      Completion Certificate to regulatory body

      While the customer is awaiting their Connection Agreement, the certified
      electrician must also send an Electro Technical Council of Ireland (ETCI)
      wiring certificate to their regulatory body quoting the client’s Meter
      Point Reference Number and address.
      In fact, every time an electrical contractor completes a new electrical
      installation, extension, or modification to an existing installation, he/she
      is obliged to test and certify that the installation complies with current
      standards. These standards are set by the Electro Technical Council of
4     Ireland.                                                                       1 calendar day        EUR 0
      The registered electrical contractor who is certifying the electrical wiring
      must send the Electro Technical Council of Ireland wiring certificate to
      his/her regulatory body quoting the client’s Meter Point Reference
      Number and address before connection can be made live. Every client
      should receive a copy of an Electrical Completion Certificate whenever
      electrical work is completed.
      In situations where an “Electro Technical Council of Ireland” Electrical
      Completion Certificate is required, ESB Networks must obtain
      electronically a validated Electrical Completion Certificate from the
      electrical contractor's regulatory body before connecting the electrical
      installation to the network.

        The electrical contractor is normally member of one of the following
        regulating bodies: Electrical Contractors Safety & Standards Association
        Ltd (ECSSA) and Register of Electrical Contractors of Ireland (RECI).
        Among the situations where an Electro Technical Council of Ireland
        certificate is required are:
        • Building any new house or premises
        • Building an extension to an existing house or premises
        • Altering the internal electrical wiring in any existing house or premises
        • Reconnecting a house or premises (if vacant for more than 6 months)
        • Connecting electric fences and other installations



        Agency: Regulatory Body



        The client registers with an electricity supplier and obtains meter
        installation and final connection from Electricity Supply Board (ESB)
        Networks

        If the customer’s Maximum Import Capacity is less than 30 kVA, they can
        contact the Supplier of their choice or they may contact ESB Networks to
        request that their connection be made live.
        If the customer’s Maximum Import Capacity is greater than or equal to
        30kVA, the client must register with an electricity supplier of their choice.
        The client will need the following information when contacting a
        supplier:
        • Meter Point Reference Number
        • The address of the new premises                                             7 calendar days      EUR 7,600
   5
        • Name and contact details
        The supplier will pass on the information to ESB Networks.
        The client is assumed to obtain their electricity from ESB Independent
        Energy (ESBIE) that is part of ESB Group.
        Once the external works are done and ESB Networks has received both
        the signed Connection Agreement and confirmation that a valid Electro
        Technical Council of Ireland wiring certificate has been issued for the
        client’s premises, connection can be energized.

      Lodgment of application for registration at the Land Registry

      Once the title deed to the purchaser has been stamped it can be
      registered at the Land Registry using Form 17. A facility to make an
      application for registration electronically via the PRAI's Electronic Acces
      System is available, while the supporting documentation is sent by post
      (mailing usually takes 2 days). Ongoing computerization has contributed
      to increase the efficiency at land registry. Supporting documentation will
      include the sales agreement and a receipt of the payment of the
      applicable fees.

      cost will be EUR 130. This is currently the case for most properties in      1 day by post + 9

      be EUR 800, according to the fee schedule detailed below.

      Registration will take 10 days. After registration, it is common to check
      on the registration via the EAS with the request of certified copies of the
      folio and title map, which should show the change in ownership. This
      online check will cost €2.50 + €25 for the certified copy and will be
      delivered in 1-2 days.

      The breakdown of the applicable registration fees for transfers of titles
      that were already registered at the Land Registry is as follows:

Economies in all regions have improved contract                   reducing backlogs by introducing periodic reviews to
