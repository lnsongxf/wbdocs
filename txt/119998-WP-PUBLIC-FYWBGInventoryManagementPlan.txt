                                                INTRODUCTION

This Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory Management Plan (IMP) provides a detailed foundation for the
World Bank Group’s (WBG) comprehensive effort to measure and manage greenhouse gas emissions from
its internal global business operations. The IMP does not apply to the lending or technical assistance activities
that the World Bank Group provides to its public and private sector clients. This document provides
organization-wide information, including corporate overview and goals, boundary conditions of the
inventory, emissions quantification methods, data management methods, base year selection discussion, list of
management tools, and auditing and verification processes.
The World Bank Group consists of five closely associated institutions located in over 180 countries and
owned by member countries that carry ultimate decision-making power. Each institution plays a distinct role
in the mission to fight poverty and improve living standards for people in the developing world.

The IMP sets forth the current scope and vision of WBG’s commitment to inventory and manage greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions for its internal global business operations and contains the WBG’s greenhouse gas
inventory methodology. It sets forth the WBG’s intention to create a GHG inventory that is consistent with the
principles and guidance of the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for
Sustainable Development’s (WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative ( GHG Protocol) for its internal
corporate greenhouse gas accounting and reporting. The inventory methodology is designed to meet the
most rigorous and complete accounting and reporting standards.

In 2007 the World Bank (WB) joined the EPA Climate Leaders Program and set a voluntary target for
reducing its Scope 1 and 2 emissions. This IMP includes information that applies to the offices located in the
United States and complies by the World Bank’s previous participation in the U.S. EPA’s Climate Leaders
Program. The U.S. EPA Climate Leaders program was phased out as of 9/15/2010 and the WB is no
longer required to report annual emissions information to the EPA. However, the WB will continue to abide
by EPA guidance for GHG inventories, and is researching other alternatives for reporting and goal setting,
including its current participation in CDP and the UN Climate Neutral Initiative. The global facilities inventory
is maintained on a fiscal year basis only. Both domestic and international emissions are calculated using the
same methodology to ensure consistency in the quantification process among all locations.

DEFINITION OF SCOPE IN GHG PROTOCOL

The World Bank Group segregates its emissions types by Scopes 1, 2, and 3, as defined by the GHG
Protocol. The following are examples of office emissions sources from the GHG Protocol publication
Working 9 to 5 on Climate Change: An Office Guide (WRI 2002).

                               Combustion of fuel in boilers or furnaces that are owned by the reporting organization
                               Generation of electricity, steam, or heat in equipment that is owned by the reporting
                                organization
 Scope 1: Direct               Business travel in vehicles that are owned by the reporting organization, such as company
 emissions sources              cars or corporate jets
                               Employee commuting in company-owned vehicles, such as shuttles and company cars
                               Fugitive emissions of refrigerant from chillers or other refrigeration units owned by the
                                reporting organization
 Scope 2: Indirect
                               Generation of purchased electricity, steam, heat, or chilled water
 emissions sources

 Scope 3: Optional             Business travel in non-company-owned vehicles such as rental cars, employee cars, trains,
 sources                        and commercial planes




                                                                                                     3|Page

                                        WBG BOUNDARY CONDITIONS

Boundary conditions serve as the foundation for the GHG inventory by defining both the inventory’s breadth
and depth. To provide a rigorous and complete GHG inventory, the WBG has defined both organizational
and operational boundary conditions consistent with the GHG Protocol guidance.

ORGANIZATIONAL BOUNDARY

Organization boundary conditions define the breadth of the GHG inventory by identifying the locations
where the WBG assumes responsibility for GHG emissions. According to the GHG Protocol, a company’s
organizational boundaries can either be defined by the amount of equity a company has in an operation
(“Equity Approach”) or based on a company’s operational control over a location or facility (“Control
Approach”). The GHG Protocol also requires that a company select the type of organizational boundary
according to which method most accurately reflects the day-to-day practices of the business. That boundary
approach should then be consistently applied to define the company’s bu siness and operations in a way that
best constitutes the business’s operations for the purpose of GHG emissions accounting and reporting.
The WBG has chosen to set its organizational boundaries for the GHG inventory according to the
operational control approach. Consistent with this approach the WBG accounts for GHG emissions from its
locations for which it has direct control over operations, and where it can influence decisions that impact
GHG emissions. This includes all owned and leased facilities/vehicles operated by WBG. A portion of
leased facilities operate under full-service gross leases, where the building owner/manager pays the utilities
directly and WBG does not have access to actual energy consumption information. WBG includes these
facilities in its definition of operational control and estimates the energy consumption as well as refrigerant
use if this data is unavailable as described in the Data Management section below.
WB locations have been identified by the General Services Department Corporate Real Estate office
(GSDCR), while IFC locations are from the IFC Real Estate Database managed by the IFC’s Facilities
Management team. A list of offices included the FY 14 GHG inventory can be found in Appendix F.

OPERATIONAL BOUNDARY AND SCOPE

    Since 2008, the operational boundary of the WBG’s carbon inventory has included all core direct
    (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2) emissions associated with all global WBG facilities with operational
    control (including headquarters operations in Washington, DC, all leased facilities, and all country
    offices). Emissions from global employee business air travel are included in Scope 3. Prior to 2008, our
    scope was limited to headquarters operations in Washington DC only, including Washington, DC and
    Virginia leased facilities and facilities with operational control, and only DC-based employee travel.

       Direct Emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the WBG, including emissions from
        on-site fuel burning equipment (for example, boilers, backup generators) and fugitive emissions
        from process equipment (for example, refrigerant from refrigeration and HVAC equipment).
        Mobile emissions from combustion of fuel in WBG-owned vehicles are also included.
       Indirect Emissions from electricity, steam and chilled water purchased by the WBG.
       Other Indirect Emissions from WBG employee business air travel and leased vehicles operated
        by other organizations.


GHG LIST

The WBG greenhouse gas inventory includes emissions from five of the six major GHG gases (there are no
known emissions from SF6):
      CO2
      CH4
      N2O
      HFCs
      PFCs
In addition, the global inventory includes emissions from CFCs and HCFCs as supplemental emissions, both of
which are optional for inventory and reporting purposes according to GHG Protocol and EPA Climate
Leaders guidance.

WBG BOUNDARY CONDITION ASSUMPTIONS

To the extent possible, this IMP attempts to standardize our inventory methodology to all WBG offices.
There are, however, a few exceptions. Our boundary assumptions are outlined as follows:
        Assumptions: Global Inventory
       Where there is shared World Bank and IFC office space, emissions are apportioned between the
        agencies by percentage of total area as detailed in lease agreements and memoranda of
        understanding, where available. When this information is not available, emissions are apportioned
        by percentage of area which is based on the percentage of total staff for each agency. For
        example, in a location where the proportion of IFC to WB space is not known, if there are an equal
        number of staff from each agency, then it is assumed that each agency occupies an equal amount
        of space in the office.
       In FY 16, data related to electricity use, stationary combustion, and refrigerant recharge amounts
        were collected at a WBG collocated office level where appropriate. This data was then
        apportioned to each agency as described above.
       Data for WB and IFC GHG inventories are collected and compiled separately using the same
        methodology and aggregated within the same WBG inventory document. A web-based database
        is used to centralize and manage the data collection and reporting process.
       For business travel, only employee air travel and travel by contracted car service data is collected
        and included because the majority of WBG business travel impacts are associated with plane
        travel.
       If a WBG office houses five or fewer employees, it is assumed that activity data is difficult to
        obtain, and that the contribution of emissions is relatively insignificant. While every office is
        provided an opportunity to report activity data where possible, WBG’s online data management

                                                                                                6|Page
                      The World Bank Group FY16 GHG Inventory Management Plan

         system allows the data provider from an office with five or fewer employees the option to (a)
         default to estimated emissions for electricity use and refrigerants (methodology for estimations are
         provided in relevant sections below in this IMP), and (b) to exempt the office from reporting on-site
         fuel and mobile sources if the information is not easily accessible (estimates are not made for on-
         site fuel and mobiles sources given there is no credible methodology to do so).
        In FY2007, employee number estimates were based on numbers for staff and extended-term
         consultants and extended-term temporaries as of the close of the fiscal year (June 30) provided by
         the Human Resources Analytics Department (HRSAN). In FY2008 the WBG requested that country
         offices provide data on all employees located in their offices, detailing the number of contractors,
         consultants, and staff working from the office as of the close of the fiscal year (June 30). In FY2009
         and going forward, the WBG reverted back to numbers for staff and extended-term consultants
         and temporaries as of the close of the fiscal year (June 30) provided by HRSAN and IFCHR in an
         effort to standardize measurement.
        In the absence of a complete country office database, office area data for World Bank offices is
         entered by data owners in each of the offices and confirmed with CO Real Estate Tracking
         database where possible. For IFC offices, office area is extracted from the country office real
         estate database and uploaded into the CR360 system. Any discrepancies may then be identified
         by data owners in each office.
        Homes owned by the World Bank Group in developing countries are not included in the inventory
         because the WBG does not control the operations of these buildings and activity data is difficult to
         obtain.
         Exceptions
        The IFC and WB share archive, business continuity center, and warehouse space leased by the
         World Bank. Since the World Bank manages the lease, the WB reports 100 percent of these
         emissions, including the Chantilly Facility (CF; located in Chantilly, VA), the Archives (located near
         Pittsburgh, PA), the Landover Service Center (LSC; located in Landover, MD) and the Warehouse
         (located in Sterling, VA).
        Emissions are estimated for buildings in Washington, DC where the WBG lacks operational control.
         To estimate emissions, assumptions about electricity usage are made based on area. Refrigerant
         emissions are estimated based on the technique described below. Due to lack of access to
         information, estimates are not made for on-site fuel consumption.
        There are mail vans in Washington, DC leased by the WB and used by both WB and IFC
         employees. The WB accounts for 100 percent of these emissions because they control the van
         leases and employ the van drivers. Because the IFC does not own any vehicles in Washington, DC,
         no emissions associated with vehicle refrigerant are reported.



                                         EMISSIONS QUANTIFICATION

The following sections explain the GHG emissions quantification approach for each of the WBG’s emissions
sources contained within the boundaries of the fiscal year 2015 (FY15) GHG inventory.
All methodologies are based on guidance from the GHG Protocol with emission factors taken from
governmental and international organizations such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the International Energy Agency (IEA). All sources
are noted in the appendices.
Emissions for both country offices and Washington, DC are calculated using similar equations. An annual
survey is conducted to collect activity data from WBG locations in the Master Location List (Appendix F).
Beginning in FY2009, this survey was conducted through a Web-based data management system called
Credit360, found online at http://worldbank.credit360.com. See Appendix G for screenshots from the FY13
survey.
When activity data is unavailable, emissions estimates are made for electricity, refrigerants, and air travel
based on office area or number of employees. Data gaps and data quality issues still exist in the WBG’s
inventory that will be addressed along with data quality issues as additional and more accurate data

                                                                                                    7|Page

offices. For a summary of FY16 emissions, please see the attached report.

SCOPE 1 – DIRECT EMISSIONS


                               ON-SITE (STATIONARY) COMBUSTION – SCOPE 1

         Quantifying Emissions from On-site (Stationary) Combustion
On-site combustion of fossil fuels for the generation of electricity, heat, or steam is one source of direct
emissions. To calculate the GHG emissions from on-site fuel combustion, the WBG collects the annual quantity
of fuel purchased. To be conservative, the WBG assumes that all fuel purchased is also combusted in on-site
operations in that same year. An appropriate emissions factor for each fuel type used is applied. Fuels used
at WBG locations include diesel, gasoline, natural gas, propane, LPG, and kerosene.
Emissions are determined for each fuel source by multiplying the total annual fuel quantity expressed in units
of energy purchased by the appropriate emissions factors for CO2, CH4, and N2O. If fuel quantity
purchased is reported in volume or mass, this quantity is converted to units of energy based on the fuel’s
heat content. Heat contents for specific fuels are listed in Appendix A. Totals for CH4 and N2O are
multiplied by their global warming potentials (GWPs) to calculate CO2 equivalent emissions. See Appendix
A for a table detailing stationary fuel emissions factors. CO2 and CO2 equivalent emissions for all fuels
combusted are summed to obtain the total CO2 equivalent (CO2eq) emissions for the year. Figure 1 shows
the calculation used when data is provided.

Occasionally, WBG offices are able to provide activity data on total fuel use for their buildings but not for
WBG occupied space. In this case, if both the total building area is known as well as the WBG occupied
area, the total fuel use is prorated for WBG occupied space and then multiplied by the appropriate
emissions factors (Figure 2) to obtain the total CO2 equivalent emissions for the year.

There is no credible methodology to estimate emissions for missing on-site fuel data. WBG’s online data
management system allows the data provider from an office with five or fewer employees the option to
exempt himself/herself from reporting on-site fuel if the information is not easily accessible. The WBG
anticipates this data gap will improve in years to come as data providers gain more experience in
gathering the data.
If an office has provided reliable fuel data in previous years but did not provide a response to the call for
data this year, fuel use from the previous year is used as a proxy for this year’s fuel use.



                                          REFRIGERANTS – SCOPE 1

Refrigeration, freezer, and air-conditioning equipment leak refrigerants. GHGs from heating, ventilation, or
air conditioning (HVAC) operations, refrigeration, and freezer units are not intentionally released, but
escape into the atmosphere as fugitive emissions through varying means, including but not limited to
maintenance, installation, disposal, and operational leakage. Each refrigerant CO2 equivalent (CO2eq) is
calculated by multiplying the mass of refrigerant by its global warming potential (GWP).
Two methods to calculate GHG emissions of refrigerants are explained in the GHG Protocol. The first
(preferred) method requires the annual amount of each type of refrigerant purchased for each location
(quantity-purchased method). The second method, relating to capacity and leakage characteristics by
equipment type, requires the total capacity for refrigerants in each type of equipment used at a location,
the corresponding manufacturer’s leakage rate for each type of equipment, and the type of refrigerant
used in each type of equipment. Equipment types are distinguished by whether the equipment is a HVAC

unit, a freezer, or a refrigeration unit. Due to activity data available, only the first method is used for the
WBG inventory.
         Quantifying Emissions from Refrigerants
Refrigerant CO2 equivalents are calculated by multiplying the weight of escaped refrigerant by the
corresponding GWP. GWPs for refrigerants reported in the inventory are gathered from the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) or from sources referencing the IPCC. See Appendix B
for details on GWPs of refrigerants and sources. If the type of refrigerant is unknown (“other” is chosen in
the online survey), HFC-134a is assumed to be the refrigerant type. See Figure 3 for the preferred
calculation methodology, and Table 2 for the calculation method used in cases where refrigerant data are
not available.

In some cases, WBG country offices are able to provide the refrigerant recharge quantity for the entire
building but not for WBG occupied space. In this case, if both the total building area is known as well as the
WBG occupied area, the total refrigerant recharge amount is prorated for the WBG occupied space and
then multiplied by the appropriate refrigerant-specific global warming potential to obtain the total CO2eq
emissions for the year.
In the case where activity data (refrigerant purchases) is not available for use, emissions are estimated
based on the refrigerant emission rate (ton refrigerant emitted/ft2/year) based on the occupied WB/IFC
building area.
The method used to calculate the intensity rate is laid out in Table 2. In this method, the estimated area per
ton of cooling (1 ton of cooling per 500 ft2 is commonly used in the United States and will be used globally
for our purposes) is multiplied by a conversion factor of one ton of cooling per one kg of refrigerant charge
and then by an assumed leakage rate of 10 percent. The resulting kilogram of refrigerant per square foot
factor is multiplied by the square footage of the location that did not provide refrigeration data. This
calculation results in the estimated number of kilograms of refrigerant recharge used in the IFC/WB building
area.

The emissions rate used (0.0000002 ton refrigerant per ft 2-year) is then multiplied by the area of the
WB/IFC building area and then by the GWP of the refrigerant type specified. If the refrigerant type is
unknown, the WB/IFC conservatively assumes the refrigerant type to be HFC-R134a. This number is
converted to metric tons to calculate the total metric tons of CO2eq emitted.
Refrigerant data is often one of the hardest pieces of information for offices to collect. While every office is
provided an opportunity to report activity data where possible, WBG’s online data management system
allows the data provider from an office with five or fewer employees or from those offices that cannot
collect the required data the option to default to estimated emissions for refrigerants. Estimates are included
for completeness, but they represent a small portion of the WBG’s emissions source , because its operations
do not require a high intensity of refrigeration. The WBG anticipates this data gap will improve in years to
come as data providers gain more experience in gathering the data.
         Quantifying Refrigerant Emissions from Vehicles
Refrigerants utilized in vehicles for air conditioning are a minute part of the WBG’s GHG emissions from
internal business operations. The WBG includes data on refrigerants from vehicles used globally.
Where available, the number of vehicles, grouped by each vehicle type, is multiplied by the standard
refrigerant charge per unit as outlined by the EPA. For example, all passenger cars are assumed to use R-
134a and have a charge per unit of 0.8, thus 8 passenger cars will have a total charge of 6.4 kg of
refrigerant. The total charge is then multiplied by the standard operating loss factor (20 percent) to arrive
at the annual refrigerant loss in kg. The annual refrigerant lost is multiplied by the global warming potential
of that refrigerant (most A/Cs are R-134a) to obtain the total metric tons of CO2eq emitted. (Figure 4)

Mobile GHG emissions result from the combustion of fuel in an organization’s owned and leased vehicles. In
accordance with the “operational control approach” for organizational boundaries, the WBG reports data
for fleet vehicles that it owns and leases. All mobile emissions, regardless of location, are calculated using
the same methodology to ensure consistency in the quantification process.
         Quantifying Emissions from Mobile Sources
The majority of WBG offices report the quantity of fuel used from driver logs or invoices. Direct CO2
emissions from owned mobile combustion sources are calculated based on fuel purchase records, where
available. Many vehicles have fuel consumption logs to track their purchases.

All transport fuel emissions factors are listed in Appendix C. The preferred approach to calculate mobile
sources is to multiply the volume of fuel by the fuel-specific CO2 emissions factors to calculate the total CO2
emissions as shown in Figure 5.

         Methodology for Estimating Emissions from Mobile Sources
When no transport fuel data is provided, the WBG makes estimates based on distance driven and fuel
economy of the vehicle type (Figure 6). For the purposes of calculating emissions, gasoline is assumed to be
the fuel used when estimating emissions in this fashion for sedans and motorcycles, and diesel is assumed to
be the fuel used when estimating emissions in this fashion for SUVs, light trucks and heavy trucks.

If mileage and fuel economy are not available, data providers are provided an option to report total
amount spent on fuel over the fiscal year, and the cost of fuel (in US Dollars) per gallon or liter in the city
location on average over the fiscal year. Data providers are also asked to indicate the type of fuel
purchased. Emissions estimates are then made based on the total fuel costs and the average cost of fuel per
gallon or liter provided (Figure 7).

Not all offices report mobile fuel use. Some do not have any owned or leased vehicles. The WBG’s online
data management system allows the data provider from an office with five or fewer employees the option
to exempt himself/herself from reporting mobile fuel if the information is not easily accessible. In FY13,
there were a few cases where offices did not reply to the survey but had done so in previous years. In these
cases, data regarding fuel use in FY 13 was used as a proxy for FY 14 fuel use.

In the United States, the EPA provides vehicle-specific emissions factors that are used to derive CH4 and N2O
emissions from vehicles. To calculate these emissions, fuel usage quantity is multiplied by CH4 and N2O
emission factors for the respective vehicle type. The CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions are then added to
quantify CO2eq. Since collecting precise car models from all country offices is a difficult task, country office
emissions calculations use one set of CH4 and N2O factors for each fuel type (gasoline, diesel, and LPG).
These standards have been set in place until more accurate data is available.


SCOPE 2 – INDIRECT EMISSIONS


                                      ELECTRICITY PURCHASES – SCOPE 2

The second scope of emissions under the GHG Protocol is indirect emissions from purchased electricity. These
emissions are classified as indirect because the emissions do not occur at the facility, but rather at the plant
where the electricity or steam is generated from fuel. These emissions are a consequence of the activities of
the organization because although the organization does not own or control the sources, its actions require
the generation of electricity. Organizations report emissions from the generation of purchased electricity that
is used by equipment or operations controlled by them. For many organizations, purchased electricity
represents one of the largest sources of GHG emissions and is the area where the most opportunities for
reductions in GHG emissions exist.

Electricity activity data for each WB/IFC office is collected using one of three methods. The preference for
reporting the data is to use method one. If this data is not available, then method two is used, and as a last
resort, method three is employed.

    WBG methods for reporting electricity data:
    1. Where possible, annual metered electricity usage (kWh) is reported for WBG offices in which the
       data provider was able to obtain information from electricity invoices.
    2. For WBG offices without separate meters, data providers are asked to provide electricity invoice
       data for the entire building, total area of the entire building, and area of IFC/WB-occupied space
       in the building We prorate the annual electricity usage based on the portion of IFC/WB-occupied
       area in the entire building, and the electricity use invoiced for the entire building.
    3. For offices that do not provide any data, estimates are based on regional electricity intensity
       (kWh/ft2) established from actual data provided from Method 1. This method is explained below
       in more detail.


                                                                                                 13 | P a g e

         Quantifying Emissions from Electricity
GHG emissions from the generation of electricity include CO2, CH4, and N2O. GHG emissions are calculated
based on the amount of kWh purchased multiplied by the power plant emissions factor. WBG offices often
do not have enough information about the specific plants or power pools that provide them with power and
electricity. Therefore, for the WBG’s facilities, GHG emissions from electricity usage are calculated based
on the amount (kWh) of electricity purchased and then multiplied by the subregion, region, or country-
specific emissions factor for CO2, CH4, and N2O.

For electricity purchased in the United States, each year emissions factors are taken from the most recent
EPA eGRID to calculate GHG emissions. In accordance with EPA guidelines, previous years’ inventories are
not retroactively updated with the most recent emission factors. The emission factors used to calculate the FY
16 inventory come from eGRID 2016.

The WBG uses region or country-specific emissions factors from IEA or country-based analogs for all other
locations. All emissions factors are listed in Appendix D. Figure 9 shows the GHG emissions calculation for
WBG locations where energy use amounts are provided. For some countries, IEA country-specific emission
factors do not exist. In these cases, region average CO2/kWh emissions factor are used as found in the IEA
document “CO2-highlights.xls”. To calculate CH4 and N2O emissions factors, the ratio of CH4 and N2O to
CO2 emission factors is calculated, which is then multiplied by the CO2 emission factor for each respective
GHG. For example:

         Methodology for Estimating Electricity Use
For offices that are able to provide electricity consumption for the entire building but not for the IFC/WB-
occupied area, annual electricity consumption is prorated for the IFC/WB-occupied area. This is
accomplished by dividing the IFC/WB-occupied space by the size of the entire building and then multiplying
this figure by the annual electricity consumption of the facility.

While every office is provided an opportunity to report activity data where possible, the WBG’s online
data management system allows the data provider from an office with five or fewer employees the option
to default to estimated emissions for electricity use.

For WBG offices that are unable to provide electricity consumption data, an estimate of annual electricity
use is calculated based on an IFC/WB regional electricity intensity figure and the area of the office
occupied (Figure 10). The intensity figure is calculated for each IFC or WB region by adding the annual
electricity consumption for each country office that responded within that region and dividing the sum by the
sum of the area of each office to generate an electricity consumption per area (kWh/ft2) intensity figure.
This regional figure is then multiplied by the area of each non-responding country offices to calculate an
estimate of electricity consumption (kWh) for each country office. Tables 3 (WB) and 4 (IFC) show the
IFC/WB country offices that were used to calculate each regional average.

These numbers may change in the future as more comprehensive data is collected. In this instance, we would
recalculate previous years emissions for electricity based on the new electricity intensity averages. For now,
we will continue to use the FY 08 averages.

                            PURCHASED HEAT, STEAM, AND CHILLED WATER – SCOPE 2

Indirect emissions also include emissions from heat, steam, and chilled water purchased for use in WBG
offices. Although the number of offices that purchase heat, steam, or chilled water is small, in the effort of
completeness we have decided to include these purchases. At the WBG Washington, DC offices, heat,
steam, and chilled water are not purchased.

         Quantifying Emissions from Steam
Emissions from the purchase of steam are estimated based on the amount of steam purchased and an
assumed fuel type (natural gas) and boiler efficiency (80 percent) based on the EPA Climate Leaders
Guidance “Indirect Emissions from Purchases/Sales of Electricity and Steam.” Steam purchase can usually be
found on utility bills or other records. If steam purchased is communicated in mass instead of energy, the
mass should be converted to energy based on the heat content of steam (assumed to be 1200 Btu/lb). The
steam purchased (in units of energy) is divided by the boiler efficiency and then multiplied by emission
factor for each GHG for natural gas. Each GHG is multiplied by its GWP and added to calculate the CO 2
equivalent emissions from the purchase of steam (Figure 10).

         Quantifying Emissions from Chilled Water
Estimates for emissions from chilled water production are a small part of the overall World Bank Group
emissions inventory. In FY 16, only a few offices responded with information regarding their chilled water
purchases.

The activity data used to calculate emissions resulting from purchases of chilled water are ton-hours and the
electric grid country/regional factor. A default estimate is used in the calculation unless site-specific data is
available regarding the chilled water supplier. A chiller efficiency of 0.75 kW per ton of cooling is assumed
as the default, which was obtained from the 2006 Buildings Energy Data Book, 2003 stock efficiency for
centrifugal chillers. This chiller efficiency is multiplied by the reported ton-hours of cooling to produce an
estimate of the electricity used. The estimate of the electricity used in chilled water production is then
multiplied by the country-specific emissions factors for CO2, CH4 and N2O, as is described in the estimation
of electricity emissions, above.

SCOPE 3 – OTHER INDIRECT EMISSIONS


                                     BUSINESS TRAVEL EMISSIONS – SCOPE 3

Business air travel is representative of the WBG’s core business activities and a significant emissions source;
therefore, air travel is included as a voluntary Scope 3 emissions source in the inventory. Due to difficulty in
obtaining data for train and car rental, and the small proportion of associated emissions, these are
excluded from the inventory. This data may be included in future inventories.
         Quantifying Emissions from Air Travel
For the WBG’s global operations, air travel data includes air travel for all WBG employees with an
identification number (UPI)—this includes contractors, consultants, and full-time staff. This data comes from
entries into a statement of expense reporting system that must be completed by all employees who travel.
The main purpose of this system is for staff to report all personal expenses related to a mission trip, so the
system captures all legs of a trip including stop-overs using city codes (for example, WAS for Washington,
DC). Each leg of the trip has an origin city code and a destination city code (for example, a round trip
journey from Washington, DC to Nairobi, Kenya with a stopover in Paris would be WASPAR PARNBO,
NBOPAR, PARWAS). The first step to calculate distance traveled by air travel in a given fiscal year is
that all city pairs from every leg of every mission trip approved and completed by WBG employees are
extracted from the travel expense system along with other relevant data. To calculate flight distances
between these city pairs, the city pairs are first checked against a Ticketed Point Mileage (TPM) table that
contains exact distances for city code pairs and, if not found in this table, against a Maximum Permitted
Mileage (MPM). The MPM table reflects the distance limit between two specified international points within
which passengers can travel at the direct fare, provided that the sum of ticketed point mileage distance is
not exceeded. If the city pair is not found in either of these, the trip is flagged as having a distance of 100.

These unknown “100” distances are estimated in the following way:

        If the travel is within the same city, the trip is assumed to not be a flight and is not included in the
         calculation.
        If the travel is within the same country, the number of flight legs for that country is multiplied by the
         square root of the country area.
        If the travel is not within the same country, the average known distance per flight leg originating
         from the country is multiplied by the number of flight legs departing from that country.

Once a distance has been calculated for each trip, the air travel data is broken down by distance into three
categories for each leg (short haul, medium haul, and long haul). The definitions used are from the revised
“2010 Guidelines to Defra/DECC's GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting. Version 1.1 FINAL ””
(updated June 2010): a short-haul flight is less than 300 miles; a medium-haul flight is less than 2,300 miles;
and a long-haul flight is more than or equal to 2,300 miles. The emission factor for unknown flight distances
that have been estimated is calculated by taking the total kg of emissions from business air travel and
dividing it by the total number of passenger-miles for the World Bank Group.

To calculate air travel emissions for each flight category, the distance traveled and the appropriate GHG
emission factor is applied to obtain the emissions due to air travel (Figure 12). For a list of emissions factors,
see Appendix E.

         Note on Integration of the Radiative Forcing Index for Medium- and Long-haul Flights
Radiative forcing is the change in radiation received at the surface of the earth due to the emission of
greenhouse gases. High-flying aircraft spur radiative changes through three types of processes: direct
emission of radiatively active substances, such as CO2 and water vapor; emission of chemicals that produce
or destroy radiatively active substances, such as NOx; and emission of substances that generate aerosols or
lead to changes in natural clouds (for example, contrails). The radiative forcing index (RFI) is a measure of
the importance of these aircraft emissions on the atmosphere. The current, generally accepted, RFI factor is
2.7.

Neither the United Kingdom’s DEFRA, the ICAO, nor the United States’ EPA or WRI factor the RFI into air
travel emissions calculations despite the recommendation of the UNFCCC. Therefore, the WBG does not
currently integrate RFI into its GHG inventory for air travel. Both the WRI and the EPA are reviewing this
issue and may decide to integrate RFI into air travel emissions calculations. If international consensus is
reached on the appropriate application of RFI, the WBG will revisit this issue.

                                   CONTRACTOR-OWNED VEHICLES – SCOPE 3

Emissions from vehicles owned by contractors but used for World Bank Group business make up a small
proportion of WBG’s emissions, but are included as a voluntary Scope 3 emissions source in the inventory.
Emissions are calculated in the same manner as those for Scope 1 mobile emissions, however as the number
of vehicles is not usually available and the emissions from vehicle refrigerants is considered de minimus,
emissions from vehicle refrigerants are not calculated.

                                              MAJOR MEETINGS

The World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) host two major meetings each year to
discuss a range of issues related to poverty reduction, international economic development, and finance.
Annually, about 10,000 people attend the meetings, including on average 3,500 members of delegations
from the member countries of the Bank and the IMF, roughly 1,000 representatives of the media, and more
than 5,000 visitors and special guests drawn primarily from private business, the banking community and
NGOs.

Because these meetings are a key aspect of the way the WBG does business, they are included in Scope 3
emissions reporting. The delegates attending the meeting, while not WBG staff, are travelling to the meeting
site, staying in hotels, and using taxis to navigate around town because of the meetings, and therefore the
related emissions are considered to be under our operational control.

Key emissions from these meeting include air travel emissions, electricity emissions from hotel stays and
mobile combustion emissions from within city transportation. Additionally, if the meeting is hosted at a non-
Bank owned facility, emissions from the venue are also calculated.
         Estimating Business Travel Emissions from Meetings
To estimate emissions from business travel related to major meetings, a list of delegate attendees is
obtained from a Conferences Officer from the Joint Secretariat for the Bank/Fund Conferences. Because the
meetings are hosted by both the WBG and IMF, the greenhouse gases assigned to delegates are divided
up so that the IMF assumes responsibility for all delegates coming from IMFC countries (see Appendix H). The
remaining countries are assumed to be representing WBG Member Countries. To estimate the air travel
emissions associated with their flights to Washington, DC, it is assumed that each delegate is flying round

                                                                                                 20 | P a g e
                       The World Bank Group FY16 GHG Inventory Management Plan

trip from the capital city airport to Washington Dulles (IAD) International Airport. Flight distances are
estimated using an online calculator (http://www.airrouting.com/content/TimeDistanceForm.aspx) and
multiplied by 2 to represent a round-trip flight. Each flight leg is then grouped into the appropriate short,
medium or long haul threshold (see the section on Business Travel Emissions, above), multiplied by the
appropriate emission factor, and summed to calculate air travel emissions for each meeting.
         Estimating Emissions from Hotel Stay for Meeting Delegates
The next largest source of emissions from major meetings is the electricity associated with the hotel stay from
each delegate. To estimate emissions associated with these stays, it is assumed that each delegate stays in a
hotel room by themselves for four nights (the meetings span 3 days and two nights). An average energy
consumption of 69.5 kWh/room/night is assumed, (personal communication with Manager – Social
Responsibility and Community Engagement for Marriott International). This total electricity consumption for
the stay is then multiplied by the appropriate electricity emissions factor for the location where the meeting
is hosted (in most cases this will be the emission factor for the RFC East subregion in the United States). These
emissions are then summed to calculate total hotel-room related emissions for the meeting.
         Estimating Emissions from Delegate Travel from Airport to Meeting Venue
The other source of emissions related to these major meetings is from delegate travel from the airport to the
meeting venue. A conservative assumption is made that most meeting delegates will travel by themselves
using taxis or other car services. For meetings hosted in Washington, DC, the distance is assumed to be 42
km, which is the distance by road from Dulles International Airport and the World Bank’s Main Complex
building. This distance is multiplied by the number of attendees and by two to represent a round trip
voyage. It is then converted to miles and multiplied by the appropriate emission factor for grams of CO2-e
per passenger-mile (Appendix C), which are then summed to calculate total delegate travel from the airport
to the meeting venue.
         Estimating Emissions from Meeting Venue
Emissions from the meeting venue are another source of emissions related to organizing and holding a major
meeting. Every Spring Meeting and two out of every three Annual Meetings are hosted at the World Bank
and IMF premises and therefore the energy use from the meeting venue is already captured as outlined in
this IMP. If a meeting is held in an external venue, the preferred methodology for estimating emissions from
the energy consumed by the venue is to prorate the total annual energy use of the venue by the number of
days the venue is used for the meeting. For example, if a large convention center in Tokyo has an electricity
consumption of 50,000 MWh per year, and the Annual Meetings are hosted at this facility for 3 days, then
50,000 MWh is divided by 365 days and multiplied by 3 days to calculate the electricity consumption for
the meeting. This electricity consumption is then multiplied by the regional electricity emissions factor to
calculate the emissions related to the meeting venue.

ACTIVITY DATA AND DATA MANAGEMENT

         WBG Data Collection
The WBG continued to centralize GHG emissions data collection and management in FY16 by using a Web-
based inventory management database called Cr360. The online system, accessible to registered data
owners via http://worldbank.cr360.com, allows users to input activity data via a simple online survey that
collects information on energy use, refrigerant purchases, and business travel. Data is also collected on
recycling habits, volunteer hours, water use, financial donations, and energy efficiency initiatives.

Data owners in country offices are typically resource management staff or designated “champions” who
work with the appropriate staff to collect the necessary information. A notification is sent to data owners in
the first quarter of each fiscal year alerting them that annual Carbon Footprint Survey is available. The
system is secure and requires data providers (“Users”) to log in with a username and password. This method
also provides an audit trail, so it is clear which staff member is entering the data. Upon log-in, users are

                      The World Bank Group FY16 GHG Inventory Management Plan

provided links to each office that they have been assigned, and answer questions in the form of an online
survey.

As previously mentioned, offices with five or fewer employees are provided an option to (a) default to
estimated emissions for electricity use and refrigerants, and (b) to exempt the office from reporting on-site
fuel and mobile sources. These options are provided assuming the difficulty in obtaining this data, probable
inaccuracy, and the insignificant percentage it represents of the WBGs’ overall carbon inventory.

In a few cases, offices have more than 5 employees but do not respond to the survey, either due to lack of
staffing, neglect or other reasons. In these cases, the Sustainability Coordinator in charge of the WBG GHG
inventory responds to the survey for the office, entering required information on office size, but triggering
the estimates for when no data is entered for electricity and refrigerant use by picking “Exempt-Less than 5
employees” so that the Credit360 system is prompted to use the estimates detailed in the sections above.
This was required for 28 WB offices and 15 IFC offices in FY 16.

To collect GHG emissions at WBG facilities in Washington, DC, engineers, building managers, real estate
experts, travel management officers, and HR analytics officers identified in the “Management Tools” section
are asked to submit their respective data sets for the fiscal year.
         Data Sources
Scope 1 direct emissions data from on-site fuel use typically comes from fuel-purchase receipts or records
maintained by facility managers of owned buildings and from building managers or landlords for leased
buildings.

Scope 1 emissions data for mobile sources typically come from fuel-purchase receipts. Where fuel purchase
data is not available, typically driver log information on fuel purchases or mileage is used.

Scope 1 emissions data from fugitive refrigerant emissions come from service records from the landlord or
facility manager and are submitted to WBG data owners on an as-needed basis.

Scope 2 emissions from electricity usage typically come from landlords for leased buildings and from
monthly electric utility bills for owned buildings.

Scope 3 optional emissions data for business travel initiated from Washington, DC is reported through the
WBG’s Travel Office, which uses a travel management contractor, currently American Express. American
Express creates itineraries for each traveler’s trip and data is recorded in SAP through a Statement of
Expense system. Itineraries for global employees must also be recorded in the statement of expense system
for travel to be approved and authorized. This data is combined and summarized and reported at all
organizational levels, from vice presidential units (VPUs) down to the individual traveler.

         Headquarters Specific: USA
Scope 1 emissions data from fugitive refrigerant emissions come from service records from the facility
contractor, Donohoe, submitted to WBG engineers on an as-needed basis.

At the WB, the CR team coordinates the assignment of roles and responsibilities for GHG inventory data
management, collects relevant data from assigned staff, and then calculates the GHG inventory.

At the IFC, the Footprint Program Officer coordinates the assignment of roles and responsibilities for GHG
inventory data management, collects the relevant data from assigned staff, and then calculates the GHG
inventory.

Scope 1 emissions data for all tracked emission sources are given in Table 7.

QUALITY ASSURANCE

The WBG staff—the WB CR team and the IFC Footprint Program Officer—annually review the data
collection process during the inventory development process to improve accuracy and fill data gaps.

To provide a level of quality assurance with the country office activity data, all office surveys are reviewed
in detail and clarifying questions are sent to key contacts. When clarifying information is not received, data
is taken out of the inventory if it has a large potential for error and will skew inventory results. In these cases
an estimate is made when possible. In the new data management system, Cr360, this whole process of data
entry, returned data, omitted data, and accepted data is captured for auditing purposes.

Beginning with the FY 11 inventory, automated data validation was used in the data management system. If
data entered fell outside of pre-determined upper- and lower-bounds, an explanation was required by the
person entering the data with information on the percentage difference compared to the previous year. If
no explanation was given, the data survey could not be submitted to the approver. The thresholds for this
automated data validation can be found in Appendix I.

Additional steps are taken to ensure the highest level of data quality:

         To submit a survey, a data owner from a country office must have responded to all required
          questions.
         The Environmental Specialist for the World Bank reviews each response of the on-line survey once it
          has been submitted before it is merged into the main database. This staff member compares
          responses by looking at two things: 1) comparing the entry to the previous year’s response from the
          same office facility; 2) scanning for data points that may seem too high or too low for a particular
          activity data relative to the office size. If any clarifications or questions are required, the Env.
          Specialist uses the feedback modules available in Credit360 to query data points he may have a
          question about. The query is then sent to the data owner, who must address the query before re-
          submitting the data to the Env. Specialist for approval.
         Once the majority of data is submitted, the Env Specialist does a second level of quality assurance
          for electricity usage data since this is the second largest source of emissions (second to air travel).

                                                                                                    23 | P a g e
                       The World Bank Group FY16 GHG Inventory Management Plan

         The staff members exports data from Credit360 to calculate kWh usage per square meter for
         each office, and checks intensity figures for each office looking for any figures that are well above
         or below the average range for the region in which the office is located.
        If any are found, these data owners are contacted for supporting documentation and clarification.
         If the supporting documentation is not available or no real data can be found, the electricity
         consumption for the office is instead estimated based on the regional intensity figure.
        The electricity intensity report is then sent to the IFC Footprint Program Manager for further review
         to ensure all outlier figures have been identified and resolved.

DATA GAPS

Currently, data gaps exist for all emissions sources. The biggest gaps are for on-site fuel and refrigerant
leakage data from developing country offices; however, both of these represent a very small percentage of
the overall WBG GHG inventory (estimated less than 5 percent). Estimations are used to fill refrigerant
data gaps, and previous years data, where available is used to fill on-site fuel use gaps, as explained in
this IMP.

Prior to the use WBG’s Statement of Expense (SOE) system for global air travel data, air travel data had
the biggest data gaps. However, data from this new system now provides exact distances for the majority
of WBG staff air travel. The exception is for city pairs entered into the SOE system that are not matched up
on either the Ticketed Point Mileage (TPM) table or the Maximum Permitted Mileage (MPM) table, both of
which are used to calculate distances for each city pair. It is estimated that about 25% of air travel data
from the SOE statement falls under this data gap. Estimations are used to fill these gaps as explained in this
IMP.

If a major known data gap is revealed, such as the reporting of a large amount of stationary fuel
combustion for one fiscal year in an office but a lack of data in the next, the data gap will be filled by first
making every effort possible to determine the activity data, and if this is not available, using the previous
year’s data. However, if it is known that there has been a major ch ange in the size of the office, and actual
data is not available, the activity data will be estimated as detailed above.

         Washington, DC specific
At the WBG Headquarters in Washington, DC, the following actions are undertaken to prevent errors:

        GSDCR and CR will assess the list of WB management–controlled properties to ensure that the
         inventory includes all leased and owned facilities, as well as to confirm the area where possible.
         CHRFM and FP will assess the list of IFC management–controlled properties to ensure that the
         inventory includes all leased and owned facilities, as well as to confirm the area of all existing
         space.
        GSDCR and CR will inventory each WB management–controlled facility for stationary fuel sources,
         including generators, boilers, and chillers. CHRFM and the FP will inventory each IFC management–
         controlled facility for stationary fuel sources including generators, boilers, and chillers.
        GSDCR and CR will review all WB fuel records for the year to ensure that logs and invoices are
         consistent with reality. CHRFM and the FP will review all IFC fuel records for the year to ensure that
         logs and invoices are consistent with reality.
        GSDCR and CHRFM will review utility bills provided by the utility company to ensure that the
         patterns are consistent with use. Upon changes to the bills, GSDCR will notify CR, and CHRFM will
         notify the FP, to update the inventory.
        All “owners” of WBG vehicles will be responsible for their own fuel logs and reporting. This includes
         GSDCR, GSDSO, and GSDMS.


DATA SECURITY

Cr360 is a Web-based data management program based around an industrial strength database that is
scalable, fine-grained, and sophisticated. It is designed to run over standard security protocols such as SSL
for Web access.


                                                                                                  24 | P a g e
                      The World Bank Group FY16 GHG Inventory Management Plan

Core permissions, such as read and write access, are highly controlled by WB CR and IFC FP and
documented. The list of users may be available upon request.

Information compiled for the purpose of the WBG GHG inventory will be maintained by WB CR and IFC FP.
Both teams have file backup protection standard to the WBG’s data backup system.

CORPORATE REPORTING FREQUENCY

Facility data will be reported on an annual basis in time for annual inventory reporting, generally by the
end of the second quarter of the fiscal year.


                                                 BASE YEAR

The WBG completed its first global GHG inventory in FY2007. The inventories in FY2007 and FY2008 were
for learning and educational purposes—teaching country offices about carbon inventory data collection and
identifying data gaps. The FY2009 inventory was the first using a Web-based survey, and was also used as
a learning experience.
The IFC has identified FY 2008 as their base year for reducing electricity use per workstation in their
Washington, DC office.
The World Bank has set FY 10 as their base year for reducing emissions from managed and owned offices
by 10% by FY 17.

ADJUSTMENTS TO BASE YEAR EMISSIONS – STRUCTURAL AND METHODOLOGY CHANGES

Structural changes include mergers, acquisitions, and divestments and/or outsourcing or in-sourcing of GHG
emitting activities. Changes in the status of leased assets also are considered structural changes.

Methodology changes include changes in activity data accuracy, changes in emission factors, changes in
electricity intensity or air travel intensity figures, and/or changes to the methodology used to calculate GHG
emissions.

Discovery of significant errors in base year emissions calculations may necessitate a change in the base year
emissions inventory. Significant structural or methodology changes in future years may necessitate an
adjustment to the base year emissions to ensure that data are consistent and historically relevant. A
“Significance Threshold” requiring a change in the base year emissions would be a 1 percent change in the
total corporate-wide GHG emission inventory over or under the previous calculation (if no change were
made).
         Changes Due to New Emission Factors
If there is a change to published emission factor(s), the emission factors will be changed for each of the
previous years as well as the current year, provided they meet the 1 percent Significance Threshold. By
changing the emission factors for each of the previous reporting years, the emission calculations remain
historically consistent and relevant since the same factors are used throughout.
         Changes Due to Errors
Arithmetic and data entry mistakes can occur while recording and reporting emissions data. If errors are
identified during subsequent year inventory reporting that trigger the Significance Threshold, corrections to
the previous inventories will be made.
         Changes Due to Data Accuracy and Availability
If new data are available on source emissions that were not previously available or if new methodologies
result in obtaining more accurate data on source emissions, an adjustment to previous year may be required.
In such cases the Significance Threshold will be evaluated to determine if adjustments to the past years ’
inventories are warranted.

 Records are maintained in the following fashion:

 All utility records from electricity and natural gas consumption from owned buildings are kept in two forms: paper
 and electronic (in the World Bank’s accounting system, SAP). The paper form is filed twice within GSD. The process for
 electricity bills and for natural gas and diesel purchases for boilers and generators is as follows:

    Invoice generated                 Invoice scanned                Original invoice               Duplicate paper
      and sent to the                 and filed in SAP               filed with GSD                 invoice filed with
       World Bank                                                                                      accounting




                                                                    Data tracked in
                                                                      All Building
                                                                     Metrics1.xlsx

 Diesel purchases for generators are recorded by the generator servicing company, Griffiths, as well as the engineer
 of the building containing the generator that was refilled. Griffiths sends a paper invoice that is filed with GSDCR as
 a hard copy. The hard copy of the bill is maintained by the World Bank.
 Refrigerant replacement and replenishment is recorded by the servicing company, Donohoe. Donohoe will submit an
 electronic report to the World Bank Contract Manager of each service instance with the quantity of refrigerant
 replaced or replenished. A hard copy of the report will be maintained by Donohoe in their World Bank office. The
 engineer for the building containing the chiller that was serviced will also maintain a copy of the file. The World Bank
 will maintain these records for three years as required by the EPA.

 For leased buildings, records are maintained in the following fashion:

 The World Bank, as a leased building tenant, does not have direct access to utility bills from our leased buildings.
 Landlords are contacted on an as needed basis (at least annually for purposes of the carbon inventory) to seek the
 information. In line with standard industry practice, the utility data is provided to the World Bank on a prorated scale
 by square footage. This information is received by e-mail and retained indefinitely. In the absence of concrete data,
 estimations are made based on intensity rates (kWh/ft2).

 All utility records from electricity and natural gas consumption from the IFC F building are kept in two forms: paper
 and electronic. The paper form is filed in the office of the IFC Chief Engineer, part of the Facilities Management
 team. The paper form is scanned, and electronic copies are stored in the shared network drive, and in the accounting
 software system, Avid, managed by Brandywine—IFC’s facilities management servicing company. On a monthly
 basis, the data is manually entered into spreadsheets organized by utility type (stored on IFC’s shared network drive)
 and then imported into one footprint summary spreadsheet (also stored on IFC’s shared network drive). All these
 records are kept indefinitely.

 Refrigerant replacement and replenishment is recorded by the servicing company, Brandywine. Brandywine will
 submit an electronic report to the IFC Facilities Management team with the quantity of refrigerant replaced or
 replenished. A hard copy of the report will be maintained by Brandywine. The engineer for the building containing
 the chiller that was serviced will also maintain a copy of the file.

TRAINING

The purpose of the WBG’s training procedure is to ensure that training that pertains to the World Bank’s CR
Program, IFC’s Footprint Program, and to the GHG inventory is maintained. Each WBG office will outline
their training procedure and update the IMP as necessary.
         Headquarters Specific: USA
At the WBG Headquarters in Washington, DC the task of maintaining the inventory is limited to the WB’s CR
and GSDCR and IFC FP; thus, currently, training will be targeted to the specific needs of individual CR and
IFC FP staff and may entail the following:
      Attending relevant conferences,
      Reviewing GHG Protocol guidance annually
      Attending various trainings with outside groups, such as the GHG Institute e-learning, U.S. Green
         Building Council, the Environmental Protection Agency, and U.S. Department of Energy

                                         AUDITING AND VERIFICATION

INTERNAL AUDITING

The WBG will conduct a desktop review of the corporate GHG inventory each year. Based on this review,
any office triggering a Significance Threshold will in turn trigger the need for an internal verification review
of that site.

EXTERNAL AUDITING

The WBG will periodically hire a third-party, outside reviewer of the Inventory Management Plan and the
corporate GHG inventory. Should an external audit be warranted, the WBG will contract a third-party
audit. ERT-Winrock conducted a verification of the WBG FY07 inventory and IMP in FY08, while WSP
Environment and Energy reviewed the FY 09 Inventory and IMP in FY 10 and the FY 11 Inventory and FY 12
IMP, as well as the FY 13 inventory and IMP.

Additionally, the IMP and IFC’s GHG inventory are reviewed annually as a part of the IFC annual report
auditing procedures.

MANAGEMENT REVIEW

Annually, upon completion of the GHG inventory, the GHG inventory results will be presented to the Director
of General Services for review.

CORRECTIVE ACTION

Corrective actions will be implemented at the direction of the WB CR and IFC FP in response to a desktop
review and/or an internal or external audit identifying a Significance Threshold criteria item or other
significant structural or methodological issue that warrants corrective action. Such corrective actions will be
documented by changes to the IMP and/or the GHG Inventories. Changes to document, inventories, plans,
and so forth are subject to the IMP Document Retention and Control Policy.

 Note: N2O, CH4 were calculated using average vehicle fuel economy. WB/IFC only has volume (gallons or liters) of
 fuel consumption and the CH4 and N2O factors are per distance (mi or km) traveled. As a result, a corporate
 average fuel economy was assumed to be 22 mpg.
