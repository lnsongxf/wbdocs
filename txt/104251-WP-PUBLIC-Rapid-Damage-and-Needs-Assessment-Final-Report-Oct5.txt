PREFACE

At the request of the Government of the Commonwealth of Dominica, a mission led by the World
Bank conducted a rapid damage and impact assessment to estimate the scale and scope of the
damage caused by Tropical Storm Erika on August 27, 2015 jointly with other development
partners. Experts from international organizations, including the Caribbean Disaster Emergency
Management Agency (CDEMA), Caribbean Development Bank (CDB), United Nations
Development Program (UNDP), the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and Women’s
Empowerment (UN Women), the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the Pan-American Health
Organization (PAHO), the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Food
Program (WFP), the Red Cross, OECS Commission and the University of the West Indies (UWI)
also participated in this assessment.

The objective of the assessment is to provide the Government of the Commonwealth of Dominica
with a quantitative basis upon which to design and base a comprehensive reconstruction and
financing strategy. From September 7-18, 2015 the team conducted a preliminary assessment of
the damage caused by Tropical Storm Erika and estimated the related macroeconomic implications
of the event. In addition to the rapid assessment, the team was asked to examine the impacts across
sectors to be reflected in the medium to longer term reconstruction and recovery phases following
the initial relief processes.

The data presented in this assessment is based on Government supplied data as of September 23,
2015. It is important to note that these estimates are preliminary due to the rapid nature of the
assessment and the damage and losses might change as time progresses.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

On August 27, 2015 a tropical storm passed over Dominica producing extraordinary rainfall with
high intensity. Owing the mountainous island topography and the saturated condition of the soil,
the heavy rainfall resulted in intense and rapid flooding. Dominica suffered severe infrastructural
damage, primarily related to transportation, housing and agriculture with the worst damage
occurring in the south and south east parts of the island.

Based upon an initial assessment of impacts to each affected sector, Tropical Storm Erika resulted
in total damage and loss of EC$1.3 billion (US$483 million), equivalent to approximately 90% of
Dominica’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP)1. The majority of damages were sustained in the
transport sector (60 percent), followed by the housing sector (11 percent) and agriculture sector
(10 percent). Out of a total population of 72,340 persons, 11 persons were confirmed dead, 22
missing, 574 homeless and 713 evacuated with approximately 7,229 impacted by the event in
disaster declared areas. A summary of the damage and loss by sector is detailed in Table 1. Disaster
impacts have been categorized into three groups: productive sectors, infrastructure and social
sectors.

CHAPTER ONE – INTRODUCTION AND EVENT DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION

1.1 Country Profile

With a gross national income per capita of US$10,3002, Dominica is an upper-middle-income
small island state, with an estimated population of 72,340 (51% men, 49% women). The country’s
land mass is 750 sq km consisting primarily of mountainous terrain with 90% of the country’s
inhabitants residing along the coastal areas. Dominica produces a narrow range of goods and
services for export namely, agricultural products and educational services through the
establishment of international medical schools. Although the economy is described as
predominantly agricultural, the country is actively exploring prospects in tourism, and is also
developing the production of geothermal energy, which in addition to its export potential could
lower domestic input costs.

Despite high human development – the 2014 United Nations Development Program Human
Development Index ranked Dominica as 93 of 187 countries – poverty remains a pervasive
development issue. According to the latest Country Poverty Assessment (2008-2009), 28.8 percent
of the population lives below the locally defined poverty line (falling from 39 percent in 2003),
3.1 percent of the population was deemed to be indigent3 (declining from 10 percent in 2003) and
11.5 percent was deemed vulnerable. Poverty rates among males and females were proportional –
28.8 percent of males were classified as poor with 28.9 percent of females classified as such. The
Gini coefficient of inequality was estimated to be at 0.44 in 2008 – the richest 10 percent of the
population accounted for 37.2 percent of the consumption while the poorest 10 percent accounted
for only 2 percent of consumption expenditure. The main poverty influences are due to external
factors, including reductions in banana export protections, surge in food and energy prices, the
global economic crisis and the regularity of natural disasters4.

Dominica continues to work towards improving the social conditions of its citizens through
infrastructural investments, economic diversification and employment generation, yet its
population and economy remains highly exposed to natural disaster events and catastrophic risk.
Disasters stemming from natural hazards such as high wind exposure, floods and landslides have
destroyed or damaged critical infrastructure and set back hard earned development gains – disaster
recovery and reconstruction have absorbed an increasingly large share of annual budgets imposing
substantial costs on the country’s economy.

                                                                                                                                8
The economy’s susceptibility to a variety of natural hazards is underscored by its rank as 12th on
the list of one hundred and eleven (111) countries on the composite vulnerability index of the
Commonwealth Secretariat and the World Bank (WB). Recent disaster trends have also
demonstrated that areas with the highest rates of poverty tend to be more harmed than others when
faced with disasters such as flooding and landslides. As climate change continues to increase the
frequency and intensity of the extreme hazard events, the most vulnerable among the Dominican
population are expected to be especially impacted.

1.2 Country Economic Profile

Dominica’s economic performance over the
past ten years has reflected its vulnerability to
natural hazards and economic shocks as real
growth averaged less than 2% per annum (see
Chart 1). The country recorded its highest
growth period during 2006-2008 where real
GDP increased by an average of 5% due to
heightened public sector investment particularly following the passage of Hurricanes Dean and
Omar. Subsequently, from 2009-2013 economic performance was lackluster as the economy
grappled with the effects of: (i) the Great Recession which was manifested in lower remittances,
tourist arrivals and foreign direct investment; and (ii) natural hazards due to the passage of Tropical
Storm Ophelia, the effects of the 2013 Christmas Eve trough, and other more localized hazard
events such as flooding. As a result of the relatively weak private sector activity, government took
on a more active role in supporting employment generation; in 2014 services provided by the state
along with private education were the main drivers of growth.

The Government of Dominica has essentially adopted a three-pronged plan to achieve its
development objective of poverty reduction. This includes: (i) creating the enabling environment
for investment (ii) supporting sectoral strategies for growth in tourism, agriculture and
manufacturing; and (iii) exploring direct strategies for poverty reduction through for example
capital programmes with a strong growth enhancing/job creation component along with direct
social assistance programmes. Importantly, within this framework, environmental sustainability
and gender concerns are treated as cross-cutting themes5.

The risks to reducing poverty are significant, given existing, economic, social and environmental
vulnerabilities. As previously indicated, hazard analysis and experience shows that Dominica is
vulnerable to a wide range of geologic and meteorological hazards, which are likely to be

                                                                                                     9
exacerbated by climate change and climate variability trends, which could erode hard-won social
and economic gains and would likely affect vulnerable groups disproportionately. Additionally,
notwithstanding attempts at economic diversification, the country is constrained by size, human
capital endowment, limited access to
finance and high input costs6 . Much of the
financing requirement for the plan will
reside with government. While the
Government of the Commonwealth of
Dominica’s (GoCD’s) fiscal and debt
indicators are more favourable than some
regional counterparts, the effects of slow
growth, post-disaster rehabilitation and the
provision of support to vulnerable groups
have put pressure on public finances (see
Chart 2).

However, the country has already taken important steps in mitigating some of these risks through
investments in geothermal, education and infrastructure (which will need to be strengthened going
forward to incorporate enhanced resilience measures). Additionally, GoCD has managed to
contract much of its debt on concessional terms, which will help to maximise fiscal space as it
seeks to achieve its development objective. See Chapter 4 on Macroeconomic Impacts for more
details.

1.3 Vulnerability to Disasters

Overview. Dominica is vulnerable to numerous natural disasters arising from meteorological
events (high wind, excess rainfall and hurricanes) and geophysical events (earthquake, volcano
and tsunami). These recurrent events have significantly harmed both the population’s
socioeconomic well-being and the country’s general economic and fiscal stability. Particularly
damaging are events associated with excessive or prolonged rainfall, which provokes flooding and
landslide activity. The highest elevations are located in the island’s interior, and (due to orographic
rainfall effects) these areas typically receive the highest rainfall. As river systems drain radially
from the island’s center to the coast, transit time for rainfall runoff is relatively short. This effect,
coupled with the steeply sloping topography, creates the potential for flash floods.

Physical Vulnerability. With regards to physical vulnerability, steep topographic conditions and
rugged interior dominate the island landscape, which has led to human settlements and physical
development being highly concentrated along narrow coastal areas (particularly in the south and
west). A significant proportion of Dominica’s population as well as assets are therefore highly
vulnerable to hurricanes as well as high-intensity rainfall, wind and storm surge events. The

6A 2014 tariff survey by CARILEC places Dominica’s average tariff rate at USD0.43 per kwh, the second highest of 13 English -
speaking countries in the survey.
                                                                                                                          10
island’s mountainous landscape presents significant engineering challenges, particularly for road
construction. In addition to the island’s steep topography, underdeveloped and damaged
infrastructure has been a key challenge to reducing vulnerability to disasters. Critical public
infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and water supply systems as well as health and education
facilities remain vulnerable to climate change–related impacts, including flooding and landslides.
This vulnerability arises in part from the failure to consider natural hazard and disaster risk in
designing and constructing infrastructure, and from deferring maintenance.


Economic and Fiscal Vulnerability. Hydrometeorological disasters have historically imposed
significant costs on the Dominican economy, leading to major declines in GDP growth and general
productivity. The average annual economic losses associated with extreme hydrometeorological
events are equivalent to roughly 7.4 percent of GDP7. Singular events like Hurricane Dean (2007)
caused extensive damage to the island, estimated at 58% of GDP, or US$162 million, with
significant damage to buildings and infrastructure. More recently in 2011, record level flooding
and landslides associated with heavy rain caused in excess of US$100 million in damage. In April
2013, heavy rains caused landslides, flooding and a 40-foot deep split in a section of the East Coast
main road resulting in two deaths, and more recently in December 2013 heavy rains caused
widespread damage to infrastructure and housing with damage estimates in the range of US$20
million.

Overview of the Storm Event

Tropical Storm Erika formed in the mid-Atlantic at about 47o West longitude 15o North latitude
on August 24, 2015. It was immediately classified as a tropical storm and continued west-
northwest at a speed of approximately 20 mph. On the morning of August, 27, 2015, the system
(storm center) arrived at the Leeward Islands with the majority of rainfall associated with the
eastern side of the system. Rainfall arrived Dominica in the morning of the 27th producing heavy
rains for approximately 9 hours. Rain Gauge               Erika Satellite Image, Aug. 27, 2015
readings taken at Canefield Airport (on the
coast near Roseau) indicated the rain event
started at approximately 7:00 a.m local time
and continued through 6:00 p.m. As recorded
at Canefield, the heaviest accumulation
occurred between 7:00 a.m and 12 noon with an
accumulation of approximately 200 mm
(nearly 8 inches over the 5 hour period).

Additional rainfall data were available from the
climate station Gleau Gommier located in the
mountains near the center of the island at a higher elevation. Data recorded from this station
indicated that rainfall accumulation on the 27th between 1:00 a.m and 5:00 p.m was 17.08 inches
or 434 mm, of which 14.1 inches (359.7mm) accumulated from 4:00 a.m to 9:00 a.m which was
higher than the Canefield data. As a result of the intense rainfall in combination with steep
topography and relative short distance from the center mountain ridge to the coastal areas (6 miles
or so), flash flooding rapidly ensued with little warning to the population.

Several factors contributed to the severe
impacts from the storm. Flash flooding
was triggered due to the accumulation
of debris in river courses, effectively
creating temporary stream dams which
released suddenly when overwhelmed
by flow accumulations. In addition,
island topography coupled with short
transit times from the central mountains
to the coast all contributed to a major
flash flood event. The combination of
intense rainfall, unusual dry season and
cracking of clay soils contributed to
slope failures and debris generation which resulted in major damages and fatalities throughout
Dominica.

1.4 Immediate Response

The Dominica Meteorological Services and the Office of Disaster Management (ODM) through
various medium kept all relevant stakeholders, media and public informed. National Emergency
Planning Organization (NEPO) was activated and the acting Prime Minister Mr. Rayburn
Blackmoore and Ministers, Staff of the ODM and key members of NEPO kept the nation informed
on safety protocols and procedures. Rainfall began subsiding at approximately 1:00 p.m on August
27. A NEPO meeting was convened at 1.30 pm Thursday at the Police Headquarters where initial
reports were received and decisions were taken for search and rescue and response to affected
areas. Initial efforts focused on creating emergency access to areas cut off by the storm (landslides
and bridge collapse).

On August 29, the Prime Minister declared 9 “special disaster areas”, namely: Petite Savanne,
Pichelin, Good Hope, Bath Estate (Paradise Valley), Dubique, Campbell, Coulibistrie, San
Sauveur, Petite Soufriere (See Map 1). Overall, more than 7,200 people were directly affected by
the disaster. Teams conducting Damage Assessment and Needs Analysis (DANA) were dispatched
on August 29. The Government of Dominica established an account at the Eastern Caribbean
Central Bank to receive contributions in support of its recovery and reconstruction efforts
following the passage of Tropical Storm Erika.

1.4.1 Request for Assistance and International Response

The Regional Response Mechanism (RRM), coordinated by the Caribbean Disaster Emergency
Management Agency (CDEMA) through its Regional Coordination Centre in Barbados, was
activated on August 27 through September 6. The RRM is an arrangement for the coordination of
disaster response among CDEMA Participating States, and Regional and International Agencies.
In early September, military vessels and helicopters from Venezuela, The Netherlands, and the
UK arrived in Dominica to assist with search and rescue, medical and infrastructure support and
damage assessment. Helicopters sent from France and Trinidad and Tobago assisted with airlifting
persons in critical conditions from affected areas and delivery relief items. Additional vessels and
officers were sent by St. Lucia, Barbados, Antigua and Barbuda, British Virgin Islands, Cuba, US
Virgin Islands, Montserrat, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, to provide transportation of humanitarian
assistance and persons in the affected areas.

The European Union Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection Department (ECHO) provided EUR
300,000 in emergency humanitarian funding through the Pan American Health Organisation
(PAHO). The emergency aid provided by the EU targeted: restoring access to essential health
services and medical care capacity (including psycho-social support); providing safe drinking
water, and ensuring proper hygiene, sanitation and waste management; and implementing crucial
disease prevention activities.

The US Government provided an emergency grant of US$50,000 in humanitarian assistance
through the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC). The Caribbean Development Bank
(CDB) made available an Emergency Relief Grant of US$200,000 is to be administered through
CDEMA. The Caribbean Institute for Meteorology and Hydrology (CIMH) deployed
meteorological equipment and two technical personnel to facilitate the re-operationalization of
both airports. Technical and logistical assistance to enhance response capacity of the Government
of Dominica were provided by: International Telecommunication Union (ITU), UNFPA,
UNICEF, UNDP, PAHO, and UN Women.

CHAPTER TWO – THE RAPID DAMAGE AND IMPACT
ASSESSMENT APPROACH

2.1 THE RAPID DAMAGE ASSESSMENT APPROACH

To conduct the assessment, the Government coordinated an interagency team comprised of
national government authorities and representatives from the World Bank, UNICEF, WFP, FAO,
PAHO, UN-Women, University of West Indies and the Caribbean Development Bank to take stock
of and tabulate damage and loss, visit affected areas, gather information and analyze the results to
inform the recovery strategy.

The information in this RDIA report reflects the results of the assessment and information
available as of September 23, 2015.

RDIA Training. A one hour technical workshop focusing on the methodology of the assessment
was held on Monday September 7, 2015 and chaired by the Ministry of Finance. The RDIA builds
on the Damage and Loss Assessment (DaLA) methodology developed by UN ECLAC (see box
below) and expands it with quantitative data on social sector and livelihood impacts. Twenty eight
experts attended representing Ministries and organizations from impacted sectors, which include:
the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Ministry of Education and
Human Resource Development, the Ministry of Health and Environment, the Ministry of Housing,
Lands and Water Resource Management, the Ministry of Public Works and Ports, the Ministry of

Social Services, Family and Gender Affairs, the Ministry of Tourism and Urban Renewal and
Dominica Water and Sewerage Authority.

The session outlined the data collection methodology to facilitate the Rapid Damage and Impact
Assessment. The training focused on assessments in four main sectors: social, productive,
infrastructure, and crosscutting sectors.

2.2 ASSESSMENT SCOPE



                         The Damage and Loss Assessment Methodology

 The DaLA methodology uses the country’s system of national accounts and involves all
 macroeconomic sectors including productive (agriculture, tourism, commerce, and industries),
 infrastructure (transportation, electricity, and water supply, telecommunications, and sanitation),
 social (housing, education, and health), as well as crosscutting issues (e.g. the environment and
 gender). Under the methodology’s conceptual framework, the following disaster effects are
 measured during the assessment:

 Damage is defined as the monetary value of physical, durable assets that may be fully or partially
 destroyed due to the natural disaster, expressed in terms of the replacement value of the assets
 assuming the same characteristics that they had prior to the disaster.

 Losses are changes in the normal flows of the economy that may arise in all sectors of economic
 and social activity due to the external shock brought about by the disaster, and that may continue
 until full economic recovery and reconstruction has been achieved, and are expressed in current
 values.


Figure 1: Damage and Loss Assessment Methodology


This assessment covers the damages and losses caused by Tropical Storm Erika and the associated
floods and landslides that occurred during that period. The main assessment of the damage and
loss were conducted island-wide taking into account data from all districts. The following sectors
have been included in the assessment: i) Transportation; ii) Water and Sanitation; iii)
Telecommunications; iv) Agriculture; v) Tourism; vi) Commerce; vii) Housing; viii) Education;
ix) Electricity; and x) Health.


2.3 ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY

While the main focus of the assessment has been to estimate the damages to physical assets and
the corresponding losses, this Rapid Damage Impact Assessment is broadly based on the Damage
                                                                                               16
and Loss Assessment (DaLA) methodology developed by the United Nations Economic
Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (UN-ECLAC) in the early 1970s and further
updated and expanded by the World Bank’s Global Facility for Disaster Risk Reduction
(GFDRR)8.

To the extent possible, the team applied the DaLA assessment approach with some deviations
owing to the timing of the assessment. This report provides, based on the available information,
an approximation of damages to assets and loss to the economic flows, and provides some inputs
to assist in summarizing total macroeconomic impacts.

Wherever possible, the reconstruction needs are computed and expressed as the financing
requirement for restoring damages with a “Build Back Better” factor for quality improvements,
resilience and risk reduction.


2.4 LIMITATIONS AND CAVEATS

The findings presented in the RDIA, which was conducted from September 7-18, 2015, are
intended to quantify the impacts of the August 27 flood event and provide recommendations to
increase the country’s disaster resilience. The data in this report is derived from figures provided
by the government and incorporated into the analysis by the sector teams following discussions
with government officials and on the basis of strategic interviews, expert opinions, feasibility
considerations and other implementation considerations.

Since some of the assessments and specific sectoral analyses are ongoing, the figures presented in
this report should be considered as the best estimate possible given available data and time
constraints. Furthermore, given the short time available for this Rapid Damage Impact Assessment,
and the focus of local authorities on rapid emergency response in terms of reconstruction needs,
this report has attempted to include the disaster’s impact on cross-cutting areas such as Gender,
Environment and Social Protection to the extent possible. In addition, while an approximation of
loss to the economic flows have been presented, albeit partially, based on available information,
the possible macroeconomic performance modifications, including possible slowdown of gross
domestic production, deterioration of the balance of payments and of fiscal sector position, and
increase in inflation arising from the losses in production have not been fully accounted for.

Therefore, the damage and loss figures presented in this Report should not be considered
definitive, but rather a preliminary understanding of the disaster’s impact, to guide the recovery
and reconstruction efforts.

CHAPTER THREE – DAMAGE AND LOSS BY SECTOR

DAMAGE AND LOSS BY SECTOR
SUMMARY. According to a summary of the data reported from each affected sector, Tropical
Storm Erika resulted in an estimated total damage and loss of EC$1.3 billion (US$483 million),
equivalent to 90% of Dominica’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The majority of damages were
sustained in the transport sector (60 percent), followed by housing sector (11 percent) and
agriculture sector (10 percent). The table below summarizes the damage and loss by sector.

Reconstruction cost estimates. The RDIA has determined that a total of EC$1,084,818,469
damages were incurred during TS Erika resulting in EC$214,011,231 losses. The reconstruction
is – in principle – based on the assessment of damages, which are based on current replacement
and/or repair costs using 2015 prices. In addition to the current replacement cost, additional costs
are accounted for feasibility studies, engineering design and supervision of works related to
engineering works. For the purpose of determining the public liability for reconstruction, a net
present value budget of EC$1,023,527,611 in 2015 prices is required to reconstruct and ‘build back
better”. This estimate excludes private liabilities but includes a comprehensive housing
development programme for approximately 560 new homes estimated at EC$128,784,0539.


9   Costs include land acquisition, access to water and sanitation, electricity, access and standard housing units.

Background. The transportation network in the Commonwealth of Dominica comprises 320 km
of main roads, 119 km of secondary roads, 127 km of urban roads, and 338 km of feeder roads. In
addition, there are more than 200 bridges and water crossings across the country. In 2009, a road
condition assessment was conducted based on road roughness indices. The results showed that
about 24% of the main roads and 90% of the secondary, urban and feeder roads were categorized
as in poor or bad conditions. This had implications in terms of higher vehicle operating costs and
negative effects on tourism and agriculture. The Ministry of Public Works has developed a
comprehensive 10 years road sector program to improve the condition of 100% of all type of roads
in the country to satisfactory condition by 2020. Tropical storm Erika has caused extensive
damages and losses in the transport sector and the result is a major setback to the ambitious
infrastructure rehabilitation program of the government.

Impact of Disaster. The floods and landslides triggered by tropical storm Erika destroyed and
damaged extensive parts of the transportation network in the country. From the initial rapid
damage assessment approximately 17% of roads and 6% of bridges are fully damaged. In addition,
24% of roads and 44% of bridges are partially damaged.

Following the storm, approximately 60% of roads in the country were inaccessible. Extensive
sections of the roads were made accessible in the first two weeks, but there remain sections of
roads that will require significantly longer time to repair and reconstruct. The west coast road has
been severely damaged with multiple segments cut due to landslides and bridge failures (e.g.
Macoucherie, Batalie, Pointe Ronde). Despite cleaning up efforts most of these landslides are still
active and present an immediate danger to users and to the population living nearby. The situation
remains critical in the Loubiere-Pichelin-Dubique-Bagatelle and Roseau-Pont Casse-La Plaine-
Boetica Gorges, along Roseau Valley corridors and some feeder roads. In some sections such the
Boetica Gorge the entire road and embankment of more than 10,000 cubic meter were washed
away. Restoring connectivity in some areas such as Petite Savanne will be difficult in the short or
medium term and will require significant investment.

Financial (Damages and Losses). The total damages and losses to the transport sector (roads
and bridges) and additional needs are estimated to be EC$773.46 million (US$287.53 million).
Damages to roads and bridges are estimated to be EC$434 million ($US161 million) and EC$ 150
million ($US56 million), respectively. Damages to road slide slopes are estimated to be EC$58
million ($US22 million). In addition, losses due to increase in vehicle operating cost, increase in
travel time, clean up, and temporary works are estimated to be EC$41.7 million ($US 15.5 million).
Reconstruction needs to improve the resilience of new and existing infrastructure including bridge
condition investigations, design and supervision of new works are estimated to cost an additional
EC$88 million (US$33 million).

Infrastructure Sector Recommendations

Immediate Actions:

To avoid additional casualties:

              Appropriate signage in dangerous areas
              Inform people about unstable and landslide prone section of the roadway
              Inform people to take caution when crossing rivers, especially in rainy days
              Proactively close traffic in dangerous sections of roads when heavy rains are
               expected
              Regularly monitor partially damaged bridges that are open to circulation
              Urgently clean up rivers, bridges, culverts etc. to avoid further flooding
              Safely trigger active landslides (blocks, trees, unstable materials, etc.),


To avoid further damages to road and bridge assets:

              Undertake urgent abutment reconstruction, foundation stabilization and approach
               protection of partially damaged or undermined bridges
              Undertake a comprehensive and detailed landslide assessments, apply speed
               restriction and traffic restriction to avoid total collapse
              Clean up rivers, drainage systems and restore hydraulic capacity of bridges by
               removing blocks, trees or materials
Short Term Actions to Restore Access and Support Recovery.

Repairs on the west coast road (Roseau to Portsmouth)

              Construct low cost river crossings using pipes (e.g. in Macoucherie, Batalie, Pointe
               Ronde)
              Prepare construction sites and install temporary bridges at minimal cost (e.g. at
               Batali and Pointe Ronde)
              Rehabilitate damaged critical points
Actions on the rest of the network

              Clean up remaining landslides
              Conduct light road and bridge repairs, install temporary crossings, place blocks or
               gabion cages to stabilize walls
                Improve bridge approaches to restore connectivity
                Conduct temporary stabilization works of undermined road sections
                Perform a comprehensive and detailed assessment of the bridge and road assets




                                                                                                21
Long Term Reconstruction Strategies and Recommendations:


               To enhance the resilience of the road network to natural disasters and climate
                change prepare technical guidelines for
                    o Hydraulic capacity analysis
                    o River bank protection
                    o Landslide stabilization and mitigation measures
                    o Coastal protection
                    o Prioritization process of investments based on cost benefits analysis
               Conduct preliminary technical studies, prepare design and bidding documents for
                repair and reconstruction of partially and fully damaged sections.
               Conduct river training work near major bridges
               Perform a comprehensive and detailed vulnerability assessment of the road
                network to natural disaster and climate change and prepare a multiyear
                investment mitigation action plan.
              Consider alternate modes of transportation such as ferries in places where
               rebuilding roads and bridges is not economically feasible.

Airport

Background. Douglas-Charles Airport is the main gateway to Dominica with the rest of the world,
and is also the main gateway for stayover tourism, which comprises 93% of the roughly US$ 130
million revenues from the tourism industry. It follows that the operational condition of the airport
is of utmost importance for the economy of Dominica. Fortunately the outage of the airport
occurred in the slowest part of the year. The damages were extensive – though the airport has been
reopened in record speed, significant capital needs to be invested in order to make it truly
functional as an efficient gateway serving roughly 140 thousand passengers a year. With all
ground-level kept electrical equipment such as conveyor belts, x-ray machines, walk-through
security scanners, runway and approach lighting, and communications equipment having been
destroyed, the airport currently operates in a very limited capacity, allowing only daytime flights
in good visibility, and having long queues for baggage and passenger security screening.
Throughput at the airport will need to be increased in order to serve the upcoming tourism season
effectively.

Impact of Disaster. Both Canefield Airport and Douglas-Charles International Airport were
flooded, however, the substantial damages occurred at Douglas-Charles due to the flooding and
the accompanying mud deposits. The river by the airport most likely became clogged by debris
further upstream, and as this temporary natural dam gave way, the currents became powerful
enough to break the dam at the western end of the airport. The airport was powered at the time,
resulting in loss of all electrical equipment that came into contact with the water. The flooding was
followed by an extensive deposit of mud and debris, which penetrated all buildings and fixtures
on their ground floors (see Figure 2 and Figure ).

Financial (Damages and Losses). The total damages and losses to the transport sector (airports
and seaports) are estimated to be EC$40,289,890 (US14, 977,654). Damage calculations are based
on figures provided by the Dominican Sea and Air Ports Authority. Calculations of financial losses
for the airport are based on the income statement for the year 2014/15 ending June 2013, adjusted
for monthly seasonality based on passenger arrivals and departures for the same period.

                                                                                                   23
Overall estimates of the damages, which are still preliminary estimates, are in the range of US$ 15
million. Fortunately, there appears to be no structural damage to any buildings, and the cleanup
effort of removing debris, along with repairing and replacing the most essential equipment, has
been very rapid, with non-scheduled relief flights already using the airport, and scheduled services
resuming on September 18. Two aircraft were observed destroyed beyond repair: A Beechcraft
Debonair and a Cessna Skyhawk 172, losses that could be valued at EC$538,000 (US$200,000).
In addition, damages of EC$1,345,000 (US$500,000) on airline-owned ground equipment were
reported.

The list of items damaged is quite long. In effect, all ground based electronics were destroyed.
This includes ground lighting, runway approach lights, the precision approach slope indicator, all
portable communications equipment (the chargers were on the ground floor), x-ray machines (one
for passenger screening, one for luggage screening), uninterruptible power supplies, baggage
scales and handling system, PA systems, CCT, air conditioning systems, and much else. Not
destroyed because of their higher locations was the distance measuring equipment (DME) and the
non-directional beacon (NDB).

In addition to electrical equipment, both fire engines became inoperative, the terrain inspection
vehicle was destroyed (as were multiple other vehicles), a generator for aircraft powering became
inoperative, the MET station for weather observation and reporting was destroyed, and much of
the apron surface was damaged. In addition, the very beginning of runway 60 received some
damage to its surface (see Figure and Figure 5). 7,000 meters of fencing will require replacing.

Airport revenues for the fiscal year 2014-2015 were EC$1,990,600 (US$740,000). Using matching
traffic data, a season-adjusted monthly revenue stream can be established, along with a daily
stream using the number of days per month. Assuming 5 days of loss of operations in August, and
15 days in September, the total amount of losses can be estimated to be EC$215,200 (US$80,000).
However, losses by the airlines directly servicing the airport far exceed those incurred by the
airport, with an estimate of US$ 14.5 million. Losses to airlines serving Dominica indirectly, such
as British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, are difficult to establish, however, with a round trip airfare
of US$ 2,270 (Gatwick – Antigua, British Airways), and visitor loss from the UK estimated at
1,202, a reasonable estimated would be EC 7.3 million (US$ 2.7 million).

                                                                                                                 25
LIAT has resumed operations out of Douglas-Charles airport since September 18, and Seaborne
Airlines since September 23rd. However, significant cost are spent daily on extra security
personnel guarding missing sections of the perimeter fence and performing screening functions
that used to be completed electronically (x-ray equipment and walk-through scanners). During
daytime 25 extra security staff are needed, and at night 12.

Cross-cutting Themes. Every airport is dependent on access, and the main road leading to the
airport has received some damage. To bring the airport fully into service again, the road linking
the airport needs to be fully restored, which involved the removal of a high number of mud slides,
the repair of the road by a bridge, and the restoration of one lane of the road at a location where it
has collapsed. Tourism and air transport are deeply interlinked. Without air access, hotels cannot
engage their markets, and without demand for Dominica’s tourism, the airport’s passenger volume
will suffer. It is therefore essential that as the airport redevelops, tourism’s infrastructure is also
brought back on line (Also see section on Tourism).

Airport Sector Recommendations. The airport is being recovered at a rapid pace, with the
runway having been cleared, the terminal appearing clean, and some essential equipment such as
one fire engine and one generator having become operational. The airport right now can only allow
daytime VFR operations, which is a severe handicap. In addition, passenger and luggage screening
has to be done manually, and security guards are needed where the fence is missing.

Priority one in aviation is always safety, followed immediately by security. Therefore, a prioritized
list would go as follows:

       Both fire engines and other emergency equipment need to be fully operational
       The perimeter fence needs to be rebuilt
       Runway lighting, approach lighting, and a PAPI should be on the airfield
           o While the airport is still operating under VFR, a much less costly visual approach
                slope indicator (VASI) could be installed
       All tower related equipment (ground to air communications, ground to ground
        communications, for example) needs to be operational.

In order to make the airfield fully marketable again, a very high priority would be x-ray screening
and walk-through scanning equipment.

Of a very high, but longer term priority, the rock and soil based dam that has been repaired needs
to be replaced with a much more substantial installation, and the river may need to be straightened
through extensive earthworks on the opposite shore. The most important aspect of building the
airport back better is to manage the risks concerning the river, and to build better embankments
and dams which take adequately into account occurrence of extreme events with a view to climate
change.



                                                                                                    26
The airport is progressing very rapidly towards limited commercial operations, however,
procurement and replacement of critical equipment may still take one or two months.

                       Collapse of Barrage which Caused Inundation of the Airport




There are short-term, intermediate term, and longer term steps that should be taken in order to keep
Dominica connected.

Short term recommendations

      Immediate replacement of damaged electrical equipment and electronics. This would
       include all security installations (CCTV, entry systems, x-ray machines, scanners), luggage
       handling (conveyor belts, scales), computers, and both ground to ground and ground to air
       communications equipment. Landing lights and precision approach lighting are essential
       to bringing the airport into full operational mode again.
      Immediate repair of physical infrastructure, including the end of runway 60, the washed
       away portions of the apron, the drive-up and car parking areas affected, and the security
       fence.
      Immediate repair of any emergency response infrastructure (fire engines, ambulances) that
       are currently not operating.
      The earthen dam may not be strong enough to hold back another rain storm, and the airport
       therefore still remains vulnerable. Reinforcements of the dam with more permanent
       materials such as concrete should be a top priority.

Intermediate term recommendations
                                                                                                 27
      A feasibility study should be developed, evaluating:
          o (a) the probabilities and risks facing the airport and their mitigation by, for example,
              building river defenses, and;
          o (b) Identification of potential future sites for constructing a new, safer airport.
Long term recommendations

      Implementation of the findings of the feasibility study be they extensive fortifications of
       the current airport, or the building of a newer facility with higher capacities on a more
       secure site.
Sea Ports

TS Erika caused no damages to the port at Woodridge Bay, the main container port of Dominica.
The ferry terminal was flooded, however the cleanup was accomplished in a single day. There may
be some damages to the passenger screening equipment which are in the process of being
evaluated.

Background. The DOWASCO service system comprises 42 service areas serviced by 44
abstraction points (Figure 6) the majority of which are stream extraction systems. Prior to the
storm, DOWASCO was supplying 98.5% of the population with treated piped water. System
production is approximately 10 million gal/day. Sewage is largely managed on an individual basis
with homeowners and businesses providing septic systems. There are a few wastewater treatment
plants but the majority of collected waste is directly discharged.

Combined, the system supports over 12,349 service connections and 595 standpipes. The vast
majority of the services areas are serviced by a single intake system. The two exceptions are WA1,
the Roseau area, which is serviced by 3 sources and WA30, Grand Bay which accesses 2 intakes.
Raw water quality is generally excellent and owing to the emphasis on maintaining forest
resources, Dominica is regionally recognized for its water resources.

Impact of Disaster. Damages in the water sector are significant and widespread with most of the
damages occurring to transmission and abstraction infrastructure. Abstraction facilities are located
in streams at various elevations throughout the country and depending on the location with respect
to the upper watershed, suffered varying levels of damage. Damages to sewer systems were to
transmission lines (3) and outfalls (2).

During the storm, flash flood damages to transmission infrastructure were largely concentrated at
bridge crossings. Much of the transmission system is underground however, at river crossings is
typically attached on the external side of the bridge beam. This practice makes the transmission
lines particularly vulnerable to damage by flood debris even if a bridge remains intact. As water
transmission generally follows transportation routes, the majority of bridges in Dominica have
water transmission lines attached.

Immediately after the storm, 100% of the network was off line due to damages to intakes and
transmission line damage (Figure 6). DOWASCO responded quickly giving priority to intakes and
transmission systems serving large populations. Additionally, DOMLEC, the electric company
depends on DOWASCO water services to cool generating facilities. Intakes were cleaned out and
stabilized. Where damage occurred, temporary measures were taken to put intakes back into
service. This involved using sand bags, tarpaulin, geotextile and the installation of temporary
piping to extract water.

In some areas, where intakes could not be reestablished, portable extraction/treatment units have
been installed tor temporary supply. Apart from the issue of extraction, transmission remains

                                                                                                  29
problematic for some areas. Where lines were attached to bridges, and the bridges were destroyed,
service restoration has been hampered. At this writing, several communities continue to rely on
bottled or trucked water and 75% of the system has been restored to service.

As emergency response measures have been focused on getting water supply to the community,
temporary measures have been taken which continue to leave the system in an extremely
vulnerable condition. While the impact is currently unknown, heavy rains on Friday, 12th
September took at least 2 abstraction points out of service.

Financial (Damages and Losses). The total damages and losses to the water sector are estimated
to be EC$45,221,590 (US$16,811,000). It cannot be overemphasized that these figures are
expected to climb as the Hurricane Season progresses, given the network is fragile and vulnerable.

Damages presented in this report (Table 3) relate to the costs associated with infrastructure
damages and the requirements for their reconstruction and rehabilitation. With respect to the water
sector, losses relate to emergency temporary repairs, emergency response to water shortages
(trucking water) and lost revenue currently being experienced. These are focused on DOWASCO
expenditures. Not captured in this section are losses relating to the public health impacts of
interruptions in the potable water supply. Most significant will be the increase in cases of gastric
disease associated with consuming contaminated water and lost employment opportunity faced by
care givers. Recent monitoring indicates this is on the rise with the aged and very young segments
of the population at increased risk. This will be captured in the public health section of the report.

Water and Sanitation Sector Recommendations.

Medium- Long Term Actions

      As transmission lines are often installed external to bridges, consider liaising with Ministry
       of Works, on the design of new bridge infrastructure to include protected utility corridors
       in the bridge design rather than hanging transmission lines externally.
      Consider the application of stream bed infiltration galleries (if possible) in lieu of surface
       water abstraction systems to reduce exposure to heavy debris during flooding events.

                                                                                                  31
   Review current locations of abstraction points to identify if less vulnerable locations can
    be utilized to lessen the impact of flood debris and battering from main channel flows (e.g.
    upstream locations, stream side diversion designs)
   Consider weir designs that facilitate sediment removal such as de-sedimentation
    structures, sloped designs or other approaches that reduce sediment build-up or promote
    rapid excavation after an event.

Background. Environmental health services include a broad range of activities critical to ensuring
the health and well-being of the population of Dominica. Activities and services include solid
waste collection and disposal, management of special wastes (e.g. medical, chemical), vector
control and monitoring, food services inspection (food vendors, meat and poultry inspections etc.),
maintenance and management of public sanitation facilities and inspection of private facilities, as
well as monitoring for vector and water borne disease.

Environmental health maintains equipment and facilities notably for solid waste collection and
disposal including collection vehicles, the national sanitary landfill, waste incinerator and
associated treatment equipment including a metal compactor, tire shredder, and waste collection
vehicles.

Vector and waterborne disease. For vector control, environmental health assesses and provides
treatment for the control of insects (mosquitoes, flies), rodent control and other activities to reduce
human exposure to potential disease transmission. Vector borne disease is a major concern for
Dominica as Dengue Fever is endemic to the island with high epidemic potential. The recent
outbreak of Chikungunya (CHIKV) demonstrated the vulnerability of the population to vector
borne disease. The disease, spread by the yellow fever mosquito (Aedes ageypti ) and was
introduced to Dominica in early 2014. Within 9 months, an estimated 70% of the population was
infected. This is the same mosquito that transmits Dengue virus.

Water borne disease is related to general sanitation. Consumption of water contaminated with
sanitary waste is the primary mechanism for the spread of disease such as gastroenteritis, typhoid,
salmonellosis in the public health setting. Leptospirosis (Leptospira sp.) is known in Dominica
and is spread through contact with contaminated soils and water. Common reservoirs for the
bacteria are domestic livestock (cattle, pigs, horses etc.), dogs, rats and other mammals. The
Environmental Health Unit monitors water quality and disease outbreaks and responds to control
outbreaks providing analytical and control services.

Solid Waste. The Environmental Health Unit is the primary solid waste manager for the country.
Waste collections are weekly or bi-weekly depending on the service area. The unit maintains 2
collection vehicles which travel from the community pickup locations to the sanitary landfill. The
island has no transfer stations. Private contractors supplement the service, particularly in the hotel
                                                                                                    33
and industrial sectors. Metal recovery and recycling is practiced to the extent possible. Medical
waste is managed by incineration. Environmental Health is responsible for the incinerator facility
located at the hospital, however the unit is currently offline. Medical waste is currently being
landfilled in a special designated area.

Sanitation. The unit manages and maintains a number of public sanitation facilities throughout the
island. Thirteen facilities (serving 885 persons) throughout the island are reported to be out of
service due to damages. They also monitor the condition and status of private wastewater systems,
generally a combination of septic systems and pit latrines. There is currently a national program
in place to ultimately eliminate the use of pit latrines.

Impact of Disaster. Solid waste, vector propagation and contaminated water are the three areas
of primary environmental health impact. On the public side, solid waste generation has increased
significantly as affected persons continue their cleanup and recovery efforts. Lack of public water
and damage to sanitation facilities has resulted in an increased exposure to contaminated water
with corresponding increases in gastroenteritis. The general post flooding environment has created
conditions favorable for the widespread propagation of pests and vectors, particularly associated
with the accumulation of solid waste and standing water.

Financial (Damages and Losses). The total damages and losses to the Environmental Health
sector are estimated to be EC$7,279,523 (US$2,706,142). Damages (Table 4) reported by
environmental health relate primarily to equipment damages and damage to public sanitary
facilities as well as to the leachate collection system. This includes the need to replace collection
vehicles and container systems and rehabilitate waste management infrastructure.

Losses are evolving as the emergency response phase continues. Losses cited in the table are
partial, incomplete and likely quite low given the potential for public disease impacts. They relate
primarily to the need for emergency acquisition of vector control supplies and response materials.
Losses in time and materials will continue to accrue, particularly as contractors are engaged to
support cleanup activities. Additional losses will be accrued as enhanced laboratory surveillance
is conducted to manage the emergency.

Finally and perhaps most importantly, losses due to increase in disease prevalence will accrue as
health conditions have deteriorated. As of 10th September, surveillance reports indicate that cases
of gastroenteritis were rapidly rising. Losses due to Vector Borne Disease (Dengue) cannot be
accounted for at this time owing to the incubation time required which varies from 4-15 days. The
incubation period for leptospirosis is 7 – 12 days.

Environmental Health Sector Recommendations

Short-term Actions:

        Work with ODM, local governments and DOWASCO to consider prepositioning vector
         control and drinking water treatment supplies at strategic locations as part of the disaster
         preparedness program.
Medium-term Actions:

        Consider the use of waste transfer stations around the island and analyze the use of these
         stations for both improved solid waste management and as staging areas for post-disaster
         waste storage when transportation is interdicted.


                                                                                                              35
   Consider improvements to public sanitary facilities that include onsite water storage to
    maintain facility operations when public water is disrupted.

Background. Dominica’s telecom system is privately owned and operated by four separate
corporations: LIME, Digicel, Marpin 2K4, and Wikibuli. The backbone of the communications
network is based on submarine cables entering Dominica at landing points in Roseau and
Canefield. Distribution throughout the island is handled by a ring of fibre-optic cable following
the primary coastal road using both underground and overhead cables which use poles and trenches
shared with other telecom and utility companies. In addition to the cables, LIME and Digicel
operate a number of cellular sites. Smaller companies are Marpin 2k4 which operates cable
television, internet and phone services and Wikibuli which provides business communication
services.

Impact of Disaster. Damages to the telecoms sector were primarily incurred due breaks in the
fibre optic cable lines resulting in interruptions of internet, cellular, cable and phone services to all
areas outside of Roseau. Breaks in lines were caused by bridge failures, scouring of trenches
located adjacent to roads and utility poles destroyed by landslides. Failure of microwave towers
also occurred in areas of severe landslides and flooding. Damage to infrastructure located below
ground were much more substantial than above ground. Cellular services were restored by LIME
and Digicel by September 3rd to 98% of their network. Permanent repair of fibre-optic
infrastructure and last kilometer links is estimated to take several months. Due to dangers to staff,
all of the providers have opted not to restore service in the worst affected areas.

Financial (Damages and Losses). The total damages and losses to the Telecommunications sector
are estimated to be EC$26,900,000 (US$10,000,000). Details of lost revenue and number of
customers were not made available by the various companies. Estimated damage figures for
infrastructure were provided with estimated losses.

Telecommunications Sector Recommendations. Communications with communities during,
and immediately after the disaster, were severely disrupted. An emergency wireless
communications system should be set up and maintained by the GoCD in partnership with the
major telecommunications companies. Volunteers should be trained in the operation of this system
during a disaster. Further private sector and Government specific recommendations are outlined
below.



                                                                                                      37
Recommendations for the Private Sector:

      Three days after the disaster, generators at some of Digicel’s sites ran out of fuel and could
       not be resupplied. This led to further network outages. All sites should be inspected to
       ensure that they have adequate backup fuel supplies and properly serviced backup
       equipment. Some of these sites also house seismic and hydro-meteorological equipment.
       Backups should be functioning for these critical sensors.
      Locations of equipment should be assessed for their vulnerability to hazards. Design of
       new bridge and road infrastructure should take into consideration the reduction of hazards
       to telecommunications equipment. For example, conduits for housing cables should be
       installed within a bridge rather than exposed on the side where they can be damaged by
       water flow and debris.
      A review should be conducted of call/data handling procedures in the event of a disaster.
       Measures need to be put in place to ensure first responders and disaster response personnel
       have priority access to networks.
Recommendations for Government:

      The existing emergency radio communications network needs to be reviewed and
       upgraded. Some communities could not be contacted for days, nor could they be accessed
       on land. The Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) receives situation reports from its
       volunteers and first responders on the ground through a radio base station. Where possible,
       every community should be equipped with a radio and a volunteer trained in its use.
      The existing voice radio network should be upgraded to carry broadband data through a
       mesh network connecting crucial parts of the country. Satellite phones are also an option
       which could be used to transmit data alongside terrestrial radio.
      Standard incident reporting procedures need to be adopted and enforced during a disaster.
       The EOC should be the information and communications focal point of the government
       during and immediately after the disaster. Telecommunications companies should be
       required to make regular daily reports to the EOC as they assess and repair damages. The
       EOC should provide a standard template for reporting which is linked to an emergency
       management information system.
      Government should upgrade all existing hydro-meteorological and seismic monitoring
       stations to automatically report through either radio or satellite. Information from stations
       should be available in real time and not be entirely reliant on wired communications.

Background. Dominica Electricity Services Limited (DOMLEC) is the sole commercial
generator, transmitter, distributor, and seller of electrical energy in Dominica. It serves a customer
base of residential, commercial, and industrial users for its operated hydropower stations as well
as diesel powered generator, with a standby facility at Soufriere.

The present generation facilities in Dominica consist of:

          Three cascading run-of-the-river hydro plants (Laudat, Trafalgar and Padu) on the
           Roseau River with an installed capacity of 6.6MW and an available capacity of
           6.16MW.
          The Fond Cole Power Station close to Roseau with a mix of medium and high speed
           units (nine in total) with an installed capacity 13.27MW and an available capacity of
           12.35MW.
          The Sugar Loaf Power Station in the Portsmouth area with five high speed units with
           an installed capacity of 6.83MW and an available capacity of 6.43MW.
These units supply the island via eight 11,000 volt (11kilovolts) distribution feeders. The two
diesel generation centers are tied together by the Portsmouth Feeder (PMF), but can also be tied
together through two alternate routes utilizing the East Coast Feeder (ECF) and the Sugar Loaf
West Feeder (SWF).

The hydro generating plants are linked to each other and the Fond Cole diesel station as follows:

          Laudat to Trafalgar by a dedicated interconnector line called the LTI.
          Trafalgar is also connected to Padu through a dedicated interconnector line called the
           TPI, and Trafalgar is also linked to the Fond Cole diesel station by a dedicated
           interconnector called the TFI.
          Padu is also linked to the Fond Cole diesel station by a dedicated interconnector called
           the PFI.
In addition, another 15MW of installed capacity (known at this time) exist through self-generators.

Impact of Disaster. Following the heavy rains, outages were experienced across the island to
which DOMLEC dispatched emergency response crews to restore services where possible.
Immediately after the incident, areas without Power were upper Trafalgar, Wotten Waven, Parts

                                                                                                   39

Financial (Damages and Losses). The total damages and losses to the Electricity sector are
estimated to be EC$6,772,825 (US$2,517,779). Overall, the power supply sector did not
experience major damage to its infrastructure except for intakes and pipelines in the hydro-power
generating system EC$5,289,000 (US$1,966,171) and the transmission / distribution grid
EC$600,000 (US$223,049). Losses for 2015 are estimated at EC$883,825 (US$328,559) for
higher production cost. In addition, DOMLEC project reduced revenues due to lower GDP in
forthcoming years. DOMLEC has estimated its damages and commenced with the re-construction
of its damaged infrastructure. In terms of water supply reliability for driving its hydropower
generating units, an assessment of siltation of water intakes may be required

Electricity Sector Recommendations:

           Consider conducting a comprehensive risk assessment with respect to landslide and
            flood risks for DOMLEC infrastructure
           Consider an assessment of the resilience of DOMLEC’s Supervisory control and Data
            Acquisition system to ascertain control over its power generating capability at all times
           Consider slope stabilization and flood impact proofing of DOMLEC infrastructure if
            and as needed

Background. The Agricultural Sector is a significant contributor to the economy of Dominica.
Agricultural contributes approximately 17%, or USD$93.4M to the country’s GDP. The
agriculture sector is a major source of jobs in Dominica. Of the estimated 32,000 persons actively
seeking employment, an estimated 7,000 are employed in agriculture. This represents 21% of the
active work force.

In terms of arable land (including permanent crops) Dominica has approximately 24,000 ha
available based on 2012 estimates. A variety of crops are grown but root crops and ground
provisions are among the highest in agricultural importance. Bay oil production is regarded as
second followed by banana and plantain. Other important crops include citrus, avocado, coconut,
passion fruit and vegetables.

Livestock is a minor but important contributor to the sector. Poultry, cattle, goats, sheep, and pork
are grown primarily for local consumption. In terms of agricultural importance, laying hens for
egg production are considered number one, followed by pork production and finally ruminants.
Over the past two decades, there has been much attention paid to the agricultural sector. GoCD
together with international partners have invested significantly in the sector to promote production
and manage pests and disease.

Impact of Disaster. Lowland flooding and landslide were the principal causes of loss and damage
in the agricultural sector. Apart from crop loss and damage, some important agriculture based
operations were completely destroyed. Among these were the destruction of two rum factories
and the partial damage of a third as well as the destruction of the bay oil distillery in and the bay
leaf crop in Petite Savanne.

Other severe impacts were realized with erosion and landslides blocking interior farm-to-market
roads. As tertiary roads, they have yet to be addressed in the emergency response and await the
availability of resources once primary and secondary roads are opened to traffic. As such,
numerous farmers are either denied access to their fields and livestock or are denied access to
markets. Finally, arable lands have been destroyed either through landslide, erosion or rock and
debris deposition. The impacts of this will be most severe where individual landowners have lost

                                                                                                   41
a significant portion of their arable plot requiring them to purchase new lands or abandon
agriculture.

Financial (Damages and Losses). The total damages and losses to the Agriculture sector are
estimated to be EC$122,832,078 (US$40,789,110). Damages and losses are extensive in areas
hardest hit by flooding and landslide. As with other infrastructure sectors, this is a rapid
assessment and damages and losses are expected to climb as the hurricane season progresses.
Damages presented for this sector (Table 6) relate to the costs associated with infrastructure
damages, loss of land, livestock and are based on the requirements for their reconstruction and
rehabilitation or replacement at market value. Agricultural losses reflect the impact of Tropical
Storm Erika on the ability to realize a harvest in accordance with projected production for this
year, inability to harvest at the appropriate time and increased expenditures for land preparation
and re-treatment as required.

Agriculture Sector Recommendations.

Medium-long term actions:

      Review with ODM, coops and farming community the locations of critical facilities (e.g.
       collection and storage facilities, processing facilities etc.) to optimize locations that reduce
       vulnerability.
      Review damages to tertiary roads and explore options with Ministry of Agriculture and
       Ministry of Works to harden infrastructure and consider engaging the users in drainage and
       erosion control on a routine basis. As national resources are limited, engaging the users
       would be a logical approach to improving resilience.

Background. Within the forestry subsector, activities include forest resource management,
protected areas management, and the management and operation or natural sites and parks. With
respect to commercial forestry, there is some agro forestry but the majority of product is used
locally. Management of protected areas for habitat and watershed protection the represents the
majority of forestry activities in Dominica. As a subsector, activities within forestry maintain and
manage the ecological services provided by the natural habitats which serve other sectors
particularly drinking water through watershed management and transport through vegetative land
slope stabilization. The sub-sector contributes to tourism by providing visitor sites and trails and
manages the protection of endangered species on the island.

As a percentage of area, approximately 60% of Dominica is forested with 21.7% of the land area
relegated to protected status. This includes Morne Trois Pitons National Park which was
designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1998.

Impact of Disaster. Large landslides have taken sections of access road, tree cover, and landslide,
flooding and erosion have damaged various facilities throughout the forest/park system. Extensive
damages are evident in the following areas: Mosquito Mountain, Morne Diablotin, Carholm
Heights, Scotts Head/Soufriere, Petit Savanne, Delices, Bagatelle, Heights of Sympa/Woodford
Hill, Fond Pie, Morne Rachette, Heights of Salisbury and Colihaut, Morne Trois Pitons, Fond
Touve, Stewart Hall Water Catchment, Castle Bruce and Fond Melle. The distribution of damages
was not sufficient to impact resources on a broad ecological level and no critical ecosystems or
critical habitats have been lost.

Financial (Damages and Losses). The total damages and losses to the Forestry sector are
estimated to be EC$1,546,960 (US$575,078). Damages to forestry are primarily associated with
landslide. Landslide is the predominate source of damage and losses in the sector and with respect
to forestry is captured largely in cleanup and reforestation costs. Other loses accrue from stream
damage due to high debris accumulations and sedimentation. It is noteworthy that fishing for
crayfish is a cottage industry and has been significantly affected by changes in stream habitats.

Forestry Sector Recommendations

The Forestry Department generally manages protected areas and visitor facilities within the
protected areas system. Additionally, they have an ongoing program to manage forest reserves
and promote reforestation activities where appropriate. While landslip is an unavoidable
occurrence given the islands physiography, certain activities can contribute to the stability of land
areas and island ecological integrity.

Short Term

        Conduct an inventory of affected areas and determine whether reforestation would be
         effective as a soil stabilization measure.
        Examine associated infrastructure to determine whether storm related impacts have placed
         facilities at greater risk and develop plans to mitigate risks identified.


                                                                                                              44
      Review critical habitats for wildlife species particularly those considered endangered to
       ensure that no significant habitat disruptions have occurred.
Mid to long term

      Develop a detailed mapping of forest resources/forest cover, implementing a classification
       scheme that defines forest types based on their biological characteristics. This will provide
       a basis for informed reforestation activities that preserves the ecological characteristics of
       islands habitats and improve resilience of forest management investments.

Background. The Fisheries Subsector in Dominica is largely artisanal in nature and primarily
serves the local population. Fisher folk typically sell their catch in their local communities and
the export of fish is not a significant contribution to their revenue. About 88% of the catch is used
for personal gain either sold or consumed directly. Approximately 12% of the catch is given away.
Fishing is accomplished primarily using nets or fish traps. Boats used are typically canoe or keeled
construction types with approximately 86% of the fleet using outboard motor propulsion (with
backup oars) and approximately 6% powered by oars only.

There are about 52 communities along the coast that support fishing activities presented in Map 2.
The fisheries monitors fishing activities through 15 fisheries enumeration districts (Map 2). Based
on the 2011 fisheries census, there are approximately 749 persons identified as fishermen with
approximately 72% (539) registered with the fisheries department. Fishers and their families are
generally dependent on the subsector for their livelihood. According to the census, approximately
2,074 fisher family dependents rely on fishing for their livelihood.

The artisanal and local nature of fisheries in Dominica introduces significant vulnerabilities to the
subsector. The catch is vulnerable to spoilage, boats are small and generally of wood construction,
and sales are generally restricted to the community of residence for each of the fishers. While
sales and cost data are not available, fishing is not a major income generator. It is very likely that
the livelihoods of the majority of fisher folk are susceptible to poverty given some kind of shock.

Impact of Disaster. During storm events, the practice is generally to place boats and fishing gear
in protected bays, most of which are the mouth of a river. In the case of Tropical Storm Erika,
extreme flooding carried large volumes of debris and flood water which resulted in the destruction
of fishing craft and gear. Additionally, flood debris has created navigation hazards, and damaged
fishing gear where rocks and sediments were washed out to sea. Fishing grounds in these areas
have been covered in sediments which will alter the ecology of some fishing areas.

Financial (Damages and Losses). The total damages and losses to the Fisheries sector are
estimated to be EC$2,949,324 (US$1,096,403). With respect to the overall damages and losses
suffered on a national scale, the fisheries subsector is a very minor contributor, however owing to
the nature of the subsector, losses and damages can be catastrophic to livelihoods and families
involved. As such, the direct impacts to those involved in the sector are disproportionately severe
compared to other sectors. Losses and damages are still being tabulated at this writing however,
preliminary estimates have been provided by the Fisheries Department. These are presented in
Table 8. While damages have been tabulated, losses have not. These will be lost income and lost
opportunities due to equipment damage and changes in the fishery habitats. Additionally, long-
term losses will be incurred due to potential reductions in catch from the effect of irretrievable
fishing pots or “Ghost Pots”. Finally, losses will be incurred awaiting equipment replacement and
rehabilitation of critical infrastructure and facilities.

       impacts of Ghost Fishing.


Medium to long term Actions

      Assess and identify safe harbor locations for water craft and fishing gear when floods are
       expected and work with fisher folk to help plan to protect their assets during an event.
      Review, in light of this disaster, weaknesses in the fisheries cold-chain (e.g. ice,
       refrigerators, etc) and identify where improvements may be made to rapidly restore these
       services.

Background. The tourism sector in Dominica comprises mainly of stay-over tourists and cruise
ship arrivals. Though cruise ship arrivals outnumber stay-over visitors nearly four to one, 93% of
tourism (roughly US$ 124 million) revenue is generated by the roughly 80,000 stay-over visitors,
while only a minor amount (US$ 9 million) comes from the nearly 290 thousand cruise arrivals.
The average expenditure per stay-over visitor has been roughly US$ 1,500, while all other visitors,
the bulk of which are cruise passengers, spend roughly US$ 30 per visitor. With the island thus
being highly impacted by stay over tourism, which stays mostly in eco-type lodges, key issues are
the availability of room stock, the accessibility of the actual hotels, and the accessibility of and
availability attractions outside hotels. The cruise industry also depends heavily on attractions:
Cruise ship operators have their own arrangement in packaging excursion for passengers on the
island, and the availability of, and accessibility to, attractions are vital.

The main tourism season runs from November to April, with December and January being the
most important months, and August and September the weakest. Fortunately this gives the tourism
sector a window in time to recover the most important assets before the height of the season begins.

Impact of Disaster. The private sector reports that out of 95 hotels, 31 (33%) have reported being
affected by TS Erika, and 7 could not be reached. Of the 31 affected, 20 are nonetheless operating.
It is known that 11 hotels have ceased operating, and two additional were completely destroyed,
including the Jungle Bay Resort and Spa in the East, with 35 rooms (4th largest hotel on the island).
The net effect has been a reduction of 8% in room capacity, from 976 rooms to 900, amongst those
hotels which have been contacted. Water damage is most commonly reported, though 8 hotels
report issues with retaining walls or structural stability, two with access roads and one with
collapsed bridges. Of the operating hotels, only one in St. Patrick Parish is currently not accessible.

In addition, the storm has also affected tourist attractions. Out of the 11 dive businesses, 9 have
been affected by TS Erika, of which 7 are operational. Of 28 tour operators, 7 are reported as
affected, and 2 could not be reached or could not assess their damages yet. The usual damage was
centered on equipment and vehicles. Out of 9 major vehicle rental agencies, none have been
destroyed, however, a very high number (7) have been affected, with a number of vehicles being
flooded at Douglas-Charles Airport.

Financial (Damages and Losses). The total damages and losses to the Tourism sector are
estimated to be EC$83,891,200 (US$31,186,320). Calculations of damages are based on reports
                                                                                                    49
provided by the Discover Dominica Authority and the Dominica Hotel & Tourism Association.
Losses are calculated with visitor figures published by the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank for
2014 and 2015, with the baseline projected at an annual growth rate of 2%. Stay-over visitor
revenue is assumed to be 93% of total tourism revenue. The estimation for stay-over losses
includes 14 days of airport closure, with the expected re-opening date of Tuesday, September 15.

Tourism sector damages total around EC$52,401,200 (US$19,480,000), with hotels being hit the
hardest with EC$40,350,000 (US$15,000,000) in damages, of which the Jungle Bay Resort
accounts for slightly over EC$26,900,000 (US$ 10 million). The damages can be summarized as
follows:

      Losses                                                                                     $31,490,000

                                                                      Total Damages and Losses   $83,891,200


The effect of the damages is wider ranging. Though with a loss of an estimated 20% in tour
attractions, there is expected to be a reduction in cruise calls and visitors, lasting most likely
through December and January as capacity is being restored. In addition, access for overnight
visitors has been nearly impossible since the closure of Douglas-Charles Airport. The commercial
losses for September 2015 may reach as high as EC$9,146,000 (US$3, 400,000).

The hotel room stock has been reduced by 8% to 92% of original capacity. This capacity will not
be fully restored within a short period because of the complete destruction of one hotel. An implied
assumption, therefore, is that within the next six months hotel capacity will be restored to only
96% of pre-Erika.

In addition, the cruise industry is deeply affected by on-island attractions, which have been
estimated to have dropped to 80% of previous capacity. These attractions may also factor as areas
of demand for hotel stay-overs.

Seasonal visitor and spending figures of September 2014, grown at an annual growth rate of 2%,
were extended over 9 months as the baseline. Using these figures it can be estimated that the
operational losses facing the tourism sector will be in the EC$31,490,000 (US$11,706,320) range.

     Refers to the list provided by the Ministry of Tourism
                                                                                                               50
Cross-cutting Themes. The damage and even destruction of some hotels most likely shares the
same common themes as the housing sector overall: zoning to avoid watersheds and flood areas,
as well better construction standards. There must be a tradeoff between the physical appeal of a
site and the danger that the site thus presents. One of the impacts of the downturn in tourism will
be unemployment, with employees of the one permanently shut down hotel now finding
themselves out of work. In the case of the Jungle Bay Resort and Spa, 65 people are now out of
work.

Tourism Sector Recommendations. The storm hit the island in its slowest tourism period, so
there will be time to bring some attractions on line again before peak season. The hotel room stock
will not be up to 100%, since two properties were fully destroyed, however, 95% capacity should
be achievable.

Both stay-over tourism and cruise ship tourism depend on attractions. It would therefor appear that
a number one short-term priority, beyond making hotels and resorts usable and enjoyable, would
be to restore attractions and their accessibility as quickly as possible. This would include both
government owned and managed attractions such as trails and access to water falls, as well as
private operations such as dive centers and others.

Long term reconstruction recommendations:

      The location of hotel sites must be more carefully considered and controlled by zoning.
       The recommendation falls in line with the issues facing the housing sector overall.
      Similar to the housing sector, building construction standards may need to be improved.
      Dominica is an island facing several natural disaster risks, including volcanic eruption.
       Emergency preparedness and planning is therefore essential. This would suggest the need
       for a comprehensive plan for evacuation of hotels, tailored to the uniqueness of each
       property’s location.

Impact of Disaster
The Ministry of Commerce together with the Ministry of Trade collaborated to get an appreciation
of the extent of damage experienced by the commercial sector – particularly companies engaged
in the export trade. Dominica has 71 businesses engaged in the export trade, with only 5 businesses
indicating negative impact from the tropical storm.

Damage and Losses
Commerce. The Ministry of Commerce conducted a rapid assessment analysis of commercial
sector players, the main findings are:
   -   34.5% or 19 of the targeted businesses with a combined employment of over 1,000
       employees were directly impacted, resulting in damage and losses amounting to
       EC$24,151.268.75 after the passage of the storm.
   -   25% or 14 assessed businesses reported damages to their premises in the amount of
       $9,201,400
   -   16% or 9 of the assessed businesses reported stock damage of $5,263,625.01
   -   3 businesses reported damage to office furniture in the amount of $468,439

Industry. The island’s sole bay oil manufacturing facility was completely destroyed, while the
two main rum producers: Belfast Estates Ltd. and Shillingford Estates Ltd sustained damages to
property, furniture, equipment, loss of stock, and loss of sales, totaling EC$1,600,000 and
EC$5,030,268.72 respectively. Data from other businesses and factories was not available to be
included in this Report.
Recommendations
Short Term
      Coordinate recovery planning with the private sector (industry) with a view to create jobs.
      Promote the dissemination of hazard maps and risk analysis with small and medium
       enterprises to create awareness of hazard risk and preparedness planning

Long Term
      Promote the updating the “business continuity plans” in the factories.
      Review hazard insurance options for small and medium enterprises.

Background. The Government of Dominica places high priority on the education sector, with the
major thrust during the last decade being directed towards the universalisation of the access to
secondary level education. The figure for total recurrent expenditure on education for 2013/2014
was ECD$59,748,346 (USD$2,300,000) being 16.1% of overall national recurrent expenditure for
that year. Through a school bus service, school feeding programme, school books rental, an
educational loan programme together amongst other initiatives, the government has focused
support towards students from the lower socio-economic groups to continue their education. The
Education Act 11 of 1997 governs the education system and mandates compulsory education for
all children between the ages of 5-16. According to the Education Digest prepared by the Ministry
of Education and Human Resource Development covering the academic year 2013/2014, there
were 60 primary schools and 15 secondary schools administratively divided into 4 geographic
zones. Also included are 73 pre-schools (many housed within primary schools) and 1 tertiary
education institution that fall under the responsibility of the ministry. Prior to Erika school drop-
out rates were at 0.25% of those enrolled at the primary level and 6.6% of those enrolled at the
secondary level. Graduation rate at the secondary level for 2014 was 79.2% (61% passing five or
more subjects at CSEC the Regional Exam Board certification qualification) with the balance
expected to repeat their final year. With 23 schools impacted, 13 damaged including 2 totally
destroyed, and the start of the 2015/2016 school year delayed, the gains achieved in previous years
are under significant risk.

Impact of Disaster. With the sudden, unexpected impact of Tropical Storm Erika, the education
sector took a direct hit, seriously affecting the vast majority of Dominica's primary, secondary
schools as well as community recreational facilities. Of 75 schools, 23 have been directly impacted
of which 13 experienced structural damage including 2 totally destroyed, spread between 8
parishes. It is estimated that approximately 3,420 primary and secondary children have been
directly affected out of a total school population of 7,695 primary and 5,561 secondary students.
The original school opening date of 1st September 2015 has been pushed back to 14th September
2015 but only for schools that were not damaged, used as shelters and have water supply
(approximately 60% of schools).

Three schools are currently being used as shelters with seven community recreational areas having
been damaged, with a further community recreational area used as a temporary helicopter landing
                                                                                                   53
site and for storage of emergency response equipment. Beyond the initial trauma caused to the
school population and damage to infrastructure caused by Erika, the longer term disruption to the
education system and preparation schedules for children’s performance within national and
regional curricula, will be significant while not easily quantifiable in financial terms.

Financial (Damages and Losses). The total damages and losses to the Education sector are
estimated to be EC$10,747,895 (US$3,995,500). Repairs, rehabilitation and rebuilding costs have
been estimated at USD$3,435,000 with non-structural repair costs estimated at USD$465,500. The
below table summarises the quantifiable losses experienced by Dominica’s education system due
to Erika. What though is less quantifiable at this stage are the costs caused by the disruption of
the educational year for individual students and the nation as a whole.

While initial damage and loss assessments to rehabilitate, reconstruct and re-open the most
affected schools have been undertaken, an in-depth systematic study needs to be designed and
implemented with a fundamental objective to “Build Back Better” (BBB). Prior to this though,
the priority is to re-commence education for all of Dominica’s children with the key actions being
to deep clean all affected schools to adequate hygienic standards, provision of water tanks with
regular supply for schools still without, and re-equip schools with education materials including
furniture which was lost during the extensive flooding. Essential psychosocial support outreach
programmes for traumatised children (“Return to Happiness” initiative), who in some cases lost
family members and witnessed the destruction of their homes, have already begun and need to be
sustained. Children also need to be provided with necessary school gear and back-to-school kits
to support their speedy return to normal school routines. Students enrolled at damaged and
destroyed schools will need to be transported to other schools on a temporary basis where shift
systems will need to be implemented to enable as many children as possible to continue their
education. The non-structural costs outlined above including training for teachers and NGO
partners along with the required capacity development for the implementation of existing
education sector preparedness and response plans such as “Return to Happiness”, have an
estimated cost of EC$1,250,850 (US$465,000).

Cross-Cutting Themes. Most teachers in Dominica are women with a figure of 87% in primary
and 73% in secondary. There will not be a significant loss of jobs or income due to the delay in
opening because the Ministry will continue to pay salaries and has organized for a shift-school
system for the majority of those schools that cannot be opened as yet or have been destroyed. Also
the Ministry attempted to support teacher placement at schools close to their homes or identified
needs as much as possible. While this was possible prior to Erika, the damage caused to the road
network and disruption to transportation services, will have had a significantly negative effect on
this. A recommendation is to cost the viability of distance learning options, but this is heavily
dependent on the telecommunications capacity which took a big hit with many cables carrying
telephone and internet across the island brought down by landslides. With schools being used as
                                                                                                55
shelters, Build Back Better methodologies should include structural capacity to allow for ease of
gender segregation for washroom and sanitation facilities that ensure adequate facility provision
in safe environments. Climate change will cause more events such as Erika, therefore education
sector planning needs to fully mesh with the social protection sector to ensure safe environments
for children and women in Disaster Risk Management preparedness methodologies that lead to
effective response mechanisms.

Education Sector Recommendations. The key objective for the reconstruction of the education
sector is to enable children to recommence their education in safe and supportive environments at
the earliest opportunity. This must be facilitated through support to the Ministry of Education and
the Ministry of Social Services, Family and Gender Affairs to implement an effective response
and recovery programme for both the education and child protection sectors. Mobilisation of funds
for critical immediate actions such as cleaning, re-location, pyscho-social support, re-equipping
and safe water provision must be facilitated through the re-allocation of existing funds in the
education sector and emergency response interventions covered under preparedness plans within
collaborative partnerships with agencies such as UNICEF and local and international NGOs.
Medium and longer term interventions including reconstruction and structural rehabilitation
including Build Back Better, will require significant resource mobilisation in collaboration with
the donor community.

Short Term Priority Actions:

          Identify alternative locations for students enrolled at the 2 destroyed and 5 schools in
           which structural damage prevents commencement of education in safe hygienic
           environments for an extended period. Provide transportation for students and teachers
           to access alternative sites, in addition to provision of school meals for children in
           schools far from their homes

          Provide water tanks, cast concrete stands and pipe fittings to enable storage and
           provision of adequate volumes of safe water to the 23 schools that have their normal
           piped water supply disrupted.

          Provide appropriate basic education, early learning and recreational materials for
           displaced schools and all those which had lost materials due to flood damage; including
           special measures for children needing help to re-engage in education.

          For the 23 impacted schools, ensure all buildings and immediate compounds have been
           completely cleared of debris and silt, and have been thoroughly cleaned and
           disinfected. For the 3 schools used as shelters, monitor the environmental and hygienic
           status of buildings and compounds, and ensure plans in place to enable commencement
           of education rapidly once evacuees leave.

          Work with Child Protection to address violence in and around learning spaces and
           schools, especially the 3 currently used as shelters, with a focus on the most vulnerable
                                                                                                 56
         Take an inter-sectoral approach to the provision of support in temporary learning
          spaces and child-friendly spaces by mobilizing available psychosocial support for
          teachers and students through the ‘Return to Happiness’ programme

         Assess the extent to which teachers have been affected – and categorise the loss among
          the 165 teachers so far identified – and make specific efforts to ensure their full
          ‘rehabilitation’ to be able to effectively carry out their duties

         Conduct comprehensive condition assessment of schools in affected areas including
          risk assessments relating to flood and landslide risks

         Conduct comprehensive water shed studies to provide enhanced information on risk
          profiles for schools

Medium-term response and long term recovery:

         Ensure that the rehabilitation and reconstruction of schools and recreational facilities
          are in accordance with established standards for child-friendly and structurally resilient
          designs- “Build Back Better”.

         Integrate immediate emergency response with long-term vision and recovery planning
          within the education system

         Consider river engineering works to reduce flood risk exposure of schools at risk

         Advocate for and support the redevelopment of schools according to safe, inclusive,
          equitable and child-friendly models including bathing and washing facilities for those
          likely to be used as shelters.

         Build capacity of the education cluster for better response, including coordination of
          support to education sector as this has been shown that the existing capacity is not
          sufficient to move with the necessary speed to coordinate efficient response.

Background. Government health care services are delivered through a network of 50 primary
health care facilities and one secondary health care facility – the Princess Margaret Hospital, based
in the capital, Roseau. Through these facilities the entire population gains access to basic health
care services such as immunization, pre-natal and childcare as well as management of non-
communicable diseases. Public health services such as water quality monitoring and the
monitoring of solid and liquid waste in the community are also delivered through the Type 3
facilities which serve as the administrative centres for the seven health districts. When Tropical
Storm Erika impacted Dominica in the early hours of August 27, 2015 several health care facilities
were affected either directly through flooding or as a result of being isolated from the rest of the
country through road blocks from landslides, roadways being damaged or bridges being washed
away. The Ministry of Health set up its Emergency Operations Center – the Health EOC, in order
to organize, coordinate and inform on its response to the event. Information from the Health EOC
also informed policy makers so that appropriate emergency actions could be taken where health
matters were concerned.

Impact of Disaster. Nine of the primary health care facilities were impacted by flooding and as a
result were not operational for at least two days. Two of the facilities that were flooded also
suffered minor damage to structure and damage to fencing. Some equipment loss was recorded
including weighing equipment, step down transformers, etc. A number of the facilities were not
accessible from the outside by roads. It must also be noted that contact by cellular or landline
phones was not possible for some time and information on status of facilities was not available. In
the immediate aftermath several patients were airlifted to the Princess Margaret Hospital since
access was not possible by road. Fractures were the most common type of injury and other
conditions included acute abdomen trauma, eye trauma, psychological trauma & pregnancy.

This event has highlighted that some health facilities are vulnerable to flooding which means that
at the time of a similar event when they are most needed are not operational. The drainage at the
Roseau and Fond Cole Health Centers must be addressed to reduce the risk. A hydrological survey
must be carried out on the water courses that are close to our health facilities. This will guide us
on the mitigation measures that will be required for facilities including Coulibistrie, Pichelin,
Massacre, Dublanc, etc. Facilities such as Mahaut and Newtown must be relocated. Water of all
facilities must be increased and improved as a matter of urgency. Also important to the
Vulnerability Reduction Strategy, accessibility immediately after the event and the focus on Build
Back Better, many of the facilities must now be equipped with standby generators, increased
                                                                                                   58
storage capacity (some climate controlled –Refrigeration) in order to increase the quantity of
supplies there.

The prevention of outbreaks is a major area for maintenance of health care services with massive
efforts needed in health education especially for the prevention of water-borne diseases such as
gastroenteritis. Vector-borne diseases such as dengue and leptospirosis are major concerns and
enhanced efforts on vector control as well as solid and liquid waste disposal are critical for
minimizing the health impact of this weather event. While many of these prevention efforts are
planned at central level, implementation at the local level through the primary health care system
is critical to success.

Financial (Damages and Losses). The total damages and losses to the Health Sector are
estimated to be EC$5,229,682 (US$1,944,120). The summary table below provides a breakdown

Cross-cutting Themes. The link between poverty and health is well recognized – poverty is
associated with poor health outcomes. It is therefore important that high quality primary health
care services remain accessible and affordable for all Dominicans. A key step in this direction is
the reconstruction of all facilities that have been damaged or lost in locations that make the
facilities readily accessible. This will include health facilities for the residents of Petite Savanne
who have been evacuated from their village and will be relocated to a new site.

            Environmental: The location and construction of health facilities should be such that
             negative impact on the environment will be minimal while providing safe,
             ergonomically sound environment for staff and patients. This should include the
                                                                                                   59
            harvesting of rain water to minimize run-off, and establish redundant water supply,
            use of green energy and the safe management of solid and liquid waste generated by
            the facility.
           Risk Reduction/climate adaptation: A review of all health care facilities needs to be
            untaken to assess their vulnerability to natural disasters – hurricanes and floods in
            particular. Design and re-design needs to minimize the impact from these events and
            allow for the continued functioning of the facility as soon as possible following the
            event.
           Others: Communication system is one major area for improvement for the health
            sector. Following this weather event there was no communication with some health
            facilities for several hours and even days. Initial communications were via social
            media which evolved into a major means for communication. Equipping facilities
            with radios and the provision of the appropriate training will be key.


Health Sector Recommendations

As stated earlier, recommendations for reconstruction will focus on reducing vulnerability,
increasing accessibility immediately after the event and, ‘build back better’ i.e ensuring that
facilities that are reconstructed are done to standards that exceed what existed prior to TS Erika.
Therefore the following actions must be considered as part of an appropriate response.

Short-term Actions:

          Install additional Water tanks to ensure at least 3 days of water storage capacity to
           continue services at the facility.
          Provide standby Generators and at least 3 days fuel storage capacity, protected against
           floodwaters.
          Refrigeration Equipment for vaccines and other medicines.
          Assessment of all electrical wiring at flooded facilities and the replacement of any
           damaged wiring, electrical outlets and fixtures.
          Replacement of damaged external doors to the facilities with solid wooden or steel
           doors connected with 3 hinges per door.

Medium-term actions:

          Retaining walls, with suitable drainage behind walls, to help mitigate failure of unstable
           soils and slopes around the perimeter of the health facilities
          Installation of storm water drainage and adequate storage capacity or detention ponds
           to channel rainfall runoff away from health facilities and foundations of the buildings.
           The detention ponds will serve to control the flow of runoff to prevent excessive
           erosion and flooding downstream.



                                                                                                  60
          Stabilise and secure access road to health facilities by using concrete paved access
           ramps and roads instead of asphalt, which bleeds and pits with excessive rainfall;
           grading slopes for proper rainfall runoff and installing appropriate drainage.
          Installation of rainwater roof catchment system. This should include gutters, downpipes
           and water tanks to capture rainfall off roof. This will serve to provide water to the health
           facility in the event that water lines are broken and national pipe-borne water supply is
           in future floods.

Long-term actions:

          Relocation of some facilities such as Mahaut and Newtown health centres away from
           the high risk flood zones in which they are currently located.
          Upgrade of the Marigot and Portsmouth Hospitals to strengthen the resilience of these
           facilities against future hazards including floods, hurricanes. Strengthening of the roof
           and external windows and doors, as well as the boundary fences and installation of
           retaining walls. Soil and slope stabilization may also be required, which may include,
           but not be limited to the use of soil anchors and installation of geotextiles. In certain
           select locations, flood barriers may also be required to prevent ingress of waters into
           these facilities.

Background. According to Dominica’s 2011 Population and Housing Census Report, the total
population of Dominica numbered 71,293. The total population comprises 36,411 males and
34,882 living in 26,085 households. Dwelling units are built mainly of wood, concrete, a
combination of wood and concrete, or plywood. It is estimated that that 7,229 persons are affected
in the disaster declared areas. As of September 6, 2015, the following housing related impact has
been confirmed by CDEMA: Homeless: 574; Evacuated: 713; Provided with shelter: 411.

Impact of Disaster. The preliminary assessment of housing stock was conducted by the Ministry
of Housing in conjunction with Local Government and has initially concentrated on the Disaster
Areas of 1. Bath Estate (Paradise Valley) 2. Dubique 3. Petite Savanne 4. Campbell 5. Coulibistrie
6. Pichelin 7. Petite Soufriere 8. Good Hope 9. San Sauveur where the highest concentration of
impact per housing stock has been confirmed. An island-wide rapid assessment is still ongoing
although hampered by access to professional engineering services to conduct thorough landslide
risk assessments, flood risk assessments as well as structural impact assessments.

Financial (Damages and Losses). The total damages and losses to the Housing sector are
estimated to be EC$145,659,315 (US$54,148,444). The total damage to the housing stock is
estimated to be EC$119,799,000 (US$$44,534,944). Losses for cost of demolition and rubble
removal and a temporary housing scheme are estimated at EC$$25,860,315 (US$9,613,500). As
of September 6, 2015, the preliminary damage assessment of the Housing Stock indicates that 430
houses damaged or destroyed of which the majority are in Petite Savanne and the remainder across
the country. Considering that the entire housing stock has not been assessed by professional
structural engineers, it is estimated that the number of destroyed houses is very likely to increase.
Therefore, a number of 478 houses is anticipated for this rapid damage and loss assessment with a
write-off value of EC$95,700,000 reconstruction cost.

In addition to the confirmed damages, a significant number of houses are considered to be unsafe
for continued habitation. These are primarily located in the disaster Areas but will also include
housing stock across the country. The exact number of houses unsafe for returning inhabitants
needs to be assessed by risk management specialists with particular focus on flood risk assessment
and landslide risk assessments. For this rapid damage and loss assessment, it is considered that ca.
87 houses are at risk. This would constitute a write-off value of EC$17,400,000 (reconstruction
cost).
                                                                                                   62
A permanent resettlement programme for destroyed and “at risk” housing units is estimated to cost
EC$143,996,004 including a Build Back Better component. This estimate includes land
acquisition, access and utilities connection.

If a relocation program is implemented with government assistance, it should make use of a
standard housing design in low risk areas for landslides and flooding and should incorporate
disaster-resilient features (e.g., hurricane-resistant roofing, seismic resistance, adequate height
from the ground, etc.) and a minimum architectural layout based on family size to produce a livable
home.

Housing Sector Recommendations

Short-term actions

          Develop a strategy for addressing the loss of housing stock whilst considering options
           for implementing a temporary housing programme for homeless people and people
           currently residing in shelters
          Develop and conduct a Building Assessment Programme to develop a prioritized
           approach to Building Back Better new Housing stock
          Develop a building programme and financing strategy for replenishing the diminished
           housing stock
          Enhance sex and age disaggregated data for HOH who have lost houses in order to
           inform relocation lists;
          Identify houses that were rented vs mortgaged.
          Conduct comprehensive condition assessment of housing stock in affected areas
           including risk assessments relating to flood and landslide risks
          Conduct comprehensive water shed studies to provide enhanced information on risk
           profiles for housing stock


Medium-term actions

          Consider options and implement a temporary housing programme for people who were
           evacuated from the disaster areas or lost their home due to storm impact and found
           refuge with families in non-affected areas.
          Consider river engineering works to reduce flood risk exposure of housing stock at
           risk
          Develop a risk-based approach to housing and residential/urban planning based on best
           practice building asset management principles (building inventories, condition
           assessments, inspection programmes, building permitting, etc)
          Adopt and enforce building code for Dominica that adequately addresses requirements
           for resilient housing for hurricanes, flood and landslide risks.
          Commence with the implementation of a building programme to replenish the housing
           stock
Long-term actions

          Implement a long term asset maintenance strategy and system for existing and new
           houses and buildings if they remain in public ownership
          Engage women and youth in non-traditional rebuilding relocation efforts through
           training programmes linked to social protection (see social protection section).

CHAPTER FOUR – THE MACROECONOMIC IMPACT

THE MACROECONOMIC IMPACT

Summary of Economic Damage

Based upon an initial assessment of impacts to each affected sector, Tropical Storm Erika resulted
in total damage and loss of EC$1.30 billion (US$483 million), equivalent to over 90 percent of
Dominica’s gross domestic product (GDP).12 The majority of damages and losses were sustained
in the transport sector (60 percent), followed by the housing sector (11 percent) and agriculture,
fisheries, and forest (10 percent), as summarized in Tables 1 and 2 and explained in the preceding
sections. Damages and losses are also the equivalent of 270 percent of 2014’s exports, 195 percent
of imports, and 615 percent of gross fixed capital formation. Damages to durable assets alone total
more than five years of normal investment spending. Expected impact on 2015 and 2016 GDP is
more modest, since reconstruction activities will make up for lost economic activity due to the TS.
For 2015, instead of GDP growth of about two percent, the net impact of economic losses and
recovery is estimated to support growth at 2.6 percent. For 2016, the same estimation approach
yields GDP growth reflecting a strong and rapid recovery, although dependent on financing
availability and sufficient absorptive capacity, such that growth could easily exceed eight percent.
As reconstruction begins to wane (in 18 months to 2 years), GDP is likely to return to a somewhat
lower path than before the disaster. These figures highlight the challenges facing public finances
and the external sector.


The Situation Before the Storm

With a gross national income per capita of US$10,30013, Dominica is an upper-middle-income
small island state, with an estimated population of 72,340. In 2014, Dominica registered strong
growth, following a more modest expansion in 2013 (undermined by a previous tropical storm).
Growth projections for 2015 before TS Erika were around two percent.14

Growth and Inflation. There was a return to growth and improvement in external conditions in
2014. Economic activity expanded by an estimated four percent in 2014, according to government
figures, spurred by growth in public administration, education, wholesale and retail trade, and
construction following the tropical storm that devastated the country in December 2013. The
expansion was bolstered also by recovery of the tourism sector, which has been hampered by
insufficient infrastructure and petty crime in recent years. Carnival stay-overs increased by 30

percent, and the World Music Creole Festival achieved year-on-year attendance growth of 8.3
percent from the US and 7.3 percent from the UK. However, agricultural production fell because
of the prolonged adverse effects of the Black Sigatoka disease, which eradicated half the country’s
banana production between 2011 and 2013 and led to a suspension of Dominican banana exports
to the UK, a major market for the fruit. Consumer prices rose modestly, by 1.8 percent during
2014, reflecting a slight increase in fuel prices before the sharp declines in international oil prices
during the last quarter of the year.

Fiscal Account and Debt. The fiscal deficit is estimated to have improved in FY 2013/2014, with
the primary balance standing at about one percent of GDP. This improvement was secured despite
the phase-out of budgetary support from the European Union (EU) and was partly driven by the
continued non-tax revenues from the Economic Citizenship Program. Despite a draw-down of
central government deposits in the banking system, net public debt declined to 65 percent of GDP
in FY2013/2014, about four percentage points lower than the previous year. These patterns
continued into the subsequent fiscal year of FY 2014/15, especially on the expenditure side.
However, tax revenues and revenues from the sale of assets dipped, and revenue overall came in
about five percent lower. The resulting primary balance was 3.4 percent of GDP, and public debt
rose to 68 percent of GDP.

Money and Financial Sector Developments. NPLs increased to 13.9 percent of loans outstanding
in December 2013, but this ratio remains below the ECCU average of 18.3 percent. Credit growth
to the private sector continued to decline, by 0.9 percent from January to October 2014, following
a year-on- year contraction of 0.7 percent in 2013.

External Sector. The current account deficit remained constant in 2014, at about 13 percent of
GDP, driven principally by lower oil and commodity prices which offset imports related to FDI.
The current account deficit was financed mostly from FDI inflows and capital grants, which
accounted for 5.7 percent and 4.5 percent of GDP, respectively, in 2014. Dominica’s point-to-
point REER appreciated by 5.8 percent to 98.2 at end-December 2014.

Outlook for 2015 and 2016 prior to TS Erika. Even before the Tropical Storm of August 2015, the
economic outlook for Dominica was mixed. GDP growth was projected at 2.0 to 2.5 percent for
2015. A recovery of the tourism sector was expected, to be supported by the recent increase in the
availability of hotel space, the accommodation of night landings at the Douglas Charles airport,
the increased capacity of up to 15,000 seats per year via Winair, and the ECP mandate to attract
investments in tourism-related infrastructure. Growth over the medium-term was also expected to
be bolstered by the completion in 2016 of a geothermal electricity plant, which was expected to
reduce electricity costs by 40 percent and reduce Dominica’s high fuel import bill. The agricultural
sector was projected to continue to decline by about 1 percent per year, as plans to replace the
banana plants infected by fungal disease with French imports and effect improvements in irrigation
systems will not show benefits soon. The Ministry of Agriculture intends also to explore the
prospects of other commodities, such as white potatoes, and farm tourism. Inflation is projected to
increase only slightly, to 1.3 percent by 2017, due to a gradual recovery in primary commodity
                                                                                                    66
prices. The fiscal deficit is projected to remain steady over the next three years. Nevertheless,
financing was expected to be adequate to support investments planned at the time, particularly in
the tourism and mining sectors. Public debt was expected to remain around 75 percent of GDP.
The current account deficit was projected to rise from a projected 13 percent of GDP in 2015 for
the next few years, as FDI-linked imports were projected to jump, but then to moderate in later
years, in part due to reduced fuel imports as a result of the geothermal initiative. The major risk
facing the economic outlook was seen as the uncertain pace of recovery in the agricultural sector
from the devastating effects of the Sigatoka disease and the tropical storm of 2013. In addition,
maintaining fiscal discipline was seen as an ongoing priority. FDI inflows associated with mining,
ongoing hotel projects, and the creation of executive office space were expected to continue to be
a major source of financing.


Projections of the Impact of TS Erika on Macroeconomic Variables

This assessment of the macroeconomic effects of Tropical Storm Erika on Dominica’s economic
performance for 2015 and following years makes use of the damage and loss assessment completed
for sectors and summarized above. The analysis aims to address the questions of how the losses
created by the TS will affect the economy and how much money the government needs to finance
reconstruction costs and how quickly such financing can be obtained within the framework of
sustainable fiscal policy. It focuses on the impact on growth, the fiscal deficit and public debt, and
the current account deficit. Because of multiple sources of uncertainty, scenarios are presented to
allow for differing assumptions about the economy’s capacity to absorb external resources and its
project delivery capacity. Considering multiple scenarios is one way to proceed with such an
assessment despite the lack of data on economic activity after the TS. This assessment can and
should be updated as new economic data is reported.

As discussed in detail above, Tropical Storm Erika brought flash flooding and landslides to
Dominica, affecting most parts of the island. Roads, housing, and the tourism sector suffered the
most harm in terms of losses and disruptions to normal economic activity while roads, housing,
and agriculture are assessed to have suffered the most damage to physical assets. Tourist arrivals
will drop quickly, since the tourist season is imminent, but if reconstruction is timely, tourism
should return to close to pre-disaster levels by the winter of 2016/17. Cruise ship arrivals should
follow the same path as tourism overall.

Output Impacts of Losses. The estimates of losses that emerged from the sector assessments are
incorporated into projections of GDP (see Table 13 and Table 14). The pattern of expected lost
activity (or additional recovery activity) over time was calculated, and import content was
estimated and omitted from GDP (so that the losses, which are more closely related to output
would more closely resemble value-added).15 Real GDP growth for 2015 is projected to increase

15
  Because no input-output table was available and because this assessment is a rapid exercise, the exact sectors
that will benefit or lose from losses registered in a single sector is not exact. In particular, much of the repair and
                                                                                                                          67
by a further 80 basis points over the pre-TS forecast of 1.9 percent. Hotels and trade are hit hard
by the temporary drop in tourism. Growth for 2016 is projected to rebound sharply as losses
(negative flows) recede and positive flows continue, in particular clean-up activities.

Fiscal Impact of Losses. Far more problematic that the impact of losses on Dominica’s output and
income are their likely fiscal impacts. Dominica was already facing fiscal challenges before the
disaster imposed even greater pressures on government spending. The government was
considering various fiscal adjustment possibilities sufficient to attain a debt target of 60 percent of
GDP by 2030. Adjustment on both revenues and current expenditures would be needed, while
preserving needed infrastructure spending. Such a path had little leeway to address the aftermath
of a disaster. Even a conservative estimate of the impact of losses on fiscal variables pushes the
overall deficit above nine percent of GDP in FY15/16. These impacts come from the additional
public expenditure necessary for activities such as cleanup, emergency repairs, temporary shelter,
and treatment of the sick and injured. Rebuilding physical assets (damages) are not included and
are addressed below.



cleanup activity may be properly recorded in the construction sector, while here it is noted in the original sector of
impact as recovery activities in that sector.

Economic Impact of Damages. The second and larger impact of TS Erika was damages to physical
assets that were partially or fully destroyed. The total damages across sectors was estimated at
EC$1,213 million or more than six years of normal investment spending. These damages were
concentrated in roads and bridges, and the public sector bears the responsibility for repair and
rebuilding. Recovery in transport is, of course, a precondition for the recovery of the economy
overall. Overall, about 80 percent of the damages to capital will fall to the public sector for
recovery. If all damaged or destroyed assets were replaced or rebuilt, including recommended
improvements, and all assets for which the government is responsible were financed by debt, the
costs would double Dominica’s public debt, already at 70 percent of GDP in FY2014/15, to more
than 160 percent of GDP in FY2015/16. This debt already carries a low interest rate. Thus, the
pace of recovery will need to be modulated to access to grant financing and a modest amount of
highly-concessional debt so as to maintain macroeconomic stability over the next few years.

Fiscal and Debt Scenarios. To understand better the constraints facing the government in financing
disaster recovery, three scenarios are applied. The first scenario assumes that no additional grant
financing becomes available and that the ratio of public debt to GDP cannot exceed 100. At this
pace of financing, after five years, about half of the damages to assets have been covered. The
second scenario assumes USD25 million in grants for the next three years and that public debt to
GDP does not exceed 100. In this case, about 70 percent of damages are financed after five years.
The third scenario assumes USD100 million in grants for the next three years. Under this final
scenario, the needed financing for damage recovery is covered by the end of FY 2017/18.

New Public Borrowing. While desirable, obtaining financing in the form of grants to cover 100
percent of reconstruction needs may not be feasible. The scenarios above, it should be noted, do
include new borrowing: all three scenarios include new loans of USD 140 million in FY 2015/16
followed by new borrowing of USD 20 to 30 million per year in subsequent years. It must be noted
that these calculations consider only broad parameters regarding public borrowing, and the impacts
of adding financing at concessional terms (in particular, IDA) on the debt profile of the country
will need to be assessed more thoroughly using the IMF's DSA framework.

CHAPTER FIVE – CROSS CUTTING THEMES

SOCIAL PROTECTION

Thirteen percent (13%) of households (28) in Petite Savanne were on some form of public
assistance. Information regarding the number of households in Dubique on public assistance is
not available because it is aggregated with a neighbouring community.

There are nine different social protection programmes in Dominica. These include the Yes We
Care Programme for Seniors and Persons with Disabilities, Public (Cash) Assistance National
Employment Programme, Housing Revolution, Home Renovation And Sanitation Programme,
Adult Education (Community-Based Vocational Skills Training; Literacy And Numeracy;
Continuing Education Programmes), Small Business Unit Fund Bureau Of Gender Affairs Small
Business Revolving Loan Fund, Dominica Youth Business Trust Fund, and Youth Development
Division Skills Training Program. These programmes allow for housing support to single mothers,
cash transfers for eligible persons, support to elderly persons and the disabled, and youth training
programmes.

Prior to TS Erika challenges were highlighted regarding the need for additional cash to support the
programmes, the lack of a CBR, and the lack of a gender and child responsive approach these will
be exacerbated in the aftermath of TS Erika, as more persons will be in need of social protection.
Social protection analysis and reform in the wake of TS Erika to meet the needs of the population
will be required. This should include an impact assessment on National Employment Programme
support to ensure equal opportunities for women and men, a Gender Aware Beneficiary Analysis
and a Costing and Budgeting Framework.

Social Protection Recommendations:

Immediate Actions:

          Track vulnerable groups such as affected single women headed households, children,
           pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, young men, disabled people, and the elderly
           to better understand their increased risks and vulnerabilities and how further risks can
           be mitigated.
          Ensure measures are put in place to identify vulnerable persons who need to benefit
           from social protection, additional psychosocial support, and medical care
Medium and Long-term Actions:

          Complete assessment through GABA and CBF of key social protection programmes to
           support the recovery process in a gender and child responsive manner.
          Develop Central Beneficiary Registry.
          Develop job training and continuing education programmes linked to already
           functioning social protection programmes such as the Adult Education (Community-
                                                                                                 72
           Based Vocational Skills Training; Literacy and Numeracy; Continuing Education
           Programmes), Small Business Unit Fund, Bureau of Gender Affairs, Small Business
           Revolving Loan Fund, Dominica Youth Business Trust Fund, and Youth Development
           Division Skills Training Program.
GENDER INCLUSION

Disaster impacts are often not distributed uniformly within a population. Due to existing socio-
economic conditions, cultural beliefs and traditional practices, women face disproportionate risks.
In many cases, the mortality rates for women in the aftermath of a disaster are much higher than
those of men.

In the case of Dominica, according to the preliminary 2011 Population Census report, the country’s
population stood at 71,293 comprising of 36,411 males and 34,882 females. Dominica has a
growing young population with children below 14 years accounting for slightly more than a quarter
of the population, and approximately 41.9% of the population comprising children and youth
below 25 years. The elderly population (60 years and above) in Dominica accounted for 14.8%,
the majority of this population is female.

While steps have been taken to promote gender equality and women’s empowerment in Dominica,
there remain significant challenges. Women, children and youth are among the most vulnerable
groups. Poverty assessments indicate that more than half of Dominica's children and youth live in
poor households (52.1%). Tropical storm Erika caused widespread damage to the housing sector,
which has a direct bearing on gender equality and social inclusion. Ownership rights and land
titling variations among men and women could limit participation in the housing recovery
programme and the benefits accruing from them. Housing losses as a result of TS Erika will also
impact men and women’s livelihoods because of the loss of potential income experienced by many
of the displaced due to home-based livelihood activities, such as home-based businesses
(hairdressing and other shops) and/or those who practiced commercial and subsistence farming in
the spaces directly around their homes, which is the majority of the population of one of the hardest
hit communities, Petite Savanne.

The recovery stage in the aftermath of a disaster offers an opportunity to engage women, men and
youth in better and more innovative ways, which is important because disasters affect women, men
and children differently. Factoring in gender issues into recovery and reconstruction efforts can
make a difference through participation and empowerment in the planning, decision-making and
implementation processes. Failure to consider both women’s and men’s concerns in the design and
implementation of DRM programs are likely to lead to overlooking the true costs of disasters and
making DRM support less effective. Gender-blind responses can also reinforce, perpetuate and
increase existing gender inequalities, making bad situations worse for women and other vulnerable
groups.


                                                                                                  73
A comprehensive assessment of gender considerations to be factored into the recovery phase has
been prepared by UN Women, which includes detailed recommendations by sector. Below are
some of the key recommendations:

Short term Actions:

          Ensure that any additional data collected is sex and age disaggregated and also ensure
           the inclusion of gender-sensitive indicators.
          Create opportunities to involve more women and youth, women’s organisations, state
           gender focal points, and other organizations working on gender issues as partners in
           the recovery work to act as agents of change. These groups can take leadership roles in
           disaster assessment and management, for example in designing livelihood recovery
           programs and/or determining housing reconstruction priorities.
Medium to Long-term Actions:

          Build on and implement the multi-sectoral Gender and Child Responsive
           considerations within the Strategic Program on Climate Resilience (SPCR) and the
           Low Carbon Climate Resilient Development Strategy
          Examine and apply, as appropriate, the considerations for mainstreaming gender
           considerations in DRM being developed by CDEMA and other regional stakeholders




                                                                                               74
CHAPTER SIX – RECOVERY, RECONSTRUCTION AND RISK
REDUCTION RECOMMENDATIONS


The devastating human and economic losses caused by Tropical Storm Erika have highlighted
Dominica’s vulnerability to hydro-meteorological and climate hazards. Restoration of lifeline
facilities and basic services requires immediate decisions and investments of both public and
private sectors to pursue rapid recovery. At the same time, the aftermath of the disaster offers the
country a window of opportunity to utilize disaster and climate resilience as a pillar of Dominica’s
sustainable development strategy.

The government is acutely aware of the country’s exposure to natural disaster events and impacts
of climate change. Dominica has adopted its Low Carbon Climate Resilient Development Strategy,
which includes the country-driven Strategic Program for Climate Resilience (SPCR)16 and
provides an overview of the country’s climate change circumstances and its development context;
it also identifies climate change vulnerabilities in key sectors, including agriculture, ecosystems,
and natural resource systems, and to some extent, the infrastructure sector. As part of this strategy,
key elements of disaster risk reduction and climate resilience across sectors have been identified.

The challenge for the country now is to continue to implement these strategies in view of the urgent
recovery and reconstruction priorities: to promote resilience in both reconstruction programs as
well as longer term development efforts. The post-disaster context also provides Dominica with
the space for the operationalization of the resilience principles, policy scope and strategies
embedded in the CARICOM endorsed Comprehensive Disaster Management Strategy (CDM)
2014, and the Regional Framework for Achieving Development Resilient to Climate (2009 and
after).

The urgency for considering resilience as a central element of development planning is supported
by International Development Partners within the framework of “Resilient Champions Group”
comprising high level representatives from the World Bank, EC, DFID, Japan, UNDP and
CARICOM Secretariat.

Reconstruction and Recovery Planning. Based on the results of the Rapid Damage Impact
Assessment, the next step is to prioritize specific reconstruction investments and recovery
programs. In order to design the reconstruction and recovery plan, the government may consider
adopting a policy framework to guide sector reconstruction strategies and development of
reconstruction and recovery projects and investments. Based on international experience,
prioritization methodologies often include the following criteria:



16   See the CIF website for more details on the SPCR: http://www.climateinvestmentfunds.org
                                                                                                   75
       •   Potential for direct and widest humanitarian impact
       •   Restoration and rebuilding of critical infrastructure and services
       •   Potential to generate sustainable livelihoods
       •   Balance between public and private sector recovery
       •   Balance between physical infrastructure reconstruction and less visible recovery (such as
           capacity building and governance)
       •   Pro-poor, pro-vulnerable, and gender-sensitive agendas17


In order to carry out a large scale reconstruction program, the government will also need to assess
its capabilities and capacities in the construction sector as well as in the public service to be able
to implement the required investments.

In this context, below are key interventions that the government may prioritize for recovery and
reconstruction divided into four key areas: (i) risk identification/hazard data collection and
analysis; (ii) increasing resilience through disaster risk reduction mitigation investments; (iii)
strengthening disaster preparedness; and (iv) introducing disaster and catastrophe risk financing.
The underlying principles of this framework are that both loss of life and the economic impact of
disasters can be reduced through advance planning and investment.


A.         Risk Identification/Hazard Data Collection and Analysis
Reliable hydrological, meteorological and climate data are of utmost importance for planning
and designing investments that are resilient to the impacts of climate change. Hydro-
meteorological data management systems need to be upgraded and maintained to provide a source
of information on rainfall events and patterns. Fundamental datasets (e.g. topography, bathymetry,
soil map, etc.) for analyzing the physical environment of Dominica need to be collected and made
readily available. A stock taking of available hazard data needs to be carried out in the short term.
In addition, new surface water run-off models need to be developed and applied to develop better
flood risk mapping capability for infrastructure design and urban planning. Flood models in
urbanized or populated watersheds will have to be prioritized. LiDAR mapping should be carried
out urgently to provide topography and other data to inform the watershed modeling work. In
conjunction with this, landslide identification and mapping work should be carried out to ensure
that new construction is not at risk.

                                                                                                                  76
A comprehensive asset condition assessment is key to understand the extent of economic
exposure to natural disaster and to develop a multiyear reconstruction investment plan .
Deteriorating infrastructure condition leads to an increase in vulnerability and failure which in turn
leads to significant economic losses. A combination of ageing infrastructure, low
rehabilitation/renewal funds and an increase in frequency of natural disasters due to climate change
calls for a proactive approach to managing infrastructure. The biggest challenge in minimizing
contingent liability is the difficulty to assess the risk of failure of different components of an
infrastructure network. This requires a systematic condition assessment of infrastructure that
incorporates vulnerability and risk analysis. This assessment should include all the major sectors
such as transport (including airports and seaports), telecommunication, water, sanitation, energy,
health, and education sectors. The key outcomes for the government will be (i) understanding of
long-term average annual losses under different scenarios of levels of asset management, (ii) full
assessment of major system failures creating opportunities for targeted investments and increasing
financial efficiency and (iii) reduce disaster risk vulnerability and loss of infrastructure by
improving maintenance protocol

B.     Increasing Resilience through Disaster Risk Reduction Measures
Territorial and urban development plans, infrastructure design standards and construction
regulations need to be revised to account for flood and landslide risk. The Rapid Damage and
Impact Assessment highlighted that a significant number of relatively new infrastructure
(including bridges; retaining walls; river protections; etc.) were destroyed due to poor design
and/or quality of construction. The probability of occurrence (return period) of extreme events
should be reevaluated as the intensity and frequency of some hazards such as flooding, wind storm
and storm surge has evolved over time due to climate change and their impact has increased
because of urbanization and overall increase in economic exposure. To enhance the resilience of
infrastructure new construction, design standards, technical guidelines and codes should be
developed, adopted and enforced.

Assess watershed management practices and prepare investments to reduce the risk of flooding
of communities and infrastructure. A significant number of properties were affected by flash
flooding, caused by various factors including inappropriate zoning, lack of adequate flood
protection measures and poor construction quality. The upgrading of flood protection
infrastructure, in conjunction with better zoning of communities would help prevent similar events
in the future.

Develop a resilient transport infrastructure recovery and reconstruction strategy around the
following priorities: (i) avoiding further casualties and damage to assets weakened by the Storm;
(ii) restoring access and resuming socio-economic activities critical for recovery; (iii) developing
a long term reconstruction and multiyear maintenance program that is informed by full condition
assessment of assets and robust cost/benefit analysis. In the short term, a no regret and conservative
designs and construction methods should be adopted until all necessary country-wide flood models
and construction guidelines are developed.
                                                                                                   77
Design a resilient housing recovery and reconstruction strategy which focuses on: (i) safety
assessment (covering both structural integrity as well as exposure to landslides, flash floods, etc.)
of existing housing stock; (ii) housing program for those displaced by the storm with options
targeting different tenure and socio-economic status (e.g. owners/renters; female-headed
households; etc.); (iii) disaster and climate risk-based program to retrofit existing housing stock
and introduce/revise regulations for unsafe areas; (iv) enforcement of building code/regulations,
improvement of building practices, certification of materials, etc.

Promote resilience in the Agricultural/fisheries sectors through improved watershed analysis
(based on high resolution core datasets) to provide a foundation for advising sector activities and
assisting with risk avoidance through improved planning and design. Given the terrain and soils
distribution there will always be a risk of crop losses due to flooding and landslip however losses
can be mitigated through improved analysis and planning. This is particularly true with the
construction and location of critical processing and storage facilities. As most of the agricultural
activity occurs in the private sector on private lands, the Ministry of Agriculture generally operates
in an advisory capacity. Adding modeling and analysis capacity to the Ministry provides a
powerful tool to assist farmers with risk avoidance/reduction activities. The Ministry should
regularly also engage with the Ministry of Planning to ensure that development plans do not place
agriculture at undue risk.


C.     Strengthened Disaster Risk Preparedness
Develop a culture of resilience to natural hazards and climate change by pre-positioning
essential supplies, safety and recovery equipment. The government should pre-position essential
supplies such as water, medication, dry food to support communities in the immediate aftermath
of disaster. It should also continue to assess the adequacy and safety of shelters for all major types
of hazards on a continuous basis. In addition, emergency respondents should be well equipped to
respond to disasters effectively. This includes, for example, having appropriate road signs that
could be used to warn drivers about dangerous areas or to close traffic in sections of roads that
pose extreme threat. The disaster risk management agency should lead this program to ensure that
all government agencies have business continuity plans and are well equipped to get their sector
back to business in the shortest time possible.

Enhance disaster preparedness and crisis response capacity by improving communication.
Communication between affected communities and government authorities should be enhanced to
ensure that (i) communities are informed of imminent danger before a natural disaster and (ii)
government authorities are continuously informed about situation on the ground. This flow of
information on both directions will help to better adopt and respond to a crisis. In the weeks
following TS Erika, new precipitations have triggered additional floods and landslides. Dominica’s
vulnerability to hydro-meteorological and climate hazards has been made even more acute and
immediate measures need to be taken to inform communities of the increased risk. In the short

                                                                                                   78
term communication tools targeting decision makers as well as the broad population have to be
made rapidly available to avoid additional casualties from subsequent precipitations.

Improve early warning systems. The early warning systems in Dominica are rather limited;
currently there is lack of capacity to produce very short term weather forecasts or real time
observations. Effective and efficient early warning systems are required for disaster operations.
An improved early warning system enables better responses to be put into action quickly and
improve safety to the public and civil protection staff. This system will require real time inputs
from rain gauges, rain radar and river gauging stations and would comprise of a metrological model
to predict rainfall and a hydraulic model to forecast river flows and levels and the consequential
impacts on flooding and debris flow events. Continuous Improvements to the system will be
necessary to deal with the inherent uncertainties in regional forecasting and to improve its
reliability.

Increase the capacity of the private sectors to respond to disasters. Private sector actors should
take measure to reduce the likelihood and impact of floods and landslides by strengthening the
capacity of employees to respond in a timely manner. Some of the key steps that the private sector
could take include (i) preparing evacuation plans, (ii) preparing facility maps showing critical
equipment (iii) a business continuity plan, (iv) buying insurance, (v) backing up all computer data,
and (vi) raising electrical outlets, ventilation systems and other equipment to avoid flood damage.

D.       Disaster Risk Financing
Reduce fiscal exposure to natural disaster shocks by developing a risk financing strategy that could
include a risk layering approach as well as the potential for adopting risk financing instruments or
contingent financing mechanisms to cover the losses caused by low frequency, high impact
disaster events.

Establish a broad based catastrophe risk financing and insurance strategy. Given the wide
spread damages and losses due to TS Erika to the agricultural sector, public infrastructure, private
properties, livelihood and its overall impact on the country’s budget, various risk financing and
transfer mechanisms would be beneficial for Dominica to ensure that government, communities
and businesses more resilient to disaster. The following are different risk financing options that
Dominica could consider to manage natural disasters.

        Sovereign disaster risk financing: Development of financial strategies to increase the
         financial response capacity of governments in the aftermath of natural disasters, while
         protecting their long-term fiscal balances.
        Property catastrophe risk insurance: Development of competitive catastrophe insurance
         markets to increase property catastrophe insurance penetration among homeowners and
         small and medium enterprises.
        Agricultural insurance: Development of agricultural insurance programs for farmers, and
         agricultural financing institutions (e.g., rural banks, microfinance institutions) to increase
         their financial resilience to adverse natural hazards.
                                                                                                    79
   Disaster micro-insurance: Facilitate access to disaster insurance products to protect the
    livelihood of the poor against extreme weather events and promote disaster risk reduction
    in conjunction with social programs such as conditional cash transfer programs.
