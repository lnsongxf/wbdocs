This snapshot summarizes preliminary findings related to child health and nutrition from the Early
Childhood Education (ECE) Study in Lao PDR. The ECE Study was initiated to evaluate the Early Childhood
Education Project. The results presented here represent data collected on the status of child health and
nutrition prior to the implementation of the project. Data will be collected again after the project has
finished to see if the project has improved outcomes for children. This snapshot highlights that child
undernutrition is a serious public health issue in Northern Laos PDR.

Good health and nutrition are essential not only for children’s survival, but for healthy development
and growth. Health and nutrition lay the foundation for development throughout childhood, in turn
impacting on later learning, educational achievement and adult productivity. To promote holistic child
development, a basis of good health and nutrition for the country’s children is critical.


THE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION
PROJECT
The ECE Project seeks to support the expansion of quality
ECE services with the objective of improving the overall
development and school readiness of children aged 3-5
years in disadvantaged villages across the country (for further
information, refer to Snapshot One: Project Background
and Baseline Data Demographics). Good health is essential
in promoting development, and as such the ECE Project
incorporates interventions designed to improve child health
and nutrition to better support overall child development.
Community awareness campaigning and parental education
will aim to improve knowledge and understanding of what is
needed for good child health, while the provision of school
lunches aims not only to promote healthy eating and better
nutrition, but to improve school attendance and children’s
concentration.

Baseline data were collected to provide information on
the current status of child outcomes, including indicators
of child health and nutrition. Here we present findings on
breastfeeding, undernutrition and vaccination coverage.

VACCINATIONS
More than half of caretakers reported they had their
child’s vaccination card (56%); 29% were able to present
their child's vaccination card but without the details
recorded on it, and 28% presented a vaccination card
that did have information recorded on it.

Examining only the responses from caretakers who
were able to present their child’s vaccination card, we
are able to estimate that up to 24% of children had their
BCG vaccine for tuberculosis, 20% had been vaccinated
against Measles, 22% had been fully vaccinated against
both Polio and DPT (three doses of each), and while 12%
of children had received two doses of the Hepatitis
B vaccine, no children had received all three doses
and were therefore not fully vaccinated against the
infection. It is likely that children of families who did not
have, or who were unable to provide, an immunization
card have had no immunizations at all, or likely at a

KEY FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This study finds that children in the northern parts of Lao
PDR are not receiving the health services and nutrition
that they should be. Despite meeting the WHO global
target for exclusive breastfeeding until 6 months of age,
there is still room for improvement in the breastfeeding
rates in Northern Lao. The rates of stunting and
children being underweight are of high public health
significance. Additionally, the rates of immunization are
well below international standards. These figures are
consistent with previous research studies conducted by
non-government organizations and the World Bank in
Lao PDR. The ECE Project has the potential to support
improvements in child health and development through
the community awareness campaign. The campaign
includes a focus on the importance of the first 1,000
days of life, immunization and good nutrition. It will be
extremely important that the community awareness
campaign is effectively implemented and that the
key messages are delivered clearly and successfully to
families living in the communities of Northern Lao PDR.
