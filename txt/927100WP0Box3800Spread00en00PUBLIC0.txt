Letter from the Chairman



                     Can Tho is the engine of growth of the Mekong Delta. With
                     a concentration of industries, educational institutions, health
                     facilities, and science and technology research organizations,
                     we are poised to achieve our 2020 goal of becoming a
                     modern city that contributes to the development of Vietnam
                     and growth of the South East Asia region.

    Given this important role, we need to ensure that we address the threats to
    our future success. We need to take proactive measures to deal with recurrent
    flooding, the pressures of rapid urbanization, and the anticipated impacts of
    climate change to ensure that we reap the benefits of economic growth in a
    safe, sustainable, and inclusive way. In short, we need to become more resilient.

    Becoming more resilient will require strengthened urban management capacity
    and better coordination and sharing of information across departments. And
    it will also require continued investment in urban infrastructure like flood
    protection, transport, and sanitation. This will be a long-term journey, and the
    implementation of the World Bank’s CityStrength Diagnostic represents just
    one milestone.

    We are inviting the World Bank and other development organizations to join us
    in a long-term partnership to strengthen Can Tho and make it an even better
    place to live, work, and enjoy the natural beauty of the Mekong Delta.

Can Tho has a transparent and inclusive urban planning process in place that includes formal
consultations with different levels of government, expert groups, and local communities
(interview with DOC). The city’s overall development vision is supported in the city’s spatial
plans as evidenced by the alignment of Can Tho’s Socio-economic Development Plan 2020
with the new Master Plan 2030. Coordination and knowledge sharing between departments is
somewhat weak as evidenced by limited reflection on each other’s programs and activities in
sectoral plans.

       Robustness
       The city’s building codes cover multiple types of assets and
       reflect flood risk to some degree. All projects are required
       to adhere to these codes in order to receive building permits.
       However, a challenge in Can Tho is the large presence of                 Coordination
       dilapidated houses that are not built according to code (Carrard         In Can Tho, the socio-economic development vision is successfully

       Reflectiveness
       The city monitors changes in natural hazards and is trying
       to direct urban growth into lower-risk areas (interview with
       DONRE). Although the city is aware of the environmental and
       human safety risks associated with informal growth along
       roads and canals and in peri-urban areas, there is no formal
       strategy for accommodating future in-migration of lower-
       income groups elsewhere in the city. Moreover, the collection
       of data on the building stock and public assets are not digitized
       or geo-referenced (interview with DOC), making it difficult to
       measure urbanization trends as well as damages and losses                Inclusiveness
       caused by flooding and other hazards.                                    Can Tho has established transparent and predictable procedures
                                                                                for consultation on urban plans. Planning processes generally

       (interview with DOLISA), it is difficult to evaluate whether land
       designated to urban development will meet future demand. It
       appears that there is insufficient supply of affordable formal housing
       as demonstrated by the presence of informal settlements along
       the city’s waterways and roads (field observations). Lack of service
       coverage to all segments of the population indicates that Can Tho is
       unable to absorb the rapidly growing population (Moglia et al., 2012;
       interviews with DOT and DOC).

                      shocks to revenues or unforeseen needed expenditures through                      the city’s ability to control its revenues and plan for its expenditures is limited
                      reserving and flexible budget reallocation mechanisms. Budget planning,           given that the central government appears to require given percentages or levels

                      including information on damage and loss from previous shocks or                  DOF). There is also a gap between the priorities of its five-year master plan and

       Robustness

       gas, and oil, providing the city with several alternatives for its
       electricity supply. Independent, back-up generation capacity has
                                                                                Coordination

       full-time with two additional plants scheduled to be constructed,
       which could result in the city exporting power to the entire
       Mekong Delta Region. The probability of price shock is relatively
       low since energy prices are tightly controlled. Load shedding
       does occur during emergencies and during energy shortfalls,
       but there is currently no demand-response market to formally
       integrate load shedding into the supply market.

number of industries and households are known to release wastewater directly into waterways”
(Neumann et al., 2013). The first wastewater treatment plant in Can Tho is being constructed. It is
expected to be completed in 2014 and will have a 30,000 cubic-meter per day capacity.

There appears to be a lack of technical and managerial capacity related to overall management,
planning, and operations and maintenance of sanitation infrastructure (Moglia et al., 2013). The
current state of sanitation causes serious damages to peoples’ health and impacts the economy
through, for example, lost navigational functions of the waterways and reduced quality and
output of aquaculture products. Can Tho has recently approved a City Sanitation Development
Plan under the proposed national Unified Sanitation Sector Strategy and Action Plan (Can Tho
CPC, 2013).
