Overview
Highlights
The way countries finance health care influences how well a health system performs and
achieves its expected outcomes, including how equitable and efficient it is. Countries decide
how to mobilize revenues from different sources for financing health care, how to pool
revenues in public and private insurance and in a national health system with automatic
coverage (risk pooling), and how to purchase care from health care providers.
The World Bank has implemented health financing activities in 68 countries during FY03–12.
Health financing interventions are found in about 40 percent of the Bank’s Health, Nutrition,
and Population portfolio. Most projects include interventions on revenue collection from public
sources. Almost half of the projects support public health insurance and automatic coverage.
More recently, results-based financing (RBF) operations became more prominent. The
International Finance Corporation (IFC) delivered a small program in health financing.
This is the first evaluation by the Independent Evaluation Group of the World Bank Group’s
support to countries trying to address health financing issues. While much remains to be
learned about the health benefits, equity in service use and finance, and the financial protection
value of health financing reforms supported by the Bank Group, this evaluation has been able to
draw the following four major conclusions:
First, there have been some notable successes of Bank support to health financing. Bank support
was more successful when the Health and Public Sector teams drew on a variety of skills across
sectors and where government commitment to reforms was strong.
Second, Bank support has helped raise or protect public revenues for health. Equity in pooling
increased where the Bank assisted governments in subsidizing compulsory contributions to
various health insurance for low-income groups. However, increased pooling did not always
lead to pro-poor spending, improved equity in service use, or greater financial protection.
Support to reduce user payments was limited.
Third, the Bank has increased its focus on activity- or results-based payments supported by RBF
projects. Little attention was paid to the impact on costs and broader effects on the public sector.
Fourth, an integrated approach that links health financing with public sector reforms is likely to
be more effective than single-issue interventions because it builds the institutions that are
needed for sustainability. This includes equitable revenue instruments, taking into account the
overall public finance situation, moving toward compulsory pooling in insurance and national
health systems, focusing on strategic purchasing, and giving attention to adverse effects in a
broader public sector context. The linking of health financing to public finance requires strong
collaboration across the Bank Group to facilitate the dialogue at all government levels.
The evaluation makes five main recommendations: support government commitment and build
technical and information capacity; address health financing as a cross-cutting issue at the
country level; focus on health financing as a core comparative advantage; integrate all health
financing functions; and strengthen monitoring and evaluation in Bank and IFC projects.

Management Response
The World Bank Group thanks the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) for
undertaking this evaluation. Management welcomes the opportunity to review and
comment on IEG’s report on World Bank Group Support to Health Financing for
Improving Health System Performance. This evaluation is timely as we embark on a
One World Bank Group model encompassing the Global Practices and Cross
Cutting Solution Areas and reevaluating our areas of strengths and space to enhance
the performance in health financing. The IEG report generally provides a balanced
commentary on most topics regarding the support of the World Bank Group to
health financing and covers a wide terrain. Management also commends IEG for the
way it engaged with management in a consultative process during the drafting of
the report.

Broad Concurrence with Conclusions and Recommendations. Management
broadly concurs with the conclusions and recommendations of this evaluation.
Management welcomes IEG’s call for effective collaboration across the new Global
Practices and IFC as well as the need for synergies in collaboration with external
partners, as this will be critical in improving future World Bank Group support to
health financing. IEG’s recommendation to develop a joint Bank and IFC approach
to health financing is also timely and could not be over emphasized. The findings of
the evaluation have broad relevance across the organization.

COMMENTS SPECIFIC TO WORLD BANK OPERATIONS

GENERAL COMMENTS

While the IEG report covers a significant amount of ground in terms of World Bank
interventions on health financing, it could be more inclusive of the big picture in
terms of the context in which interventions in health financing impact on our client
countries. For example, management notes that in many emerging economies, while
the private sector is not yet bigger than the public, the private sector is growing at a
much faster rate. If that trend continues, over the period of a decade, the public
sector’s weight will be reduced from perhaps half of the total to a small fraction of
the total. Other players in global health have also grown and have a large weight
relative to the direct role of the Bank in health financing.

The report covers the work of the World Bank Group only for the period of FY03–12.
While it could be seen as beyond the scope of the report, it would be helpful to the
reader to understand the larger historical perspective and note that the Bank’s health
financing work has evolved over time (e.g., advocate for user fees in the 1980s,
analytic work on voluntary insurance in the 1990s) to its current state. It could also

                                                                    MANAGEMENT RESPONSE


note that client demands have changed over the years (e.g., helping countries in
Europe and Central Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean pivot away from tax-
based health finance in the 1990s). More context could help explain the current state.

The report underemphasizes the Bank’s knowledge program role in supporting
health financing, focusing mostly on lending. However, it could more explicitly
recognize that much of Bank support to health financing reform is through technical
assistance (often as an outcome of analytic and advisory activities, or AAA) rather
than through lending. It may not have large monetary value (which is perhaps why
work led by the Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Vice Presidency
through development policy loans, or DPLs, comes across as so important in the
overall support), but this does not make the technical assistance any less important
to improving health system performance.

The report has an implicit focus on the Bank’s normative view of health financing. It
indirectly suggests that one of the Bank's strengths is its recognition of the many
different ways to finance health and that there is not a “one-size-fits-all” prescription
for clients. The report could benefit from recognizing this strength more explicitly.

RESULTS-BASED FINANCING

The portrayal of results-based financing (RBF) in the report could better reflect
the reality of how Bank RBF projects in low- and middle-income countries
operate. The country cases that were chosen are not the most representative. There
are many RBF programs in the Health, Nutrition, and Population (HNP) portfolio
that are more mature and have been under implementation for some time enabling a
more in depth analysis of the impact over time. While the definition of RBF on page
xv and paragraph 4.14 is accurate, in the rest of the report RBF is understood mostly
as Pay-for-Performance (P4P), used in the OECD countries. The report often uses
different yardsticks to evaluate the effectiveness and credibility of RBF. As many
Bank-funded impact evaluations of RBF are still ongoing, the report prematurely
draws several negative conclusions on RBF and minimizes positive findings.

The report describes RBF as a costly intervention and attention is drawn on
financial sustainability. In most low-resource settings that the RBF operates in, key
issues include poor utilization and low quality of services. Introducing RBF has
resulted in large increases in service utilization and provision of quality
interventions. By improving productivity and better leveraging the resources
already invested, RBF payments form the incremental unit cost of providing the
resultant service levels and quality standards. The small incentives used by
Argentina’s Plan Nacer, one of the RBF programs discussed in the report, (2 to 4
percent of the provincial public health budget) have successfully leveraged the
existing resources for health in the country. Impact evaluation results for the Nacer

Plan show that the performance incentives are enormously cost-effective: the cost of
a Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) saved was US$1,115, compared to a gross
domestic product per capita of US$6,075. In Rwanda, facilities paid based on
performance yielded better results in service provision and quality of care compared
to facilities which received equivalent input-based budgets.

Government commitment is crucial for sustainability and is shown, among other
things, by the financial contributions made by countries as diverse as Cameroon,
Zimbabwe, and Armenia committing US$2 million, US$3 million and US$4 million,
respectively, from their government budget to RBF. Further, RBF has supported the
process of aligning and harmonizing donor inputs with government budgets.
Burundi scaled up a virtual pooling system enabling the Government of Burundi,
the Bank, and ten other development partners to jointly finance a comprehensive
package of services. In Benin, a joint-basket fund supported by the Bank, GAVI and
the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria is managed by the
Ministry of Health and used to pay for the RBF results in the health facilities in the
country.

The report does not recognize the range of benefits that RBF provides. The report
focuses on health financing, and portrays RBF merely as a provider payment
mechanism. This is inaccurate because RBF is used as a platform to improve
providers’ autonomy, strengthen monitoring, increase supervision, boost utilization
and quality of care, and overall improve accountability and transparency in the
health system. Impact evaluation studies (Basinga et al 2011; Gertler, Paul;
Vermeersch, Christel. 2012) have demonstrated that paying for performance
increased prenatal and postnatal care quality in addition to boosting service
provision and that these effects translated into large and significant improvements
in child health outcomes. The core concept of RBF is to promote a results-orientation
by linking financing to desired outputs and encouraging entrepreneurial behavior
by staff and managers. Further, unlike the typical provider payment methods
(capitation, DRG1, case based), RBF payments do not reflect real service production
costs, but aim at investing in front line services and modifying behavior, while
leveraging existing resources in the health system. The IEG review, by focusing on a
relatively narrow subset of country cases2 with an explicit health financing lens and
drawing generic lessons, does not recognize the comprehensive nature of the RBF
approach and what it has to offer. Moreover, the World Bank Group aims to

    The 16 country cases in the IEG study that form the basis of the opinion on RBF include four
    countries where RBF is implemented with Bank support; out of which two countries (namely
    Benin and Kenya) were at the early stages of RBF implementation at the time of the study and
    two were more advanced (namely Rwanda and Afghanistan).

continue integrating RBF with the other health financing functions it is delivering to
create a more comprehensive, systems approach.

EVIDENCE AND MONITORING AND EVALUATION

Finding evidence for IEG’s research questions is difficult. Most of the health
financing reforms supported by the Bank are implemented nationwide, therefore
making it difficult to use an experimental design (e.g., randomization) as an
outcome identification strategy. Therefore, it should be recognized that the "limited
evidence" of the Bank’s support to health financing reforms is also the result of the
difficulties in producing rigorous impact evaluations that are implemented
nationwide.

A more nuanced treatment of the monitoring and evaluation discussion would
add value. Paragraph 5.23 states that “evaluation may be missing some successful
Bank and IFC engagement in health financing because of weak M&E in health
projects.” A more nuanced approach to this could be helpful. In cases where the
Bank supported national reforms (e.g., through DPLs or AAA), there are no
counterfactual or control groups to assess the impact. Analyses of the effects of
health financing can be plagued by endogeneity (e.g., in the case of pooling, this
could be the fact that insurance is a choice) that is difficult to overcome statistically
and quantify without carefully designed impact evaluation and big data
requirements. Evaluating these effects properly would require big financial
investments by the Bank and, quite possibly, convincing clients to roll out health
financing reforms in an "evaluable” way (e.g., phased or partial) — which may not
be desirable for a number of reasons.


METHODOLOGY

 Health financing is one of several building blocks of a health system. The IEG
conceptual framework for health financing would benefit from situating it as one of
several "building blocks" of a health system (as the World Health Organization
conceptualizes it). In several instances, there is a jump from health financing to
health outcomes without putting other building blocks -- such as service delivery --
in complementary context.

MISSING PRODUCTS FROM THE WORLD BANK

Missing references to the Global Expert Team (GET) on Health Financing and
Insurance. This was one of the few GETs in the Bank, and it would have been
expected to help strengthen the Bank's contributions in health financing and
linkages across countries/regions. Its establishment attests to the priority given to

the Bank's role in health financing. The evaluation did not mention this initiative,
and did not comment on what mechanisms could have better ensured effective
action in each health financing engagement.

Narrow representation of lending and non-lending Health Financing tasks. The
report appears to have excluded projects where the Bank worked with clients to
improve the allocative and technical efficiency of public expenditure, as most Sector-
wide Approaches (SWAps) did explicitly (in South Asia, this would include the
Bangladesh SWAp). In addition, the evaluation could have included operations
which aimed to improve accountability of public expenditure and efficiency through
contracting (such as the Uttar Pradesh Health Systems Strengthening Project) and as
well as projects where the Bank supported efforts to pursue fiscal decentralization in
health (as in the Sri Lanka Health Sector Development Project).

COMMENTS SPECIFIC TO THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION

The International Finance Corporation’s (IFC) experience in the health financing
space is relatively limited. Over the FY03-12 review period, IFC committed $161
million in this subsector, representing less than 1 percent of IFC total commitment
volume across all sectors. According to IEG, the six investments and nine advisory
services projects covered in the report already represent 100 percent of IFC
interventions during the review period.

IFC was more optimistic in health financing when it formulated its health sector
strategy in 2002. As indicated in IFC’s Management Response3 to a different but
related IEG evaluation of the World Bank Group’s support to Health, Nutrition and
Population in 2009, IFC learned that the business case for direct investment in stand-
alone private health insurance does not exist to the extent IFC has envisaged it.
Going forward, recognizing that in many emerging economies, the private sector is
now growing at a much faster rate than the public sector, IFC anticipates greater
opportunities for the World Bank Group to support private sector development in
health financing.

Chairperson’s Summary: Committee on
Development Effectiveness
The Committee on Development Effectiveness (the Committee) met to consider the
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG’s) report entitled World Bank Group Support to
Health Financing for Improving Health System Performance FY03-FY12 and Draft
Management Response.

The Committee welcomed the timeliness of the evaluation and was encouraged that
management broadly concurred with the report’s recommendations. Members
recognized that health is inextricably correlated with the World Bank Group
corporate strategies and the mandate of poverty reduction. Members appreciated
the timeliness of the evaluation, coinciding with the implementation of Global
Practices, Cross Cutting Solution Areas and the “One-WBG” model. Members
agreed this was an opportunity for the institution to assess comparative advantages
to further enhance its development effectiveness including in the health sector.

Members noted that the evaluation covered the period from 2003 to 2012 and that
the Bank's approach to the financing of the health sector has evolved significantly.
They expressed strong interest in seeing the Global Practices lead to a consistent and
cohesive strategy to financing across the Regions, while still appreciating the
country context. Members agreed with the importance of a more holistic approach to
health financing and service delivery, augmented cross-sector coordination, and
increased public-private interface and partnerships, including in particular with the
International Finance Corporation (IFC). In this respect, members were encouraged
that the Bank and IFC are joining forces to develop a road map for collaboration on
health financing as well as on broader assistance in health systems and reforms.
They underscored the need for synergies in collaboration with external partners to
further improve future World Bank Group support to health financing. Members
emphasized the importance of monitoring and evaluation and encouraged
management to focus on cost-effective means of evaluation of the relevant policies
and operations.

Some members commented that the emphasis of health financing should be equally
placed on financial sustainability and equity, in order to improve poverty alleviation
effects and strengthen equity of health systems. Members noted the difficulty in
evaluating the Bank’s knowledge role, including technical assistance, in health
financing and welcomed the clarification that there have been various knowledge
initiatives underway to improve knowledge development and sharing, including
designing a prospective impact evaluation at the inception of Bank projects.
Members recognized that the divergent views with respect to results-based

Highlights
 The way that health services are financed affects human welfare because it influences how health
  systems perform in improving health outcomes, and more directly, it affects the income and
  consumption of the poor.
 Health financing affects health outcomes and poverty through three main functions: revenues
  collected for health, risk pooling, and purchasing.
 Almost half of the World Bank’s health operations support countries in improving the way these
  three functions perform. The topic is nascent at the International Finance Corporation. Most Bank
  projects support revenues collected from public sources, but this support has declined over time,
  whereas Bank support to purchasing has increased substantially.
 Evaluating Bank Group support is timely because of its relevance to the institution’s newly
  articulated poverty goals and its ability to inform the post–Millennium Development Goals 2015
  agenda. Also, health finance is a central part of the health strategy implemented by the new Global
  Practices.

The way health systems are financed can directly affect growth and human welfare
(Box 1.1). Ill health can lead to financial hardship among low-income households
that have to pay fees for health services: they may have to sell assets and incur debts
to pay for care, and may fall into poverty or deeper into poverty. As a result, the
poor often forgo care when it is needed and report worse health outcomes. Their ill
health can keep them trapped in poverty and negatively affect a country’s growth
prospects.

Improving health outcomes and protecting households against the financial
consequences of ill health are top priorities to reduce poverty and sustain growth.
Continuous growth depends on a healthy and productive labor force. Good health
helps to increase education and the level of human capital. A healthy population
also has a fiscal impact as it frees up government resources that can be used for
alternative investments. These health outcomes are determined both by household
behavior and by the level and quality of health care services.

How revenues for health are raised, managed, and then allocated to health care
providers may also create different financial incentives for insurers, providers, and
consumers, which will affect their behavior and use of resources for service delivery.
This affects the type of care patients receive, including the quantity and quality of
services and efficiency in service delivery.

CHAPTER 1
BANK GROUP SUPPORT TO HEALTH FINANCING
Box 1.1. What Constitutes a Health System?
There are diverse views as to what should constitute a health system. To date, 41 different
conceptual frameworks have been developed to describe health systems, offering diverse
perspectives in terms of focus, scope, taxonomy, linguistics, usability, and other features
(Hoffman et al. 2012). Common elements are found across the different definitions. These
include the need to support health system performance measured by improved equity in
access, quality, and efficiency of care, independent of the patients’ diseases.
The World Bank has embraced strengthening health systems in its operational work. This
approach was articulated in the 2007 Health Nutrition and Population Strategy (World Bank
2007). It says, “Health systems encompass all country activities, organizations, governance
arrangements, and resources (public and private) dedicated primarily to improving,
maintaining, or restoring the health of individuals and populations and preventing
households from falling into poverty (or becoming further impoverished) as a result of
illness.”

As countries become richer, they make tremendous progress in achieving better
health outcomes. Yet substantial inequities in health remain across population
groups because health systems in low-income settings often fail to respond to the
needs of the population. A major problem is that poor individuals often do not
receive needed care because they cannot afford to pay user fees charged by health
care providers (Gottret et al. 2008). In addition, patient surveys and citizen
scorecards point to public dissatisfaction with low-quality care, informal payments
charged by providers to patients, absentee health workers, and unavailability of
pharmaceuticals in underfunded health facilities (WHO 2000).

Countries are responding to these challenges by ensuring that the way they finance
health care is efficient and equitable. The World Bank Group has supported these
efforts through a combination of financial assistance, policy advice, and technical
assistance. This is the first evaluation by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) of
the World Bank Group’s support to clients seeking to design their health financing
functions. The evaluation is timely because of both its relevance to the Bank’s newly
articulated poverty goals and the need to inform the post–Millennium Development
Goals 2015 agenda. Also, health finance is a central part of the health strategy to be
implemented by the Bank’s new Global Practices.


Health Financing Influences Health System Performance
Health financing systems consists of three main functions: raising revenues to
finance health, pooling health funds and risks, and purchasing health care (Figure
1.1). These functions are designed differently across countries, and no single health
financing model is supported by the Bank Group. Instead, the World Bank and the
International Finance Corporation (IFC) have taken a flexible approach toward

Revenues to finance health systems are raised from public, private, and external
sources. Governments collect revenues through direct and indirect taxes to finance
public spending, including that for health care. Some of these taxes can be
earmarked for health. These domestic revenues for health are then transferred to the
health sector in the form of internal transfers, subsidies, and grants to the budget of
the Ministry of Health and to lower levels of government (e.g., regions, states, and
municipalities), and as subsidies to public or social health insurance (SHI) to finance
contribution payments for groups such as informal sector workers. Compulsory
contributions to SHI are paid by employees, employers, and the self-employed.
Private revenues for health include voluntary premiums paid by households to
private insurance and to other prepayment mechanisms, and user payments made
by patients (or out-of-pocket payments) directly to public and private providers.
Some private providers and pharmacies only receive revenues from user payments.
Additional revenues for health are transfers from external sources including bi- and
multilateral donors and nongovernmental institutions (OECD et al. 2011).

CHAPTER 1
BANK GROUP SUPPORT TO HEALTH FINANCING
Pooled financing is money raised through taxes or insurance contributions and
premiums that individuals must pay whether or not they need care (Savedoff et al.
2012). Risk pooling is about how to pool financing to share the health risk among
pool members. With the exception of user payments, all revenues for health are
pooled and then transferred to providers. Depending on the country context, pools
can take different forms including the central and local government budget, public
and private health insurance, and community-based health insurance, among others.
Participation in a pool is compulsory or voluntary. Compulsory pooling of public
funds includes (i) automatic coverage of the population (e.g., national health
services) and (ii) mandatory participation by law for all or a defined population
group in social health insurance, which can be public or private health insurance.
Voluntary pooling refers to coverage of individuals at their own discretion through
private health insurance and community-based health insurance (Gottret and
Schieber 2006; OECD et al. 2011).

Governments and health insurers purchase health care benefits on behalf of pool
members from public and private providers and nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs). Passive purchasing is when providers are simply reimbursed for medical
services. Strategic purchasing requires countries to make decisions about how to pay
providers and at what price, what benefit package should be purchased for whom,
and from which provider. These decisions require information about the behavior of
providers and consumers. They also need institutions to govern management in
health facilities (Figueras et al. 2005; Gottret and Schieber 2006; Langenbrunner et al.
2009).

The way the three health financing functions are designed sets different financial
incentives to the government, health insurers, providers, and consumers that will
affect the attainment of health system outcomes. It will also influence how much of
the health funds are spent on different forms of health care (to ensure service use
relative to need); how equitable health revenues are collected from public and
private sources and distributed (equity in finance); who is protected against the
financial risk of having to pay for care (financial risk protection); and how effectively
health care costs are managed (efficiency) (Hsiao 2007). The three main outcomes
can be assessed by a set of indicators (Table 1.1).

What Has the World Bank Group Been Doing in Health Financing?
World Bank and IFC support to countries’ efforts to improve their health finance
systems are guided by clearly articulated strategies. The Bank’s 2007 Health,
Nutrition, and Population (HNP) strategy on healthy development sees health
financing as a comparative advantage for the Bank because of “its multi-sector
nature, its core mandate on sustainable financing, and its fiscal, general economic,
and insurance analytical capacity, on regulation, and on demand-side interventions”
(World Bank 2007, 51). The strategy aims to prevent poverty as the result of illness
by improving financial protection, and strives to improve health outcomes,
particularly for the poor and vulnerable. It also aims to improve financial
sustainability in health and contribute to sound macroeconomic and fiscal policy, as
well as governance, accountability, and transparency in health. The strategy focuses
on results and agreements with global partners on a collaborative division of labor
in client countries (World Bank 2007). Also, two World Development Reports have
brought health financing on the international policy agenda (Box 1.2).

To help countries improve their financial protection, the Bank in its HNP strategy
commits to provide sound policy advice about the best use of external assistance for
health; to remove user fees if the lost revenue can be replaced with alternative
resources that reach facilities in a fiscally sustainable manner; and to support
effective public financial management systems to document the flow of funds. The
Bank also stands to help countries identify options to reduce fragmentation across
insurance and public funds, and improve integration with regulatory frameworks
for public–private collaboration. Extending risk pooling to the informal sector and
the rural population, guided by solid evidence, is a key priority for HNP. The Bank

BANK GROUP SUPPORT TO HEALTH FINANCING
also commits to support countries in their monitoring and evaluation (M&E), to
assess whether arrangements improve financial protection for everyone including
for the poor and near-poor (World Bank 2007).

Box 1.2. Health Financing in World Development Reports
The World Bank’s 1993 World Development Report (WDR) on investing in health argued
that countries could reduce their disease burden by, at a minimum, doubling their public
spending on cost-effective public health interventions and that external assistance for health
should be increased in low-income countries (World Bank 1993).
The 2004 WDR on making services work for poor people reasoned that to improve services
for the poor, copayments made by patients needed to be retained locally and tied to the
performance of providers. They also need to contribute to the income of providers rather
than compensate for inadequate public funds. To provide income protection for the poor
against the financial risk related to health, the WDR argued that governments should
subsidize insurance enrollment or develop specific programs, adjusting subsidies between
rich and poor regions in decentralized health systems (World Bank 2004).

The HNP strategy strives to improve the financial sustainability of the health sector
by helping countries monitor indicators for fiscal sustainability, fiscal space, effects
of health financing on labor markets, and country-competitiveness determinants.
The Bank commits to help low-income countries address issues of financial
sustainability by leveraging household financing to expand risk pooling, attending
to volatility in external funding for health, and encouraging governments to adopt
pro-poor fiscal policies. In middle-income countries, Bank support aims to help
countries dealing with financial sustainability including systemic efficiency
problems and the fiscal and labor implications of SHI (World Bank 2007).

IFC’s health strategy seeks to contribute to institutional capacity building in client
countries. It aims to promote efficiency and innovation within health, while
improving health security and expanding financial protection against the
impoverishing effects of ill health (IFC 2002). In 2007 the IFC outlined a strategy for
engaging in the health sector in Africa (IFC 2007). The 2007 strategy called for
combined investment and Advisory Service operations, to assist governments with
developing appropriate regulatory frameworks in order to support growth in the
private health sector; to increase access to capital, promote quality standards for
service delivery, and support risk pooling mechanisms (IFC 2007). Both strategies
expected a growing portfolio to focus on private health insurance and to support
supplementary insurance that covers services excluded from mandatory coverage.

The Bank and IFC do not have a joint strategic approach to health financing. There is
no joint strategic direction about the mix of public and private insurance, which
population groups they should insure, and how to prevent and address risk-

selection in multiple-insurance contexts. Nor have the two institutions decided on
whether and how to separate the financing and the provision of care.

HOW HAS THE WORLD BANK GROUP OPERATIONALIZED THESE STRATEGIES?
The Bank Group’s role in health must be seen in a context of the changing nature of
international development assistance. Its share of total development assistance for
health is small and has decreased since 1998 from almost 20 percent to about 6
percent in 2013 (appendix Figure B.3). The largest areas of growth in donor
assistance have been in health related global programs (e.g., the GAVI Alliance;
Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria; and U.S. President’s
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) targeted to diseases but typically not addressing
health finance and system requirements (IEG 2011a). Partly in response to this trend,
in 2007, the Bank’s health strategy emphasized selectivity and a greater focus on the
Bank’s comparative advantage. This evaluation conducted a detailed review of the
World Bank and IFC support to health financing through lending, investment,
policy dialogue, and analytical work. Bank operations were included if they
supported any interventions that are part of the health financing functions
(appendixes A, B, and C). Similarly, IFC operations are included if they support
private or public health insurers or health maintenance organizations (HMOs)
(appendix D).

Bank support to health financing is managed by the Health, Nutrition, and
Population, Social Protection (SP), and Poverty Reduction and Economic
Management (PREM) Sector Boards. In addition, the Regions and the HNP anchor
produce a large number of knowledge products. Health financing is a relatively new
topic for the IFC, which offers advisory services and investments including loans
and equity to private, for-profit insurance companies.

Between FY03 and FY12 the IFC made six investments, including two investments in
private health insurance, two in Nigeria’s largest integrated HMO-provider
network, and two in health-specific private equity funds, which have invested in
insurance companies and HMOs. IFC also provided nine advisory services and
funded two output-based aid operations to health financing (appendix Table D.1).
Advisory services aim at generating knowledge and advising governments as well
as private and public insurers (appendix D). Most IFC projects in health financing
aim to improve the financial protection of underserved populations, expand access
to private insurance covering the mandatory package, and improve access to care
among the poor. The business case for direct investment in stand-alone private
health insurance does not exist to the extent envisaged in the 2002 IFC health
strategy. Thus, the operational execution of IFC’s strategy has emphasized

increasing health care access through direct investments in health care networks,
centers of excellence, and wholesaling (see appendix D).

In the same period, the Bank provided 188 loans that included health financing
interventions (appendixes A and C). These loans were implemented in 68 countries
through development policy operations (56 percent) and investment loans1 (44
percent) (appendix B). The number of operations with health financing peaked in
2006 and then in 2010 when a large number of multisector development policy
operations provided fast-disbursing financial support to ensure funding for social
sectors during the economic crisis (Figure 1.2). About 40 percent of the Bank’s
portfolio includes health financing. The share of health financing operations
managed by HNP and the number of newly approved projects, have decreased as
more health financing operations are implemented through development policy
operations managed by PREM. Most health operations with health financing
activities fund a variety of interventions, including infrastructure costs, but the
actual lending amount for health financing activities is unknown.

Most health financing projects support revenue collection from public sources
(Figure 1.3). However, there has been a marked decline in this type of Bank support,
whereas support to purchasing has increased substantially. Almost half of the
projects support compulsory risk pooling, but few Bank operations focus on
revenues from private sources, including user payments. The distribution of project
interventions and objectives by Region and sector are presented in appendix B.

(Figure 1.4). Only a few health financing projects have a financial protection
objective. Less than 20 percent of projects aim to improve equity in access, with
access often defined as increased utilization or coverage of care. About one-fourth
explicitly target the poor in their objectives (appendix B).2

CHAPTER 1
BANK GROUP SUPPORT TO HEALTH FINANCING
Bank lending operations are accompanied by a large body of analytical and advisory
work, knowledge products, technical assistance, and training programs including
the flagship course which is organized by the World Bank Institute (WBI). From
1997 to 2008 the WBI and its collaborating partners delivered 314 short-term training
events on health sector reform and sustainable financing to 19,400 participants from
51 countries (Shaw and Samaha 2009). In FY03–12, the World Bank undertook
analysis and promoted knowledge sharing on health financing reforms through 98
public expenditure reviews, at least 10 public expenditure tracking surveys,3 20
poverty assessments, about 70 economic and sector work activities, 8 fiscal space
studies, and a small but growing number of impact evaluations (appendixes A and
B). A large number of health financing workshops have been organized in the
Regions,4 some of them in collaboration with the WBI and with initiatives such as
the South–South Network and the Joint Learning Network. In addition, the HNP
anchor supports health financing, including through the Results-Based Financing
(RBF) initiative5 and the Universal Health Coverage initiative, which has conducted
25 country case studies.6 The Bank’s Development Research Group launched the
ADePT health module software in 2011 which allows users to produce standard
tables for health equity analysis.7


Objective of the Evaluation
The evaluation’s objective is to examine the effectiveness of World Bank Group
support to health financing in improving health system performance as measured
by improved equity in service use, financial protection, and efficiency. The evaluation
applies the health financing framework illustrated in Figure 1.1. The methodology is
described in appendix A.

This is the first time that IEG has evaluated the effectiveness of Bank and IFC
support to health financing. IEG’s 2009 HNP evaluation analyzed IFC and Bank
portfolio performance in achieving health outcomes for the poor, conducted analysis
of communicable diseases, and examined health in transport and water and
sanitation operations. This evaluation will not examine lending to finance health
care delivery including human resources, equipment, pharmaceuticals, and
construction of facilities, nor the procurement of these products. Some of these
aspects of health systems improvements were evaluated previously (IEG 2009).
Also, as procurement in the health sector is not part of health financing, it will not be
addressed (IEG 2014). Social safety nets through conditional cash transfers were
evaluated previously (IEG 2011b).

                                                  BANK GROUP SUPPORT TO HEALTH FINANCING
The evaluation recognizes that reforms in health financing only are not enough to
improve quality of care, ensure utilization according to need, or remove barriers in
the use of care, and that additional investments are needed to assure health care.
However, financing reforms are necessary to influence the provision of health care.
Other factors also influence the performance of health systems and outcomes,
including economic growth, demographic and epidemiological changes, new
medical technologies, and the environment. However, examining these factors is
beyond the scope of this health-financing-focused evaluation.

The evaluation addresses four questions, each of which is the main topic of the next
four chapters:
     What is the evidence that Bank Group support to revenue collection for health
       leads to improved equity in health financing and service use, financial
       protection, and efficiency?
     What is the evidence that Bank and IFC support to pooling of funds and health
       risks leads to improved equity in health financing and service use, financial
       protection, and efficiency?
     What is the evidence that Bank Group support to purchasing leads to
       improved equity in health financing and service use, financial protection,
       and efficiency?
     What are the factors in successful Bank Group support to health financing
       reforms?

The evaluation offers lessons to inform future lending and knowledge activities.

This evaluation covers FY03–12 and draws on several sources (appendix A). They
include a review of 188 closed and ongoing Bank operations (appendixes B and C), a
review of Bank impact evaluations, 43 poverty assessments, 8 IEG project
performance reports, semi-structured key informant interviews with 25 international
health financing experts, and an electronic survey of Bank staff working in HNP. All
IFC health-related advisory services and investment operations were reviewed
(appendix D). The evaluation team also carried out 16 new country case studies,
summarized in appendix E. Country case studies review reimbursable advisory
services where relevant.

Two caveats stand out. Evidence on the achievements of the Bank and IFC project
portfolio has been difficult to obtain, mainly because project M&E frameworks do
not collect the relevant indicators (appendix A). Further, limitations in project data
severely constrain the ability to assess the contribution of Bank and IFC support to
health financing (chapter 5).

1 Investment lending to the public and private sector finances project costs such as goods,
infrastructure, and consultancies. Development policy operations are nonearmarked loans, credits, or
grants that support the country’s economic and sector policies and institutions; they finance
transition costs, institutional strengthening, and consensus building on reforms. Using its RBF
experience, the Bank introduced a new lending instrument, Program-for-Results financing, in January
2012, which supports government programs and links the disbursement of funds directly to the
delivery of defined results, with a focus on strengthening institutions. The Bank has approved one
health project under Program-for-Results financing, namely the Ethiopia Health Millennium Goals
Program for Results (P123531), approved in February 2013. It is not included in this evaluation.
Public Financial Management for Results Program in Mozambique (P124615) includes public
financial management, health and education and is scheduled for approval in June 2014.
2Health, Nutrition, and Population (HNP) operations tend to target the vulnerable in their objectives.
But as these projects often include disease-specific components, “vulnerability” could be interpreted
as vulnerable to higher infection risk and not necessarily vulnerable to weaker socioeconomic status.

tracking surveys.

2. Revenue Collection for Health
Highlights
 The challenges governments face in revenue collection include how to raise revenues efficiently
  and equitably to finance health care. In low-income countries, direct payments made by patients to
  providers are the main source of revenue, raising concerns about access to care for the poor.
 The Bank did not take an ideological stance in its work in revenue collection for health; rather it
  worked within the different country contexts. Bank advice focused on increasing the health budget
  in low-income countries. In middle-income countries, the Bank recommended managing the level
  of public spending and subsidizing insurance enrollment. Some timely advice on a greater role for
  alcohol and tobacco taxes has been given but this is very limited. The Bank gave limited attention
  to user payments through lending operations. In few countries did it help institutionalize monitoring
  and evaluation to examine the effect of health financing.
 There have been some notable successes. Bank support has helped raise domestic revenues for
  health and subsidize contributions to risk pools for low-income groups. Support to reduce user
  payments lacked the necessary fiscal and equity analysis, and evidence is missing that it has
  improved service use and financial protection.
 Bank support was more successful with strong government commitment at both the economy-wide
  and sector levels and when Bank staff drew on a variety of skills across sectors to engage
  government.

Revenues for health are collected from public and private sources and allocated to
health care providers. Governments face challenges in raising revenues efficiently
and equitably. Chapter 2 introduces these challenges, describes how the Bank
supported countries in addressing them, and evaluates the effect of this support.


Challenges
While some countries set targets for public revenues for health, such as the Abuja
target of allocating at least 15 percent of the annual government budget to health,1
there is no consensus on how much revenue governments should allocate to health.
The reasons for this diversity reflect different economic circumstances and the range
of social contracts that governments have with their citizens for ideological or
historical reasons. The economic rationale for devoting public revenues to health are
(i) to correct for market failures (e.g., private markets do not work well when
consumers and providers have different levels of information regarding the

society at large); and (iii) to ensure that the poor and other disadvantaged groups
are not excluded (to meet equity objectives). The concern in many developing
countries is that the very low amount that many governments now devote to health
is too low to fund these necessary functions.

A government’s revenue-raising capacity is affected by factors such as the country’s
economic development, institutional constraints, level of formalization of the labor
market, and tax administration capacity. Where these are weak, countries rely more
on revenues from private and external sources for health. Private revenue—mainly
user payments on fees charged by providers—amounts to 62 percent of total health
funds in low-income countries (Figure 2.1). User fees have raised concerns about the
financial consequences for poor households and the negative effect on health service
use (Table 2.1). As countries grow economically, public revenue for health comes to
predominate.

Recent syntheses of impact evaluations find that increasing public spending and
lowering payments for patients positively affects health outcomes. Using a large
panel dataset at the country level, with annual data for 14 years (1995–2008),
Moreno-Serra and Smith (2011) applied a two-step instrumental variables approach
that directly estimates the reverse causal effects of mortality on coverage indicators.
They found that higher public spending on health leads to better population
outcomes, measured either by under-five or adult mortality rates.2 A synthesis
report of 16 impact evaluations found that introducing user fees decreases
utilization of care, whereas removing them sharply increases utilization of curative
services (Lagarde and Palmer 2011). A systematic review of 20 impact evaluations of
user fees for maternal health services found that the removal of such fees contributes

External sources               Governments allocate funds for political                   Rigidity because of fragmented
from donors                       reasons and to priority diseases                            and earmarked funding
a. Private insurers charge premiums that reflect the risk of illness for an individual or a group of individuals.

However, many developing countries struggle to mobilize adequate and stable
resources because they report low tax ratios, with tax revenues often below 15
percent of gross domestic product (GDP) (IMF 2011). Thus these governments have
little room to increase spending on health through domestic revenues. Still, the
financing of increasing demand for costlier treatment for noncommunicable diseases
(such as diabetes) and the treatment of infectious diseases put a heavy strain on their
budgets. In response, governments try to manage public spending on health by
setting caps on sector spending, prioritizing spending within the sector, and using
central oversight (IMF 2011).

Governments have introduced taxes on wages and alcohol and tobacco to raise
additional revenues for health, which can have efficiency and welfare implications.3
If governments impose taxes on wages to finance insurance enrollment, this may
affect efficiency if it leads to a reduction in the quantity of hours worked and
increases informality (Table 2.1). Indirect taxes levied on goods with externalities,
such as alcohol and tobacco, can increase efficiency because they aim to influence
individual behavior, reduce negative externalities on others, and subsequently curb
the incidence of costly diseases caused by alcohol and tobacco consumption (Begg et
al. 2000). Although excise taxes on alcohol and tobacco are regressive, they have a
welfare effect if the poor benefit disproportionately more than the rich in health. Nor
do excise taxes have adverse effects on labor and capital (IMF 2011).

                                                          REVENUE COLLECTION FOR HEALTH
Only a small share of total health revenue comes from voluntary premiums paid to
private insurance. Outside the United States, revenues from voluntary health
insurance contribute less than 15 percent of total health revenues in Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries (OECD 2013). In
developing countries, voluntary private health insurance raises a negligible share of
total health revenues (Gottret and Schieber 2006). Few countries have community-
based health insurance (CBHI), which is financed by individual contributions and in
some countries subsidized by government and donor funds.

Despite the low share of government spending in low-income countries,
governments still have much influence as most external resources are routed
through them to finance the public health sector. External funds can, however,
contribute to fragmentation in financing and service delivery, especially if they are
earmarked for specific diseases, and draw away health workers and other resources
from general care (Table 2.1). External funding can also be driven by external
priorities, introducing both rigidity and instability into a country’s health sector
funding.


Bank Group Support to Revenue Collection for Health
The World Bank Group has tried to help countries address the above challenges.
Two-thirds of the Bank’s health financing portfolio includes interventions related to
public revenue collection for health; however, this type of Bank support has been
decreasing over time. Development policy operations are almost twice as likely as
investment lending projects to advise governments on public revenues (appendix
Table B.4).

The Bank’s approach has been to help countries raise revenues to address market
failure, public goods, and equity objectives. The Bank assisted countries in raising
adequate levels of revenues to finance the government health budget and health
insurance. It advised governments on revenues raised in the form of labor taxes and
other contributions to social health insurance paid by employees, employers, and the
self-employed, and on user payments made by patients to providers.

ANALYTICAL WORK
Multisector Bank teams produced analytical work, including Public Expenditure
Reviews (PERs), tracking surveys, and fiscal space analysis, that informed
governments and other donors about the level of public revenues for health and the
allocation of funds within the sector (appendix Table A.9). Bank teams conducted 98
and at least 10 Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys since 2006 (appendix Table



                                                                                    17
CHAPTER 2
REVENUE COLLECTION FOR HEALTH
A.10). However, the number of PERs with a health chapter has fluctuated and
decreased over time to less than 10 reviews per year. Medium-term expenditure
frameworks were supported by the World Bank in Madagascar, Nepal, and
Rwanda, and helped inform governments and donors about health expenditure
planning. In 2010 the Bank developed a conceptual framework for assessing fiscal
space for health (Tandon and Cashin 2010). Since 2009 the Bank has conducted about
eight fiscal space analyses to advice governments on how to feasibly increase
revenues for health in a way consistent with the country’s macroeconomic
fundamentals. More recently in 2013, the Bank produced a series of macro-fiscal
context and health financing fact sheets for all Regions (Pande et al. 2013).

DOMESTIC REVENUES FOR HEALTH FROM GENERAL TAXES
The Bank tailors its advice to the country context. In low-income settings the Bank
advised governments to increase their budgets for health, often with the support of
Poverty Reduction Support Credits. In some countries tobacco taxation is earmarked
for health and other social spending. Bank analytical work advised on using tobacco
taxes to create fiscal space for health, mainly in middle-income countries, including
China (2003), Estonia (2004), Morocco (2004), Indonesia (2005), Brazil (2007), The
Gambia (2012), and the Philippines (2012) as well as the Southeast Asia Region (2004).

COMPULSORY CONTRIBUTIONS AND VOLUNTARY PREMIUMS TO INSURANCE
In a few European countries the Bank advised on labor taxes and on domestic
revenue financing for social health insurance mainly through development policy
operations. Where labor tax rates were already high, the Bank warned about adverse
effects for the labor market and for informal workers.

The World Bank and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) did not advise on
the level of premiums paid to voluntary private health insurance.

USER PAYMENTS
Only 14 percent of Bank health financing projects advised governments, (mainly in
the Africa and Europe and Central Asia Regions), on the level of user payments
(appendix Table B.5). The Bank through development policy operations
recommended introducing copayments with exemptions for lower-income groups in
Romania and for preventive services in Burkina Faso. Analytical work by the Bank
on under-the-table payments made by patients to providers (Cherecheş et al. 2013)
has not been followed up in projects, even though the measurement of progress
toward the objective of improved governance, accountability, and transparency is an
indicator in the Health, Nutrition, and Population (HNP) strategy.

Effectiveness of World Bank Group Support to Revenue Collection
This section focuses on how Bank advice has affected institution building and the
level of revenues for government health budgets and social insurance. It presents
evidence on Bank support to nonpooled funding in the form of user payments and
how they have affected service use. Increased domestic revenues and subsidized
contribution payments to social insurance mean that more pooled public funds are
available for health. The effects associated with pooled financing are presented in
chapter 3.

STRENGTHEN REVENUE RAISING INSTITUTIONS
In its analytical work, the Bank emphasized that strong institutions are crucial in
ensuring that higher public spending positively affects the provision of care. Several
Bank studies find a correlation between public health spending and utilization of
care when institutions are strong, and Bank teams found that public sector spending
improves health indicators in low-income and transition countries, mainly those
with good governance systems (Gupta et al. 2002; Baldacci et al. 2008). In 2009,
during the financial crisis, the Bank’s Europe and Central Asia Region reiterated the
importance of good governance in revenue management in its Knowledge Briefs for
client countries and staff.

The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) found that the Bank through lending and
policy dialogue helped governments build institutional and technical capacity, and
in some countries, Bank teams worked well with government staff. Institution
building took place in Argentina where the Bank helped re-establish the ministerial
and provincial health committee to coordinate health financing decision in the
country (IEG 2011). The Bank supported technical capacity building through the
introduction of National Health Accounts in governments to track the flow of funds,
mainly in middle-income countries in the Europe and Central Asia Region
(including Albania, Armenia, Kosovo, Moldova, Serbia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan)
as well as in Mauritania and Vietnam. Information produced by government
National Health Accounts was used by Bank public expenditure review teams, other
donors and the government in health expenditure planning. While health accounts
proved to be useful and informative, this support did not always succeed in
institutionalizing the health account function within Ministries of Health (IEG 2014).

Because many institutions are involved, coordination is important. IEG found that in
Tanzania, the Ministry of Health and the Bank produced their own individual PER
in 2011, drawing from different datasets and thus producing different results. The
Bank’s PER was distributed but never published officially. As the discrepancies
between the two PERs were not reconciled, the Ministry of Health uses its own


                                                                                      19

report. Collaboration between the Bank and government teams could have helped
ensure that health financing analysis is coordinated and institutionalized in
Ministries of Health.

INCREASED AND PROTECTED HEALTH BUDGETS
With the support of the Bank’s development policy operations and policy dialogue,
health budgets increased during the loan period in several lower-income countries
(for example, Afghanistan, Albania, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, El Salvador,
Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Mali, and Niger). However, these budget
increases were not always sustained. IEG found in Tanzania, the Bank worked
closely with other donors to ensure the government would maintain the share of
public funding for health. Donors and the Bank decided to disburse earmarked
funds to local government health budgets (in a sectorwide approach) and not move
to general budget support when concerns were raised that this change would lead to
a decrease in overall public spending for health. Despite these efforts, government
spending on health decreased from 16 percent in 2007 to 11 percent of total
government expenditures in 2011. The reasons for this decrease included a shift in
government priorities from social sectors to infrastructure as outlined in the 2010
National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty, commonly known as
MKUKUTA. Similarly, in the Kyrgyz Republic, Bank policy lending in 2002
supported the government in increasing its budgetary share for health to finance
health insurance coverage for pensioners and unemployed persons and implement a
categorical grant formula for health financed from the central government with the
goal of decreasing the share of user payments among the poor. Until 2006,
government spending on health increased steadily but then declined again to similar
levels as in early 2000 because of increased government priorities for other sectors,
including education (IEG 2008). The decline in budget financing for health was
addressed under a Bank-supported follow-up operation (sectorwide approach), and
the government implemented a set of rules governing the allocation and execution
of public funds to the health sector. Subsequently, spending on health increased
from 10.3 percent of total government spending in 2005 to 13 percent by 2012. Thus,
competing government priorities play a role in raising revenue for health.

Bank advice through lending and technical assistance helped raise additional taxes.
One Bank policy operation (Romania) advised an increase in tobacco taxes in 2009;
however, as Romania follows European Union rules,4 this increase would have
happened without the Bank’s input. In the Philippines, the Bank responded quickly
with a multisector team to government requests to help it get the “sin tax on tobacco”
through a reluctant Congress. The government of the Philippines reports substantial
revenue increases from the tax, which will translate into higher funding for health

programs (AER 2014). While some countries have increased tobacco taxation, recent
studies from Brazil (Euromonitor International 2013) and Indonesia (Nasrudin et al.
2013) suggest that the tax rate is not high enough. There is scope for the Bank to
address tobacco taxation in low-income countries. At the same time, impoverishing
effects caused by regressive taxation need to be addressed.

Bank advice on managing or protecting public revenues for health was informed by
analytical work and implemented in close collaboration between the Health and
Public Sector teams. IEG’s review of project completion reports found that in Bosnia
and Herzegovina, Colombia, and Serbia the Bank’s Public Sector and Health teams
(mainly through development policy operations) supported improvements in the
tax collection from employers and employees which increased revenue transfers
from the tax authority to social health insurance. In Eastern Europe, including in
Croatia and Turkey, the Bank recommended budgetary caps on spending to manage
spending growth. Bank policy lending protected the level of budgetary spending
from cuts in Latvia and Tajikistan during the financial crisis, and thereby helped the
government implement recommendations from recent PERs. During the economic
crisis in 2010, Bank policy lending advised the Latvian government to subsidize
health payments for low-income households and raise the number of nurses in
health facilities to accommodate increased patient demand. In light of fiscal austerity
in Argentina, Bank lending and policy advice ensured that basic and cost-effective
health programs were protected and financed by the government, including the
availability of reproductive health care services for low-income groups in public
facilities (IEG 2011). In these countries, the Bank’s Health and Public Sector teams
leveraged support through a program of policy and investment lending that was
informed by analytical work such as PERs and fiscal analysis.

SUBSIDIZED CONTRIBUTION PAYMENTS
The Bank also helped increase revenues for health by subsidizing contributions to
various insurance institutions for low-income groups. This type of Bank support
was implemented through lending and policy dialogue in countries such as Benin,
Bolivia, Cambodia, the Dominican Republic, Ghana, Mexico, Rwanda, Turkey, and
Vietnam. The Bank supported the explicit targeting of subsidies to finance
contributions for low-income groups through means testing in Georgia, Rwanda,
and Turkey and through geographic location in Cambodia and Egypt.

In other countries, similar support served to subsidize access to health insurance for
low-income groups. Vietnam’s public insurance fund is financed from payroll taxes
and general tax revenues. For households not active in the formal sector, the
government makes contributions, defined as a proportion of the minimum wage,
from the state budget. In Vietnam’s Mekong Region the Bank health project


                                                                                    21
CHAPTER 2
REVENUE COLLECTION FOR HEALTH
cofinanced enrollment for near-poor households in the Health Care Fund for the
Poor. In Georgia, Bank lending supported the publicly funded Medical Insurance
Program for the poor, which provides an extensive benefit package with zero
copayments. Low-income beneficiaries receive a publicly funded voucher to enroll
with a private insurance company (Bauhoff et al. 2011). IEG found that in Rwanda
the Bank provided technical assistance on the law for CBHI.5 Under this law, the
government and donors subsidize CBHI enrollment for the three lower-income
quintiles through means-tested targeting while the remaining households pay full
contributions. By 2010 about 44 percent of CBHI revenue was from the government
budget, 31 percent from households, and 22 percent from donors. As a result of this
Bank support, insurance enrollment has increased in these countries. Whether these
subsidized contribution payments have also improved service use among pool
members is discussed in chapter 3.

SERVICE USE AND FINANCIAL PROTECTION
As shown in Figure 2.1, user payments are the most important revenue source for
the health sector in lower-income countries. Bank advice on reducing user fees and
copayments has fiscal and equity implications. However, this type of support often
lacked the necessary analytical underpinnings, and—contrary to findings from other
researchers (Lagarde and Palmer 2011; Dzakpasu et al. 2013)—evidence is missing
that reducing copayment levels improved service use and financial protection.
While the Bank had recommended introducing copayments with exemptions for
lower-income groups in Romania, a recent study found that, compared with those in
neighboring countries, households in Romania are far more likely to forgo care
because they cannot afford the fees, and young people are more likely to borrow or
sell assets to pay for care (Tambor et al. 2013). In El Salvador the Bank supported the
elimination of copayments in hospitals but did not prepare providers enough for the
resulting demand increase. A 2011 evaluation finds a 40 percent increase in service
use after user fees were abolished, and raises concerns about transparency and
corruption in finances at unaudited hospitals. It recommends increasing staffing in
hospitals to reduce waiting lists caused by the higher number of patients (AfGH
2011). A case study prepared by IEG for this evaluation found similar concerns in
Kenya where the new government had just eliminated user fees for primary care in
2013 and was to allocate higher public funding for primary care to compensate for
forgone revenues from user fees. The Bank estimated that an additional $8.1 million
is needed to compensate providers. It also identified challenges on the flow of health
funds to health facilities in a decentralized system. The Bank could analyze the fiscal
and equity implications of changes in user fees, as emphasized in the HNP strategy,
and inform governments on the amount of public funds needed to compensate
providers for reduced or eliminated fees.

                                                                       REVENUE COLLECTION FOR HEALTH
In sum, most Bank support in health financing went to public revenue collection for
health. As a result of the Bank’s help, government health budgets were increased;
health spending was protected against budget cuts during an economic crisis; advice
on fiscal space for health was considered; and governments were assisted in
subsidizing compulsory contributions to various health insurance for low-income
groups. Some timely advice on a greater role for alcohol and tobacco taxes has been
given, but this is very limited. Public Sector and Health teams emphasized strong
institutions and monitoring and evaluation to ensure revenues positively affect the
provision of care. While this type of support has been decreasing over time, there
have been some notable successes. Evidence indicates that these have occurred with
strong government commitment at both the economy-wide and sector levels that the
Bank has supported and when Bank staff drew on a variety of skills across the Bank
to engage government. Bank advice and operations have also supported
governments which have tried to lower user payments as a source of revenue.
However, this type of support often lacked the necessary fiscal and equity analysis,
and evidence is missing that Bank support to reduce copayments has improved

3 Governments raise direct taxes from earnings, indirect taxes on consumption, and wealth taxes. A
tax system is considered fair if it generates higher taxes on the rich to finance public goods and
services, such as health services, predominantly used by the poor. Indirect taxes on consumption
(e.g., value-added taxes) are regressive if the poor spend a higher proportion of their income on
goods subject to these taxes than the rich. While such indirect taxes reduce the redistribution effect
from the rich to the poor, they may still have a pro-poor effect if they finance public services
predominantly used by the poor (Begg et al. 2000; IMF 2011).

3. Pooling Health Funds and Risks
Highlights
 Risk pooling is important to address equity and financial sustainability in health. Countries have
  multiple pooling arrangements, leading to unequal risk distributions across pools and to different
  pools for the various socioeconomic groups.
 World Bank support contributed to increased risk pooling in middle-income countries. Similarly, the
  International Finance Corporation supported risk pooling through public and private insurance.
 The World Bank Group built institutional, management, and technical capacity in government and
  insurance administration to manage funds and risks, and Bank analytical work informed policy
  decisions. However, Bank assistance to health insurance has been diminishing over time. Projects
  were less effective in countries with decentralized health systems.
 Equity in pooling has improved where the Bank helped subsidize coverage of the poor. But
  coverage did not always lead to pro-poor spending, improved service use, or greater financial
  protection. Fragmented pooling remains an issue and can affect efficiency. Success factors
  included strength in institutions, management, technical capacity, and information.

With the exception of user payments, all revenues for health are pooled in public
and private health insurance and in central and local government budgets, and then
transferred to providers. Pooled financing reallocates funds from healthy to sick
individuals—that is, from individuals with a low risk of illness to those with a high
risk who are more likely to occur higher health care costs. As countries grow
economically, pooled health financing in national health systems and health
insurance comes to dominate revenues from user payments.

The objective of pooling is to reduce the out-of-pocket price the patient pays when
using services and to ensure financial protection against catastrophic health
payments and equity in service use. But managing health revenues in a way that
ensures equitable and efficient pooling is a major challenge (Gottret and Schieber
2006). Also, increased pooling contributes to higher health spending by increasing
the demand for health care.

Increased pooling, in national health systems or through insurance, benefits
consumers and providers. Individuals who are insured or covered in the public
system will copay less when seeking care. They are thus expected to report greater
service use and lower copayments than those who pay user fees. Increased pooling
is also good for providers because user payments from patients are erratic revenues
in low-income environments. Instead, contracted providers will receive a stable
amount of revenues from the government and insurers to treat patients (Box 3.1).


                                                                                                   26

                                                                POOLING HEALTH FUNDS AND RISKS
Box 3.1. Risk Pooling Arrangements
Countries introduce different risk-pooling arrangements to protect individuals against the
financial risk of illness. In health systems with automatic coverage, public revenues are
pooled in the government’s health budget, and the public sector plays an insurance role,
even if it is not formally constituted as an insurance plan (Kutzin 2007; Savedoff et al. 2012).
The government transfers revenues from the central and local government budgets to
providers to pay for health care services provided to the population. In countries with
decentralized health systems (such as Argentina, Kazakhstan, and the Philippines), health
revenues from the central and local governments are pooled at the local level (state or
region) and transferred to providers to finance health care delivery to patients.
In addition, public and private health insurers pool health funds, including from individual
contributions, premium payments, and government subsidized contributions, to pay for the
financial risk of illness among their members.

Chapter 3 summarizes the challenges related to automatic coverage and to
mandatory and voluntary pooling. It then describes support from the International
Finance Corporation (IFC) and World Bank to countries in meeting them. It offers
evidence on how this support to pooling affects equity in health financing and
service use, financial protection, and efficiency.


Challenges
In most countries, multiple pooling arrangements coexist, leading to a risk of
fragmentation. Generally, formal sector workers are covered under mandatory
social insurance; higher-income groups can afford paying higher premium to enroll
with private voluntary insurance (to access specialist care and private providers);
and the government provides automatic coverage in public health facilities for those
who are excluded from these insurance arrangements, mainly the lower-income and
informal sector groups. As a result, different socioeconomic groups pool their health
risk among themselves in different institutions with different revenue raising
capacity and access to different health benefits. The resulting fragmentation raises
concerns about equity in service use across different groups. It also raises concerns
about the financial sustainability of small risk pools (Box 3.2).

One of the main challenges in government health systems (automatic coverage) in
low- and middle-income countries is that government allocations are often not pro-
poor. Instead, a higher share of funds is allocated to hospitals in urban areas, which
are mainly used by the wealthier (Table 3.1). To improve pro-poor spending, some
countries have earmarked transfers to providers mainly used by low-income groups.
In Mexico, for instance, the Seguro Popular is an intergovernmental revenue transfer
within the national health system from the center to the states. The transfer is

Popular and is cofinanced by the states.

a. In some countries including Georgia, India, and Slovakia, private insurers offer mandatory insurance coverage.

Mandatory participation by law in public or private health insurance limits
insurance coverage to all or a defined population group (e.g., formal sector
employees). The excluded are mainly lower-income groups who work in the
informal sector—the majority of the population in developing countries (Table 3.1).
They receive automatic coverage through the public system; however, this is often
less comprehensive. The small membership size of social insurance in countries with
nascent formal sectors can endanger an insurer’s financial viability. A fiscal and
equity problem can arise if the government has to finance the deficit caused by the
medical service use of wealthier insurance members (Box 3.2).

Box 3.2. Financial Incentives May Endanger the Sustainability of Risk Pools
Risk pooling involves trade-offs between equity gains caused by reduced uncertainty about
the financial consequences of ill health and efficiency losses created by financial incentives
(Arrow 1963; Cutler and Zeckhauser 2000; Zeckhauser 1970). These incentives, which
include adverse selection, moral hazard, and supply side–induced demand, can lead to
higher costs for the risk pool and endanger its financial sustainability.
Adverse selection arises when those enrolling in voluntary risk pools are mainly high-risk
individuals, resulting in high-cost pools that may not be financially viable. Moral hazard
occurs when pool members overuse medical services because they copay at a reduced price
for care, which can increase costs. Finally, providers who are reimbursed by the pool based
on fee-for-service payments have a financial incentive to oversupply care, which also leads
to higher costs.

Some governments introduced separate institutions to pool public funds and health
risk for informal sector groups. Thailand, for example, has established the
government-funded Universal Coverage Scheme, which uses tax revenues to

                                                                              CHAPTER 3
                                                          POOLING HEALTH FUNDS AND RISKS
provide coverage for individuals not covered by formal sector social insurance.
Benin and Cambodia created health equity funds to strengthen financial risk
protection among the poor and informal sector groups. While they differ in design,
these funds were set up to manage health care subsidies for eligible population
groups.

The volume of voluntary pooling in private health insurance is inconsequential. Few
people can afford voluntary private insurance, and there are generally not that many
private providers to contract with in developing countries (appendix D). Private
health insurance pays mainly for services not covered by social insurance or by the
government (e.g., specialist care in the private sector) and is used to avoid waiting
lists for elective treatment. To ensure their financial viability, private insurers have
an incentive to enroll people at low risk of being ill.

Community-based health insurance (CBHI) is more prominent in Africa for informal
sector groups. While members of such schemes often report better access than those
who pay user fees, they tend to have access to a smaller benefit package than those
with social health insurance (SHI). In addition, voluntary pooling in private
insurance and CBHI may lead to adverse selection resulting in small, high-risk pools
with predominantly sicker individuals, and may undermine pool finances (Box 3.2).


Bank Group Support to Risk Pooling
The World Bank Group has tried to help countries address challenges in pooling
arrangements. About 40 percent of the Bank’s health financing operations support
automatic coverage through national health systems or enrollment into mandatory
health insurance in 36 countries.

The Bank Group does not take an ideological stance on risk pooling arrangements. It
did not advocate for SHI or automatic coverage through national health systems, or
promote private health insurance. Rather, it works within different country and risk
pooling contexts. The Bank assisted Ministries of Health and local governments
managing and implementing their health budgets. Management and information
capacity was also built with Bank and IFC support in public and private health
insurance.

ANALYTICAL WORK
The Bank produced several analytical reports, mainly in middle-income countries, to
inform governments about the challenges of different risk pooling arrangements in
different contexts. Of the 70 economic and sector work activities, a relevant word
search suggests that 15 have tackled pooling. In addition, the Bank conducted eight


                                                                                     29
CHAPTER 3
POOLING HEALTH FUNDS AND RISKS
impact evaluations on risk pooling in China and Vietnam (appendix Table A.8). It
also carried out limited analysis on the welfare effect of increased pooling of
domestic revenues and whether the poor benefit. Only 10 Bank poverty assessments
examined the distributional aspects of public spending and conducted benefit
incidence analysis (see chapter 5).

AUTOMATIC COVERAGE THROUGH NATIONAL HEALTH SYSTEMS
The Bank provided technical assistance to improve resource management in
national health systems. Decentralization of funding to lower levels of government
was supported in several countries including Cambodia, Indonesia, Kosovo,
Pakistan, Rwanda, and Serbia. It helped build technical capacity to manage fund
pooling and health resources in Afghanistan, Cambodia, and Vietnam. The Bank has
helped countries target the poor through automatic coverage in national health
systems. In Argentina it supported the introduction of the Plan Nacer program,
which targets supply-side subsidies to health facilities used by the poor (IEG 2011).

Depending on the country context, Bank support to automatic health coverage was
accompanied by public sector measures to strengthen the public management of
health funds. In Afghanistan the Bank supported expenditure management through
program-based budgeting which links health sector spending to the national
strategy and to prioritize allocation. In Kenya and Tanzania it helped with public
expenditure tracking to identify inefficiencies in spending. In Kenya the Poverty
Reduction and Economic Management and Health, Nutrition, and Population
(HNP) teams worked with the government to improve budget transparency by
adding more detailed line items to track health expenditure.

PUBLIC AND PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE
The Bank has advised several low- and middle-income countries on the level of
contributions paid to social insurers and on subsidized enrollment. The Bank also
supported the strengthening of health insurance governance and management.

The IFC has made only two direct investments in private health insurance (both
originating from the Financial Markets Group) and two investments in a health
maintenance organization (HMO) provider network (appendix Table D.3). The IFC
has supported the expansion of Nigeria’s largest integrated HMO provider network
with two investments and one advisory services project (2007 and 2009), and
provided funding through its Performance-Based Grants initiative to support a
project under the Global Program on Output-Based Aid to support the HMO’s
community-based health plan targeting the informal sector. And it has supported
the expansion of private insurance providers in the Europe and Central Asia and the
Middle East and North Africa Regions with two equity investments in 2011 and

2012, respectively. IFC has recently approved a micro health insurance advisory
project in India (appendix D).

Two equity funds have been established as part of the Health in Africa Initiative
(HiA)—the Africa Health Fund and the Investment Fund for Health in Africa. Both
funds include insurance as target investments. They have invested in insurance
companies and HMOs in Kenya, Nigeria, and Tanzania. The initiative has also
supported governments in Kenya and Nigeria in strengthening their public health
insurer through IFC’s advisory services. IFC support to the government of Uganda
in reforming legal and regulatory frameworks aims to increase private sector
participation in publicly funded health programs (appendix D).


Effectiveness of World Bank Group Support to Pooling
In practice, risk pooling may not work as expected for several reasons. This section
examines how effectively Bank Group support to risk pooling has helped countries
develop management and technical capacity, and improve equity in pooling, service
use, financial protection, efficiency and financial sustainability of risk pools.

MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL CAPACITY
Management and technical capacity is important to ensure that health budgets in
central and local governments are effectively implemented. Although the Bank has
supported governments in increasing their health budget, budget implementation is
limited in some countries. Low budget-execution rates were reported in Afghanistan
and the Democratic Republic of Congo because of constrained technical capacity,
lack of financial authority, and complicated financial and procurement procedures.
In Afghanistan, Bank analytical work also found no clear targeting of public funds
to areas with worse health outcomes, and the funds spent by the government and
donors on health were not coordinated across provinces (Belay 2010). More recently,
the IEG case study found, the Bank played an effective coordinating role among
donors and emphasized the use of M&E which supported the government in
evidence-based fund management. In Brazil, Bank support to building the
institutional foundations at municipality level—including budget management,
accounting, monitoring, financial management, and managerial capacity—
contributed to the timely execution of the health budget in a decentralized health
system (IEG 2011).

Through its multisector analytic work, the Bank provides important information about
public sector reforms (such as decentralization) that affect health financing. The
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) found that in Kenya, the Bank’s Health and Public



                                                                                   31
CHAPTER 3
POOLING HEALTH FUNDS AND RISKS

Sector teams have spearheaded several analytical products and policy discussions in
health financing. The Public Sector team was supporting a fiscal space analysis to
ascertain the efficiency of the health sector and determine the value for money
aspect. Bank work through the 2012 Public Expenditure Review and a Public
Expenditure Tracking Survey with sub-national analysis and frontier analysis helped
identify inefficiencies and informed the government about challenges that need to be
addressed in health sector devolution (appendix E). This type of Bank analysis helped
inform policy makers in their management and technical decisions.

Health financing projects in decentralized health systems with automatic coverage
performed worse than the average health financing projects in ratings of the IEG.1
Examples include projects in Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Ghana, and
Mauritania, where the Bank overestimated the political commitment and technical
knowledge in the government to decentralize, and failed to calibrate project design
to local capacity.

In Indonesia, three Bank health projects assisted the government in shifting
responsibilities for planning and management of resources to district authorities.
While district health budgets tripled, the additional resources were insufficient and
ineffectually allocated. Allocation formulas were not adequately poverty calibrated,
and the limited own-revenue raising capacity of poorer districts negatively affected
horizontal equity across districts. Few districts reached the target of allocating at
least 15 percent of local government spending to health, and health service use
among the poor and near-poor increased very modestly in some districts and
decreased in others. IEG found several factors that limited the success of Bank-
supported health sector decentralization in Indonesia, including insufficient
attention to define roles and responsibilities at different government levels,
inadequate information systems, and considerable overlap and duplication of tasks
across government (including in management of human resources) that generated
inefficiencies in the organization and delivery of services. The Bank did help
introduce better planning and budgeting methods that over time have helped
improve information systems for regional monitoring. IEG concluded that Bank
support to health decentralization needs to be grounded in a realistic understanding
of how institutions work, and how they can be expected to change in the political
context in which projects operate (IEG 2013).

Bank technical assistance and lending helped governments develop new laws and
administration to strengthen social insurance management, mainly in middle-income
countries. Following Bank advice governments in Albania, the Dominican Republic,
Serbia, and Vietnam introduced changes to health insurance laws and regulations. In
Turkey it gave advice on the Social Security Administration law and hospital budgets.

                                                        POOLING HEALTH FUNDS AND RISKS
Governments in European countries introduced measures to stem the deficit in health
insurance as recommended in PERs and analytical work supported under policy
lending. Bank loans financed beneficiary identification and medical claims
management systems in Georgia, Montenegro, and Serbia, and improved efficiency in
insurance management. In these countries, Bank Public Sector and Health teams
worked closely on these reforms, which contributed to successful implementation.

Although the HNP strategy highlights the Bank’s comparative advantage in health
insurance analytical capacity, Bank teams did not always maintain support to health
insurance and address shortcomings in management and institutional capacity. In
Tanzania in the 1990s and early 2000s, the Bank was instrumental in setting up the
National Health Insurance Fund, the National Social Security Fund and the
Community Health Fund. However, by the mid-2000s, the Bank reduced its
engagement in these funds, partly because of changes in Bank resources as well as
reduced demand for Bank assistance by the government as other donors increased
their health financing technical assistance. By 2013, only about 8.6 percent of the
population is insured in Tanzania, enrollment is highly unequal, and the National
Health Insurance Fund has high financial reserves because investments are tied up,
and because of a lack of understanding among health facility managers about how
to submit a medical claim to the fund to get paid for care provided to insured
patients. Little additional reforms were introduced to address these shortcomings.
IEG finds that given the strong Bank involvement in the past, the Bank team could
have provided further analysis and technical assistance to the funds to strengthen
institutions and management capacity, especially since the government is now
considering scaling-up insurance and raising labor taxes to finance enrollment. In
Bolivia, IEG found that the Bank was instrumental in helping the government
establish health insurance for mothers, children, and the elderly; however, this
support was not maintained over time. Similar concerns were identified in Ghana
and Rwanda, where Bank support to health insurance management has been
reduced over time partly due to a shift in government priorities and Bank resources
(appendix E).

In the Kyrgyz Republic the Mandatory Health Insurance Fund is nearly all funded
from general government revenues and manages a state-guaranteed benefit package
for the whole population. The fund is also the sole purchasing agency for health
services within the health system (Kutzin 2013). The Bank has supported these
reforms in collaboration with other donors, through analytical work and capacity
building and as a convener of donor efforts. Health reforms have benefited from
strong political commitment and technical capacity, which are important success
factors. They include the 10-year (1996–2005) government health reform strategy,
several champions in the government in support of the reforms, and effective use of

monitoring and evaluation (M&E) so that early successes could be publicized and
used to generate support for subsequent reforms. In addition, Bank interventions
and policy dialogue at key moments of political opposition sustained momentum
for insurance reforms (IEG 2008).

Under the HiA, IFC has conducted a strategic review of Kenya’s National Hospital
Insurance Fund (IFC 2011a) and a market assessment of prepaid plans (IFC 2011b).
Its recommendations were accepted by the government and are now being
implemented. Through a follow-on advisory project, IFC is assisting the government
on integrating private hospitals into the national health system (e.g., regulatory
framework for accreditation and contracting with private providers). The
evaluation’s case study found the Bank is also working on recommendations made
by IFC through a project on health insurance subsidies for low-income groups
(appendixes D and E).

EQUITY IN POOLING
Ensuring that pooling arrangements are equitable requires an effective way to cross-
subsidize across pool members and to inject the pools with a sufficient amount of
public funds that are sustainable. In health systems with automatic coverage, the
Bank conducted a few incidence analyses to alert governments to issues in pro-poor
allocation of funds. In Indonesia the Bank found that overall allocation of public
spending on health is low and spending needs to be increased strategically to reach
the poor effectively and to include demand-side measures. In Ghana the Bank
identified increased pro-poor spending over time. However, in Nicaragua it found
that public spending on social services is not pro-poor—it benefits all socioeconomic
groups about equally.

The share of poor included in risk pools increased where the Bank helped
governments subsidize their enrollment (Box 3.3). In Turkey insurance coverage for
the poorest increased more than fourfold between 2003 and 2011, generating a
coverage rate of 85 percent for the poorest (Atun et al. 2013). The public health
insurance has recently incorporated the Green Card Program, which subsidizes
health care for the poorest income group and is funded by general government
revenues (Atun et al. 2013). Similarly, in Colombia the Bank’s development policy
operation helped increase the enrollment of low-income groups in government-
subsidized insurance from 10.7 million in 2002 to 18.2 million in 2007. By March
2014, about 43 million individuals or 90 percent of the population was insured in
Colombia (www.sispro.gov.co). In Rwanda, IEG found that Bank support to the
CBHI law makes insurance enrollment mandatory and increased CBHI enrollment
to about 85 percent of the population by 2012. A Bank project in the Philippines

reached the poor in the National Health Insurance Indigent Program, but the
percentage enrolled is unknown.


Box 3.3. Bank Analysis Informed Risk Pooling in China and Vietnam
Researchers have found that individuals enrolled with the voluntary Vietnamese Health
Insurance (VHI) program were more likely to use outpatient care, and the poorest insured
are 10 times more likely to seek care than the uninsured. But there were concerns that
adverse selection and the use of unnecessary care would threaten the financial sustainability
of VHI (Jowett et al. 2004). The Bank, using data from the late 1990s, confirmed improved
health outcomes among VHI members (Wagstaff and Pradhan 2005). Informed by these
studies, the Bank and other donors through the Second Poverty Reduction Support Credit in
2003 helped the government establish the Health Care Fund for the Poor (HCFP), which
provides the same benefits as the VHI. In a follow-up study the Bank found that 60 percent
of eligible households were covered by 2006, and the HCFP was well targeted to the poor;
however, there was adverse selection (Wagstaff 2010). To address selection problems, Bank
lending helped increase HCFP enrollment to 96 percent among the poor and 42 percent
among the near-poor by 2011.
In China, based on data from the late 1990s up to 2004, the Bank found that the Rural
Cooperative Medical Scheme diminished the risk of high user payments for households
(Wagstaff and Lindelow 2005), and ill health can have a large impact on household income,
labor supply, and medical expenditures, even for the insured, raising concerns about the
effectiveness of the Scheme (Lindelow and Wagstaff 2005). This was followed up by an
impact evaluation of the government-subsidized New Cooperative Medical Scheme
(NCMS) established in 2003, which found lower enrollment among the poor and higher
enrollment among the chronically sick, pointing to adverse selection. Service use increased,
but the NCMS did not reduce user spending for the poor (Wagstaff et al. 2007). Informed by
these studies, the Bank has supported the NCMS since 2009. Enrollment increased to 99
percent in 2012.

In some countries, Bank support was less successful in targeting the poor for
inclusion in risk pools. In Tunisia only 9 percent of the eligible poor are covered
under the government-funded Free Medical Assistance Program. The poor are not
reached because of institutional constraints including nontransparent eligibility
criteria that are subject to manipulation,2 and the Bank could in fact have addressed
weak targeting of the poor in the policy dialogue (IEG 2014). In Georgia, despite
means testing supported by the Bank, a significant proportion of eligible households
were excluded from the Medical Insurance Program, mainly because of insufficient
information (Bauhoff et al. 2011).

In Ghana the National Health Insurance System covers 40 percent of the population,
which are predominantly the nonpoor. The Bank was instrumental in convincing the
government to extend coverage to children and youths under the age of 18 and
pregnant women to achieve the relevant Millennium Development Goals. It also


                                                                                          35
CHAPTER 3
POOLING HEALTH FUNDS AND RISKS
discussed a more generous definition of the poor, which according to the National
Health Insurance System is only 1.7 percent of the population and far below the
national poverty rate of 30 percent (appendix E). But reaching the poor requires
commitment by government. IEG found that insufficient political and financial
commitment by the government and limited implementation capacity were
constraining factors to reforms as was weak M&E systems to track equity in access
for insured and uninsured individuals (IEG 2007).

The IFC supported private and public health insurers that provide both mandatory
and voluntary coverage mainly for formal sector employees. In IFC’s managed-care
investments in Nigeria, HMO enrollees are primarily federal employees and
employees of large corporations and members of the National Health Insurance
Scheme. There is no evidence from the IFC’s Development Outcome Tracking
System to suggest the 1.2 million HMO enrollees in Nigeria and 613,000 patients
served as of FY13 were poor. In Kenya, IFC advisory support to the public insurer
contributed to expanding coverage to civil servants. IFC support also resulted in the
government’s decision to expand health insurance subsidies to the indigent
population (poorest 9 million Kenyans). IFC assisted the government of Meghalaya
(India) with the contracting of a private insurer to offer health insurance to low-
income individuals. In Tanzania, the Investment Fund for Health in Africa invested
in the largest private insurance company; its clientele is primarily corporate
employees who are mainly higher- and middle-income individuals (appendix D).
Dalberg (2012) finds that the equity investment through the Africa Health Fund in
Kenya is reaching the poor but not the very poor.

SERVICE USE RELATIVE TO NEED AND FINANCIAL PROTECTION
Few Bank projects report how increased pooling of domestic revenues affects service
use, particularly in automatic coverage systems. In Uzbekistan primary health
spending to facilities mainly used by low-income groups rose from 41 percent in
2004 to 45.2 percent of public health expenditure in 2011, and the number of visits
per person per year has increased from 3.8 in 2005 to 4.4 in 2010. In Tajikistan the
reforms in public revenues had no effect on care seeking; as patients did not seek
care, households also spent less on health. In Argentina service use of protected
programs remained at a high level and increased for the treatment of tuberculosis
and HIV vertical-transmission prevention (IEG 2011).

Risk pooling does not necessarily translate into improved service use and financial
protection. In China no recent information is available on the impact of the use of
care and how effectively the New Cooperative Medical Scheme protects households
against the financial consequences of ill health. The Turkey insurance reform
supported by the Bank contributed to improved equity in health financing across

                                                            POOLING HEALTH FUNDS AND RISKS
income groups and substantially reduced catastrophic expenditures for the poor
while increasing their service use (Atun et al. 2013). The Colombia health insurance
for the poor lowers mean inpatient spending for patients and is associated with the
use of preventive series and health gains for children. However, insurance does not
affect spending for outpatient care nor does it increase utilization of curative care
(Miller et al. 2013). In Georgia, insurance did not affect utilization of care (Bauhoff et
al. 2011). Among the reasons why were low quality of care and the exclusion of
pharmaceutical products from coverage (World Bank 2012). Bank analytical work
should identify and address the reasons why pooling does not lead to the expected
outcomes, as done in Georgia and Vietnam (Somanathan et al 2014), for example.

Insufficient information about benefits is a limiting factor. In Vietnam a Bank impact
evaluation finds that while the Health Care Fund for the Poor (HCFP) has reduced
user payments for members, it did not affect their service use (Wagstaff 2010).
Among the reasons were that HCFP members were not well-enough informed about
benefits. Thus the Bank helped improve knowledge about HCFP benefits for 98
percent of members, and by 2011, 46 percent of the poor HCFP members used
hospital and outpatient care. Similarly, service use among members of the Medical
Insurance Program in Georgia was low because the program provided too little
information on the benefit package; beneficiaries failed to receive vouchers for
enrollment; and providers continued requesting under-the-table payments from
patients (Bauhoff et al. 2011).

Some countries report substantial improvements for the poor insured, but this
information is limited. Other researchers report improved utilization and reduced
out-of-pocket spending for the insured in some Bank-supported risk pools. Based on
2006 household survey data, CBHI in Rwanda is associated with significantly
increased utilization of health services when they are needed and with lower user
payments. The incidence of catastrophic health expenditure was almost four times
as high for noninsured households as for the insured (Saksena et al. 2011). In Ghana
the insured poor have greater access to health care, lower copayments, and better
health outcomes than the noninsured poor. Insurance has also reduced catastrophic
spending on health and protected households against impoverishment (Nguyen et
al. 2011). In Cambodia the health equity funds led to sharp gains in utilization of key
services and reduced spending by the poor, and they significantly lowered
copayments, catastrophic expenditures, and debt by the poor (Flores et al. 2013).

Little evidence of the impact of IFC’s support to health financing on improved service
use or financial protection is due to the newness of the projects or scarcity of data
(appendix D). As IFC investments in private health insurers do not monitor
utilization of care and copayments by the insured, no information is on hand about


                                                                                        37

POOLING HEALTH FUNDS AND RISKS
their effectiveness. Partly this is due to the transaction-like nature of some IFC’s
advisory services; however, recent projects have recommended post-completion
reporting on access to improved services.

EFFICIENCY AND FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY
Efficiency concerns arise where pooling is fragmented. In East Asian countries the
Bank warned about high administrative costs, duplications of benefits, and loss of
negotiating power with providers (Langenbrunner and Somanathan 2011). In
European countries the Bank highlighted risk-equalization issues to address
fragmentation (World Bank 2009a). Bank advice to the government of Turkey in
2003 cautioned about fragmented pooling (World Bank 2003). Since then, the
government has consolidated the five insurance schemes into a unified general
health insurance program with harmonized benefits (Atun et al. 2013). The
government has also improved revenue allocation to primary care which reduced
referral rates to more costly specialist care. In Hungary and Poland the Bank
successfully advised against breaking up the social health insurer into multiple
pools, which would have increased fragmentation. The Bank also warned about
adverse selection in countries with multiple insurance funds, including China, the
Slovak Republic (World Bank 2009a), and Vietnam. Achieving development results
in IFC's private insurance investments have been difficult. For example, an
investment aimed at reaching underserved populations in a multiple pooling
environment proved difficult.

Addressing fragmentation needs political commitment. In Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Bank advice to consolidate various health insurers faced political resistance, and the
government did not follow it. In Mexico a Bank study found that government-
subsidized risk pooling among the poor through Seguro Popular incentivizes
informality. While Seguro Popular improves access to care, it was associated with a
3.1 percentage point fall in the flow of workers into formality. The Bank also found
that Seguro Popular has income effects. Members can avoid having to contribute to
the formal SHI program by moving to the informal sector and receiving services
under Seguro Popular (Aterido et al. 2011). Yet the government has chosen not to
consolidate Seguro Popular with the formal SHI program to reduce fragmentation.

The findings of this evaluation show that almost half of the Bank’s health financing
portfolio supported the strengthening of pooling through automatic coverage or
mandatory public health insurance. The Bank helped strengthen regulatory
frameworks, resource management, and institutional foundations for budget
execution, and invested in M&E. Bank and IFC analytical work and technical
assistance helped inform governments about fund management and the expansion
of coverage to the uninsured. However, in some countries the Bank could have

                                                                       POOLING HEALTH FUNDS AND RISKS
provided further analysis and technical advice to help governments strengthen
insurance institutions and address weaknesses, including in targeting the poor.
Equity in pooling improved where the Bank helped subsidize enrollment of the
poor. But coverage did not always lead to pro-poor spending, improved service use,
or financial protection. The IFC supported private and public health insurers that
provide both mandatory and voluntary coverage mainly for formal sector
employees, but evidence that this has improved service use is missing. Fragmented
pooling remains an issue in several countries and can reduce efficiency.

4. Purchasing
Highlights
 Purchasing is important for incentivizing quality and efficiency. Countries are introducing complex
  payment reforms that require improved data collection and analysis and management to address
  adverse effects, including those on nonhealth sectors.
 A growing share of Bank operations are supporting countries in purchasing reforms and most of
  this support is to performance- and results-based payments in low-income settings. In addition, the
  Bank helped in building institutional and administrative capacity and investment in information to
  assess provider performance.
 Service use has increased when countries move from line-item budgets to paying providers for
  activities or performance. A change in provider payment method primarily benefits individuals
  seeking care. Demand-side barriers, such as user fees, and high administrative costs remain
  concerns for efficiency and financial sustainability of Bank support.
 Purchasing reforms are likely not sustained unless they are embedded in overall health financing,
  and the broader public finance context and future financing are assured.

The objective of purchasing is for providers to deliver quality care efficiently to
individuals who need it. Purchasing is challenged by the financial incentives of
various provider payment methods that transfer funds from the purchaser (e.g.,
government units and insurers) to providers and by the paucity of information on
providers’ reactions to these methods. Whether these incentives lead to the desired
outcome heavily depends on the institutional context for providers and how they
react to them.

How did the World Bank Group support countries in purchasing, and what
evidence is there for improved equity in financing and service use, financial
protection, and efficiency? This chapter addresses these questions. It also includes
findings from the country case studies presented in appendix E.


Challenges
Financial incentives set by the payment method may encourage providers to change
the number of services, manage costs, and improve quality of care, all of which can
affect efficiency (Ellis and McGuire 1996) (Table 4.1). Line-item budgets and hospital
per diem are still common in middle- and low-income countries. But these two
payment methods do not set incentives for providers to become more efficient or
offer better care. To increase the number of health services, governments and

insurers increasingly pay providers based on their activities including through fee-
for-service and Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs) which reimburse hospitals a fixed
amount per patient depending on the diagnosis. In the U.S. Medicare system the
average length of hospital stay fell by 15 percent in the first three years after the shift
to DRGs (Cashin et al. 2005). But activity-based payment has cost implications for
the payer. In the Czech Republic, the move from line-item budgets to fee for service
led to an increase in activities and 46 percent growth in hospital expenditures from
1992 to 1995 (Langenbrunner et al. 2005).

Prospective payment—including capitation based on the number of individuals
registered with the provider and global budgets to hospitals to provide a set of
services—shifts the financial risk to the providers, setting an incentive to increase
efficiency. In Ireland the move to capitation led to a decline of 20 percent in the
number of outpatient visits (Langenbrunner et al. 2005). In the worst case, providers
reduce their costs by skimping care or discourage individuals with costlier health
problems from registering. Mixed payment methods are frequently used, such as
capitation adjusted by some activity indicator (e.g., number or coverage of preventive
services or quality).

To improve quality and efficiency, some countries including the United Kingdom
and the United States have introduced performance payment to compensate
providers for meeting preset quality and efficiency measures.1 The evidence base
linking performance-based payments to better quality of care is thin in Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries (Box 4.1). Similarly,
no systematic review shows the impact of performance-based payments in low- and

middle-income countries. A review of nine impact evaluations finds that their effect
on quality of care, antenatal care, institutional deliveries, preventive care for
children, and outpatient visits is unclear. While performance-based payments
increase facility revenues, their impact on efficiency is yet to be ascertained. The
review also found little evidence that such payments have triggered for managerial
autonomy in health facilities (Witter et al. 2012).

Box 4.1. What Is the Effect of Performance-Based Payments in OECD Countries?
The evidence base linking performance-based payments to better quality of care is thin.
Most studies from the United States and United Kingdom show inconsistent efficacy or
have revealed unintended effects, such as improved documentation without much change
in quality of care (Epstein 2007). Maynard (2012) also finds that most studies were
conducted without control groups and had methodological flaws. He finds that studies with
control groups show modestly improved quality scores in participating health facilities,
with the lowest improvements in the already highest performing hospitals, and that larger
financial incentives produced greater effects than smaller incentives. Still, the financial
incentive seems to diminish over time. U.S. hospitals reported gains for the first three years,
but afterwards showed no difference in the performance of the two study groups. While the
design and implementation costs of performance-based payment are considerable, none of
the studies has conducted a relative cost-effectiveness analysis of these programs. Maynard
(2012) concludes that the scale up of performance-based payments in OECD countries was
made based on poorly designed, executed, and evaluated pay-for-performance programs,
which may even raise costs and worsen efficiency.
Although performance-based payment is often introduced alongside public reporting of
performance results, few studies have identified whether improved performance stems
from the performance-based payment itself or from the information on provider
performance, which affects the reputation of the health care provider. One study suggests
that the incremental effect of performance-based payment over public reporting of
performance is small, around 3 percent performance improvement over two years, and
varies according to baseline performance with the largest improvements observed among
the poorest performing hospitals (Lindenauer et al. 2007). This finding has important cost
implications given the high implementation costs of performance payment.

In addition to these constraints in provider payments, governments are challenged
by insufficient information, unclearly defined benefit packages, and institutional
limitations when designing the purchasing function. Asymmetric information is a
major constraint for activity- and performance-based payments, particularly in low-
income settings. The difficulty is choosing appropriate measures and benchmarks,
and collecting reliable and valid information on provider performance on the basis
of which payments are made. But the purchaser—especially in countries with weak
data systems—often has little information on how health care was delivered.
Another problem is that in many countries the health care benefit package is
nominally comprehensive, but in practice it is narrowly defined owing to provider
and financial constraints. This means that patients continue to pay user fees for

                                                                               PURCHASING
goods and services that are meant to be in the package and financed by the
government or insurance.

Institutional reforms support the effect of provider payments in public health
facilities. While private providers can adjust their resources, managers in public
facilities seldom have the autonomy to respond to the financial incentives set by the
payment method and improve efficiency by adjusting the input mix, such as staff
and medical supplies. Thus changing provider incentives needs to be accompanied
by public sector reforms. Concerns arise if incentives cause adverse behavior among
providers, as it may lead to cost shifting across different payers or to spillover effects
in other sectors (e.g., payments may lead to wage increases in the health sector and
put pressure on the government to increase wages in other sectors).

Given the complexity of purchasing, purchasing needs to be fully integrated into the
overall health financing and public finance context (Box 4.2). Unintended
consequences such as spillover effects on other sectors need to be examined and
addressed.

Box 4.2. Integrated Approach to Purchasing
An integrated approach consists of strategic purchasing, defining which interventions
should be purchased in response to population needs, how they should be purchased, for
whom, and from which providers (Figueras et al. 2005). IEG also finds that an integrated
approach to purchasing considers the broader public sector context, including relevant
institutional reforms needed to implement purchasing reforms, while attempting to foresee
and forestall any potentially adverse effects.


Bank Group Support to Purchasing
An increasing share of Bank health financing projects supports governments and
insurers in purchasing. Bank projects generally support health care providers and
the purchaser who pays providers.

In line with the Bank’s 2007 Health, Nutrition, and Population (HNP) strategy, the
Bank has introduced a focus on results and better performance in health facilities.
The Bank assisted governments and insurers with changing their provider payment
methods. It also helped build institutions through information, monitoring and
evaluation (M&E), and regulations to define benefits. In some countries, these
operations also support the abolition or reduction of user fees paid by patients,
including in Argentina, Benin, Burundi, Djibouti, Nigeria, Senegal, and Zimbabwe.

PURCHASING
ANALYTICAL WORK
The Bank’s health teams have prepared limited analytical work on purchasing
(Moreno-Serra and Wagstaff 2010); however, this body of work is growing as shown
by an increasing number of impact evaluations on provider payment reforms
supported by results-based financing projects (appendix Figure B.4). So far, the
Bank’s impact evaluations have not analyzed the distributional effect of payment
reforms and whether the poor benefit. M&E frameworks in Bank projects are
presented in chapter 5.

PROVIDER PAYMENT METHODS
Some 60 percent of provider payment methods supported by Bank projects include a
performance- or results-based component; project documents use these terms
interchangeably (Figure 4.1). Most are introduced in health systems with automatic
coverage in low-income settings and not by using the health insurer as the
purchaser. A few Bank operations, mainly in Europe, supported DRG payment from
health insurers to hospitals or some other case-based payment. Similarly, capitation
payment adjusted by some activity and case-mix indicators are introduced mainly in
Europe and Central Asia, Ghana, Latin American countries, and Vietnam. In
Armenia, RBF is managed by the country’s single payer state health agency and is
implemented nationally. In some countries such as Rwanda the Bank helped scale
up performance-based payment developed by other donors.2

A more-detailed review of the Bank’s project documents categorizes Bank support in
performance- or results-based payment along geographic lines. In reality, most of
these payment methods are mixed payments that combine some aspects of activity-
based payments (e.g., fee-for-service and case-based payment) with some quality

indicators. More recently, this type of Bank support is implemented with the
support of results-based financing (RBF) operations.

       Afghanistan. The Bank supported the Ministry of Public Health to establish
        performance-based payment for contracted nongovernmental providers.
        Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are paid a capitation amount
        adjusted by scorecard indicators such as patient satisfaction and staff
        availability. The payment is a 1 percent bonus if the quality score improves.
        Bank support has recently transitioned to helping government paying
        providers a fee-for-service amount to increase the number of maternal and
        child health services.
       Africa, including Benin, Burundi, Central African Republic, and Nigeria. In these
        countries the Bank supports governments in the introduction of mixed
        payment methods to providers consisting of fee-for-service and case-based
        payment for specific treatments or diagnoses, such as number of
        hypertension cases. This payment sets an incentive to increase the number of
        services for which a fee is paid and to diagnose more patients with diagnoses
        that have higher reimbursement. It can also have adverse effects if providers
        “up-code” patients and diagnose them with higher-priced diseases, leading
        to higher costs. The payment includes a quality component as measured in
        scorecards or during health supervision. These projects often include a
        demand-side component that abolishes or reduces user fees or provides
        vouchers for care to poor patients.3
       Argentina and Brazil. Bank loans supported provider payment reforms and
        co-financed central government transfer payments to the health budgets of
        local governments (in addition to line-item health budgets) based on
        institutional performance in Brazil, and capitation adjusted by the
        achievement of 10 preventive care indicators in Argentina (Box 4.3).
        Payments encourage local governments in Brazil to invest in local
        administration, institutions, and fiduciary management in the health sector
        and in Argentina to ensure that providers have the resources to achieve the
        targets for preventive care indicators. Providers in both countries continue to
        receive line-item funding. In Argentina local governments also pay
        providers fee for service for preventive care to incentivize increased service
        provision (IEG 2011).

An increasing number of Bank projects support a shift to performance- or results-
based payments in national health systems. The majority of them are run with the
support of the Bank’s results-based financing (RBF) program implemented through
the Bank’s policy and investment lending programs. In some countries (e.g., Benin
and Burundi), RBF funds are pooled with funds from the government and other


                                                                                      47

donors and then transferred to providers. RBF is a cash payment or non-monetary
transfer made to a national or sub-national government, manager, provider, payer,
or consumer of health services after predefined results have been attained and
verified. Payment is conditional on measurable actions being undertaken (Musgrove
2011). RBF operations thus directly influence the provider payment method. The
Health Results Innovation Trust Fund4 cofinances Bank operations that finance
health interventions in countries in the International Development Association. It
also funds technical dialogue and learning related to RBF operations and program
evaluations. The Trust Fund has a dedicated work program to monitor countries’
progress using performance data and to support country teams in their data work.5

Box 4.3. Financing Based on Performance or Results in Argentina and Brazil
In Argentina the Bank loan disbursed an earmarked capitation amount to the government’s
Plan Nacer based on the number of individuals registered in the provinces. Plan Nacer is a
supply-side subsidy program that provides reproductive, maternal, and child health care in
contracted public and private health facilities to uninsured children and women. The
National Ministry of Health signed a performance contract with the provincial governments
to transfer funds from the Bank loan and the central government budget to the provincial
Plan Nacer based on the number of individuals registered (capitation) and on the results
achieved on 10 health indicators. The capitation part of the transfer sets an incentive to
provinces to increase the number of plan members; the second part an incentive to achieve
treatment targets.
The Brazilian central government, supported by the Bank, paid a bonus payment and a
performance prize to municipalities for achieving explicit governance and fiduciary targets
to improve management in primary care. The bonus payment was distributed as a lump
sum to the 35 (of 188) municipalities that met the three criteria, and the performance prize
was shared by 12 municipalities.

INSTITUTIONS, BENEFIT PACKAGE, AND INFORMATION
The Bank helps countries in purchasing their essential benefit package mainly from
public sector providers and NGOs. In Afghanistan the Bank supported contracting
of the basic package of cost-effective services from NGOs. In middle-income
countries, Bank technical assistance advised insurers to purchase care strategically.
In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia primary care providers were
privatized in 2007. There, the national health insurance fund, with Bank support,
contracted the essential package from private providers and paid capitation adjusted
by age, gender, region, and preventive care indicators (IEG 2013). Bank loans
financed information systems in insurance and governments to manage beneficiary
information. In low-income countries where the Bank supports performance- or
results-based payments, substantial investments in information were made. Data

allow for real-time monitoring and evaluation of provider performance and
corrective actions.6


Effectiveness of Bank Group Support to Purchasing
To understand the effectiveness of Bank and International Finance Corporation (IFC)
support to purchasing, one must first ask whether that support was appropriate to
country conditions. In particular, was the support accompanied by an assessment of
financing needs, and where appropriate, financial assistance? Also, given the
demanding managerial requirements of purchasing systems, did the Bank Group
tailor its support to local capacity?

INTEGRATING PURCHASING WITH HEALTH FINANCING AND PUBLIC FINANCE
In several countries the Bank has taken a more single-track approach to purchasing
without integrating payment reforms with other health financing functions. This
approach is contrary to the multisector approach described in the HNP strategy as
the Bank’s comparative advantage. IEG’s case studies found that in the Republic of
Yemen the results-based payment approach supported by the IFC and the Bank for a
narrowly defined disease area is not linked to any broader health financing efforts in
revenue collection or risk pooling. In Kenya, although the Bank and the IFC are
providing health financing support to strengthen the National Insurance Fund, a
parallel RBF program is being piloted in one county that does not appear to be
connected to the health insurance reform. In Rwanda discussions about RBF support
did not involve any analysis on the use of the existing health insurers as the fund
holder for RBF, on the effect of RBF in health facilities that are paid capitation or fee
for service by health insurance, or on what the overall impact would be on health
insurance finances and future cost trends. In Benin there is no coordination with
public sector budget reform. RBF is almost exclusively linked to using revenues
from household payments and drug sales, and is not integrated with fiscal transfers
to facilities. In Tanzania an RBF pilot has been introduced separate from overall
ongoing public sector and health financing reforms which raises concerns about its
sustainability. In Ghana the design of the Bank’s RBF operation is not coordinated
with the payment reforms introduced by the health insurer and fails to clearly
demonstrate how it will address performance problems, given already sizable
increases in health worker salaries.

Where purchasing is embedded in broader public sector reforms it is more effective
in establishing the relevant institutions that are needed to make it sustainable. In
Rwanda the government changed the public finance law to allow for incentive
payments for public sector workers; greater autonomy to facilities in regard to


                                                                                      49

recruitment, deployment, and dismissal; and direct accountability for the
performance of mayors. IEG found that the Bank provided substantial support
through policy dialogue and general budget support, including legal changes and
management reforms in health facilities. In other countries, however, purchasing
support has had less profound effects on strengthening regulatory and management
functions. The above examples suggest that the Bank could give more attention to
integrate purchasing with broader health financing functions and public finance to
build the necessary institutions that make payment reforms sustainable, as
emphasized in the Bank’s 2007 HNP strategy.

MANAGEMENT AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
Bank support has strengthened management and information systems. In Poland
the case-based payment (supported by Bank policy lending) contributes to
transparency and improved data availability in the social health insurance fund
(Czach et al. 2011). Similarly, in Afghanistan, Argentina, and Egypt, among others,
supervision of health facilities improved as did information and reporting systems
and the validity of routine data. In Serbia the Bank conducted a baseline analysis
when the government considered shifting from line-item budgets to capitation. The
Bank recommended additional measures to prevent possible adverse effects under
capitation, including consolidated pooling of funds from the insurer and other
public sources to prevent fragmented incentives; a comprehensive capitation rate to
cover salaries along with public sector reforms for public employees and provider
autonomy; and M&E (World Bank 2009). But in Brazil a recent Bank project failed to
introduce performance-based payment because it omitted to collect the relevant
information to link disbursement to results or to provide for independent technical
audits of data to compute disbursement indicators.

Institutional strengthening contributed to transparency. Bank loans financed
information-technology management systems in governments to monitor provider
performance and in insurance companies to help process medical claims submitted
by providers and monitor and assess their performance. In Argentina the Bank
helped provinces invest in detailed data collection and analysis of performance
indicators. Results were audited by an independent firm hired under the Bank loan,
and provinces and providers were fined for incorrect data reporting (IEG 2011). In
Benin, the Bank supported health strategic planning and information systems, and
in Bolivia, performance agreements between the central government and the
regional departments with clearly defined objectives and results. However, the
contracting of international firms to carry out the verification of performance to pay
providers has proved very costly in these countries.

                                                                              PURCHASING
In some cases, the Bank did support public reporting of provider performance
results with the aim of informing consumers and financers about better providers
(as is done in some OECD countries; see Box 4.1). RBF programs have introduced
online real time performance and financial reporting at the facility level including in
Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Zambia, and elsewhere.7 The Bank did also help a few
communities that were getting involved in monitoring and verification of the use of
public health resources in Afghanistan, Benin, and Rwanda. IEG case studies in
Nicaragua found that the Bank supported the government in bringing the
community into the health sector by strengthening the use of locally collected data,
including technical and social audits. The Bank in Kenya channels resources directly
to health facilities and has contributed to improved reporting and accounting of
revenues collected by facilities. Findings from Bank-supported research in Uganda
suggest that community participation in monitoring providers can improve quality
and quantity of health services as evidenced by large increases in utilization,
significant weight gains for infants, and markedly lower death rates among children
(Bjoerkman and Swensson 2007).

AVAILABILITY OF CARE AND SERVICE USE
Availability of care and service use has increased where countries moved from line-
item budgets to activity- or performance-based payments, including where this was
supported by the Bank. In Afghanistan the bonus payment has been associated with
an increase in availability of skilled health workers and administrative personnel. In
Egypt performance-based payment positively affected provider behaviors toward
patients, reduced staff turnover, and helped lift medical encounters from three to 16
per day. In Argentina a 1 percentage point provincial health budget increase,
combined with a results focus for local authorities, contributed to higher utilization
rates among low-income groups who seek care in public health facilities (IEG 2011).

Few studies use control groups to compare the effect of performance payment
against other payment changes such as higher salaries independent of performance,
or against intrinsic factors. In an impact evaluation in Rwanda, the Bank compared
higher budget funding for health facilities in control districts with performance-
based payments for selected services in pilot districts. It found that the payments
mainly increased utilization of services that had higher unit payments and that
providers could more easily control for. There was no impact on other rewarded
services such as childhood immunization, malaria prophylaxis, or curative care
visits for children (Basinga et al. 2011). Distributional effects across the insured and
uninsured and between socioeconomic groups were not identified. Bank research
also highlighted the importance of altruistic concerns that drive the behavior of
health care providers. In Uganda a Bank team found that more funding to religious



                                                                                      51

PURCHASING
health facilities in 1999 was passed on to patients in the form of more diagnostic
services and lower user fees, which reduced financial barriers; however, public
facilities performed less well (Reinikka and Svensson 2003).

While the Bank did not analyze the payment effect over the insurance effect on
service use, other researchers find that insured individuals in Rwanda report large
and significant improvements in several rewarded and unrewarded services and a
decrease in child anemia prevalence (Sherry et al. 2012). Similarly, Skiles et al. (2012)
report increased service use across all wealth quintiles and insurance as a positive
predictor for service use. These findings suggest that it is mainly the care-seeking
insured who benefit from payment reforms. It also shows that much still needs to be
learned about how to combine payment reforms with risk pooling to address
barriers in access to care for patients, such as user payments.

FINANCIAL PROTECTION
As a change in provider payment method primarily benefits individuals seeking
care (e.g., the insured and wealthier), provider payment reforms without measures
to reduce user payments and improve risk pooling are unlikely to improve equity in
service use and financial protection. So far, the Bank’s impact evaluations have not
analyzed the distributional effect of payment reforms and whether the poor benefit
or the uninsured.

HEALTH OUTCOMES
The evidence linking payment reforms to better health outcomes is thin and mixed.
Sherry et al. (2012) used 2005 and 2007 demographic and health survey data in
Rwanda and found mixed results and no significant impact of performance-based
payment (which was supported by Bank policy lending) on maternal and child
health outcome indicators. However, one Bank study found (based on household
survey data comparing households in 10 districts with the payment reform and 9
districts with traditional input-based financing) that performance payment led to
large and significant improvements in child health between 2006 when the payment
was introduced and 2008, and the payment is more effective among higher-skilled
providers (Gertler and Vermeersch 2012). Distributional effects in health outcomes
across the insured and uninsured and between socioeconomic groups were not
identified.

EFFICIENCY
Insurers and government entities can purchase care strategically to ensure the
efficient use of health funds. There is some indication that Bank support contributed
to improved efficiency where pooling of public funding increased to purchase a



52
                                                                             CHAPTER 4
                                                                            PURCHASING
benefit package with cost-effective interventions. In Afghanistan, efficiency is
considered to have been improved by the performance-based NGO contracting
model because access to the contracted services increased, and those services in the
package are the most cost-effective interventions available for improving overall
health outcomes. In Armenia spending shifted from hospitals, which had to reduce
bed overcapacity, to more cost-effective primary health care. In Serbia the Bank
helped streamline benefit packages where social health insurers had committed to
cover overly generous benefits. The number of staff was rationalized in the health
sector in Croatia and Serbia, and the Bank recommended increasing wages for
primary care workers in Tajikistan. Strong government support was essential in
introducing these efficiency enhancing measures in these countries and supporting
the effectiveness of purchasing.

However, adverse effects of activity- and performance-based payment reforms on
sector efficiency were insufficiently examined in Bank analysis. Only in a few
countries (e.g., Serbia) did the Bank conduct cost and productivity analysis to
identify the payment amount. Nor did Bank analysis sufficiently examine adverse
reactions by providers to the payment. A case study prepared by IEG for this
evaluation found that in Bolivia, fee-for-service payment for mothers and children
created an incentive for beneficiaries to seek costlier tertiary care, contributing to
inefficiency. In Ghana fee-for-service payment leads providers to refer patients to
hospitals or clinics for more expensive treatment. It has also resulted in lengthy
processing times and prolonged the reimbursement time to providers to five
months. In Vietnam moving from fee-for-service to capitation payments for
hospitals contributed to efficiency gains by reducing recurrent expenditures and did
not have a negative effect on health outcomes. However, a recent Bank-supported
study warns of adverse spillover effects because hospitals are shifting costs across
different payers from insurance paying capitation to the uninsured who pay user
fees, which may have implications for access and financial protection (Nguyen et al.
2013). A ruse in Rwanda was used by hospital pharmacies to prevent drugs from
running out of stock—a performance indicator—by refusing to dispense the last box
of pharmaceuticals (Kalk et al. 2010). The Bank could analyze adverse effects of
payment reforms systematically and help countries addressing them.

FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY
Purchasing reforms are not sustainable unless they are embedded in overall health
financing and the broader public finance context and future financing is assured.
Mainly in middle-income countries, the Bank supported purchasing reforms in
social health insurance and cautioned governments about the financial
consequences. A small body of Bank analytical work looked at the financial



                                                                                    53

PURCHASING
sustainability of insurance and advised governments on streamlining generously
defined benefits (Chawla 2007; La Forgia and Nagpal 2012; Langenbrunner and
Somanathan 2011; Preker et al. 2013; Smith and Nguyen 2013). In the Europe and
Central Asia Region, the Bank warned that social health insurers are simple
disbursement agents who create a high financial risk for the government budget and
recommended strategic purchasing (Chawla 2007). The Bank also recommended
selective contracting with providers and shifting to capitation and case-based
payment with broader health sector reforms (Langenbrunner et al. 2009; World Bank
2010).

Where performance and activity payment was introduced through the government
budget, the Bank did not give sufficient attention to the financial sustainability of
this support. Many RBF projects are pilots that aim to build evidence on the impact
and cost effectiveness of the intervention. Still, administrative costs and the financial
implications for the payer are major concerns when introducing activity- and
performance-based payments, which the Bank did not address sufficiently. In Kenya
verification costs for performance payment are estimated at 20 percent of the
performance budget. Governments have not assumed financing responsibility in the
recurrent budget for the cost of performance- or results-based payment programs,
and so even programs considered effective have not been taken over by
governments. In Egypt the government scaled up the Family Health Model but not
the performance-payment component after donor funding ended, even though it
was perceived as successful. In Ghana plans are going ahead with a new RBF
program supported by the Bank in parallel to the provider payment reforms of the
National Health Insurance System, but because of financial sustainability concerns,
the program will need to be financed by the Bank or donors. In Argentina
cofinancing of the Plan Nacer by provincial governments encountered long delays
(IEG 2011). In low-income countries, RBF is a separate budget line and mainly
financed by donors from sector budget support. In Rwanda challenges of
sustainability came to the fore as donor funding was scaled back (Ministry of
Finance and Planning 2011).

The Bank did not examine how a change to the provider payment in the public
sector affects the governments wage bill, yet this may have substantial financial
implications for the government. A case study prepared by IEG for this evaluation
found that the Rwandan government allocated about 10 percent of the domestic
health budget to performance payments in 2010, which were used by health facilities
as they saw fit, including topping up salaries and improving the facilities (Ministry
of Finance and Planning 2011). In the first two years, performance-based pay
increased facility budgets by 22 percent on average, most of which (77 percent) was
paid as a salary top-up, resulting in an average 38 percent salary increase for staff

                                                                            PURCHASING
(Basinga et al. 2011). In absolute terms, results-based financing helped lift health
workers’ salaries by $75–750 a month depending on their function and facility
performance (Kalk et al. 2010). This is considerably higher take-home pay for health
workers than for other public employees, such as teachers, and can pressure
governments to increase other public sector wages. However, in none of the
countries did Bank teams analyze the public sector wage impact of results-based
financing.

As in OECD countries, decisions to scale up payment reforms were not always
based on lessons from pilots, which may affect sustainability. Most of the Bank’s
performance- or results-payment reforms supported by RBF programs were piloted.
However, decisions were made to scale up regardless of weak, inconclusive, or
incomplete pilot results. In Benin several failed RBF pilots introduced in 2007 were
redesigned and reintroduced with a grant from the Bank’s Health Results
Innovation Trust Fund. The evaluation of the pilot supported by this fund is not yet
complete. Nonetheless, plans have been made to scale up RBF to all 34 health zones.
Similarly, in Tanzania, despite multiple failed RBF programs and before the
evaluation of the most recent pilot becomes available, the Bank and other donors
have voiced interest in supporting a scale up to a national RBF scheme. This is a
concern as early findings from an evaluation by the Ifakara Health Institute suggests
that the RBF programs are burdensome, incompletely understood, unevenly
implemented, not particularly effective, and unlikely to be sustainable (Chimhutu et
al. 2014). In Argentina the Bank’s impact evaluation (Gertler et al. 2011) was not
ready to inform the scale up of Plan Nacer nationwide. Instead, the government
decided to scale up based on routine administrative data and qualitative analysis
(IEG 2011).

The IEG found that in some countries, the Bank supported additional payments and
transfers with questionable sustainability. In Rwanda, the Ministry of Finance raised
concerns over the sustainability of the Bank-supported payment program to
community health workers who are volunteer members of a cooperative (Ministry
of Finance and Planning 2011). Under a former Bank project, pregnant women also
received a baby kit if they delivered in health facilities or an umbrella if they have
four antenatal care visits—but these in-kind transfers were stopped due to high
procurement costs. Again, these examples emphasize the importance of integrating
purchasing with broader health financing and institutional reforms to support
sustainability.

In sum, countries are introducing complex payment reforms to incentivize providers
to improve quality and efficiency. A growing share of Bank operations are
supporting countries in these purchasing reforms, and most of this support is


                                                                                    55

PURCHASING
through RBF in low-income settings. In addition, the Bank helped in building
institutional and administrative capacity and investment in information to assess
provider performance. IEG’s country case studies found that where Bank
purchasing support was integrated with other health financing functions (risk
pooling and revenue collection) and linked to public sector reforms rather than
limited to narrowly defined provider payment methods, it has been relatively more
effective because it addressed broader institutional reforms which in turn support
sustainability. The availability of care and service use improved in countries where
the Bank helped introduce activity- and performance payment often with RBF
support. However, limited evidence from impact evaluations with control group
points to broadly similar effects for performance-based payment and budget
increases for health. Moreover, performance-based payment systems have high
overhead costs for performance verification. As a change in provider payment
method primarily benefits individuals seeking care (e.g., the insured and wealthier),
Bank-supported provider payment reforms without measures to reduce out-of-
pocket user payments and improve risk pooling are unlikely to improve equity in
service use and financial protection. Payment reforms are likely not sustained unless
they are embedded in overall health financing and the broader public finance
context.

1The underlying rationale for performance payment is that quality varies across health facilities
because providers deliver care differently. Reducing this variation by setting financial incentives was
expected to increase quality and productivity of the health system. Performance-based payment
methods differ substantially, however, and reflect local conditions including information technology,
data availability, and providers’ willingness to participate (Maynard 2012).
2Hospitals are paid on their performance in 52 quality indicators assessed quarterly. Health centers
receive payments based on 24 indicators on service delivery measured monthly. Hospitals and health
centers also receive a provider payment, including fee-for-service and case-based payments and
capitation, from the social health insurance fund and from community-based health insurance.
3In Burundi, results-based financing (RBF) is a national program, and the Bank ’s funds are pooled
with other donors and government funding to finance RBF and user fee abolition. In Senegal and
Zimbabwe, poor women receive vouchers to seek care. The Nigeria health project introduces
exemption policies for the poor. Most of these projects are still in the design phase or early
implementation.
4This is financed by the governments of Norway and the United Kingdom. The number of HNP
projects with cofinancing from this fund increased from three in 2007 to nine in 2013 for a total
committed amount of $260 million.
5The trust fund supporting the RBF operations has a requirement that each country program is
paired with a rigorous impact evaluation and is accompanied by a well-funded impact evaluation
grant. In parallel with the requirement, extensive technical support is provided to the country teams
to assure the rigor of such evaluations. At present, the portfolio consists of 34 impact evaluations and
eight program and process assessments.
6 All RBF programs collect and verify performance data which allows for real-time monitoring of
performance and necessary corrective actions. Most programs have an extensive database which
stores administrative data and allows for a close examination of performance down to the facility
level. Data collected for the most part are integrated in the countries Health Management and

Information Systems (HMIS) and beyond that also contain information on quality of care. Some
countries, like Zambia and Zimbabwe, make use of HMIS data to monitor possible negative spill-over
effects of RBF on nonincentivized services. The Bank team designed an RBF module for ADePT to
make it easier and faster to analyze data and focus on results (http://www.worldbank.org/adept/)
Discussions with the World Bank Institute’s Innovation Lab explore options to show cross country
RBF data on the web.
7RBF programs introduced online performance dashboards to show real-time performance and

5. Factors in Successful Bank Group Support
Highlights
 Government commitment to health financing reforms is influenced by political and fiscal
  constraints. The World Bank Group can reinforce commitment by building technical capacity but
  needs to be flexible and able to adjust to the local political and technical context.
 Bank analytical work has informed the international health financing dialogue and could be
  expanded to help institutionalize health financing reforms and build local capacity.
 To fully use its capabilities in health financing, the Bank Group should draw on the expertise from
  health staff jointly with public finance and fiscal experts and work across the new Global Practices.
 The Bank’s health financing portfolio is changing and focusing on one subintervention —
  performance-payment reforms, which is increasingly supported by results-based financing
  operations. Purchasing needs to be integrated with other health financing functions and public
  finance to be sustainable as outlined in the 2007 strategy for Health, Nutrition, and Population.
 This evaluation may be missing some successful Bank engagement in health financing because of
  weak monitoring and evaluation (M&E) in health projects. Learning from the Bank’s rich country
  experience is constrained by weak M&E in health projects.

The common success factors seen in the previous chapters that would make for good
engagement in revenue collection, risk pooling, and purchasing include:

       Government commitment and technical and information capacity;
       Depth and relevance in analytical work;
       Capabilities and collaboration;
       Integration of all health financing functions; and
       Sound monitoring and evaluation (M&E).
Chapter 5 discusses how these factors cut across the three pillars of health financing
and influence the effectiveness of Bank Group support and the implementation of
the Bank’s Health, Nutrition, and Population (HNP) strategy. Chapter 2 showed that
in governments that are committed to improving health outcomes and increasing
support to the sector, efficient and equitable revenue instruments need to be used,
taking into account the overall public finance context. Similarly, to address the many
challenges in risk pooling described in chapter 3, strong institutions, management,
and technical capacity are needed as well as information capacity to manage pooled
funds. Bank analytical work helps inform governments in these health financing
decisions. As seen in chapter 4, purchasing depends on integration with risk pooling
to address financial barriers and thus revenue collection and with public finance.
Purchasing depends heavily on information systems, M&E, technical capacity to
analyze performance and define payments, and government commitment to

institutional reforms to allow providers to respond to financial incentives. The
Bank’s 2007 HNP strategy—chapter 1—sees health financing as a comparative
advantage for the Bank because of its analytical capacity and multisector nature.
Chapter 5 also contains lessons learned from the country case studies conducted for
the evaluation (appendix E).


Government Commitment, Technical and Information Capacity, and Flexibility
Whether Bank support to health financing reforms is sustained depends on
government commitments to allocate revenues to health, execute health budgets,
address inequity in health financing, and introduce institutional reforms, including
passing legislation, changing provider autonomy to allow responses to financial
incentives, addressing fragmentation, and linking health financing to broader public
sector reforms. Governments are also required to invest in information to document
the flow of funds in the sector, build technical capacity to analyze information
collected on finances and performance, and address adverse effects.

Mounting political commitment by governments has ensured important health
financing reforms in countries such as Afghanistan—where nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs) were contracted by the government—and Ghana, Rwanda,
and Turkey, which introduced impressive health financing reforms. Yet insufficient
financial commitment has limited reform sustainability. Ghana has too little fiscal
space to subsidize insurance coverage for the poor, leading the health insurer to use
a 1.7 percent poverty rate rather than the true rate of 30 percent. Weak technical and
information capacities in Tunisia stymie coverage for the poor under the Free
Medical Assistance Program (IEG 2014).

Government commitment is also affected by political, not just financial and technical
constraints. In Bolivia, Bank lending and analytical work guided much of the policy
discussion in health financing reform. However, since the government changed in
2006, the Bank has not been considered a technical partner in health financing.
Similarly, in Egypt the Bank was engaged through lending and analytical support in
consolidating insurance reform and the family health model, which was widely
considered coherent and innovative. But discord within the government over the
reform led to implementation difficulties, and the Bank has since found it hard to
reengage. In Rwanda, Bank support was conducted through policy dialogue and
general budget support, which addressed a wide spectrum of health financing
reforms. But in 2009, the government decided under its division of labor policy that
the Bank should redirect funds to other sectors. The Bank has since been absent from
the health financing policy dialogue there. Although the Bank provided extensive

FACTORS IN SUCCESSFUL BANK GROUP SUPPORT
technical assistance to drafting the health financing policy in Rwanda, after the
Bank’s health financing team left, momentum drained and the draft policy has yet to
be finalized (IHP+ 2012). In Kenya, by contrast, the relationship with the
government has improved markedly since 2009. The Bank is now engaged in an
array of health financing activities, including analytical work on the level and
allocation of fund, and the government has provided additional $50 million in FY
13–14 to compensate providers for free maternity care. The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) has convened the stakeholder dialogue and supports
management reforms in the public health insurer. In addition, the Bank financial
collaboration with health facilities has contributed to improved reporting and
accounting of revenues in Kenya.

Technical capacity facilitated understanding for health financing reforms. The
Bank’s HNP regional departments and the World Bank Institute (WBI) are building
local technical capacity that helps facilitate dialogue on key health financing issues
with governments. Country and donor representatives interviewed by the
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) indicated that WBI courses have improved
their understanding of the technical and policy aspects of health financing reform.
For this evaluation, the IEG conducted an online survey among graduates of the
WBI flagship course. Almost three-quarters of the 109 participants who completed
the survey said they had a chance to implement what they had learned during the
course. More than 80 percent used the literature from the course in their work, and
more than half of them said the course had a positive impact on their collaboration
with Bank staff. The WBI should consider tracer surveys among future graduates to
ensure that its courses build technical capacity for health financing (appendix A).

In some countries, including Brazil, Bank support to building the institutional
foundations at municipality level contributed to the timely execution of the health
budget. Bank support to consumer information and information technology has
created transparency in insurance management in Vietnam and elsewhere. The Bank
could also help more countries institutionalize standardized methods commonly
used in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, such
as National Health Accounts to track the flow of funds in the sector. Standardized
government M&E helped inform Public Expenditure Reviews (PERs) in several
countries, built local technical capacity, and created a better understanding for
health financing reforms.

In some cases, Bank support needs to be more flexible and adjust to the local
political and technical context. In a low-capacity environment like Afghanistan, the
Bank demonstrated such flexibility. Given the limited ability of the Ministry of
Health to provide or purchase services, the Bank supported contracting with NGOs

                                              FACTORS IN SUCCESSFUL BANK GROUP SUPPORT
and provided large-scale assistance. Similarly, in Benin, Bank support to pooling
and purchasing was calibrated to the local context. In Tanzania, however, other
donors viewed Bank financing as inflexible as it proved hard to finance one of the
nine option papers on fiscal space to feed into a larger health financing strategy
paper. Beyond flexibility, in some countries including Egypt, the Bank would have
been more useful had it possessed a better understanding of the political economy.


Depth and Relevance of Analytical Work
The Bank has a unique ability to connect operational work with research and
evaluation to inform policy making through its knowledge products. It has provided
analytical support to health financing reforms including those for fiscal space, PERs,
insurance analysis, and impact evaluations on insurance and results-based
financing. Through this work, the Bank maintained a policy dialogue with
governments that contributed to informing health financing reforms in countries
such as Afghanistan, Ghana, Mexico, Kenya, Poland, Rwanda, Turkey, and
Vietnam—and elsewhere.

The Bank has launched a growing number of impact evaluations to examine the
effect of health financing reforms. The World Bank Development Impact Evaluation
database in the Development Economics Group had 178 health-related impact
evaluations in 2013. Of these, 14 are on health financing and complete and available
(appendix Table A.8). Most of them examine health insurance in China and
Vietnam. Results-based financing has become the most frequently researched topic
among the ongoing evaluations (appendix Figure B.4). None of these impact
evaluations, however, includes a cost-benefit analysis. Another drawback is that the
Development Impact Evaluation database is not comprehensive and may have
missed some impact evaluations of Bank-supported reforms (e.g., impact
evaluations financed under a Bank project or conducted by non-Bank researchers).

Through health financing workshops, the Bank promotes international dialogue. It
also adds value by creating and maintaining the global health databases with health
financing indicators. International health financing experts and stakeholders in
client countries interviewed agree that the Bank adds value through its knowledge
work on health financing, health financing analysis in PERs, poverty assessments,
fiscal space analyses, and a growing body of impact evaluations. They consider
these reports of high quality and very useful. However, the Bank does not have a
central registry that would make these studies or workshops easily accessible.1

CHAPTER 5
FACTORS IN SUCCESSFUL BANK GROUP SUPPORT
The Bank has conducted an array of analytical work on health financing, including
in sector analysis, PERs, and fiscal space studies. However, these reports do not
necessarily examine the poverty and equity effect of health financing. The Bank
could therefore deepen analysis on health financing in its poverty assessments. In
2007–2012, few poverty assessments with a health chapter looked beyond
epidemiological changes to examine the poverty impact of health financing. Twenty
of the 43 poverty assessments assess the country’s health financing situation
(appendix Table A.5), but their approach varies greatly (Table 5.1). Ten included
benefit incidence analysis, and five presented out-of-pocket spending as a share of
total health expenditures. Few analyzed utilization combined with out-of-pocket
spending. Health insurance enrollment among the poor is reported in 10 reports, but
they did not analyze whether insurance improves utilization of care or protects the
insured against catastrophic spending or falling into poverty. Two assessments
reported on impoverishment from health shocks (Azerbaijan and Georgia) and
compared household income before and after health payments.

As in PERs, the Bank’s poverty assessments could usefully follow a common
methodology to analyze the impact of health financing for households. This
methodology could be developed based on the experience from the Azerbaijan and
Georgia reports, and be integrated with the new Systematic Country Diagnostic
framework which will focus on achieving the twin goals of reduced poverty and
shared prosperity. Bank analytical work should be made easily accessible on the
Internet.

Capabilities and Collaboration in Health Financing
Health financing requires a different skill set from that of the general health
specialist. Since 2007, the number of Bank staff affiliated with the HNP sector has
increased slightly. However, the share of economists among HNP staff remained at
19 percent, and the economist team became more junior as suggested by a
decreasing number of lead economists working in HNP (from nine in 2007 to two in
July 2013). The number of senior economists doubled from 14 to 29 in 2013. If the
Bank is to be a major player in health financing, it has to staff accordingly.

The Bank’s comparative advantage lies in HNP’s ability to collaborate with the
Public Sector and Macro and Fiscal Management teams and facilitate dialogue on
health financing at all government levels, including the Ministry of Finance as
outlined in the HNP strategy. To fully use its capabilities, the Bank Group could use
a multisector team that draws on the expertise from Health and other sector experts
and works across the new Global Practices and the IFC. Most IEG country cases
found there was collaboration between the HNP hub and the Regions but limited
cross-support from the Development Research Group2 or the Human Development
chief economist, which is also confirmed in the HNP staff survey. Collaboration with
the IFC was limited to the Health in Africa and India initiatives. Within the jointly
established Health in Africa Initiative, an external mid-term review found that the
Bank Group did not leverage synergies within the group and “operated without
complementarity” (Brad Herbert Associates 2012). In several countries, including
Argentina and more recently in Kenya, this collaboration has worked well and has
improved results. Collaboration is essential in a broad-based systems approach to
link health financing reforms (in purchasing, pooling, taxation, and user fees) to
public sector reforms and lead the health financing dialogue at all government
levels. However, the evaluation’s country case studies and the international health
financing experts noted that the Bank does not often exert this leadership role.

The Bank’s Health and Public Sector teams could enhance collaboration to fully
embed health financing in broader public sector reforms. In Vietnam, health support
has not been a significant part of overall public sector reform in the past, and a need to
enhance coordination was emphasized in the IEG case study by the HNP and Poverty
Reduction and Economic Management teams, with a view on macro-level issues of
health financing reform such as fiscal space, costing of coverage, and affordability and
sustainability of reforms. Similarly, in Benin reforms were intra-health focused
without drawing enough on expertise on how to create fiscal space or considering
longer-term implications of fiscal sustainability. In Tanzania the health team was
involved in government-wide public financial management reform to track resource
allocations to decentralized levels of government. Still, an attempt was made (without


                                                                                       65

success) to harmonize three independent reforms in this area. In Uzbekistan treasury
reform supported by the Bank’s Public Sector team reintroduced rigidities in
spending that reduced intended increases in autonomy and flexibility at health
institutions. This created a contradiction between public financial management and
health financing reforms—one that has yet to be resolved.

The international health financing experts raised concerns over the Bank’s dwindling
capabilities in health financing. While the Bank has added value in the area of strong
technical skills, the general impression is that it is not as deep as it used to be,
following the departure of several more experienced health financing staff. Partner
agencies reported they do not know who to contact on health financing at the Bank,
and they raised concerns that recent senior retirees are not being replaced. There are
also concerns that the Bank is losing its edge and a perception that it has become less
serious about health financing. An example was that the Bank sent public health
specialists to international costing meetings, where a health financing expert was
expected. HNP staff interviewed by IEG echoed these anxieties and worried that this
could affect the Bank’s future collaboration with other organizations. IEG’s country
cases identified similar concerns. In several countries, including Ghana and Rwanda,
the Bank did not maintain its health financing expertise even so governments
embarked on substantive reforms.

Without doubt, the Bank’s capabilities affect partnerships with other bodies. At the
country level as well as globally, the Bank works with other donors on health
financing reforms.3 It often leads the donor collaboration agenda but not necessarily
in health financing. Country-level engagements in health financing vary and are
influenced by the perspectives of Bank staff, their available resources, and
individual capabilities. In Nepal and Tanzania the Bank coordinated well with a
multidonor sectorwide approach and basket funding arrangement, and has
supported the health financing agenda as an active member of the technical working
group of finance. Yet in some countries collaboration with Bank staff was described
as informal, sporadic, and challenging, where staff are focused on disbursements
instead of technical issues in health financing. In short, there is room to leverage
synergies in collaboration between organizations so as to raise the quality of the
health financing dialogue at the country level.


Integrating All Health Financing Functions
The evaluation showed that the Bank’s health financing portfolio is changing, and
there is a growing focus on purchasing. Within purchasing most attention is given to
one subintervention—performance- or results-based payment reform. This trend is



66
                                                                              CHAPTER 5
                                               FACTORS IN SUCCESSFUL BANK GROUP SUPPORT
continuing. Since FY13, the Bank has approved 11 new RBF projects that are
cofinanced by the Health Results Innovation Trust Fund. This is an impressive shift
in the portfolio given that in previous years, HNP reported about six new health
financing operations annually.

This shift in the Bank portfolio raises concerns that the Bank’s approach to health
financing is driven by availability of trust funds; draws on an insufficient evidence
base; and is not integrated with the other health financing functions and public
finance. Payment reforms supported by the Bank’s RBF program tend to operate in
parallel to health financing and public finance reforms (Ghana, Kenya, and
Tanzania) and did not examine broader fiscal effects (Rwanda). Similarly,
stakeholders interviewed by IEG in countries and among the international health
financing experts indicated that the Bank focus in health financing seems to change
with the viewpoints of the Bank’s leadership, with individual staff, and with the
availability of donor funding to promote specific topics. For example, the Bank
seemed only temporarily committed to support National Health Accounts as long as
the external funding was provided. With the availability of funding from the Health
Results Innovation Trust Fund, the Bank’s focus shifted to results-based payments in
low-income countries. Because of these shifting areas of focus, the Bank is perceived
as not properly linking health financing to poverty reduction.

IEG found that the Bank has integrated health financing reforms with public sector
reforms in several countries, often in collaboration with Public Sector teams. Much
of this support was provided through development policy operations. In Cambodia,
cross-sector collaboration has been strong and effective, and the health economist in
some instances took the lead in the overall policy dialogue with the government on
public servant payment reform, for example. In Turkey health reform benefited from
a dialogue between the public sector and health teams about the implications of
insurance expansion for health spending, which were analyzed jointly. In Argentina,
Bank support to the government’s budget helped protect pro-poor health spending.
This was coordinated with the results-focused design of the Plan Nacer Program
(Gertler et al. 2011). In several countries (e.g., Ghana and Serbia), the Bank provided
support to public health insurers including to move to capitation payment and
manage cost. In Bolivia, Cambodia, Turkey, and Uzbekistan, the Bank’s purchasing
support could be considered a key entry point for other health financing reforms.
The Bank can add value by stressing this comparative advantage via linking health
financing with public finance and working across teams, as suggested in the 2007
HNP strategy.

These findings suggest that the Bank could revisit its approach to performance- and
results-based financing and integrate purchasing, including that in RBF projects,


                                                                                    67
CHAPTER 5
FACTORS IN SUCCESSFUL BANK GROUP SUPPORT
with other health financing functions and public finance. The Bank could link
provider payment methods with public reforms to help institutionalize these
changes. It could also help governments disseminate information on provider
performance that affects the reputation of health care providers and informs
consumers (e.g., infection rates, cleanliness in health facilities). As performance- and
results-based payments mainly benefit patients who seek care, payment reforms
need to be linked to pooling so as to reduce demand-side barriers in accessing care.
In countries with social health insurance, such as Ghana, Kenya, and Tanzania, the
Bank could explore working with the insurer to implement its results-based
financing activities with ongoing insurance payment reforms, instead of
implementing a parallel activity. This would help streamline financial incentives,
reduce fragmentation, and build institutions that support sustainability.


Monitoring and Evaluation in Health Financing Projects
This evaluation may be missing some successful Bank and IFC engagement in health
financing because of weak M&E in health projects (appendix Table B.8 and Table
D.4). HNP is among the sectors with the lowest ratings for the quality of project
M&E. Of the 34 closed HNP projects with an IEG project completion review
included in this evaluation, 25 percent were rated substantial or high M&E
performance in IEG project ratings, which is considerably below the Bank average of
32 percent. Reasons for weak M&E ratings in Bank projects include missing
indicators, indicators that are too vaguely defined or not measurable, use of national
data to evaluate a pilot program, and unreliable data. However, looking forward,
HNP is substantially investing in impact evaluations, and most of them are
evaluating RBF pilot programs (appendix figure B.8). It remains to be seen how the
results from these evaluations will inform future program expansion and progress
in health financing projects.

The HNP strategy stipulates that the Bank monitor how health financing affects
equity in service use, risk pooling, and financial protection, but this information is
rarely collected in health financing operations (Table 5.2). The majority of Bank
projects that aim to improve access to care monitor changes in the utilization of
services, though rarely across socioeconomic groups. Of the 12 HNP projects with
equity objectives, the China Rural Health Project is the only one monitoring
utilization patterns across income groups. Four of the 11 HNP projects with
objectives to expand health insurance report enrollment, but only two—in Turkey
and Vietnam—report enrollment among the poorest as stipulated in the HNP
strategy results framework. Only three of the nine projects with financial protection
objectives report on changes in catastrophic spending or the impact of out-of-pocket

spending on household incomes; even so, these are indicators identified in the 2007
HNP strategy results framework. Only seven of 19 HNP projects with poverty
objectives monitor changes in utilization of care for the poor.

FACTORS IN SUCCESSFUL BANK GROUP SUPPORT

3Collaboration is on strategic issues, operational and country-level support, analytical product
development, and knowledge and capacity building through joint health financing workshops,
conferences, and the World Bank Institute flagship course. Some organizations provide temporary
funding through trust funds to advance initiatives managed by the Bank Group (e.g., National Health
Accounts, Universal Health Coverage, Health in Africa, and RBF). The Bank’s collaboration with
universities is limited, mainly involving universities in the United States.

6. Conclusions and Recommendations
This evaluation examined World Bank and the International Finance Corporation
(IFC) support to health financing through lending, investment, policy dialogue, and
analytical work. Over FY03–12 the World Bank supported health financing reforms
through 188 operations in 68 countries and provided an active analytical program.
The IFC delivered a small program with six investments and nine advisory services.
The Bank’s Health, Nutrition, and Population (HNP) 2007 strategy sees health
financing as a comparative advantage for the Bank because of its analytical capacity
and multisector nature. The Bank and IFC do not have a joint strategy or strategic
approach about the mix of public and private health insurance.

The Bank Group did not take an ideological stance in its work in revenue collection
and different risk pooling arrangements; rather, it worked within the different
country contexts. In line with the Bank’s health strategy, the Bank did promote a
focus on improved results and performance in health facilities by helping
governments and insurers change the way they pay providers. An increasing
number of this work is implemented with the support of results-based financing
(RBF) operations.

The Bank’s 2007 health strategy remains valid to guide support to health financing
reforms. However, the evaluation finds that key elements of the strategy have
proved to be elusive in its implementation, including integration and monitoring
and evaluation (M&E). The reasons mainly evolve around capabilities and cross-
sector collaboration and are areas for further reflection for the global practices.

The factors for successful Bank support include government commitment to address
the many challenges in revenue collection for health and risk pooling, ensure pro-
poor spending, introduce institutional reforms, and build technical and information
capacity. Purchasing needs to be integrated with risk pooling to address financial
barriers for poor individuals in accessing care and with public finance to manage
adverse effects. Bank analytical work and collaboration across teams helps inform
governments in these health financing decisions. These health financing functions
heavily depend on information systems, M&E, technical capacity to analyze
performance, and government commitment to sustain reforms.

The evaluation recognized that reforms in health financing only are insufficient, and
additional investments are needed to ensure the supply of health care. But health
financing decisions are necessary to influence the provision and use of health care
and ensure financial protection. They include decisions about how to mobilize and

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
allocate funds for health, how to pool these funds, and how to purchase care from
health providers.

The evaluation found that evidence is scant on the effect of Bank and IFC operations
and programs on final outcomes, and much remains to be learned about the health
benefits, equity in service use and finance, and financial protection value of public
spending, pooling, and purchasing supported by the Bank Group. There is also a
critical need to strengthen evidence on implementation processes so as to identify
the reasons that contribute to success. Sound analytical work about adverse effects
and financial sustainability are particularly important for all countries.

The four main conclusions of the evaluation are the following:

        There have been some notable successes of Bank support to all three health
         financing functions, including revenue collection, risk pooling, and
         purchasing. Evidence suggests that these have occurred when the Bank
         Health and other sector teams drew on a variety of skills across sectors to
         engage government and where government commitment to reforms was
         strong. The collaboration between the IFC and the Bank has been limited so
         far, given the small health financing IFC portfolio.
        Bank support has helped increase governments’ health budgets and protect
         health spending against budget cuts during economic crisis. Equity in pooling
         increased where the Bank assisted governments in subsidizing compulsory
         contributions to various health insurance for low-income groups. However,
         increased pooling did not always lead to pro-poor spending, improved equity
         in service use, or greater financial protection. Support to reduce user
         payments was limited, and evidence is missing that it improved equity in
         service use and financial protection. This type of support often lacked the
         necessary fiscal and equity analysis.
        The Bank has been shifting its focus on health financing to performance- or
         results-based payments supported by RBF projects. There is a greater focus
         on financial incentives to increase the number of specific services and
         monitoring of service use. Little attention was given to the impact on costs,
         broader public sector institutional reforms to allow providers to react to
         financial incentives and to demand-side barriers including user fees, and how
         to tackle these in a fiscally sustainable manner. This shift has happened
         without the necessary evidence for financial protection and sustainability and
         potential adverse effects on the broader public sector, including on wages.
        An integrated approach that links health financing including RBF with public
         sector reforms is likely to be more effective than single-issue interventions in
         establishing the relevant institutions that are needed to sustain reforms. This

                                                         CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
        approach comprises efficient and equitable revenue instruments (tax and
        non-tax) for health, taking into account the overall public finance situation. It
        also includes moving toward compulsory pooling and reduced fragmentation
        in pooling, and a focus on strategic purchasing that examines potential
        adverse effects in a public sector context. Linking health financing reforms to
        public sector reforms requires strong collaboration between the IFC and the
        Bank’s Health and Public Sector and Finance teams to help facilitate the
        dialogue on health financing at all government levels.

In a reorganized World Bank Group, health financing operations could benefit more
from thinking and coordination across the Bank’s HNP, Governance, Macro and
Fiscal Management, Poverty, and Social Protection teams as well as the IFC. This
could include, for example, streamlining the methodology in the Bank’s diagnostic
program to include analysis on both financial protection and adverse effects set by
financial incentives, and integrating health financing analysis into the new
Systematic Country Diagnostic framework which will focus on the critical
challenges to achieving the twin goals of reduced poverty and shared prosperity.

This evaluation makes five recommendations to guide the Bank Group’s future
work on health financing:

   1. Support government commitment and build technical and information
      capacity to be able to inform health priorities and spending by:

       Supporting countries through capacity building in standardized monitoring
        of total health expenditures (e.g., National Health Accounts), with attention
        to serving the needs of the poor; and
       Expanding training in client countries in collaboration with local Institutions
        to build knowledge and technical capacity through health financing learning
        platforms.

   2. Address health financing as a cross-cutting issue at the country level by:

       Ensuring analysis of equity in health service use and finance, financial
        protection, and financial sustainability consistent with the aim of promoting
        Universal Health Care coverage.

   3. Have Global Practices focus on health financing as a core comparative
      advantage of the Bank by:

       Building and expanding technical capacity among staff working on health
        financing in different Global Practices (including Health, Macro and Fiscal


                                                                                       73

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
         Management, Governance, Poverty, and Social Protection) to ensure that
         staff capacity is adequate to respond to country demand; and
        Having a clearly identified focal point on health financing for the World
         Bank Group.

     4. Integrate all health financing functions by:

        Integrating results-based financing interventions with other health financing
         functions and the broader public finance context at the country level to
         address sustainability and prevent distortions; and
        Developing a joint strategic approach between IFC and the Bank and
         complementary implementation on the ground toward health insurance,
         including mandatory and voluntary coverage.

     5. Strengthen M&E in Bank and IFC health financing projects by:

        Improving appropriate M&E frameworks in Bank and IFC projects to put in
         place mechanisms to collect and monitor relevant indicators; and
        Monitoring distributional indicators, including on access and outcomes,
         consistent with benchmarking and tracking progress toward Universal
         Health Care coverage.
