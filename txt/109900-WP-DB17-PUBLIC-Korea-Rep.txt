This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW

environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business

        Request and obtain proof of ownership of land

        BuildCo must obtain proof of ownership from the Property
        Register to show that BuildCo has the right to construct a
        warehouse on the land. The issuance date stated in the Land
        Registry should be within 3 months prior to the date of
        submitting the application for a building permit. Once the
        application for a building permit and the relevant documents are
        filed with the licensing authority, the authority will forward the        1 day             KRW 1,000

        design drawing to the relevant regulatory agencies, the fire
        department and the sewage department. It is possible to obtain
        proof of ownership (from the Court Registry) immediately after
        applying over the Internet. The fee for issuing certificate of
        registered items is KRW 1,000 for issuance via internet.

        Agency: Property Register



        Purchase National Housing Bonds (NHB)

        To qualify for a building permit, BuildCo must purchase National
        Housing Bonds (NHBs) at any commercial bank. The NHB is
        calculated at a rate ranging from KRW 600.00 to KRW 1,300.00
        per sq. m., depending upon the structure of the warehouse. If the
        warehouse is constructed in steel frame, the rate of KRW
        1,300.00 per sq. m. is applied.

   2                                                                              1 day            KRW 169,078
        BuildCo can either receive the money paid for the NHBs upon
        maturity or sell them at a discount (the discount is 10%). Upon
        purchase, the bank issues a receipt, which must then be
        presented to the Building Authorities. The cost is calculated as
        follows: KRW 1,300.00 x 1300.6 sq. m. = KRW 1,690,780.00.
        However, many sell the NHBs immediately at a discount of 10%,
        which brings the actual cost incurred by the company to KRW
        169,078.00.

      Request and obtain building permit

      BuildCo must submit an application for a building permit to the
      County (Ku) Office of Construction. The application must include:
      • The size of construction lot;
      • Documentation showing BuildCo's ownership or the right to
      use the construction lot; and
      • Basic design drawings, which must specify the approximate
      location of the water pipes, sewage, septic tank, electrical
      facilities, and telephone lines.

      Once the application for the building permit with the relevant
      documents is filed with the licensing authority, this authority
      forwards the design drawings to the relevant regulatory agencies
      (such as the sewerage department and the fire department).
      Thus, it is not necessary for the company to obtain separate
      project clearances from these departments.

      Under the Article 10 of the new Building Code, anyone who
      intends to construct a building may opt for a fast-track
      procedure and apply for an "advance decision regarding building
      permit" before applying for a building permit. If an advance
      decision is obtained for the construction, the builder must
      separately apply for and obtain a building permit for the
      construction. However, when the advance decision is obtained,
3     the relevant approval for the development or re-characterization        9 days     KRW 121,500
      of land (such approval is needed in certain zoning areas under
      several relevant laws) is deemed to be obtained. This effect of
      the advance decision is valid for 2 years from the date of
      issuance, before the builder applies for the building permit itself.

      In addition, it is possible to submit simultaneous applications for
      an advance decision and for the traffic and environment impact
      assessment procedures, and the like, if those procedures are
      necessary. Accordingly, if the builder obtains an advance
      decision before applying for the building permit, the time before
      the construction may be reduced more or less. However, this has
      not worked well in practice and many companies follow the
      traditional way.

      According to the Standard for Civil Petitions Treatment
      published by the Korean Government on December 30, 2005, the
      duration for obtaining a building permit for a two-story, 1,300-
      square-meter building is estimated to be 3 -- 14 days, subject to
      certain circumstances, including whether the work is performed
      by an agent (a certified architect). The duration can take a few
      days longer, as the case may be.

      Before construction work begins, the company informs the
      authority thereof. BuildCo must present a notification
      application, including:

      (owner, construction company, architect, building inspector, etc.)

      water pipes, sewage, septic tank, electrical facilities, and
      telephone lines.

      Hire a certified inspector

      A certified inspector conducts inspections throughout the period
      of construction. If the company does not hire a certified
      inspector during construction, there is a penalty of up to 2 years’
      imprisonment or a fine of up to KRW 10 million. The inspector is
      independent of the company. The frequency of inspections
      varies depending on the size and cost of construction. Generally,
      an inspection takes place if the inspector and the company deem
      it necessary. However, in some instances, the contract between
      the company and the inspector contains a clause specifying the
4     frequency of inspection. There must be at least two inspections        1 day     KRW 19,944,988
      throughout the construction, during which the construction work
      does not stop.

      The cost of is calculated by multiplying the value of the project
      by the relevant rate of 1.29%, in accordance with the Regulation
      for Scope of Architect Services and Fee Standard.

      Agency. According to the Act’s enforcement provision, the time         1 day       KRW 40,000

      Request and obtain fire inspection certificate

      When BuildCo applies for an occupancy permit, the approval

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

Doing Business 2017 presents the data for the labor
market regulation indicators in an annex. The report
does not present rankings of economies on these
indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance
to frontier score or ranking on the ease of doing
business. Detailed data collected on labor market
regulation are available on the Doing Business website
(http://www.doingbusiness.org). The data on labor
market regulation are based on a detailed questionnaire
on employment regulations that is completed by local
lawyers and public officials. Employment laws and
regulations as well as secondary sources are reviewed to
ensure accuracy.

To make the data comparable across economies, several
assumptions about the worker and the business are
used.

The worker:
       Is a cashier in a supermarket or grocery store,
        age 19, with one year of work experience.
       Is a full-time employee.
       Is not a member of the labor union, unless
        membership is mandatory.
The business:
       Is a limited liability company (or the equivalent
        in the economy).
       Operates a supermarket or grocery store in the
        economy’s largest business city. For 11
        economies the data are also collected for the
        second largest business city.
       Has 60 employees.
       Is subject to collective bargaining agreements if

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
