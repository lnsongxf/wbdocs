This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
       Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in Georgia
        perceive the Bank;
       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Georgia regarding:

II. Methodology
In April and May 2013, 276 stakeholders of the World Bank in Georgia were invited to provide
their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country survey.
Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President or Prime Minister;
the office of a Minister; the office of a Parliamentarian; employees of a ministry, ministerial
department, or implementation agency; consultants/contractors working on World Bank-
supported projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of a
project; local government officials or staff; bilateral agencies; multilateral agencies; private
sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; NGOs; community-
based organizations (CBOs); the media; independent government institutions; trade unions; faith-
based groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; the judiciary branch; and former officials
of the government or a ministry. A total of 162 stakeholders participated in the country survey
(59% response rate).
Respondents received questionnaires via courier or email and returned them accordingly.
Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Georgia; their overall attitudes toward the
World Bank; the World Bank’s effectiveness and results; the World Bank’s knowledge work and
activities; working with the World Bank; the Bank’s future role in Georgia; and the Bank’s
communication and information sharing in Georgia.
Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the World Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are
identified throughout the survey report.

A. General Issues Facing Georgia: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Georgia is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
   development priorities, which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and
   generating economic growth in Georgia, and how to best achieve “shared prosperity”.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in Georgia, Bank staff preparedness to help
   Georgia solve its development challenges, the extent to which the Bank should seek to
   influence the global development agenda, their agreement with various statements regarding
   the Bank’s work, and the extent to which the Bank is an effective development partner.
   Respondents were also asked to indicate the sectoral areas on which it would be most
   productive for the Bank to focus its resources, the Bank’s greatest values and greatest
   weaknesses in its work, the most effective instruments in helping to reduce poverty in
   Georgia, with which stakeholder groups the Bank should collaborate more, and to what
   reasons respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts.
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps achieve development results in Georgia, the extent to which the Bank
   meets Georgia’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, and the Bank’s
   level of effectiveness across thirty-four development areas, such as economic growth.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge Work and Activities: Respondents were asked to indicate
   how frequently they consult Bank knowledge work and activities, the areas on which the
   Bank should focus its knowledge work and activities, and to rate the effectiveness and
   quality of the Bank’s knowledge work and activities, including how significant of a
   contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as working with the World
   Bank increasing Georgia’s institutional capacity.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in Georgia: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the Bank should play in Georgia’s development in the near future and to
   indicate what the Bank should do to make itself of greater value in Georgia.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, their Internet access, and their usage and evaluation of the
   Bank’s website. Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s Access to
   Information policy, past information requests from the Bank, and their level of agreement
   that they use more data from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy .
   Respondents were also asked about their level of agreement that they know how to find
   information from the Bank and that the Bank is responsive to information requests.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in Georgia, geographic location, and gender.
In addition, when possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey
were compared to responses from the 122 respondents (82% response rate) who completed the
survey in FY 2005 and the 115 respondents (74% response rate) who completed the survey in
FY 2003. Notations and/or charts are included when these comparisons were possible.

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank (continued)

Greatest Weakness
       Respondents from the office of a Parliamentarian, local government, and bilateral or
        multilateral agencies were the most likely to indicate that the World Bank’s greatest
        weakness was not enough public disclosure of its work whereas consultants on Bank-
        supported projects and respondents from other organizations were signifcaintly less likely
        to choose not enough public disclosure.
       Employees of ministries/implementation agencies were the most likely to indicate that
        the World Bank’s greatest weakness was being too bureaucratic in its operational policies
        and procedures whereas respondents from the office of a Parliamentarian and the media
        were signifcaintly less likely to choose being too bureaucratic.
       Respondents from NGOs were the most likely to indicate that the World Bank’s greatest
        weakness was not collaborating enough with non-state actors whereas employees of
        ministries/implementation agencies and respondents from the office of a Parliamentarian,
        academia/research institutes, and the public sector/financial sector/private banks were
        signifcaintly less likely to choose not collaborating enough with non-state actors.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)

Specific Areas of Effectiveness (continued)

       There were just two instances in which there were statistically significant stakeholder
        group differences across these thirty-four areas of development.
             Employees of ministries/implementation agencies, consultants on Bank-supported
              projects/PMUs, and respondents from other organizations gave the highest ratings
              for the Bank’s effectiveness at “Waste management” whereas respondents from
              the private sector/financial sector/private banks and academia/research institutes
              gave significantly lower effectiveness ratings.
             Employees of ministries/implementation agencies and respondents from the office
              of a Parliamentarian and bilateral or multilateral agencies gave the highest ratings
              for the Bank’s effectiveness at “Trade and exports” whereas respondents from the
              private sector/financial sector/private banks gave significantly lower effectiveness
              ratings.

       Respondents in this year’s country survey gave higher ratings for the Bank’s
        effectiveness across most areas that could be compared to respondents in the FY ’05 and
        FY ’03 country surveys. Statistically significant comparisons are noted in the graph on
        the next page.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)

Drivers of Effectiveness

To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Georgia, bivariate correlational
analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty-four specific areas of
effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in crease.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Georgia. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
                The Bank’s effectiveness at economic growth;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at regulatory framework;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at tourism; and
                The Bank’s effectiveness at public sector governance/reform.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in Georgia, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at economic growth;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at regulatory framework; and
             The Bank’s effectiveness at environmental sustainability.
