EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Results of the World Bank’s 2013 Global Survey on Consumer Protection and Financial Literacy show that financial
regulators are increasingly focusing attention and resources on financial consumer protection. The number of
financial regulators dedicating resources to financial consumer protection increased between 2010 and 2013
from 68 percent to 89 percent. In 2013, 72 percent of a total of 114 agencies had dedicated teams or units for
financial consumer protection within the financial regulator, with many teams created in the past few years.

This technical note is intended to assist policymakers and regulators seeking to establish a financial consumer
protection1 supervision department (“FCPSD”) within the main financial regulator of a country.2 The note provides
concrete, practical information drawn from the experiences in five countries: Armenia, the Czech Republic,
Ireland, Peru, and Portugal. These countries provide examples of the successful development and establishment
of FCPSDs, all of which have been operating for at least five years. A comparative table summarizing the main
elements in the establishment of FCPSDs in case study countries can be found in Annex A.

The scope of this technical note is financial consumer protection supervision. The primary focus is on supervision
and activities related to supervision, such as enforcement and rule-making. However, given that FCPSDs are
commonly found to conduct a range of consumer protection-related activities (e.g. complaints handling, financial
education and literacy, and information sharing), this note will briefly discuss these activities and how they may
impact the organizational structure and activities of a FCPSD.

It is important to emphasize that there is no one approach to establishing a FCPSD that can be copied in all countries.
There is also no orderly, step-by-step process. How a FCPSD is established will be highly dependent on country
context, including such factors as the legal framework for the financial sector, the organizational structure, size,
and capacity of the main financial regulator, political priorities, the stage of development of financial markets, and
major consumer protection concerns.

Nevertheless, there are useful observations that can be made and lessons learned by examining the common
obstacles faced by FCPSDs and the different approaches utilized in establishing such departments. All FCPSDs
in case study countries faced a variety of obstacles, including a lack of internal support, perceived conflicts of
interest with prudential supervision, capacity constraints, and the inherent difficulties associated with starting up
operations for the new (and potentially very broad) topic of financial consumer protection.

A number of organizational and operational strategies used by FCPSDs in case study countries to address these
obstacles are noted below. These strategies are also summarized in Table 1.

      The terms “financial consumer protection” and “market conduct” are used interchangeably in this technical note, as both terms are used in different
      countries to connote similar concepts.
2.	
      Note that there are other institutional arrangements which can be considered for financial consumer protection, such as the “twin peaks” model. For
      purposes of this paper, the discussion is limited to a department within the main financial regulator.

    An initial starting point for establishing a FCPSD is                             countries, the impetus for financial consumer
    ensuring a strong and clear legal mandate to undertake                            protection came from the Ministry of Finance.
    financial consumer protection combined with high-level
    policymaker support. Ideally, the financial regulator                             The scope, coverage, and statutory responsibilities
    should be assigned (1) rule-making powers, (2)                                    of FCPSDs should be broadly established, but actual
    oversight and monitoring powers, and (3) enforcement                              implementation should begin on a small-scale and

    TABLE 1: PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS WHEN ESTABLISHING A FCPSD
    LEGAL MANDATE AND HIGH-LEVEL SUPPORT
    •	   Ensure that the financial regulator has a strong, broad, and clear legal mandate to undertake financial consumer protection supervision.
    •	   Assign the financial regulator with comprehensive powers necessary to undertake financial consumer protection supervision, including rule-making,
         oversight and monitoring, and enforcement powers.
    •	   Aim for high-level, public, and political support from outset from both within and outside of the financial regulator.
    •	   Prove relevance and importance of FCPSD’s work over time to generate acceptance and understanding.
    SCOPE, COVERAGE, AND STATUTORY RESPONSIBILITIES
    •	   Clearly specify scope and coverage of financial consumer protection supervision by type of financial institution or type of product or service.
    •	   Coordinate with other regulatory agencies involved in consumer protection.
    •	   Establish relatively broad statutory objectives and responsibilities, but be flexible in implementation priorities.
    •	   Conduct initial risk-based assessment to determine immediate priorities and agenda.
    •	   Can start small-scale and expand consciously and strategically over time.
    ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE
    •	   Begin as smaller internal division within larger department for ease and quickness of launch.
    •	   Establish the goal from the start to become a stand-alone department in long-run.
    •	   Clearly separate consumer protection supervision from prudential supervision by either housing it in a separate department or placing it at the same
         level of hierarchical authority as prudential supervision.
    •	   Where possible, have FCPSD report directly to a different board member than prudential supervision department to reinforce independence.
    •	   Coordinate with other departments within the financial regulator as an explicit strategy to leverage resources.
    STAFFING AND INTERNAL STRUCTURE
    •	   Hire staff with experience in a variety of sectors and backgrounds to provide flexibility to address expanding activities of FCPSD.
    •	   Provide staff with in-house training and allow for learning by practice.
    •	   Begin with smaller staff size with more limited activities and grow from there.
    •	   Organize internally by function to allow for staff with greater degree of specialization.
    SUPERVISORY TOOLS
    •	   Conduct independent on-site inspections where capacity allows; consider targeted on-site inspections on particular themes or issues.
    •	   Where on-site inspections are conducted with prudential supervision, use clear supervision manuals and coordinate with prudential supervision on
         inspection results.
    •	   Develop a systematic, risk-based program of regular off-site supervision and market monitoring to make most effective use of resources.
    •	   Allow FCPSD to directly request voluntary corrective actions.
    •	   Consider providing FCPSD with rule-making authority with respect to financial consumer protection.

   Case Study 1: Czech Republic—Building Support Over Time
   In the Czech Republic, the largest obstacle that the new CPD faced was lack of internal support. The Board
   of the CNB believed that there was a conflict of interest between prudential supervision and financial
   consumer protection supervision. The Board also expected the CPD to fight against the level of bank fees
   and interest rates for consumers, which was considered undesirable and contrary to the CNB’s liberal
   policy towards fees and interest rates in the financial market.

   The CPD utilized various strategies to address these concerns. As previously noted, the CPD’s initial
   oversight and monitoring tools were limited. The department has focused its work and the exercise of its
   power on transparency, rather than more intrusive regulation of products. Requests for corrective action
   have focused on disclosure of information to consumers; modifications to the terms of a product are only
   requested on occasion.

   After five years, the CPD is now viewed with more support within the CNB. The department has proven
   that its work can complement prudential supervision and it is now considered by management to actually
   increase the reputation of the CNB.

    Case Study 2: Peru and Portugal—Expanding Coverage and Scope
    The experiences in Peru and Portugal illustrate that the scope and coverage of financial consumer protection
    supervision can begin on a more limited basis and expand gradually over time. In Peru, market conduct
    supervision by the Products and User Services Office (GPU) began in 2005 with banks and microfinance
    institutions. Coverage of insurance providers and private pension funds was only added in 2013, when
    transparency regulation was issued for these institutions. Consumer protection responsibilities for private
    pension funds on transparency-related issues, which were previously held by another department within
    the SBS, are currently being transferred to the GPU. This move helps to centralize consumer protection
    supervision within the SBS and ensure a more consistent supervisory approach.

    In Portugal, BP has seen its authority for market conduct extended pursuant to new legal provisions. For
    example, the Payment Services Directive of 2009 granted BP further powers to supervise the conduct of
    payment services providers (credit institutions, payment institutions, and e-money institutions).

    The examples in Peru and Portugal both show that the scope and coverage of financial consumer protection
    supervision can and should expand over time to include new providers and products, in order to ensure
    comprehensive and harmonized oversight.

   Case Study 3: Portugal—Developing an Initial Agenda
   In Portugal, the conscious strategy of the BCSD was to pursue a gradual approach with clearly defined
   priorities. Before the department was established, an assessment was conducted examining what the
   main consumer protection-related issues were from both the consumer side as well as the supplier side.
   Risk-weighting was used to determine specific areas on which to first focus, as it was deemed impossible
   for the new department to undertake all activities at once. Based on the risk-weighted evaluation, the
   BCSD’s priority areas were determined to be: advertising, transparency of information in the deposits
   market, price lists, transparency of information in the mortgage market, and consumer credit. The BCSD’s
   initial agenda therefore focused on these priority areas, beginning with advertisements, then price lists,
   followed by consumer credit and mortgages. It now also undertakes the development of codes of conduct.

   Case Study 4: Portugal and Peru—Evolution of Organizational Structure
   In Portugal and Peru, financial consumer protection supervision began as a division within a larger
   department, but with the goal firmly established from the start to ultimately become a stand-alone
   department.

   In Portugal, the Banking Conduct Supervision unit was first created within the Banking Supervision
   Department in 2007. BCSD supervisors noted that it was not practical to start a new department from
   scratch and made more operational sense to begin within an existing department. However, the long-term
   plan from the very start was for the unit to become a separate, independent department down the road.
   It was important that the unit had a clear, specific assignment and set of responsibilities separate from
   prudential supervision. In addition, the deputy director of the Banking Conduct Supervision unit reported
   directly to the Vice Governor of the Banco de Portugal, bypassing the director of the Banking Supervision
   Department and providing the unit with a degree of independence. The unit became an autonomous,
   stand-alone department in 2011 when the Supervision Department was split into Prudential Supervision
   and Banking Conduct Supervision.

   In Peru, the GPU was created in 2005 as an internal division within a broader unit, although this placement
   was only temporary. The GPU was moved to the same hierarchical level as a deputy superintendency the
   following year. However, the GPU was legally structured as a “unit” and not a deputy superintendency,
   and therefore lacked the legal protections provided to deputy superintendencies within the SBS. The GPU
   is anticipated to become a formal deputy superintendency with the same organizational level and legal
   protections as other deputy superintendencies beginning in January 2014.

      Laws on the CBI summarize the CBI’s financial consumer protection strategic priorities as 5 C’s: (1) Consumer – putting the consumer at the center of the regulatory framework; (2) Culture
      – striving to ensure a consumer-focused ethos among those the CBI regulates, the CBI, and others; (3) Compliance – ensuring compliance with the rules through effective supervision and cred-
      ible deterrence and enforcement; (4) Confidence – ensuring confidence in financial services, products, industry and regulation; and (5) Challenge – challenging the CBI, those the CBI regulates,
      and others to get it right for consumers.
