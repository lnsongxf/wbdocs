Review of Waste Minimisation Programmes                                               June 2014



1.0     INTRODUCTION

The World Bank commissioned SLR Consulting Limited (SLR) in February 2014 to
conduct a global review of successful programmes for waste minimisation, waste
segregation, waste collection and litter reduction.

The outcomes from this study are expected to inform the World Bank of successful
programmes to support Latin American countries in their modernisation of solid waste
management services and infrastructure.

The Terms of Reference (TORs) for the commission identified three specific tasks:

1.     Task 1 – Global review of successful waste minimisation programmes;
2.     Task 2 – Global review of innovative programmes for waste collection, litter
       reduction and source segregation; and
3.     Task 3 – Prepare a case study of the source segregation scheme implemented in
       San Francisco, California.

This report presents the findings from Task 1 5 global review of successful waste
minimisation programmes.

1.1     Methodology

SLR initially reviewed reports available from a wide range of sources (e.g. International
Solid Waste Association (ISWA), UNEP, World Bank) to develop a long list of waste
minimisation programmes (see Table 151 below) that have been implemented by other
countries worldwide.

The long list was provided to the World Bank for consideration and a shortlist consisting of
the following five waste minimisation programmes, which are considered to be of
relevance for informing waste management in the Latin America and Caribbean region,
was agreed for further research and review:

•     Brazil’s National Policy on Solid Waste (Section 2.0);
•     pay5as5you5throw (PAYT) schemes (Section 3.0);
•     European Commission’s Landfill Directive with focus on landfill bans on organic
      waste (Section 4.0);
•     plastic bag bans (Section 5.0); and
•     polystyrene foam bans (Section 6.0).

                                                                                                        2

Review of Waste Minimisation Programmes                                        June 2014

Each of the above programmes has been reviewed in some detail to provide a general
overview of the following elements, to help inform the development and implementation of
similar programmes:

•    policies implemented for successful implementation of the program;
•    program costs, where available;
•    program requirements and standards;
•    reported benefits;
•    key pre5requisites; and
•    key design elements.

Relevant case study examples are also included in this report for each of the five
shortlisted programmes to provide further information on the implementation of the
programmes in specific locations.

It should be noted that the content of this report is reliant on the accuracy of information
presented in the publically available documents which have been reviewed for this study.
Some of the information available may not fully reflect changes to the programmes and
policies discussed in this report which have been implemented since publication of the
source material. Where practicable, SLR has endeavoured to cross5check the accuracy of
information and the current status of programmes.

For each of the five shortlisted programmes, the report provides a general overview with
sufficient supporting information to assist in the development of comparable programmes,
if deemed appropriate, to support the ongoing modernisation of waste management
practices in the Latin America and Caribbean region.

2.0    BRAZIL’S NATIONAL POLICY ON SOLID WASTE

This chapter provides an overview of Brazil’s National Policy on Solid Waste (hereafter
referred to as NPSW) implemented in August 2010, with specific focus on waste
prevention and minimisation measures proposed in the policy.

This chapter is structured to summarise the responsibilities and implications for the public
and private sectors in delivering the waste prevention and minimisation proposals in the
NPSW, with particular focus on the reverse logistics (e.g. take5back schemes) of certain
products.

Two case studies are presented towards the end of this chapter reporting experiences of
those who have implemented reverse logistics schemes for pesticides packaging and
electronic waste.

It should be noted that an unofficial English translation of the NPSW published by the
Brazilian Ministry of the Environment (see Appendix A) and accessible documents
(including those from the various Brazilian ministries) have been relied upon in preparing
this review. Whilst this review provides a general summary of the NPSW and its
implications, it should not be relied upon as a legally accurate interpretation of the NPSW.

2.1    Overview of the Policy

The NPSW sets out a series of principles, objectives, instruments, guidelines, goals and
actions for effective implementation of an integrated and environmentally sound solid
waste management system for Brazil.

Some of the general sustainable waste management approaches promoted in the NPSW
include:

•     waste management following a hierarchy which prioritises waste prevention,
      minimisation, reuse and recycling over environmentally safe treatment and disposal;
•     eco5design (e.g. design of products to enable recycling and minimise environmental
      impacts at their end of life);
•     shared responsibility of products’ life cycle by producers, importers, distributors and
      sellers;
•     integration of waste5pickers, with adequate training and appropriate equipment, in
      activities such as waste collection, reuse and recycling; and
•     green procurement (e.g. preference to use products that are either eco5designed or
      made of recycled materials) by government bodies.

It forms part of the National Environmental Policy and is coordinated with other national
policies on environmental education and basic sanitation.

2.1.1 Waste Prevention and Minimisation Specific Elements of the Policy

The NPSW, in addition to promoting sustainable management of waste following a
hierarchy that promotes waste prevention and minimisation, contains the following
requirements to prevent waste generation and inappropriate disposal of environmentally
hazardous materials:

•     only packaging materials that are capable of being reused or recycled should be
      manufactured; and


                                                                                                4
World Bank                                                                 406.01566.00005
Review of Waste Minimisation Programmes                                          June 2014

•     manufacturers, importers, distributors and sellers of the products below are
      compulsorily required to frame and implement reverse logistics systems upon
      receiving products from consumers:
           o pesticides, their residues and packaging;
           o cells and batteries;
           o tyres;
           o lubricant oils;
           o fluorescent, sodium and mercury vapour, and mixed light lamps; and
           o electric and electronic appliances and their components.

Reverse logistics is essentially a take5back scheme that puts legal responsibility for the
safe disposal of certain materials on manufacturers and importers of those materials. It
may also be referred to as an extended producer responsibility (EPR) scheme. In a
reverse logistics system, products and/or packaging placed on the market are taken back
(after their intended use) for recycling or safe disposal by those who were responsible for
placing the products on the market. The NPSW permits public authorities and their
operators of local waste management services to provide reverse logistics systems as well
as environmentally safe reuse, recycling treatment and/or disposal of such materials.

A sectorial agreement or similar will need to be in place between the public authority (or its
waste management operators) and the supply chain of the relevant product stream for
such a scheme to be delivered. Public authorities (or their waste management operators)
are eligible to charge adequate fees to the supply chain for the delivery of waste
management and reverse logistics services.

The NPSW also allows public authorities to introduce financial incentives or attractive
credit lines to initiatives, such as eco5design and reverse logistics, which may contribute to
waste minimisation and prevention.

2.2    The Role of National and Local Governments in Delivering the Policy

2.2.1 What needs to be done and by when?

National Level

The NPSW requires the Federal Government (national government) to formulate a
National Plan on Solid Waste (waste management strategy) under the coordination of the
Ministry of Environment, to be developed in consultation with stakeholders including the
states, municipalities, Federal District, business sectors, households and other competent
bodies (e.g. Sisnama, SNVS). The NPSW states that the plan should include:

•     targets for waste reduction, reuse, recycling and/or other relevant waste
      management measures;
•     targets for energy recovery from landfills;
•     targets for the elimination and recovery of dump sites with consideration to the
      inclusion and economic emancipation of waste5pickers collecting reusable and
      recyclable materials;
•     planning and regulatory guidance for the development and operation of integrated
      waste management facilities; and
•     minimum requirements for accessing public funds for investment in eligible solid
      waste management initiatives.




                                                                                                 5

Review of Waste Minimisation Programmes                                        June 2014

State Level

The states in Brazil are each required by the NPSW to develop a State Plan on Solid
Waste to clarify state level waste management objectives, targets and support
mechanisms.

In addition to setting targets similar to or better than those identified in the NPSW
developed by the Federal Government, each State Plan on Solid Waste should identify
suitable sites within the state boundary where waste treatment or disposal facilities may be
provided.

Municipality Level

All municipalities are required to develop an integrated waste management plan to detail
their strategy for delivering long term improvement to waste management arrangements in
their municipality regions.

The municipalities are encouraged to develop integrated waste management plans jointly
with neighbouring municipalities to provide economies of scale in delivering improved
waste management solutions.

The required contents of the municipal integrated waste management plans as per the
NPSW include:

•    suitable locations for constructing waste treatment or disposal facilities;
•    programmes and actions for the participation of cooperatives or other forms of
     association of waste5pickers collecting reusable or recyclable materials; and
•    targets aimed at reducing the quantity of waste requiring final environmentally
     adequate disposal (e.g. targets specific to waste reduction, reuse, selective
     collection and/or recycling).

Timescales

The national, state and municipal solid waste plans are required to cover a period of 20
years from the date of their publication and should be reviewed and updated every 4
years.

The NPSW requires all states and municipalities in Brazil to prepare their respective solid
waste plans by August 2012. It also requires the state and local governments (e.g.
municipalities) to cease all open dump operations and provide environmentally safe waste
disposal locations by August 2014 (Figure 251).

2.2.2 What support is available to local governments for delivering the policy
      requirements?

The NPSW offers the states and municipalities the opportunity to seek funding from the
Federal Government for the development of their solid waste plans.

Further guidance and support mechanisms may have been made available to the local
governments following the implementation of the NPSW, but SLR has not been able to
identify publically accessible documents which identify such support mechanisms.

2.2.3 What are the likely consequences of not complying with the policy
      requirements?

The NPSW does not appear to specify any direct impacts or consequences to local
governments from non5compliance with its requirements.

It is possible that subsequent or complementary legislation may have identified the
consequences, but further review of such policies or legislative measures has not been
undertaken within the scope of this study.

2.3    Policy Implementation

2.3.1 Delivery Model

The NPSW seeks to encourage technical and financial cooperation between the public
sector, commercial (private) sector and households to deliver an environmentally friendly
and economically affordable sustainable waste management solution for Brazil.

The overarching structure for the implementation of the provisions in the NPSW is as
summarised in Figure 252, but there may be some exceptions when it comes to
implementation of specific policy measures (e.g. reverse logistics).




                                                                                            7
World Bank                                                                406.01566.00005

    Figure 252 Schematic of Development and Implementation of Waste Management
                          Plans (Environmental Ministry, 2011)

Following the provision of the long term strategy for solid waste management by the
Federal Government (as described in Section 2.2.1), the responsibility for locally delivering
the strategy will fall on municipalities, their waste management contractors and business
sectors.

Delivery of local waste management services will need to comply with the waste plans (i.e.
municipal, state and national level solid waste plans) and relevant standards established
by national competent bodies (e.g. Sisnama).

Shared Responsibility and Reverse Logistics

One of the innovative policies in the NPSW that is specific to waste reduction and
minimisation is the policy on shared responsibility for the life cycle of products, which is
outlined in Articles 30 to 35 of the policy document.

Article 33 of the NPSW requires manufacturers, importers, distributors and sellers of the
following products to develop and implement a reverse logistics system for the recovery
and environmentally safe reuse, recycling, treatment or disposal of each product type:

•      pesticides, their residues and packaging (or other products whose packaging
       constitute hazardous waste);
•      cells and batteries;
•      tyres;
•      lubricant oils, their residues and packaging;
•      fluorescent, sodium, mercury vapour and mixed light lamps; and
•      electrical and electronic equipment.

Subsequent information available from Brazil’s government departments suggest that
reverse logistics systems are also being considered for general packaging and medicines
(Ministry of Development, Industry and Trade, 2013).

                                                                                                8
World Bank                                                                 406.01566.00005
Review of Waste Minimisation Programmes                                          June 2014

Implementation of reverse logistics for the above products is expected to involve the
following:

•     implementation of purchasing procedures of used products or packaging;
•     establishment of drop5off points for reusable and recyclable waste; and
•     partnership working with cooperatives or other forms of association of waste5pickers
      collecting reusable and recyclable material.

The ultimate responsibility, including costs, for the safe reuse, recycling, treatment and
disposal of packaging and products returned through reverse logistics lies with the
manufacturer or importer of the products.

Public authorities, or their providers of local waste management services, may provide all
or part of the reverse logistics services including final treatment and/or disposal subject to
a Sectorial Agreement (or similar) and receipt of appropriate fees for the provision of such
services. Public authorities might be better placed to provide affordable collection and
transport services for reverse logistics in rural areas, provided they have effective services
for waste collection and treatment.

A ‘Sectorial Agreement’ is a contract intended to be signed by the government,
manufacturers, importers, distributors and dealers to implement the shared responsibility
for the life cycle of the products. A Sectorial Agreement will typically establish and agree
objectives, requirements, targets, logistics, treatment and costs for the groups responsible
for the implementation of reverse logistics strategies (Beecheno, 2013).

2.3.2 Supporting Legislation

It is understood that the following legislation, in addition to the NPSW, complements the
legal basis for solid waste management in Brazil (Environmental Ministry of Brazil, 2011):

•     Decree by the Ministries of Cities, Mines and Energy, and Environment (Decree No.
      7.404/2010) which deals with energy recovery from waste;
•     Decree No. 7405/2010, Pro5Scavenger Decree;
•     Law No. 11.445/2007, Basic Sanitation. Decree No. 7217/2010; and
•     Law No. 11.107/2005, Public Consortia. Decree No. 6.717/2007.

2.3.3 Implementation Costs

The Environmental Ministry has estimated an expenditure of R$1.5 billion (approximately
US$640 million) for the development and implementation of solid waste management
plans in accordance with the NWSP (Environmental Ministry of Brazil, 2011).

An estimate from the Brazilian Ministry of Development, Industry and Foreign Trade
suggests that implementation of a reverse logistics system for electric and electronic
equipment alone may cost R$264 million (US$112 million) in 2014, with the cumulative
costs rising to R$515 million (US$219 million) by 2020 (Ministry of Development, Industry
and Trade, 2013).

2.3.4 Status Update

Strategic Plans

Information and reports available since the introduction of the NPSW suggest that the
policy has helped to initiate sustainable management of solid waste in Brazil and has
resulted in the closure of open dumps (e.g. Jardim Gramacho dump in Rio de Janeiro in
June 2012).
                                                                                                 9
World Bank                                                               406.01566.00005
Review of Waste Minimisation Programmes                                        June 2014

However, there appear to be no credible reports which summarise the progress made to
date on specific requirements of the policy such as development of waste plans at state
and municipality levels.

Brazil’s Ministry of Environment has been contacted for a status update regarding NPSW’s
implementation, but a response has not been made available at the time of finalising this
report.

Shared Responsibility and Reverse Logistics

Soon after the implementation of the NPSW, a Decree (No. 7404) created the Steering
Committee for the Implementation of Reverse Logistics, the structure of which is
summarised in Figure 253 below.

This steering committee then developed five Technical Working Groups (one each for
lubricant oils and packaging, lamps, general packaging, electric and electronic equipment
and medicines), which included representatives from major retailers, producers and
recyclers.

The purpose of each group was to design its own legal Sectorial Agreement, subject to the
Ministry of the Environment’s approval and to establish conditions, targets and obligations
to retailers, manufacturers and importers in relation to the implementation of reverse
logistics strategies.




Figure 253 Structure of the Steering Committee (Environmental Ministry of Brazil, 2011)

Brazil already had functional reverse logistics systems in place, with good recovery rates,
for pesticides and related packaging, tyres and automotive batteries even before the
implementation of the NPSW (Beecheno, 2013; Veiga, 2013; Espinosa et al., 2004,
Baenas et al., 2008).


                                                                                              10
World Bank                                                                         406.01566.00005
Review of Waste Minimisation Programmes                                                  June 2014

The most recent update regarding the process of development of Sectorial Agreements for
the remaining materials that fall under the reverse logistics scheme was reported in July
2013 and is summarised below:

•     lubricant oil and packaging: Sectorial Agreement signed in December 2012;
•     lamps: proposals being reviewed by the Ministry of Environment;
•     general packaging: proposals being reviewed by the Ministry of Environment;
•     electrical and electronic equipment: Started public consultation in February 2013;
      and
•     medicines: feasibility study and public calling being prepared.

Clearly progress is being made, but further work is needed to maintain the early
momentum.

2.4     Opportunities

It is considered that the implementation of the NPSW, and particularly the application of
shared responsibility and reverse logistics, would pave the way for social inclusion of
waste5pickers, as well as encouraging innovation and investment in a range of areas to
deliver sustainable management of waste in Brazil including:

•     cost effective and environmental friendly reverse logistics systems which may
      provide opportunities for the use of GPS technology, route optimisation software or
      fleet management models to plan locations of drop5off points, collection times and
      loading efficiency;
•     eco5design (e.g. design of products such that they can be easily disassembled at the
      end of their lives to enable reuse or recycling of parts to minimise reliance on virgin
      materials);
•     innovative technologies and business models for the reuse and recycling of
      materials procured through the reverse logistics model; and
•     development of standards to ensure consistent quality and safety of reused and
      recycled products including those from reverse logistics scheme.

2.5     Case Studies

Two case studies are presented below in the context of reverse logistics schemes,
reflecting the sectors of:

•     pesticide packaging; and
•     electrical and electronic equipment.

The case studies have been sourced from previously published and publically available
documents, and the current operational status of each scheme has not been further
verified under this commission.

Reverse Logistics of Pesticides and Related Packaging (Freires et al., 2010)
Background
Brazil was the fifth largest user of pesticides in 2010, and had a functioning reverse logistics system
(RLS) for agricultural pesticide packaging even before the implementation of the NPSW.
Legal Framework
All parties involved in the supply chain of agricultural pesticides are legally obliged to provide a RLS
                 th
(Law 9974 of 6 June 2000, amending Law No. 7802). Failure to provide an adequate RLS could
result in imprisonment for up to 4 years and/or further penalty. The end users of agricultural
pesticides (e.g. farmers) also have a legal obligation to return all pesticide packaging, after
                                                                                                           11
World Bank                                                                        406.01566.00005

thorough washing (if the pesticides are water soluble), to specified drop5off points within one year of
purchase or six months following the ‘use by date’ of such items.
Infrastructure
Under this system, dealers of pesticides are responsible for providing the drop5off points and must
indicate the nearest drop5off point on the customer’s purchase invoices. Returned packaging items
are then inspected by trained personnel and recorded for any future inspection.
It is understood that the RLS network for agricultural pesticide packaging consists of approximately
350 drop5off points, managed by 185 associations (including cooperatives) and 40 dealers
representing more than 2,200 distributors across all Brazilian states (Figure 254).




            Figure 254 Pesticides and Related Packaging RLS Infrastructure


Governance
In the 1990s, a partnership was formed between ANDEF (the General office of Agriculture of the
state of Sao Paulo), AEASP (the Association of the Agricultural Engineers of the State of São
Paulo) and COPLANA (the Association of Sugar Cane Producers of the Guariba District) to study
the flow of empty packaging of pesticides. In addition, a unit for piloting reception and primary
treatment of packaging of pesticides was also implemented. Recycling options for pesticide
packaging were created through an agreement with a small company within the pesticide industry.
The Brazilian Association of Technical Standards (ABNT) contributed to the RLS of pesticide
packaging by developing standards and procedures for the management and treatment of such
materials.
The National Institute of Processing of Empty Packaging was formed in 2001 (INPEV) and started
to contribute towards the coordination of the RLS for pesticide packaging with support from
companies involved in the supply chain.
Outcomes
Pesticide packaging recovered through the RLS is understood to be managed by 10 companies,
with certification from INPEV. Eight of these companies recycle pesticide packaging to produce
products such as cardboard barrels, sewer tubes, boxes for automotive batteries and packaging for
lubricants. The remaining two companies recover energy from the returned packaging.
INPEV reported that approximately 88% of the packaging for primary pesticides was recovered for
recycling and treatment in 2006 (Keith, 2007).
In addition to contributing to environmental protection and resource efficiency, the RLS for pesticide
                                                                                                          12

packaging is understood to have generated more than 2,500 jobs.


Reverse Logistics of Electrical and Electronic Equipment (The Guardian, 2013)
Background
Brazil is the third largest market for computers in the world and is estimated to generate
approximately 900,000 tons of waste electric and electronic equipment (WEEE) per annum
(Ministry of Development, Industry and Trade, 2013).
Philips Sustainable Cycle Programme
In 2009, before the implementation of the NPSW, Philips Brazil initiated the program Ciclo
Sustentável or Sustainable Cycle, which set up take5back and reverse logistics mechanisms, to
manage WEEE efficiently.
Philips had a service agreement with over 400 service centres around the Country. This partnership
was extended in 2010 by setting up procedures that enable the service centres to function as
product take5back centres so that consumers can drop off products that cannot be repaired and
play a part in the proper recycling of these products.
Philips continues to develop take5back systems for their products in Brazil by rolling out take5back
programmes in several service centres across the Country including:
•     Rio Grande do Sul;
•     Paraná, São Paulo;
•     Rio de Janeiro;
•     Minas Gerais;
•     the Federal District;
•     Mato Grosso do Sul, Goiás;
•     Bahia;
•     Alagoas;
•     Pernambuco;
•     Paraíba;
•     Ceara;
•     Rio Grande do Norte;
•     Piauí;
•     Maranhão;
•     and Pará.
These centres were selected because they dealt with approximately 80% of product service orders
in the Country.
The programme was expanded in November 2010, to include other types of waste and nearly 1,000
collection points were set up for batteries in a project called Projeto ABINEE Recebe Pilhas, run by
the ABINEE 5 Brazilian Association of Electrical and Electronics Industry. In 2011, a further
programme was initiated to collect medical equipment for recycling.
Philips’ experience of WEEE take back schemes in Brazil suggests that it is crucial to set up
comprehensive reverse logistics systems, as WEEE items need to be transported from all over the
Country to a very limited number of recycling plants. The products brought in by consumers are
accumulated in the service centres or drop5off points until they reach a sufficient volume to make
the transport costs economic, at which point the goods are transported in bulk to the nearest
recycling plant.
Outcomes
Since its inception in 2010, the Sustainable Cycle programme is estimated to have collected 360
tons of electronic products and appliances, 475 tons of batteries and 210 tons of medical
equipment across the Country. These figures represent a significant improvement on the situation
prior to the programme’s introduction.
As the programme is extended further, a new chain of activities are expected to be generated,
helping to reduce the extraction of raw materials and return raw materials to the production cycle,
thus continuing the journey towards a circular economy.

3.0    PAY AS YOU THROW SCHEMES

3.1    Introduction

Pay5as5you5throw (PAYT) programmes refer to waste management and payment schemes
where residents are charged for the collection of household solid waste based generally
on the amount that they throw away. There is a direct economic incentive inherent in the
PAYT scheme for residents to maximise waste reduction, reuse and recycling (including
home composting) and generate less unsorted residual waste.

In waste management systems without PAYT schemes, residents usually pay for waste
collection and management through property taxes or a fixed fee, regardless of how much,
or how little, residual waste they generate. PAYT schemes treat waste services in the
same manner as other utilities such as electricity, gas or water.

3.2    Policy Implementation and Delivery Models

PAYT programmes are particularly popular in the US and Europe, in comparison to the
rest of the World.

According to the USEPA, by 2006 more than 7,000 communities in the US (representing
26% of all US communities) had implemented some form of PAYT scheme (USEPA,
2006). European countries which operate PAYT schemes include Switzerland, Germany,
Italy, Denmark and the Netherlands.

There are several operational models of PAYT schemes, which are defined by:

•     the method of identification for charging (i.e. by user or container); and/or
•     the measurement unit for payment (e.g. by volume of bin, number of sacks, or
      weight of waste).

There are a number of published studies, including from the USEPA, about various PAYT
schemes and their specific aspects. An overview of various delivery models for PAYT
schemes is provided in Figure 351 below.

Volume based payment schemes (e.g. pre5paid sacks, volume of the waste bin used)
appear to be the most widely used schemes in the US and Europe. However, schemes
based on the actual tonnage of weight disposed also seem to be increasingly popular.

The following factors must be considered before implementing a PAYT scheme (Figure
352):

•     determination of the PAYT scheme and measurement unit (e.g. bags, containers or
      user identification) with consideration of location specific socio5urban characteristics
      and the available recyclable collection options;
•     fee or user rate;
•     logistical aspects (e.g. purchase, storage and deployment of bags, containers or
      user identification tags); and
•     legal aspects (e.g. legislation and enforcement).

Wastewatch (2014) reports that for the PAYT schemes to contribute effectively to waste:

•     all residents should have equal access to practical and convenient recycling
      services. Recycling of materials with higher weight, value or volume should be at
      least as easy as throwing away unsorted waste;
                                                                                                             18

•    proper and effective communications campaigns should be run to ensure that all
     parts of the community are aware of how they can minimise their waste;
•    waste charges should be set at a level that motivates consumers to reduce their
     waste, but not so high as to encourage illegal waste disposal; and
•    billing systems and invoicing may be made comparable to that of electricity, gas and
     water.

3.2.1 Setting Rates for PAYT Schemes

A 1999 USEPA review of the payment structures utilised by the various communities in the
US with PAYT programmes classified them into three main categories:

•    Proportional Systems – where households are charged the same level of fees for
     each waste container that they set out for collection. These are usually bag or tag
     systems, with the bags being sold at local retail stores or municipal offices;
•    Variable Rate Pricing Systems – where households are charged different amounts
     per unit and/or type of waste (e.g. using different sized containers); and
•    Two5Tiered or Multi5Tiered Systems – where residents pay a flat fee for a base
     level of service, and then pay a "second5tier" fee based on how much waste they set
     out. Second5tier fees can be based on either proportional or variable rate systems.

The USEPA review concluded that decisions about pricing systems and other rate
structure components depend on an individual community's circumstances and goals for
its PAYT programme.

Variable Rate Pricing systems appear to be preferred by communities which aim to
maximise recycling. Where an equitable approach is the main programme objective,
communities tend to adopt Proportional Systems, and those with the objective of covering
solid waste management costs seem to prefer Two5Tiered or Multi5Tiered Systems (as is
the case with San Francisco’s successful ‘Fantastic Three Programme’ for example).

The USEPA study identified that the approaches adopted by various communities to
derive the rates for the PAYT schemes could be broadly grouped into the following:

•    setting rates based on rates set by comparable communities (e.g. cities or
     municipalities with comparable demographics);
•    setting rates based on community data and local competition. This approach would
     look at waste generation data for the community, anticipated programme costs and
     local competition to derive rates for the PAYT scheme. This approach may be more
     effective than setting rates based on comparable communities; and
•    setting rates to recover full costs of waste management. This approach looks at total
     costs for waste collection and disposal and will set a base level fee (to cover fixed
     costs such as labour and equipment) plus a variable fee (to cover variable costs
     such as facility gate fees).

None of the PAYT examples reviewed for this study reported use of differential pricing
systems to account for the varying abilities of low income and well off households within a
scheme area to pay for waste management services.

Typically, affordability of PAYT schemes to households targeted for the scheme is
considered before implementing such schemes, and therefore the rates tend to be set at
affordable levels from the outset.

3.3    Benefits and Challenges of PAYT Schemes

3.3.1 Benefits

Supporters of PAYT schemes highlight the following advantages or benefits of the
approach:

•     increase in recycling levels and reduction in waste generated. Some PAYT schemes
      adopted in Europe and North America are estimated to have increased recycling
      levels by up to 30540% (Strange K, 2006);
•     reduced reliance on natural resources as more materials are recycled;
•     reduction in greenhouse gas emissions associated with the manufacture,
      distribution, use, and subsequent disposal of products due to increased recycling;
•     assistance in generating the revenues that communities need to cover their solid
      waste management costs, including the costs of complementary programmes such
      as recycling and composting; and
•     inherent fairness of the systems because residents pay only for what they put out for
      collection, and therefore are directly incentivised to minimise generation of residual
      waste.

3.3.2 Challenges

The challenges that will need to be considered before implementing PAYT schemes
include:

•     approach to gaining strong political support;
•     robustness of the legislative provisions;
•     appropriate enforcement of environmental legislation to prevent fly5tipping, illegal
      burning and illegal filling5up of neighbour’s waste bins or street litter bins (scheme
      dependent);
•     gaining the support of households that would be impacted;
•     arrangements to ensure timely collection of fees to support the cash flow;
•     potential increase in fly5tipping incidents and associated clear up costs;
•     potential contamination of recyclable streams with unsorted waste (dependent on
      collection arrangements);
•     ability of the scheme to recover fixed costs for the provision of waste management
      services; and
•     container systems combined with pay per weight schemes may lead to residents
      illegally filling up their neighbour’s bins or roadside litter bins to avoid charges.

A study by Econservation Institute based on factual evidence concluded that the vast
majority of communities that adopted PAYT in the US did not report increased incidences
of illegal dumping, and most of the communities that reported an increase of illegal
dumping found that it returned to pre5PAYT levels within one to three months
(Econservation Institute. 2014).

Effective communication of the scheme’s benefits is essential to alleviate householders’
concerns and establish their support for the scheme. Despite best efforts, some
householders or specific groups may organise themselves effectively to oppose
implementation of PAYT schemes (e.g. retired people on fixed income might perceive
PAYT scheme as high net costs to them, although they might be low waste generators
and therefore more likely to benefit from the scheme). These considerations will need to
be factored in when planning for the introduction of PAYT scheme.

3.4     Pre5requisites

Some of the essential pre5requisites for successful implementation of PAYT schemes are
summarised in Table 352.

Pre5Requisite            Rationale
Access to practical      Unless all residents have equal access to practical and convenient recycling
and convenient           services, they will have no effective means to actively reduce the quantity of
recycling services       non5recyclable waste. Recycling of materials with higher weight, value or
                         volume should be at least as easy as throwing away unsorted waste.
Affordability of         The user rates for PAYT scheme should be affordable to the households
households to pay        being served. If not, it might lead to unsafe waste disposal methods such as
for the scheme           illegal dumping or burning.
Effective legal and      There should be an effective legal and enforcement system to encourage
enforcement system       compliance with the scheme and to address any active and persistent
                         violation of the scheme rules (e.g. illegal dumping, non5payment of user
                         fees, contamination of recycling streams with non5recyclable waste).
Political support        Political support is essential for the scheme. Politicians will need to be
                         briefed about the scheme objectives and results of any impact assessment
                         that have been carried out to ensure their support for the scheme.
Effective system for     It is better to implement PAYT schemes in regions where residents are
recording, invoicing     used to paying for utilities such as electricity, gas and water. If not, it could
and collecting           be a difficult task to implement the scheme as people will not be used to
payments                 paying for services and might actively seek to avoid payment.

The above list is not exhaustive but includes the main points that need to be considered
before implementing a PAYT scheme.

3.5     Key Elements of Programme Design

Key programme design aspects that would need to be considered for the implementation
of a PAYT scheme are summarised in Table 353.

                        Table 353 PAYT Scheme – Key Design Elements
Design Element              Rationale
Clarity of purpose          The type of PAYT scheme to be introduced will be dependent on the
                            envisaged end results. The end results could be waste minimisation,
                            increased recycling and/or recovery of waste management costs.
                            Therefore, clarity of intended outcomes of the scheme is essential to
                            ensure that the scheme is designed to deliver these objectives.
User rates, units and       Once the purpose of a PAYT scheme has been confirmed, the detailed
scheme affordability        design of the scheme should be developed. Some of the important
                            aspects of the design are the user rates, units and affordability to users.
                            User rates should be set at levels that are affordable to the households
                            but high enough to motivate behaviour change (i.e. increased recycling)
                            and sufficient to cover at least part of the service costs, if not full costs.
                            The unit of charging should also be confirmed. This could be a volume
                            based charge (e.g. bins, bags, number of collections etc.) or weight
                            based charge.

Design Element         Rationale
Impact assessment      Once the outline design of the proposed PAYT scheme is known, it is
                       considered good practice to undertake an assessment of potential
                       impacts on users, local government, environment and other
                       stakeholders (e.g. waste management companies). Outcomes from the
                       impact assessment will provide useful information to share with users,
                       politicians and other stakeholders to generate interest and acceptance of
                       the scheme.
Stakeholder            Consultation with stakeholders (e.g. residents, businesses) to explain
consultation           the scheme and receive feedback would assist the body implementing
                       the scheme (usually local authority) to consider and address any
                       concerns the stakeholders may have before implementing the scheme.
                       This will help the acceptance of the scheme when implemented.
Communications and     Focussed communications campaigns will be required to inform all users
complaints handling    regarding the scheme and especially the options they have to minimise
                       unsorted waste and therefore reduce the fees to pay. Communications
                       campaigns will need to be sustained especially in the early stages of the
                       scheme to help residents fully understand the scheme and answer their
                       questions. As the scheme is implemented, complaints from residents will
                       be expected and systems should be in place to record and address
                       these issues in a timely manner.
Legislative measure    Unless the legislation allows a local authority or its contractor to charge
                       users for the collection and disposal of waste, PAYT scheme cannot
                       usually be implemented. Therefore, legal provisions should be checked
                       and/or made before introduction of a PAYT scheme.
Lead in time and       Sufficient time should be made available before implementation of the
transition period      PAYT scheme to ensure that:
                           •   Users are fully aware of the scheme and costs;
                           •   Bags, bins or user identification systems necessary for the
                               delivery of the scheme are in place;
                           •   The collection crews fully understand the scheme rules and their
                               responsibilities; and
                           •   Complaints handling or non5compliance management unit is fully
                               equipped and resourced.
Billing system         A transparent and simple billing system is essential for schemes that do
                       not use paid bags for the disposal of unsorted waste. There should be
                       effective systems in place for the timely collection of fees that are due.
Logistical aspects     Dependent on the scheme type, the logistics regarding the purchase,
                       storage and deployment of bags, containers or user identification tags
                       will need to be carefully planned to ensure that these are in place before
                       the introduction of the scheme. Maintenance of containers and their
                       replacements will also need to be planned.
Management of non5     There should be an effective legal and enforcement system to
compliance issues      encourage compliance and address any active violation of the scheme
                       rules (e.g. illegal dumping, non5payment of user fees, contamination of
                       recycling streams with non5recyclable waste). Sufficient and trained
                       resources will need to be allocated to this aspect of the scheme design
                       to ensure that non5compliance is dealt with immediately.

Argentona, Spain. (Agència de Residus de Catalunya, 2010)
Argentona, a town with approximately 12,000 inhabitants and an urban density of 3,363 inhabitants
       2
per km , introduced a pay5per5bag system in 2010 for unsorted residual waste and packaging
waste. The reason cited for the introduction of this payment scheme was to incentivise households
and commercial establishments that make an effort to reduce and recycle waste.
The payment scheme, called Taxa Justa (i.e. fair charge), consisted of a flat rate (paid by bill) and
variable rate (collected by the sale of bags for waste collection).
The Council offered free collection of paper, cardboard, and organic waste. Standardised bags with
the Town Council’s logo were used in the PAYT scheme. These bags were sold at the town’s waste
collection centre and local retailers who had signed collaboration agreements with the Council.
The characteristics and prices of bags in the PAYT scheme were as follows:




Source: Agència de Residus de Catalunya, 2010.

The following key benefits were reported following the implementation of the PAYT scheme:
•      recycling rate increased from 64% to 66%;
•      a 24% reduction in the arisings of packaging waste; and
•      a 19% reduction in the arisings of unsorted residual waste.
The PAYT scheme recorded a 30% incorrect usage of bags when first introduced, but this reduced
to approximately 6% within two months of rolling out the scheme.


Loveland, Colorado, United States (Di Martino, 2000)
The City of Loveland introduced a pay5per5bag PAYT scheme in 1993, replacing their previous flat
fee for waste collection, in order to increase recycling.
The inhabitants were initially quite resistant to the programme, but then quickly realised the benefit
of participation.
By 1999, Loveland had achieved an annual recycling rate of 59% compared to 0% in 1993.


Taipei City, Taiwan (Lai, 2011)
In 2000, Taipei City government implemented a PAYT scheme based on charging per bag of waste
set out by residents for collection.
This policy is claimed to have successfully reduced the volume of waste generated by 23%.


Cambiano, Italy (Bosio et al., 2013)
Cambiano enforced a PAYT scheme in 2008 which saw quantities of unsorted waste reduce to 806
tons (2010) from 1,415 tons (in 2007), a reduction of 43%.


South Korea (Asia Today, 2013)
South Korea has been trialling a weight based PAYT programme for food waste in selected areas
since as early as 2005. Building upon the success of the scheme, it had been extended to

                                                                                                         23

approximately 95% of the country's 153 self5governing municipalities (cities and districts) by 2012.
Before the implementation of the new weight based PAYT scheme, users were charged a flat rate
irrespective of the amount of food waste they set out for collection and disposal. Following the
introduction of the weight based payment system, Seoul achieved a c.23% reduction in the quantity
of food waste it generated per day. The success in reducing food waste quantities is not limited to
Seoul. The ancient city of Gyeongju has reportedly reduced food waste quantities by approximately
14% after the introduction of the weight based PAYT scheme.


San Francisco, California, United States (World Bank, 2014)
San Francisco has been operating a PAYT scheme for the past several decades which is self5
financing using a multi5tiered approach to payment that includes a base charge and then a variable
charge element based on reducing residual waste and increasing recycling.
The PAYT scheme together with a number of other waste management policies has assisted San
Francisco to achieve a landfill diversion rate of 80% in 2012. It has not been possible to estimate
the impact of the PAYT scheme alone in achieving the landfill diversion rate, due to its
interdependencies with several other complementary drivers for improved waste management in
the City.

4.0    EU LANDFILL DIRECTIVE AND LANDFILL BAN ON ORGANIC WASTE

This section first provides an overview of the European Landfill Directive, the schemes put
in place by European countries to increase the landfill diversion of waste, and the
diversion rates achieved by those countries as a result of such schemes.

Organic waste landfill ban schemes introduced by some European countries are then
discussed in greater detail to provide some general understanding of their delivery models
(including enforcement) and the reported benefits.

A case study of the combustible and organic wastes landfill ban implemented in Sweden is
also included towards the end of this section.

Landfill bans in non5European countries have not been considered within the scope of this
study.

4.1    EU Landfill Directive

4.1.1 Overview

The European Landfill Directive (Council Directive 99/31/EC) was introduced in 1999
primarily to reduce the environmental impacts from landfilling of waste by introducing
stringent technical requirements for waste and landfills. Some of the key features of the
Directive included:
•     definition of different categories of waste (e.g. municipal waste, hazardous waste,
      industrial waste);
•     classification of landfills into hazardous, non5hazardous and inert sites;
•     a standard waste acceptance procedure for the three landfill categories to ensure
      consistency in approach across the Member States (i.e. countries within the
      European Union);
•     prohibition of landfilling of certain waste types (e.g. liquid waste, flammable waste,
      used tyres);
•     a requirement to set up a system of operating permits for landfill sites;
•     a requirement for Member States to close as soon as possible all landfill sites that
      were non5compliant with the Directive requirements;
•     a requirement on all Member States to prepare a national strategy (within 4 years,
      i.e. by 2003) for the implementation of the reduction of biodegradable waste going to
      landfill sites to achieve the following targets:
            o reduce the tonnage of biodegradable waste landfilled to 75% of that
                 landfilled in 1995 (or a suitable base year) within 7 years from the
                 introduction of the Directive;
            o reduce the tonnage of biodegradable waste landfilled to 50% of that
                 landfilled in 1995 (or a suitable base year) within 10 years from the
                 introduction of the Directive; and
            o reduce the tonnage of biodegradable waste landfilled to 35% of that
                 landfilled in 1995 (or a suitable base year) within 17 years from the
                 introduction of the Directive.
        Note: Member States that landfilled more than 80% of collected municipal waste in
        1995 (or the agreed base year) were allowed an additional four years to achieve
        the above targets for landfill diversion of biodegradable waste.
•     a requirement on all Member States to ensure that the landfill gate fees were
      sufficient to cover for the future closure of landfill sites and their aftercare costs (for a
      period of at least 30 years from closure).


                                                                                                      25
World Bank                                                                      406.01566.00005
Review of Waste Minimisation Programmes                                               June 2014

The Directive did not explicitly ban landfilling of biodegradable waste, but instead required
Member States to significantly reduce the amount of such waste landfilled over a period of
time, as per the targets summarised above.

Failure by Member States to comply with any of the requirements of the Directive could
result in fines being imposed by the European Commission on that Member State.

4.1.2 Summary of National Strategies Proposed for the Implementation of Landfill
      Directive

The EU Member States implemented various strategies and programmes to achieve, and
in some instances significantly outperform, the biodegradable waste diversion targets of
the Directive.

A summary of the measures proposed by some of the Member States for reducing the
quantity of municipal waste, including biodegradable waste, is provided in Table 451
below.

                 •   Separate collection of packaging waste for reuse and recovery.
                 •   Requirement to separate biodegradable waste in larger construction
                     projects.
                 •   Landfills to accept only waste which has been pre5treated by incineration or
                     mechanical biological treatment to achieve a total organic carbon (TOC)
                     content of less than 5%.
Belgium          •   Set targets for the reduction, recycling and recovery of municipal waste.
                 •   Promoted separate collection of organic waste on a voluntary basis.
                 •   Supported creation of new installations for bio5methanation, composting and
                     energy recovery.
                 •   Banned landfilling of some wastes (e.g. unsorted household waste collected
                     for recovery and the combustible fraction) or waste with a TOC of more than
                     6%.
Denmark          •   Banned landfilling of all waste suitable for combustion.
France           •   Only waste that cannot be treated under the prevailing technical and
                     economic conditions were allowed to be accepted in landfills.
                 •   New targets were set for recovery of packaging waste, especially paper.
                 •   Separate collection of biodegradable waste was proposed for most regions.
                 •   Made arrangements for new incineration plants in several regions.
Germany          •   German law required a general separate collection of waste streams
                     including biodegradable waste.
                 •   Waste wood was recommended to be diverted from landfills.
                 •   Packaging waste was collected and recovered to a high extent with the
                     recovery quota already nearing practical limits.
                 •   Placed a condition on landfills to accept only municipal waste that has either
                     been incinerated (with a TOC of 3% or lower) or has undergone mechanical
                     biological treatment (with a TOC of 18% or lower).

Country          Summary of Proposed Measures
Italy            •   An eco5tax was proposed to increase the price of landfilling waste in order to
                     encourage investment in alternative methods for waste treatment and
                     reduce the quantity of waste landfilled.
                 •   Planned for an increase in separate collection of organic waste.
                 •   Proposed new incineration plants.
                 •   Banned landfilling of high and medium risk animal by5products and organic
                     healthcare waste.
Greece           •   A system was set up for the separate collection and recovery of packaging
                     waste.
                 •   Proposed construction of biomechanical treatment plants and/or energy
                     recovery plants subject to their technical and economic feasibility.
                 •   Operators of new and existing landfills were required to pre5treat waste
                     before landfilling.
Luxembourg       •   Set up different systems for the separate collection of kitchen waste, green
                     waste, paper and wood.
                 •   The two landfills for municipal waste were equipped with separate areas for
                     installation of waste pre5treatment equipment (shredding, sorting,
                     homogenization, organic stabilisation).
Netherlands      •   Most of the municipal waste was incinerated even before the Directive was
                     introduced.
                 •   Encouraged home composting and set targets for the separate collection of
                     organic waste.
                 •   Landfilling of separately collected biodegradable waste was banned.
                 •   Incineration of waste other than at permitted plants was prohibited.
                 •   Composting and anaerobic digestion were promoted as the preferred
                     options for the treatment of separately collected biodegradable waste.
Portugal         •   Set targets to increase separate collection of food and garden waste from
                     households, restaurants, canteens and supermarkets.
                 •   Backyard composting, centralised composting and other biological treatment
                     options were promoted for the treatment of biodegradable organic waste.
                 •   Planned construction of a third incinerator and expansion of capacities at
                     existing incinerators.
                 •   Targets were set for the recycling of paper.
                 •   Considered increasing landfill fees and the introduction of phased landfill
                     restrictions.
Sweden           •   Banned the landfilling of combustible waste and organic waste. Exemptions
                     were granted only if there was a lack of capacity.
United Kingdom   •   Introduced recycling and recovery targets for municipal waste.
                 •   Landfill tax for the disposal of non5inert waste was steeply increased on an
                     annual basis to encourage investment in systems for diverting unsorted
                     waste from landfills (landfill tax for the year 2014/15 is set at £80 (c.US$130)
                     per tonne, this is payable in addition to the individual site gate fee).
                 •   Introduced tonnage allowances for each local authority (i.e. local
                     governments with responsibility for the disposal of collected municipal
                     waste) for the landfilling biodegradable waste, consistent with the
                     biodegradable diversion targets in the Directive. In England, the local
                     authorities were allowed to trade their allowances, if they had not been used,
                     whereas in other devolved administrations (e.g. Wales, Scotland) the
                     allowances were not tradable. If local authorities landfilled more than their
                     allocated allowances, they faced a penalty of up to £200 (c. US$330) per
                     tonne of biodegradable waste landfilled above their allowance.

As can be seen from Table 451 above, some Member States simply banned the landfilling
of wastes that have not been pre5treated or could be combusted, whilst others followed
                                                                                                        27

4.1.3 Outcomes

A comparison of municipal waste landfill rates in 1995 and 2012 for 15 European countries
(see Figure 452 below) shows that the Directive, together with the various measures
implemented by each Member State, contributed to delivering significant reductions in the
percentage of municipal waste landfilled in most Member States.

This has been possible only in conjunction with investment in promoting reuse, recycling
and sustainable treatment of waste.

                                   Eurostat)

Although Portugal and Spain reported an increase in the percentage of MSW landfilled in
2012 compared to 1995, conclusive information has not been identified to explain this
apparent increase in the percentage of MSW landfilled, which could be caused by a
number of issues. For example, the apparent increase could merely be a reflection of
improved data capture processes in these countries rather than genuinely representing a
higher percentage of municipal waste landfilled.

4.2    Landfill Ban of Organic Waste

4.2.1 Objectives and Approaches

Several European countries have achieved diversion of organic waste from landfills by
introducing a landfill ban on one or more of the following (Figure 453):

•     organic waste;
•     biodegradable waste;
•     combustible waste; and
•     source segregated waste (if source segregation of organic waste is required by law).




                                                                                             29

             Figure 453 Overview of Landfill Ban Types for Organic Waste

The main reasons cited by these countries for introducing landfill bans on organic waste
include:
•     promotion of reduction and/or treatment (including recovery of energy) of organic
      waste;
•     reduced dependency on landfills; and/or
•     reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from their disposal at landfills.

Some of the countries/regions that have successfully diverted organic waste from landfills
by introducing landfill bans of the nature described above include:

   •   Austria                     •   Finland                      •   Netherlands
   •   Belgium                     •   Germany                      •   Norway
   •   Denmark                     •   Italy                        •   Sweden

4.2.2 Reported Benefits

In most instances, a landfill ban is one of many mutually supportive programmes
implemented by a country to improve its waste management practices, and in such
circumstances it is not always possible to disentangle the actual benefits of the landfill ban
alone.

Landfill bans, when properly enforced, have reportedly delivered the primary objective of
waste diversion from landfills to other forms of treatment (as summarised in Table 452
below).

There appears to be no evidence to suggest that banning landfilling of organic waste alone
has contributed to an increase in waste prevention or recycling rates, other than to divert
waste from landfills to recovery of energy by either anaerobic digestion or mass burn
facilities.

However, it is understood that banning the landfilling of organic waste did create long term
market certainty, encouraging investment in alternative facilities for the treatment of
organic or biodegradable waste.

4.2.3 Implementation

It is not always practical to sort or monitor waste being received at landfills to check for
banned materials. Therefore, waste acceptance criteria have been developed and
implemented to ensure compliance with the primary objectives of banning organic waste
from landfill disposal.

The waste acceptance criteria at landfills typically include one or more of the following
elements (Figure 454):

•       visual inspections;
•       density threshold (e.g. approach implemented in the Netherlands);
•       physical and biological properties (e.g. combustibility, biodegradability, TOC limits);
        and
•       approved documentation from a treatment facility operator confirming that the waste
        has been treated and stabilised.




                                                                                                                     31

                                   Landfill Ban

4.2.4 Issues to consider

The following matters need to be considered before the implementation of a landfill ban, to
ensure that the intended outcome of organic waste diversion from landfills is delivered:

•    waste categories or sources (e.g. municipal waste, commercial waste) to which the
     ban should apply;
•    consultation, announcement and lead times for implementation of the ban;
•    management of the transition period and scope of potential exemptions;
•    monitoring and enforcement:
            o party responsible for demonstrating evidence of compliance;
            o party responsible for monitoring evidence of compliance;
            o consequences of non5compliance; and
            o resources and costs for monitoring and enforcement.
•    availability of alternative treatment facilities and capacities;
•    governmental support that may be required to develop alternative treatment
     capacity;
•    impact on current operators of waste collection, treatment and landfill;
•    additional costs for collection and management of materials diverted from landfills;
•    operational standards to be achieved for the collection and treatment of organic
     waste; and
•    fly5tipping or ‘waste tourism’ (e.g. transfer of waste to regions or countries with no
     landfill ban).

4.2.5 Supporting programmes

Dependent on the objectives of implementing a landfill ban, a range of supplementary
programmes may be considered.



                                                                                              32
World Bank                                                                        406.01566.00005
Review of Waste Minimisation Programmes                                                 June 2014

A list of potential supplementary programmes, informed by operational programmes in
countries with landfill bans in place, is provided below:

•     requirement to sort waste at source (i.e. at household level), or prior to disposal at
      landfill, in order to recover recyclables and divert suitable organic waste for
      composting, anaerobic digestion or mass burn (with energy recovery);
•     landfill ban of waste with significant recyclable or compostable organic components;
•     ban or restrict the amount of municipal waste that can be landfilled and/or
      incinerated;
•     introduction of a landfill tax at a level that is sufficiently high to make alternative
      waste treatment options commercially competitive;
•     introduction of a tax on incineration, if recycling of waste is an additional priority to
      landfill diversion;
•     introduction of extended producer responsibility schemes (e.g. take5back schemes
      funded by manufacturers of specific products such as electrical and electronic
      equipment); and
•     implementation of pay5as5you5throw systems.

It is suggested that introduction of a landfill tax system, at a level that would make
alternative treatment facilities more economically competitive, could deliver similar results
to those of a landfill ban or restriction.

4.2.6 Pre<Requisites

Some of the essential pre5requisites for successful implementation of landfill bans are
summarised in Table 453.

                         Table 453 Landfill Bans – Key Pre5Requisites
Pre5Requisite                  Rationale
Access to other                Treatment capacity should be available at suitable alternative
environmentally safe           facilities for treating waste diverted or banned from landfills. If
recycling or treatment         sufficient treatment capacity is not available, the government might
facilities                     need to consider funding (or part funding) environmentally safe
                               recycling and treatment facilities. Implementing a landfill ban or
                               restriction without access to suitable alternative treatment facilities
                               can lead to piling up of unsorted waste awaiting treatment and
                               causing environmental and health hazards.
Effective legal and            There should be an effective legal and enforcement system to
enforcement system             encourage compliance with the scheme and to address any active
                               violation of the scheme rules (e.g. illegal deposition of banned
                               waste at landfills, fly5tipping, illegal burning).
                               Some of these issues could be overcome by requiring:
                               •   permits or consents for all landfill sites to operate;
                               •   standardised waste acceptance criteria at landfill sites; and
                               •   standardised waste category classification and reporting
                                   systems.
Political support              Political support is essential for the scheme. Politicians will need to
                               be briefed about the scheme objectives and results of any impact
                               assessment that have been carried out to gather their support.

4.2.7 Key Elements of Programme Design

Key programme design aspects that will need to be considered for the implementation of
landfill ban are summarised in Table 454.
                                                                                                         33

                        Table 454 Landfill Bans – Key Design Elements
Design Element            Rationale
Clarity of purpose        It is important to be absolutely clear about why a programme is required
                          and what needs to be achieved as a result of implementing the
                          programme. A landfill ban or restriction is usually applied to:
                          •       Promote reduction and/or treatment of organic waste;
                          •       Reduce dependency on landfills; and/or
                          •       Reduce greenhouse gas emissions from their disposal at landfills.
                          A clear understanding of the purpose of implementing the programme will
                          help in the effective design of the programme.
Waste types to be         Some nations or regions have banned or restricted specific types of waste
restricted or banned      (e.g. organic waste, combustible waste) and therefore clarity on the type
                          of waste to be restricted is essential.
Nature of restriction     What type of restriction should be implemented? The answer to this
                          question will determine the nature of the enforcement and compliance
                          monitoring regimes.
                          Countries with landfill restrictions have implemented such schemes
                          broadly using one of the following approaches:
                          •   Outright ban of the specified waste stream;
                          •   Landfill diversion targets for specific waste streams with significant
                              financial penalties for not meeting the targets; and
                          •   Escalating tax or fees for depositing certain waste streams in landfill,
                              which will inherently act as an incentive to invest in alternative waste
                              treatment technologies.
Impact assessment         Once some clarity has been obtained regarding the design elements
                          above, an impact assessment should be undertaken to test matters
                          including the following:
                          •  Availability of alternative treatment capacity; and
                          •  Costs and benefits of the programme to local authorities, existing
                             waste management companies, residents (especially if they are on
                             PAYT schemes) and other stakeholders.
                          Results from the impact assessment study could assist with stakeholder
                          consultation and to alleviate some of the concerns that could be raised.
Stakeholder               If the impact assessment suggests that there are greater benefits to be
consultation              realised from the implementation of the programme, these will need to be
                          clearly communicated to all key stakeholders with a view of obtaining any
                          additional concerns or feedback they may have to offer. Such feedback
                          will need to be considered and, where necessary, addressed before the
                          implementation of the programme.
                          Stakeholders to be consulted will typically include local authorities,
                          operators of landfills and other waste treatment facilities, residents and
                          local businesses who might be impacted by the programme requirements.
Communications and        Communications and awareness campaigns will be required with parties
complaints handling       who are likely to be impacted by the ban or who are required to implement
                          and monitor the ban. It is also beneficial to manage communications with
                          press and media to promote a neutral coverage of the ban, where
                          possible.
Legislative measure       Ordinarily the ban will have to be legally implemented (e.g. law, bill,
                          decree).
Lead in time and          Industry and relevant stakeholders will need to be provided with adequate
transition period         time to change the status quo operations and be fully ready to meet the
                          requirements of the new programme.

Design Element          Rationale
Exemptions              Some operations or users may require exemption for a period of time until
                        they are fully able to meet the requirements of the programme. The nature
                        of exemptions, body responsible for issuing exemptions, criteria for
                        receiving exemptions, and their timescales will need to be carefully
                        considered to ensure that exemptions are only issued where absolutely
                        necessary. Too many exemptions may nullify the realisation of intended
                        outcomes of the programme.
Operational standards   Diversion of waste from landfills helps to minimise greenhouse gas
                        emissions. Standards may need to be agreed for the treatment of waste at
                        alternative facilities to ensure that the treatment of waste is undertaken in
                        an environmentally safe and sustainable manner. Examples of such
                        standards may include:
                        •   Technical quality specifications for compost of digestate from the
                            treatment of organic waste; and
                        •   Emission standards and limits from incineration and other energy from
                            waste facilities.
Monitoring of           It will be impractical to physically check each and every load of waste
compliance              arriving at landfill sites for disposal. Therefore standardised systems will
                        need to be developed for monitoring and recording compliance. A
                        compliance monitoring system will typically include:
                        •    Waste acceptance criteria;
                        •    Compliance testing protocols and frequency of any specific tests (e.g.
                             TOC); and
                        • Written undertaking of compliance from waste generators (e.g. local
                             authorities, local businesses).
                        A methodology for dealing with any non5compliant waste loads that arrive
                        at landfill sites will also need to be developed. The following points should
                        also be considered:
                        • party responsible for demonstrating evidence of compliance;
                        • party responsible for monitoring evidence of compliance;
                        • consequences of non5compliance; and
                        • resources and costs for monitoring and enforcement.
                        A ‘honeymoon’ phase might need to be allowed for a brief period after the
                        implementation of the ban to assist all landfill operators to install effective
                        systems for checking and reporting compliance. Penalties for non5
                        compliance may be waived during this initial period.
                        There should be an effective legal and enforcement system to encourage
                        compliance and address any active violation of the scheme rules (e.g.
                        illegal acceptance of banned waste streams). Sufficiently trained
                        personnel will be required to ensure that persistent non5compliance is
                        dealt with in a timely manner.
Governmental support    If sufficient treatment capacity is not available to treat waste that will be
                        diverted from landfills following the ban, the government might need to
                        intervene and support development of alternative facilities. The support
                        measures can include long term legislative certainty regarding waste
                        management (e.g. recycling targets) and funding for the construction of
                        new treatment facilities.
Management of non5      There should be an effective legal and enforcement system to encourage
compliance issues       compliance and to address any active violation of the scheme rules (e.g.
                        illegal acceptance of banned waste streams). Sufficiently trained
                        personnel will need to be allocated to ensure that persistent non5
                        compliance is immediately dealt with.

before implementing a landfill ban of certain waste types.

4.3     Case Studies


Landfill ban on combustible and organic wastes in Sweden (Green Alliance, 2009)
Main provisions of legislation
Sweden implemented two landfill bans: one on sorted combustible waste and the other on organic
waste. The bans covered all waste sources (e.g. household waste, commercial and industrial
waste, construction and demolition waste).
The ban on the landfilling of sorted combustible waste was introduced in 2002. Combustible waste
is defined in Sweden as ‘waste that burns without additional energy following the start of the
incineration process’. Heterogeneous waste that contains less than 10% by volume of combustible
material was exempt from the ban. All organic wastes (other than those with high water content,
such as sewage sludge) are combustible, and so were covered by the 2002 ban.
However, a second ban on the landfilling of organic waste was introduced in 2005. Sweden defined
organic waste as waste that contains organic carbon, such as biological (‘bio’) waste and plastic
wastes. Homogenous waste that has a total organic carbon (TOC) content of less than 10% by
weight was exempt from the ban.
Some waste types (e.g. ash from incineration) were exempted from the bans. Exemptions, in the
form of permits, were also granted by local government administrative boards where suitable
alternatives to landfills were not available. Such exemptions lasted for one year and had to be
applied in advance. It was the responsibility of the landfill operator to apply for an exemption,
except in the case of household waste, for which the local government (e.g. municipality) had to
apply.
Motivation / Rationale
The main objectives of the ban were to reduce the quantity of waste going to landfill, minimise
environmental impacts of landfill and increase the recovery (recycling, biological treatment and
energy from waste) of waste.
Discussions about the possibilities of a landfill ban started in the mid51990s when the government
undertook work to understand the effects of a ban on landfilling organic waste. In 1997, a common
responsibility bill was passed, which focused on measures to reduce the landfilling of waste. Whilst
the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency suggested a ban on landfilling organic waste from
2005, in 1999 the government announced that the landfilling of combustible waste would be banned
from 2002.
It is considered that the decision to ban combustible waste on a shorter than anticipated lead time
was a political one, designed to send a clear signal to the waste industry and municipalities that the
government was serious about the development of alternative infrastructure for waste treatment.
Although the purpose of the 2002 ban on combustible waste was to encourage the development of
a wide range of treatment infrastructure, including recycling and biological treatment, it resulted
predominantly in the development of incineration capacity in Sweden. However, the 2005 ban on
organic waste is understood to have focused extra attention on organic waste from households and
encouraged municipalities to introduce separate food waste collections for residents.
Stakeholder Reactions
The municipalities and the waste industry were both initially quite critical of the bans because they
felt that the lead times were too short and that the necessary investment in alternatives would not
occur in time.
However, since the early 2000s there has been significant investment in alternatives to landfill,
particularly by the municipalities. There is now understood to be general acceptance amongst
stakeholders that the bans have been successful in achieving their objectives.
The bans were not communicated directly to the public and remained in the domain of waste
management professionals. Therefore, there was temporary media interest, due to a lack of
                                                                                                         36

available alternatives, at the time the ban on combustible waste was implemented.
Compliance and Enforcement
The operators of landfills were responsible for complying with the bans by:
        •    developing systems for ensuring that banned waste are not accepted; and
        •    submitting yearly reports on wastes accepted and rejected.
The waste producer (e.g. a business or a municipality) is required to produce a document detailing
the properties of the waste, which they hand over to the landfill operator on delivery of the waste to
the landfill site. If there is no document, or the waste brought to the site is found to be inaccurate or
not reflecting the description in the document, then the waste producer and the landfill operator will
discuss options for resolving the issue. This may include additional sorting of waste at the landfill
site to bring that waste to a permissible level for landfill disposal. This sorting is often undertaken at
an extra cost to the producer.
Monitoring of the bans is carried out by either local or regional branches of the Swedish
Environmental Protection Agency, between two and four times a year. Landfill operators that do not
comply with the bans can face fines or ultimately lose their licence to operate.
Financing
Municipalities are responsible for the management of household waste in Sweden and they provide
these services either directly or by appointing a private sector service provider. Municipal costs for
household waste management are met by a waste collection fee which covers the municipality’s
entire costs for waste management including recycling centres for hazardous and bulky household
waste.
The annual ‘basic’ fee was on average SEK1,940 per household in 2009 (approximately $300), and
varied slightly depending on whether facilities were under the direct control of municipalities. Some
municipalities (approximately one in ten) also introduced weight5based fees in addition to the basic
fee to encourage more recycling and composting.
Supporting Programmes / Instruments
The following supporting programmes and instruments were also in place:
    •       landfill tax: a tax imposed on every ton of waste landfilled;
    •       incineration tax: a tax, determined by the waste’s fossil fuel content and the treatment
            plant’s energy recovery efficiency, imposed on each ton of waste that has been incinerated;
    •       extended producer responsibility system: a scheme that makes producers of goods such as
            packaging, tyres, newsprint, vehicles, electric and electronic equipment meet statutory
            recycling targets;
    •       legal obligation on households to sort combustible waste separately to non5combustible
            waste; and
    •       variable charging: a weight based fee introduced by some municipalities in addition to a
            basic waste management fee to promote reduction, segregation and recycling of waste.
            Some problems have been reported for systems where food waste attracted a lower tariff
            than other waste, which inadvertently encouraged people to contaminate this waste stream.
Outcomes
The following outcomes have been observed following the introduction of the landfill bans:
     •      waste to landfill dropped from 20% (in 2000) to approximately 4% (in 2007);
     •      a significant reduction in the number of landfill sites from approximately 400 to 140 (by
            2007);
     •      a combined recycling and composting rate of 49% was achieved by 2007; and
     •      waste incinerated increased from 38% (in 2000) to 47% (in 2007).

Economic Impacts of the Bans
The reported economic impacts include:
      •   advantages:
              o creation of new markets for composting, anaerobic digestion and incineration; and
              o enhancement of Sweden’s energy policy objectives by displacing the use of fossil
                 fuels.
      •   disadvantages:
              o dwindling revenues for landfill operators; and
              o increased waste management costs for households and businesses.

5.0    PLASTIC BAG BANS

5.1    Introduction

A growing number of nations and cities have restricted the usage of single use plastic
carrier bags for one or more of the following reasons:

•     to prevent visual blight of littering;
•     to prevent blockage of drains and sewer systems by stray plastic bags;
•     to reduce impacts of plastic in the environment;
•     to prevent and minimise waste;
•     to avoid wastage of resources;
•     to initiate a behaviour change in citizens by moving away from a ‘throwaway culture’
      to a more sustainable way of life; and
•     due to public pressure to take action on plastic bags.

Availability of alternatives (e.g. paper bags, textile bags), difficulty in separating various
plastic bag types to ensure structural integrity of recycled plastic products, and lack of
suitable end markets are some of the influencing factors on the adoption of plastic bag
bans.

Some of the arguments often made against introducing restrictions on single use plastic
carrier bags include:

•     they can be reused a number of times and recycled at the end of their lives;
•     they have a high calorific value and can therefore be beneficial when waste is sent
      for incineration;
•     alternatives such as cotton or canvas bags may be less hygienic;
•     a reduction in the demand for plastic bags would cause job losses at local or national
      bag manufacturers and distributors; and
•     shoplifting may increase and be difficult to control when large numbers of people
      carry their own bags.

An impact assessment study conducted for the Welsh Government before the introduction
of a carrier bag charge in Wales (UK), concluded that benefits of restricting single use
carrier bags outweighed the arguments against such restrictions (AEA, 2009).

It should be noted that an overwhelming majority of cities and countries worldwide
(including in the US and Europe) do not yet restrict plastic bags.

5.2    Types of Plastic Bags and Alternatives

An overview of the types and properties of carrier bags (mainstream and alternatives)
used in various countries is provided in Table 551.

Bag Type                  Commentary
Reusable Low5Density      These are heavier gauge plastic carrier bags, sometimes referred to as
Polyethene (LDPE) Bags    ‘bags for life’.
Paper bags                The paper bags issued by shops range from very simple ones for small
                          items (e.g. from newsagents and greengrocers) to larger ones (e.g.
                          issued by fashion and shoe retailers). Some paper bags have plastic
                          handles or plastic coatings.
Polypropylene bags        Polypropylene has many uses for producing rigid and flexible
                          containers, as well as furniture. Like LDPE and HDPE it is derived from
                          oil resources. Non5woven polypropylene bags are strong and durable
                          and, like ‘bags for life’, are intended to be used many times.
                          Woven polypropylene bags are produced by stretching the
                          polypropylene in production to form “fibres” resulting in a stronger bag.
Biodegradable bags        Biodegradable bags are made from natural starch sources such as
                          maize and synthetic polyesters that degrade through the enzymatic
                          action of micro5organisms (bacteria, fungi and algae), essentially
                          rotting down like vegetable matter. A subgroup of this classification
                          would be compostable bags that are required to meet certain
                          standards (e.g. EN13432:2000) relative to the rate at which they
                          degrade and the absence of toxic residues that would affect the quality
                          of any compost produced.
Bio5erodible bags         Bio5erodible bags are made from synthetic plastics (oil5based) with
                          trace degradation initiators (HDPE with a c.3% content of metals such
                          as manganese and iron). They bio5erode primarily by oxidation and
                          erosion of the plastic through the action of light and heat until very
                          small particles of plastic remain (these often degrade biologically). It is
                          reported that, in an anaerobic environment, the degradation process is
                          halted for some types of bio5erodible bags.

Plastic carrier bags given to consumers are often of different plastic types and, if recycled
without an appropriate segregation of plastic types, the structural integrity of the resulting
plastic may be compromised. This technical issue needs to be carefully considered and
overcome in designing any plastic bag recycling scheme.

5.3    Single Use Carrier Bag Restrictions

Measures introduced by various countries to restrict the use of plastic bags include:

•     outright ban on the use of plastic carrier bags (usually with some exemptions);
•     introduction of a fee (e.g. tax, levy or similar) to be collected from the consumer for
      using single use plastic bags;
•     entry into voluntary schemes with the business and retail sector to reduce the use of
      plastic bags. Measures may include:
            o provision of reusable or recyclable carrier bags made of non5plastic
                material;
            o provision of carrier bag waste collections in stores to improve recycling
                rates;
            o setting of voluntary targets to reduce the consumption of plastic bags; and
            o introduction of a user charge for carrier bags by the retail sector;
•     public awareness raising through the promotion of long5life bags or non5plastic
      alternatives.

Approaches implemented by some countries to reduce or limit the consumption of plastic
carrier bags are summarised in Table 552 below, based on publically available published
sources.

Country            Overview of the Approach Taken
Europe (European Commission, 2013)
Bulgaria           A tax on polyethene bags with a thickness of less than 23 microns has been
                   proposed. The tax will be paid per item by those who place plastic carrier bags
                   on the Bulgarian market and retailers will pass the fee on to customers. The
                   proceeds of the tax will be ring5fenced for use in waste management projects.
Spain              The region of Andalucía agreed a charge for the use of plastic carrier bags in
                                                        st
                   June 2010, which came into force on 1 May 2011.
Ireland            A levy was introduced in March 2002 for the purchase of plastic carrier bags in
                   supermarkets, petrol stations and shops. Charges are paid into an
                   environmental fund, which is used for financing recycling centres and other
                   environmental activities such as cleaning up illegal landfill sites.
Wales, United      Wales introduced a 5 pence (approximately US$0.08) charging scheme for all
Kingdom            single use carrier bags (plastic, paper and starch bags) in October 2011.
Americas (Surfrider Foundation, 2014)
United States      Plastic bag bans are in place in many states and regions of the United States.
                   Most ordinances are for plastic bag bans and the most effective ones also
                   include a small fee for paper bags to encourage more use of reusable bags. The
                   ordinances in Washington DC, Montgomery County MD, various Colorado
                   communities and Brownsville, Texas are understood to cover a fee for both
                   plastic and paper bags.
Brazil             In Brazil, more than twenty cities are said to have issued a direction that the city
                   authorities and all their suppliers use only oxy5biodegradable plastic for their
                   packaging, bags, and refuse sacks.
African and Middle Eastern Nations (AEA, 2009)
Botswana           Banned use of lightweight plastic bags.
Eritrea            Banned plastic bags in 2005.
Kenya              A 120% excise duty has been set on plastics and a standard has been set for
                   the minimum thickness of plastic bags.
Niger              The government of Niger buys used plastic bags for 25 CFA francs,
                   (approximately US$0.03) per kg. The processed bags are then used as a
                   material to repair crumbling roads, or are compressed using new ceramic mould
                   technology and transformed into bricks.
Republic of        Compulsory levy on plastic bags and enforcement of a minimum 245micron
South Africa       weight per bag (including imports).
Rwanda             Imposed a ban on plastics less than 100 microns thick. This law is heavily
                   enforced and is reported to have led to development of a black market for
                   plastics.
Somalia            Banned plastic bags in 2005.
Tanzania           Imposed a ban on thin plastics.

Bangladesh       Ban on lightweight plastic carrier bags.
China            Ban on free plastic bags at shops and supermarkets.
Kerala, India    Banned the production, storing, consumption, distribution and transportation of
                 plastic bottles, carrier bags and cups below 50 microns. Those who violate the
                 rule face a potential fine of Rs. 1 lakh (approximately US$1,650) and/or
                 imprisonment of up to five years.
Japan            Levy ranging from 5 to 10 yen (approximately US$0.09) per bag (plastic and
                 paper bags) imposed.
Taiwan           Plastic bags offered to customers must not be less than 0.06mm thick and must
                 not be given to consumers for free. Levy set for plastic bags was NT$1
                 (approximately US$0.03).

5.4      Reported Benefits

Bans and charging schemes, when implemented and enforced effectively, have been
found to deliver the highest reductions in the use of single5use plastic bags.

Voluntary schemes and public awareness raising activities deliver some reductions in the
use of plastic bags, but usually not at levels comparable to that achieved with bans or
charges.

Benefits reported for some of the plastic bag reduction schemes in place are summarised
in Table 553 below.

Voluntary Schemes with Retailers
Australia                   A 66% reduction in plastic bag use was achieved over a 45year
                            period as a result of voluntary agreement with retailers’ association.
                            (AEA, 2009).
Belgium                     A voluntary agreement with the retailers’ association Comeos
                            resulted in (European Commission, 2013):
                            •   80% reduction in disposable plastic carrier bags between 2003
                                and 2009 in the Flanders region of Belgium; and
                            •   60% reduction in disposable plastic carrier bags for the period
                                between 2003 and 2010 in the Wallonia region of Belgium.

5.5       Success Factors / Deliverability Issues

5.5.1 What needs to be considered?

A review of single use plastic bag restrictions implemented by other countries suggests
that the following issues need to be sufficiently considered before introducing a restriction
or ban on plastic bags and other single5use carrier bags:

•       Awareness Campaign 5 an extensive awareness campaign using a variety of
        communication channels would be preferable to ensure that the proposed restriction
        and its objectives are fully understood by those who will be impacted.
•       Stakeholder Consultation 5 early consultation with all stakeholders, particularly
        retailers, would be a key factor in establishing early take5up and support.
•       Training and Support 5 retail outlets and their staff may need to be provided
        sufficient support including training (e.g. how to work with new computer systems
                                                                                                     43
World Bank                                                               406.01566.00005
Review of Waste Minimisation Programmes                                        June 2014

     following introduction of a restriction, how to respond appropriately to customer
     queries).
•    Exemptions – the level and duration of any exemptions that may be required (e.g.
     packaging for fresh meat and/or fish).
•    Support Networks 5 local or regional support networks that may need to be
     established for both customers and retailers to provide support during the transitional
     phase.
•    Standards for Alternatives 5 technical specifications and accreditations for
     replacement bags or non5chargeable bags may need to be established. For
     example, EN 13432 is an accepted European standard to certify compostable plastic
     bags. Lack of specific standards could lead to use of re5usable bags that are not
     environmental friendly or safe. Some re5usable bags have been reported to contain
     lead levels much higher than generally permitted (O’Donnell, 2011).
•    Charges 5 if a restriction through a charging scheme is planned, the initial minimum
     charge will need to be set at a level that encourages behaviour change (e.g. less use
     of bags) and the charges should be well publicised. The retailers may need to be
     legally obliged to charge the minimum fee to customers, and such charges may
     need to be shown on till receipts.
•    Enforcement 5 an adequate and effective enforcement system would be needed.
•    Utilisation of Charge/Income Received 5 if a minimum fee is placed on a plastic
     bag or its replacement, guidance will be needed to inform how such income may be
     used. In some instances, there is active encouragement for money raised to be used
     for projects focused on sustainability or good social causes.

An example approach to delivering and monitoring a ban or restriction on plastic bags (or
other single5use5carrier5bags) may include:

•    customers being responsible for paying for the bag (plastic or paper);
•    retailer receipt shows the price of the bag as a separate item;
•    retailers transfer the money raised from sale of bags to the nominated body
     responsible for collecting taxes from businesses at agreed intervals;
•    the nominated body for collecting the proceeds is granted a one5off fund for initial
     setup costs (e.g. updates to computer systems) followed by annual fees to cover for
     resources and additional administrative tasks;
•    additional income from the sale of bags (after covering for the costs of administering
     and enforcing the scheme) may be ring5fenced to support priority environmental
     projects or those with a social cause;
•    public authority (e.g. municipalities) led enforcement which may include initiatives
     such as:
           o initial visits to retail outlets to assist them in complying with the ban or
                restriction;
           o spot checks or unannounced site visits;
           o monitoring or overseeing implementation of the ban or restriction at retail
                outlets;
           o ensuring that the levy/charge is passed on in full to customers;
           o checking that exemptions, if any, are not being abused;
           o taking appropriate actions where it has been established that the restriction
                or ban has not been appropriately implemented by a retailer (e.g. issuing
                warning letter informing the retailer of obligations under the regulations
                followed by monetary penalties for persistent non5compliance); and
           o following up on any complaints received from the public.

Strong political support, adequate legislative measures and strict enforcement are critical
to the successful implementation of a ban or restriction on the usage of plastic bags and
other single5use carrier bags.
                                                                                               44

Customers and retailers should be provided with affordable alternatives to enable them to
comply with the legislation without affecting their businesses and general convenience.
Unavailability of such alternatives may result in unintended outcomes (e.g. sale of small
plastic bin liners to be used as carrier bags; development of a black market for plastic
bags, as seen in Rwanda).

There should also be an effective system to collect and recycle/compost replacement bags
to ensure that they don’t contribute to the same issues that triggered the initial ban (e.g.
littering).

5.6     Pre5Requisites

Some of the essential pre5requisites for successful implementation of plastic bag bans are
summarised in Table 554.

                          Table 554 Plastic Bag Bans – Key Pre5Requisites
Pre5Requisite                Rationale
Availability of viable       Before implementing a ban or restriction on single use carrier bags, it
alternatives                 needs to be ensured that there are sufficient viable and affordable
                             alternatives in place (e.g. biodegradable starch bags, long life bags, paper
                             bags).
Effective legislative        The country or region considering banning single use plastic bags will
measures and                 need to have an effective legislative system and capability to strictly
enforcement regimes          enforce the ban.
Political support            Political support is very important. Local authorities considering a ban
                             should be prepared for potential legal challenges from organisations who
                             may be affected by the ban. If such legal challenges occur, strong political
                             backing in favour of the ban would be a helpful addition to effectively
                             counter the legal challenge.
Facilities for the           Generally one of the reasons for implementing a ban on single use carrier
collection and               bags is to tackle littering caused from these bags. Therefore, an affordable
treatment of                 and effective system for safely collecting and disposing bags used instead
replacement bags             of single use plastic carrier bags. If such a system is absent, the
                             replacement bags will have similar impact as plastic bags on littering.

5.7     Key Elements of Programme Design

Key programme design aspects that will need to be considered for the implementation of
plastic bag ban are summarised in Table 555.

                         Table 555 Plastic Bag Bans – Key Design Elements
Design Element               Rationale
Clarity of purpose           The local authority should first consider why a ban is required. Typical
                             objectives include achieving reduction in littering or promoting use of more
                             environmental friendly alternatives. Clarity of objectives is important for
                             designing a ban that is fit for purpose.
Nature of restriction        Dependent on the objectives of the ban, the scope of the ban needs to be
                             considered. Some questions that will need to be considered to set the
                             scope of the ban include:
                             •   Should it be an outright ban on all single use carrier bags (e.g.
                                 including plastic and paper bags)?
                             •   If plastic bags only, should the ban cover all single use plastic bags or
                                 just those that fall under a specific category (e.g. less than 30 microns

                             or a specific plastic type)?
                         •   Should a pay5per5bag scheme be implemented instead of an outright
                             ban?
                         •   Should voluntary agreements be entered with retailers to reduce the
                             number of single use carrier bags they give away instead of a ban or
                             charge on plastic bags?
Alternatives or          Single use carrier bags provide a convenient mode for carrying purchased
replacements and         goods and therefore suitably convenient and affordable alternatives
required standards       should be available to replace them following a ban or restriction. If such
                         alternatives are not available, it may lead to unintended consequences
                         including increase in the sale of items such as residual waste sacks (to act
                         as replacement bags) or a wide spread non5compliance as users and
                         retailers find no alternatives.
                         Where alternative bags are used, technical and environmental standards
                         may need to be specified to ensure that they are fit for their purpose as
                         well as capable of being managed in an environmentally safe manner at
                         the end of their useful life. Typically, these standards would need to be
                         agreed between the manufacturers, retailers and waste management
                         operators.
Impact assessment        An impact assessment will need to be undertaken to estimate potential
                         technical, legal, financial and commercial impacts of a ban or restriction
                         on:
                         • Shoppers;
                         • Retailers;
                         • Corner shops or convenience stores; and
                         • Manufacturers and suppliers of plastic bags.
                         This exercise will provide an understanding of the viability, as well as any
                         gaps that need to be bridged, before implementing a ban or restriction.
Stakeholder              Consultation with all relevant stakeholders will be essential to discuss the
consultation             objectives and to understand any concerns so that these can be looked
                         into and addressed before a ban is implemented. Stakeholders will
                         typically include shoppers, retailers including convenience stores,
                         manufacturers and suppliers of plastic bags, and local politicians.
Awareness campaigns      Focussed awareness campaigns will need to be run with simple and clear
                         messages for shoppers and retailers to inform them why a ban is being
                         proposed and what practical and affordable alternatives are available to
                         them to comply with the ban without significant inconvenience to their
                         shopping habits or sales.
Plans for managing       The local authority will need to consider and plan for the eventuality of a
potential challenges     potential legal challenge by the plastics industry or retailers. With sufficient
from plastics industry   political backing and robust impact assessment, there is high chance of
and/or retailers         successfully overcoming such challenges, but this can be time consuming
                         and therefore timescales for implementation of a ban should consider this.
Approach to charging     This is mainly applicable to restrictions imposed through a charging
and utilisation of       scheme. For such schemes, clear and deliverable plans should be in
income generated         place regarding the implementation of the charging scheme by retailers,
                         monitoring and reporting of the payments received, and utilisation of funds
                         raised from charging of singe use carrier bags.
Collection and           There should be an effective approach to the collection and management
treatment of             of bags being used instead of single use carrier bags. For example, if
alternative bags         biodegradable bags are used instead of plastic bags, the local authority or
                         retailers could put in a system to collect all biodegradable bags for
                         composting after their use so that they do not end up as litter creating the
                         same problem that plastic bag ban tried to address.

Design Element         Rationale
Legislative measures   Consideration should be given regarding the legal implementation of the
                       ban. Typically, this will require introduction of a law, bill or decree.
Lead in time and       All parties likely to be affected by the ban or restriction should be given
transition period      adequate time to source alternative products in order to avoid undue
                       commercial disadvantages. This will need to be factored in when planning
                       for plastic bag bans.
Compliance             The system for compliance monitoring will need to be considered and
monitoring and         agreed at the outset. As a minimum, this should consider:
enforcement            • party responsible for demonstrating evidence of compliance;
                       • party responsible for monitoring evidence of compliance;
                       • consequences of non5compliance; and
                       • resources and costs for monitoring and enforcement.
                       A ‘honeymoon’ phase might need to be allowed for a brief period after the
                       implementation of the ban to assist retailers and affected shops to install
                       effective systems for monitoring and reporting compliance. Penalties for
                       non5compliance may be waived during this initial period.
                       Implications for failure to comply with the ban will also need to be
                       considered. Firms that persistently breach the ban could face fines, lose
                       their consent to trade and/or face legal proceedings.
Exemptions             A universal ban may not be applicable to all retailers and shops because it
                       may have an adverse impact on their sales or they might need more time
                       to provide suitable alternatives to carrier bags for the products they sell
                       (e.g. butchers, fish mongers). Such implications will have to be considered
                       and reasonable exemptions allowed for in the legislation. Clear criteria
                       needs to be set for eligibility for exemption and any exemption should
                       ideally be time limited.
Support networks       Support networks might need to be set up between shoppers, retailer
                       representatives, bag manufacturers, waste management operators and
                       local authorities to help develop affordable and environmentally friendly
                       alternatives for single use plastic carrier bags.
Governmental support   The local or national government might need to provide support (monetary
                       on non5monetary) to enable commercial enterprises to comply with the
                       ban. Support could include subsidies to purchase alternative products or
                       facilitating networking between suppliers of alternative products and
                       organisations affected by the ban.
Billing systems        If a restriction by charging is planned, the retailers may have to make
                       changes to their billing systems to itemise the sale of carrier bags and
                       record the income generated from such sales. The scale of required
                       changes to standard billing systems and associated costs need to be
                       considered before restricting use of plastic bags.

The above list is not exhaustive but includes the main points that need to be considered
before implementing plastic bag ban.

In this section, a successful case study is presented for a plastic bag ban scheme (County
of Los Angeles, United States) and single5use carrier bag charging scheme (Wales, United

County of Los Angeles Plastic and Paper Carryout Bag Ordinance (Department of Public
Works, 2013).
Background
      rd
On 23 November 2010, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors adopted an ordinance
prohibiting the use of all single5use plastic carrier bags at certain stores in the County
unincorporated area, and requiring said stores to charge 10 cents for each recyclable paper bag, as
defined, that was sold to a customer.
                                                                                         st
Large supermarkets and pharmacies were required to comply with the ordinance by 1 July 2011,
while smaller markets, grocery stores, pharmacies, drug stores, and other retail stores that sell
                                                     st
basic groceries, including liquor stores, had until 1 January 2012, to comply with the provisions of
the ordinance.
All stores were required to provide the County with quarterly reports summarising their compliance
with the ordinance. Persistent non5compliance with the ordinance could result in the relevant stores
being fined.
Impacts / Outcomes
Some of the main outcomes from the implementation of the ordinance are (Department of Public
Works, 2012):
•   in addition to eliminating single use carryout plastic bags from these stores, it also resulted in a
    25% reduction in the use of recyclable paper bags. The combined effect was estimated as 95%
    reduction in single use carrier bag usage (i.e. including plastic and paper bags);
•   the estimated cost impact to residents from the implementation of the Ordinance was $4.00 per
    resident per year;
•   the ban fuelled development of local reusable bag companies trying to take advantage of the
    growing market;
•   the financial impact on local businesses from the ban has been reported as minimal; and
•   some stores used the opportunity to completely stop provision of single use paper bags as well.
    Instead, they provided either reusable bags for a fee or waste cardboard boxes for free to the
    customers.
Supporting Measures/Activities
A summary of supporting measures and activities undertaken to publicise the Ordinance and
promote compliance included:
•   pre5implementation of the ordinance:
        o assessment of potential economic impacts on residents and stores from the
            implementation of the ordinance to ensure that impacts, if any, were affordable or
            manageable;
        o stakeholder meetings were held by the County to make stores aware of efforts
            underway that may impact their operations, sales, and employment;
        o strategies to minimise operational and sales impacts, if any, were developed by the
            County and shared with stores to assist them in complying with the ordinance;
        o a website was set up to help residents become aware of the reasons for the ordinance,
            to help stores follow ordinance guidelines, and to help other jurisdictions to develop a
            similar ordinance; and
        o distribution of reusable bags at participating stores and libraries to promote awareness
            of the ordinance.
•   post5implementation of the ordinance:
        o Public Works department coordinated with carryout bag vendors to speed up
            compliance of their reusable and paper bags with the County ordinance;
        o Public Works department continued to contact stores to provide them with the
            necessary resources and information to fully comply with the ordinance;
        o the County reviewed and monitored quarterly compliance reports submitted by the
            stores;
        o stores promoted use of reusable bags by offering insulated bags to keep food cold or
            hot, providing bags with varying stylish designs, offering a free reusable bag with a
            minimum purchase, and offering rewards points or cash back to customers who use
            reusable bags.
                                                                                                           48

            o   many stores have also placed signs at shopping cart stalls in the parking lot and in the
                front door to remind customers to bring their reusable bags into the store.
Enforcement
The County is responsible for the enforcement of the ordinance. Residents and shops can report
shops that do not comply with the ordinance. In addition, the County reviews the quarterly reports
submitted by the stores to check for compliance. Any shops that are suspected of breaching the
requirements will be investigated and fines imposed if they persistently fail to comply with the
ordinance.
The costs for enforcement and education of the ordinance are related to staff time required to
review quarterly reports and to investigate reports of non5compliance. Other costs include public
education and ongoing store outreach and enforcement activities.
Public Works partnered with other departments of the County, who regularly visit the shops within
their remit, to reduce costs of enforcing the ordinance.
Other Issues
Legal challenges were brought against the ordinance including one by a large manufacturer of
plastic bags. However, the ordinance withstood all legal challenges.



Single Use Carrier Bag Restriction in Wales, United Kingdom.
Background
       st
On 1 October 2011, Wales became the first UK country to introduce a 5 pence (c.US$0.08)
minimum charge for single use carrier bags (Welsh Government, 2010a). Retailers are allowed to
charge more than 5 pence per bag if they wish to. The Welsh Government was committed to
reducing the amount of single use carrier bags used in Wales, and wanted to encourage people to
use their own bags to conserve resources, promote sustainability, and cut down on waste and litter.
Single use carrier bags (plastic, paper or starch) are no longer given away for free in Wales when
people buy goods. The money raised is collected by the retailers and is passed on to good causes
in Wales.
Reported Impacts / Outcomes
In July 2012, the Welsh Government released the following brief summary covering 13 retailers
which showed reductions of between 35% and 96% since the launch of the carrier bag charge
(Welsh Government, 2012):
•     food retail 5 between 70% and 96% reductions;
•     fashion 5 between 68% and 75% reductions;
•     home improvement 5 95% reduction;
•     food service 5 up to 45% reduction; and
•     telecommunications 5 85% reduction.
The number of single use plastic bags used by customers, as reported by 6 major retailers in the
UK, in 2011 and 2012 is summarised below (WRAP, 2013):

    Country                     Number of bags in        Number of bags in        % change (2011 use
                                 2011 (in billions)       2012 (in billions)         to 2012 use)
    England                            6.77                     7.06                     +4.4%
    Wales                              0.27                     0.07                     576%
    Scotland                           0.74                     0.75                     +1.1%
    Northern Ireland                   0.19                     0.19                     +3.0%
    United Kingdom                     7.98                     8.08                     +1.3%
The data clearly illustrate a marked reduction in the use of single use carrier bags around the time
of the introduction of a charge for carrier bags in Wales. No reduction has occurred in any other
nation within the UK between 2011 and 2012.

                                                                                                           49

Review of Waste Minimisation Programmes                                                  June 2014

Examples where revenues generated from the sale of carrier bags have been used include
(Carrierbagchargewales, 2014):
•     Morrisons, a national supermarket chain, donating £135,000 to a Save the Children charity
      scheme, FAST (Families and Schools Together), to improve relationships between schools,
      families and the local communities. The project helps children from more deprived areas thrive
      in school and get the best possible start to life (Carrierbagchargewales, 2014).
•     Tesco, a global supermarket chain, passed all proceeds (approximately £300,000) from sales
      of carrier bags in its Welsh stores to RSPB, a bird protection charity. The proceeds will help
      make a RSPB site in Wales more attractive to visitors and wildlife, and also fund the
      development of a circular walk.
Supporting Measures / Activities
A regulatory impact assessment was undertaken prior to the implementation of the carrier bag
charges to estimate potential impact on residents and business and mitigate detrimental impacts, if
any. As per the impact assessment study (Welsh Government, 2010b), the cost impacts were
estimated as follows:
•     cost to consumers: between £9m and £14m per annum (arising from loss of convenience in
      switching to ‘bags5for5life’ if not willing to pay the charge);
•     cost to retailers:
          o set5up costs in altering till points to process the charge (£1m); and
          o ongoing annual publishing requirement costs (£0.9m).
•     cost to Welsh Government:
          o one5off costs for advertising/communication (£0.4m);
          o introducing the legislation (£0.18m);
          o annual enforcement costs (£0.45m); and
          o annual management costs (£0.18m).
A dedicated website was set up by the Welsh Government to inform shoppers and retailers of:
•     the Regulations and what they can do to support reduction of single5use carrier bags in Wales;
•     the obligations on retailers to comply with the Regulations; and
•     a summary of progress made to date.
Enforcement
Local authorities (i.e. local government bodies) are responsible for administering and enforcing the
scheme within their administrative boundaries. They are also responsible for developing guidance
with regard to how the scheme will be monitored and enforced.
The guidance is to be developed in consultation with the Welsh Government and the British Retail
Consortium, amongst others.
All retailers or shops that employ 10 or more staff are required by law to keep an accurate record of
(CarrierbagchargeWales, 2014):
•     the number of single use carrier bags for which a charge has been made;
•     the gross (total) amount received from charging for single use carrier bags;
•     the gross (total) proceeds of the charge;
•     the net (final amount after deductions) proceeds of the charge;
•     a breakdown of the difference between the gross and net proceeds including the deduction of
      Value Added Tax (VAT) and the deductions for “reasonable costs”; and
•     How the net proceeds have been utilised.
The Regulations do not specify where the proceeds of the charge should be used. However, Welsh
Government expects that the proceeds should be passed on to charities or good causes in Wales,
and in particular to environmental projects.
Retailers or shops failing to comply with the provisions of the relevant legislation could face
monetary penalties.

6.0    POLYSTYRENE FOAM BANS

6.1    Background and Objectives

Polystyrene is a petroleum5based lightweight polymer with good insulation properties. It
falls under the Society of Plastics Industry (SPI) code of 6 (Figure 651) and has a wide
range of industrial and commercial applications.




                         Figure 651 SPI Coding for Polystyrene

It is used in manufacturing yoghurt pots, take5out lunch boxes and beverage cups, egg
cartons, plastic cutlery and protective packaging for electronic goods and toys (Figure
652). It is also used as insulating material in the building and construction industry.




       Figure 652 Typical Examples of Polystyrene Food Ware (Chan, A. 2011)

Polystyrene is also commonly referred to as Styrofoam, although the latter is trademarked
polystyrene developed by the Dow Chemicals Company.

Despite polystyrene’s beneficial physical characteristics and lower costs, some national
and local governments have either restricted or fully banned its use. The main reasons
reported for restricting the use of polystyrene generally include one or more of the
following:

•     they form a significant visual percentage of solid waste and litter in local urban and
      marine environments;
                                                                                               52
World Bank                                                                    406.01566.00005

•      they ultimately end up in municipal storm drains and cause clogging of the drainage
       system;
•      they are not biodegradable and can take more than one hundred years to naturally
       break down;
•      they break up into small particles which get blown away, making any recovery for
       safe disposal or treatment difficult;
•      polystyrene containers contaminated with food are either difficult or expensive to
       recycle and its collection, transport and recycling are often prohibitively expensive;
       and
•      Styrene, which is one of the main components in polystyrene, is considered to be
       neurotoxic and carcinogenic with potential health hazards to wildlife and humans.

6.2      Common Features of Successful Polystyrene Bans

Many local and state governments in the US have either restricted or banned the use of
polystyrene.

Polystyrene restrictions or bans mainly target single use food ware but their scope,
especially to whom the bans apply, is not necessarily uniform in all cases. Polystyrene
bans would appear to be more commonplace in California when compared to other states
in the US (Table 651).

There are very limited examples of polystyrene bans in nations outside the US. It is
reported that, in 2002, Taiwan banned the use of polystyrene and plastic table and food
ware from all public sector catering facilities (Space Daily, 2002).

                                                                                                 53
World Bank                                                                 406.01566.00005
Review of Waste Minimisation Programmes                                          June 2014

China, which had a (reportedly poorly enforced) ban in place for the use of polystyrene
food ware since 2001, lifted the ban in 2013, suggesting that it has become technically and
economically feasible to recycle or recover these materials since 2001 (Want China
Times, 2013).

Some of the common features of successful polystyrene bans include:

•     strong political backing and support for the ban;
•     effective stakeholder engagement and communications before, during and after
      implementation of the ban;
•     introduction of the ban or restriction through legislative means (e.g. ordinance);
•     setup and maintenance of a dedicated and publicised webpage to disseminate
      information, receive feedback and report non5compliance;
•     provision of assistance to impacted outlets by the means of:
            o providing a list of suitable suppliers who sell affordable alternative products;
            o assistance in finding alternative products and exemptions if no affordable
                alternatives could be found; and
            o one5off subsidies or grants to help manage the transition to alternative
                products.
•     an effective system for enforcement, which may be a ‘light touch’ approach that
      relies on non5compliance reporting by the public; and
•     implementation of appropriate procedures to tackle non5compliance, which may
      include written warning letters and monetary penalties.

Regions that have effectively introduced polystyrene bans are reported to have achieved
compliance rates close to 100% within a year of introducing the ban (Nguyen, LD. 2012;
Save the Bay, 2011).

6.3    Things to Consider Before Implementing a Polystyrene Ban

Based on the experiences reported by the regions who have implemented successful
polystyrene bans, some of the key issues that would need to be considered by public
authorities planning to implement a similar ban include:

•     the scope of the ban (e.g. all polystyrene products or only food ware, polystyrene
      from all outlets or limited to take5aways and restaurants);
•     local availability, affordability and recyclability of alternative products;
•     any specific technical standards that may need to be met by the alternative products
      to ensure recyclability (or compostability);
•     local capacity for the collection, recycling and composting of alternative products;
•     likely political will and support for introducing a ban;
•     timeframe for implementing the ban including scope of any exemptions or grace
      period;
•     extent of support (monetary or non5monetary) that may need to be offered to
      organisations who may be impacted by a ban;
•     communications and stakeholder engagement strategy;
•     likely potential legal challenges (e.g. from impacted outlets or manufacturers of
      polystyrene products); and
•     potential resources and costs for enforcement.

Affordable alternatives to polystyrene food ware include (Figure 653):

•     paper products with recycled content;
•     re5useable, washable cups and containers; and
•     plastic5like containers made from non5petroleum5based sources such as corn starch.
                                                                                                 54

6.4     Pre5Requisites

Some of the essential pre5requisites for successful implementation of polystyrene foam
bans are summarised in Table 652.

                    Table 652 Polystyrene Foam Bans – Key Pre5Requisites
Pre5Requisite                                                                                Rationale
Availability of viable          Before implementing a ban or restriction on polystyrene foam, it
alternatives                    needs to be ensured that there are sufficient viable and affordable
                                alternatives in place (e.g. paper based products, re5usable or
                                washable food ware).
Effective legislative           The country or region considering banning polystyrene foam will need
measures and enforcement        to have an effective legislative system and capability to strictly
regimes                         enforce the ban.
Political support               Political support is very important. Local authorities considering a ban
                                should be prepared for potential legal challenges from organisations
                                who may be affected by the ban. If such legal challenges occur,
                                strong political backing in favour of the ban would be a helpful
                                addition to effectively counter the legal challenge.
Facilities for the collection   Generally one of the reasons for implementing a ban on polystyrene
and treatment of alternative    foam is to tackle littering of these products (mainly food ware from
products                        takeaway outlets). Therefore, an affordable and effective system for
                                safely collecting and disposing products that replace polystyrene
                                foam will be required. If such a system is absent, the replacement
                                products will have similar impact as polystyrene foam on littering.

6.5     Key Elements of Programme Design

Key programme design aspects that will need to be considered for the implementation of
polystyrene foam ban are summarised in Table 653.

                 Table 653 Polystyrene Foam Bans – Key Design Elements
Design Element          Rationale
Clarity of purpose      The agency responsible for the ban should first consider whether a ban or
                        restriction is required. For example, if it administers a region where people
                        consume significant quantities of prepared meals or take5away meals,
                        there is a potential for vast amounts of polystyrene food ware to end up as
                        litter. In such areas, there might be a case for implementing a ban on
                        polystyrene food ware compared to rural areas with low consumption of
                        food served in polystyrene food ware. Once the need for a ban is justified,
                        the responsible body should identify what the intended outcomes of a ban
                        or restriction are. Typical expected outcomes include achieving reduction
                        in littering or promoting use of more environmental friendly alternatives.
                        Clarity of objectives is important for designing a ban that is fit for purpose.
Nature of restriction   Dependent on the objectives of the ban, the scope of the ban will need to
                        be defined. For example, the ban could cover all polystyrene food ware
                        (including those from grocery shops) or be targeted to specific generators
                        of such food ware (e.g. take5away outlets).
Alternatives or         Polystyrene food ware provides a convenient mode for storing and
replacements and        transporting food and therefore suitably convenient and affordable
required standards      alternatives should be available to replace it following a ban or restriction.
                        If such alternatives are not available, the ban may not be effective and
                        public support will dwindle.
                        Where alternative products are used, technical and environmental
                        standards (e.g. recyclability) may need to be specified to ensure that they
                        are fit for their purpose as well as capable of being managed in an
                        environmentally safe manner at the end of their useful life. Typically, these
                        standards would need to be agreed between the manufacturers, users of
                        such products (e.g. take5away outlets) and waste management operators.
Impact assessment       An impact assessment will need to be undertaken to estimate potential
                        technical, legal, financial and commercial impacts of a ban or restriction
                        on key groups who are likely to be impacted by the ban such as:
                        • Customers of take5away outlets;
                        • Commercial enterprises (e.g. take5away outlets, grocers) that widely
                           use polystyrene food ware; and
                        • Manufacturers and suppliers of polystyrene products.
                        This exercise will provide an understanding of the viability, as well as any
                        gaps that will need to be bridged for the ban to be effective.
Stakeholder             Consultation with all relevant stakeholders will provide the opportunity to
consultation            discuss the objectives and understand any concerns from those who are
                        likely to be affected by the ban so that these can be considered before the
                        introduction of the ban. It would also be beneficial to discuss the plans
                        with relevant politicians.
Awareness campaigns     Focussed awareness campaigns will need to be run with simple and clear
                        messages for people and organisations that are likely to be impacted by
                        the ban, to inform them why a ban is being proposed, and what practical
                        and affordable alternatives are available to them to comply with the ban
                        without significant inconvenience to their lifestyle and purchase habits.

Design Element         Rationale
Plan for potential     The agency responsible for introducing the ban will need to consider and
challenges from        plan for the eventuality of a potential legal challenge by the polystyrene
plastics industry      industry or users of such products. With sufficient political backing and
and/or retailers       robust impact assessment, there is high chance of successfully
                       overcoming such challenges but this can be time consuming and therefore
                       timescales for implementation of a ban should consider this.
Collection and         There should be an effective approach to the collection and management
treatment of           of products that replace polystyrene foam. For example, if paper based
replacement products   alternatives are used instead of polystyrene food ware, there should be an
                       effective system in place to collect all such paper based products after
                       their use for recycling, composting or safe disposal so that they do not
                       continue to litter the local environment causing exactly the same issues
                       that prompted polystyrene foam ban.
Legislative measure    Consideration should be given to how the ban should be implemented. In
                       most instances, this is implemented by legislative means i.e. a law or
                       decree.
Lead in time and       All parties likely to be affected by the ban should be given adequate time
transition period      to source alternative products in order to avoid undue commercial
                       disadvantages. This will need to be factored in if planning a ban on
                       polystyrene foam.
Compliance             The system for compliance monitoring will need to be considered and
monitoring and         agreed at the outset. As a minimum, this should consider:
enforcement             • party responsible for demonstrating evidence of compliance;
                        • party responsible for monitoring evidence of compliance;
                        • consequences of non5compliance; and
                        • resources and costs for monitoring and enforcement.
                       A ‘honeymoon’ phase might need to be allowed for a brief period after the
                       implementation of the ban, to assist affected commercial enterprises to
                       install effective systems for monitoring and reporting compliance.
                       Penalties for non5compliance may be waived during this initial period.
                       Implications for failure to comply with the ban will also need to be
                       considered. Firms that persistently breach the ban could be dealt with by
                       imposing fines, suspending their trading license and/or taking them to
                       court.
Exemptions             A universal ban may not be applicable to all commercial enterprises
                       because it may have an adverse impact on their sales or they might need
                       more time to provide suitable alternatives for the transportation of
                       products they sell. Such implications will need to be considered and
                       reasonable exemptions should be allowed for in the legislation to address
                       such issues. Clear criteria to assess eligibility for exemption will need to
                       be set. Ideally, all exemptions should be time limited.
Support networks       Support networks might need to be set up between affected commercial
                       enterprises, manufacturers of alternative products, waste management
                       operators and relevant government bodies to help develop affordable and
                       environmentally friendly alternatives to polystyrene products. Government
                       subsidies or funding might be required, especially in the early stages, to
                       support investment in manufacturing of alternative products or systems for
                       monitoring and reporting compliance.
Governmental support   The local or national government might need to provide support (monetary
                       on non5monetary) to enable commercial enterprises comply with the ban.
                       Support could include subsidies to purchase alternative products or
                       facilitating networking between suppliers of alternative products and
                       organisations affected by the ban.

The above list is not exhaustive but includes the main points that need to be considered
before implementing polystyrene foam ban.

6.6      Case Studies

Portland, Oregon, United States (Nguyen LD, 2012)
Background
Portland passed a ban on polystyrene foam containers in January 1989, which came into effect in
January 1990.
The ordinance prohibited restaurants, grocery stores and other retail vendors from using
polystyrene foam containers for prepared food within the City’s jurisdiction. The ordinance had an
impact on more than 1,000 food establishments at the time.
The ordinance allowed for a one year exemption to impacted establishments if they could prove
that compliance with the ordinance would cause undue commercial hardship to their businesses.
The ordinance also exempted food items that have been pre5packaged outside the City’s boundary.
The ban was met with a lawsuit by the McDonalds Corporation, which the company subsequently
lost.
Implementation
A task force was appointed prior to the preparation of the ordinance to recommend potential
policies, programmes and ordinances for prohibiting the use and sale of polystyrene foam products
in the City.
The task force was instructed to consider the following aspects in their recommendations:
•     public education and promotion;
•     alternative product recycling/energy conversion;
•     financial assistance; and
•     alternative products research
Following the approval of the ordinance and prior to its implementation, the City developed and
circulated two handouts – one explaining the background of the ordinance and the other listing the
banned food ware. A webpage was also set up to provide details of the ban as well as contact
information.
Enforcement
Portland’s enforcement of the food ware ordinance is complaint based. When the relevant City
department or official receives complaints from other establishments or public, the City’s
enforcement staff begin their investigation by visiting the establishment and providing general
advice on how they can comply with the ordinance. Follow up visits to the store are then made,
usually after a month has elapsed, to re5check for compliance.
Most complaints received tend to be about new food establishments in the City who may have not
fully understood the requirements of the ordinance.
Reported Benefits
No quantified benefits appear to be reported in the public domain apart from references to notifiable
changes in litter composition.
Since the introduction of the ordinance, the City has focused efforts on the collection and
appropriate management of alternative products (i.e. products that replaced polystyrene).
The City has also started to work jointly with neighbouring public authorities who have implemented
similar bans (e.g. County of Mutnomah) to share resources and avoid duplication of efforts in
enforcement.

Seattle, Washington, United States (Nguyen LD, 2012)
Background
The City of Seattle’s ordinance banned use of polystyrene food ware from all food establishments
selling food in the City including restaurants, groceries and fast food outlets. The ordinance was
passed in July 2008, and implemented in two phases:
•   Phase 1 (January 2009): banned use of polystyrene food ware from all establishments serving
    food in the City; and
•   Phase 2 (July 2010): required all singe use food packaging and service ware to be compostable
    or recyclable.
The ordinance impacted on approximately 4,000 food establishments. Exemptions have been
allowed for:
•   pre5packaged foods in expanded polystyrene that have been filled and sealed prior to receipt
    by the food service businesses; and
•   utensils, straws, small portion cups, foil faced insulated wrap, and cocktail sticks (a temporary
                                       st
    exemption was in place until July 1 2012).
The City did not allow an exemption for economic or undue hardship.
Implementation
A study was commissioned to estimate the impacts arising from polystyrene disposal food ware
prior to implementing the ban. Although the original scope of the considered ban included plastic
bags and polystyrene, only a polystyrene ban was ultimately implemented. A survey was also
conducted in 2007 to gauge public opinion regarding a ban on disposable polystyrene food ware.
An effective communications program has been implemented with support from consultants, which
included quarterly stakeholder meetings and events with food service businesses, waste service
providers, food packaging manufacturers and media. Stakeholder groups were also created after
the passage of the ordinance and the groups included neighbourhood associations, food
establishments, The Seattle Chapter Restaurant Association, and suppliers of food ware. The City
requested stakeholders to share information on the prices, performance, and availability of
alternative products for it to develop a co5ordinated approach to bringing the prices down and
increasing availability of the alternative products.
Site visits were made by the City’s consultants to advise food service establishments on matters of
compliance and affordable alternative approaches. The City’s staff also attended at least two trade
shows every year in Seattle to interact with the distributors of alternative products. The City
provided four handouts in multiple languages to ensure compliance with the ordinance.
Following the implementation of the ordinance, the City’s staff worked with waste hauliers to
maximise capture rates of alternative products for recycling or composting. The City expanded its
composting scheme to also provide a cost effective outlet to manage food waste from impacted
establishments.
Enforcement
Seattle’s enforcement measures included hiring of inspectors who visited stores and restaurants to
check for compliance, both on a random basis and in response to complaints received.
They also helped the City’s staff in collection of fees or penalties, where such measures were
imposed on establishments due to non5compliance.
Reported Benefits
The ordinance had 95% compliance rates by 2011 and only six establishments had been fined up
to that point in time.
No establishments had been reported as being ‘forced out of business’ due to the requirements in
the ordinance.

City of Millbrae, California, United States. (Save the Bay, 2011)
Background
The City of Millbrae adopted a ban on polystyrene food packaging in January 2008 to reduce
pollution in local waterways and City streets.
A City ordinance was published in this regard, which banned use of polystyrene containers by
restaurants or sellers of take5out food and required them to use containers that are reusable,
biodegradable, compostable or recyclable under the City’s programmes. The ban covered
polystyrene cups, lids, straws, ‘clamshells’, plates, bowls and utensils.
Some exemptions to the ban were allowed including for:
•     food prepared or packaged outside of the City; and
•     packaging used for applications where a suitable affordable alternative is not available.
Delivery Model
The ban was introduced following a stakeholder engagement exercise, which included:
•     production of two informational reports by City staff to prepare the Council for addressing
      industry concerns;
•     distribution of postcards and flyers to businesses explaining the reasons for considering a ban;
•     discussions with the Chamber of Commerce prior to the adoption of the Ordinance; and
•     offering of online resources and materials to educate business owners about how to comply.
A consultation with the City and County attorneys was undertaken during the development phase of
the ordinance to make sure that it was compliant with any existing local, state, or federal legislation.
Resources and staff were needed to draft the legislation, develop communication materials,
manage the informational website, and enforce compliance.
Enforcement
The model implemented for enforcement utilised a reactive approach whereby non5compliance was
investigated mainly following receipt of complaints from other shops or members of the public.
Responsibility for enforcement of the ban rested primarily with the City Manager or his/her
designee. Food vendors who persistently non5comply with the ban are liable to pay penalties up to
$500, which is set at an increasing scale as summarised below:
•     first incident: written warning and no monetary penalties;
•     second incident: $100;
•     third incident: $200; and
•     fourth incident: $500.
Reported Compliance Level
The City of Millbrae reported near 100% compliance following the introduction of the ban.

7.0     OVERVIEW OF PRE5REQUISITES AND KEY DESIGN ELEMENTS OF WASTE
        MINIMISATION PROGRAMMES

This section provides an overview of the key pre5requisites and design elements for the
following waste minimisation programmes discussed in this report namely:

•     Pay5as5you5throw (PAYT) schemes;
•     Landfill bans;
•     Plastic bag bans; and
•     Polystyrene foam bans.

7.1      Pre5Requisites

An overview of the key pre5requisites for the waste minimisation programmes discussed in
this report is provided in Table 751.

                             Table 751 Overview of Pre5Requisites
                                                                 Plastic Bag
                                                                                 Polystyrene

Table 752 suggests that the following key design elements are applicable to all waste
minimisation programmes discussed in the preceding section of this report:

•         Clarity of purpose;
•         Impact assessment;
•         Stakeholder consultation;

                                                                                                     63
World Bank                                                                406.01566.00005
Review of Waste Minimisation Programmes                                         June 2014

•    Communications and complaints handling;
•    Legislative measure;
•    Adequate lead in time and transition period; and
•    Compliance monitoring and enforcement.

These findings demonstrate that a considered, strategic approach is needed to maximise
the potential success of new waste management initiatives, regardless of location.

Once the overall strategy and goals have been established, more detailed consideration of
local factors is then required to inform the detailed design of the service delivery systems.
