Rapid Damage and
LossAssessment (DaLA)
December 24-25, 2013 Floods
A report by the Government of Saint Vincent and
the Grenadines
January 16, 2014
FOREWORD
On 24thand 25thDecember, 2013 a tropical trough system produced heavy rains in Saint Vincent and
the Grenadines (SVG), which resulted in intense flooding across the island. The ensuing rapid and
intense flash flooding resulted in widespread damage to road infrastructure, electricity and water
infrastructure, housing as well as public and private buildings. On December 26, 2013, the
Government of SVG (GoSVG) declared a National Level 2 Disaster in accordance with the National
Emergency and Disaster Management Act, 2006. This declaration was considered of national
proportions, but specifically declared the following disasters areas to be: 1) Vermont Valley to
Buccament Bay; 2) Rose Bank and Dark View on the Leeward Side, 3) Chateaubelair, 4) Fitz-Hughes,
5) Richmond Vale, 6) Spring Village, 7) Gordon Village, 8) Cumberland, 9) Troumaca, 10) South
Rivers, 11) O’Briens Valley, Georgetown, and 12) Spring Village, Georgetown.

We will never forget the people who lost their lives as a result of this disaster, and will use their
deaths as a wake-up call for the entire nation that we are a country that is highly vulnerable to
natural disasters and the impacts of climate variability.

This “Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (2014) Rapid Damage and Loss Assessment” report serves as
a reminder and proof of the GoSVG’s resolve and commitment to risk reduction as well as the well-
being of our people. The GoSVG recognizes the necessity to better understand our climate and
disaster risk context, and will do our best to reduce this risk and improve resilience across all sectors.

This report provides a rapid damage and loss assessment of the sectors affected – with a particular
focus on infrastructure damage in order to inform the GoSVG’s recovery, reconstruction and
financial planning. It also includes short and medium term recommendations designed to further
incorporate disaster risk reduction and management into land use and physical planning decision-
making processes so that we continue to develop into a country that is more resilient to natural
disasters and climate change.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
On 24th and 25th December, 2013 a tropical trough system produced heavy rains in Saint Vincent and
the Grenadines (SVG). Local rainfall stations reported between 200mm and 310mm in a matter of 2
– 3 hours on the north windward side of the island and up to 153.3mm in the north leeward side of
the island, which resulted in intense flooding across the island.

The ensuing rapid and intense flash flooding resulted in severe damage and 9 confirmed deaths with
3 persons still missing. Additionally, there is widespread damage to road infrastructure, electricity
and water infrastructure, housing as well as public and private buildings.

On December 26, 2013, the Government of SVG (GoSVG) declared a National Level 2 Disaster in
accordance with the National Emergency and Disaster Management Act, 2006. This declaration was
considered of national proportions, but specifically declared the following disasters areas to be in a
state of emergency: 1) Vermont Valley to Buccament Bay; 2) Rose Bank and Dark View on the
Leeward Side, 3) Chateaubelair, 4) Fitz-Hughes, 5) Richmond Vale, 6) Spring Village, 7) Gordon
Village, 8) Cumberland, 9) Troumaca, 10) South Rivers, 11) O’Briens Valley, Georgetown, and 12)
Spring Village, Georgetown.

According to the summary of the data reported from each affected sector, the December 24-25,
2013 flood event resulted in total damages and losses of US$108.4million (EC$291.4 million),
equivalent to 15% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). Most of the flood damage was
sustained in the infrastructure sector (97%) - followed by the social (3%) and productive sectors
(<1%). However, as in the case with any rapid assessment following a major event, re-
construction/rehabilitation works contingencies – particularly in the transport sector, could
potentially increase the total damages reflected in this report by up to 15%.

1. COUNTRY OVERVIEW
1.1       COUNTRY CONTEXT
Demographic. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG) is an archipelagic state in the Eastern
Caribbean, comprising the main island, Saint Vincent, and a chain of 32 islands and cays. The total
area of the country is 390 sq. km of which the main island is 344 sq. km. SVG is a small island
developing state (SIDS) with an estimated population of 109,373 and a GDP per capita of US$6,515
in 20121.The country’s population is split evenly with 50% female and 50% male. According to the
last completed census (2010), 30% of the population lives below the national poverty line. Over the
past two decades, the population has migrated from the rural areas to the urban areas, where 50%
of the population now resides.

Economic. The GDP in 2012 was US$712 million with the tertiary sector accounting for 72.9% of the
GDP, industry for 19.9% and the primary sector accounting for the remaining 7.3% of the GDP2.In the
past, SVG relied almost exclusively on agriculture, but within recent times, tourism and related
services, construction and other sectors have become
increasingly important as contributors to the national economy.
Although commerce is becoming more decentralized, the main
area of economic activity is Kingstown - the country’s capital.
Public external debt relative to GDP ratio was 70% in 20123,
which results in SVG having limited capacity to manage the fiscal
impacts of exogenous shocks. Table 2 shows select socio-
economic statistics.

Poverty. According to the 2007 Country Poverty Assessment
(CPA), 2.9% of the population lives in abject poverty, 30.2%is
below the poverty line and 48.2% of the population is
susceptible to poverty. The poverty distribution is
geographically correlated with the highest poverty rates, 55.6%
found at the northern end of the island – with the highest                           FIGURE 3: POVERTY HEADCOUNT
concentrations found in the villages of Sandy Bay and in
Georgetown. Figure 3 shows the poverty by census district.

1.2       GENERAL SITUATION
Extraordinarily heavy rains experienced in Saint Vincent Island on the evening of December 24, 2013
provoked rapid and intense flash flooding that directly affected over 50% of the population. Flood
damages and landslides resulted in significant damage to infrastructure - particularly in the water,
electricity and transport sector. Numerous private homes were lost and 9 persons are confirmed to
have lost their lives with 3 person still missing. As a result of the event, 225 persons were evacuated
to national disaster shelters and schools were closed for an extra week of Christmas vacation while
emergency stabilization operations continued.

Particularly critical was the damage experienced in the transport, electricity, and water sectors.
Floods destroyed bridges and undermined roadways, two hydropower-generating facilities were
disabled, and water services were cut to more than 50% of the population due to losses of
transmission pipes throughout the country.

Initial emergency response operations have restored most transport communication and water
services through a patchwork of emergency interventions and most landslips have been cleared
from affected roadways. However, the two hydropower plants remain offline and are not expected
to be restored for several months. These plants represent 12% of the national generating capacity.


1.3 VULNERABILITY TO NATURAL HAZARDS
SVG is exposed to high levels of risk to meteorological and geophysical hazards4, which have
significant negative impacts to SVG’s economic and fiscal stability. It has more than 40 rivers and
tributaries, which originate in the central mountains and discharge to the Caribbean Sea or the
Atlantic Ocean5. Often villages and towns are located along those rivers, especially near the coast in
the flatter areas that leads to increased debris flow and flood risk. As a result of its volcanic origin,
steep slopes dominate the island’s landscape and tilted volcanic layers define the geology and soils6.
In combination with high temperatures and abundant rainfall, this leads to slope instabilities and the
potential for landslides. De Graaf identified in 1988 about 475 landslides, covering about 1% of the
country’s surface. The most common type of landslides in SVG are debris flows. These are defined as
rapid movements of a mass of soil, water and air, posing a significant threat to human lives since
they can travel long distances, approach fast and exhibit a considerable destructive force. Volcanic
eruptions have affected the country in 1789, 1812, 1902, 1971 and 19797. SVG is located in the
Atlantic hurricane belt and has suffered periodic damages from past events e.g. from Hurricane Allen
(1980), Hurricane Lenny (1999), and Hurricane Tomas (2010).

Studies show that natural hazards are being exacerbated by the adverse impacts of climate change,
which are putting increased stress on water availability, coastal investments, national infrastructure

approximately US$41 million, which was more than the accumulative sum of damages from 1961 –
20008.


1.4 OVERVIEW OF DECEMBER 24 AND 25 DISASTER
On December 24 through the early morning of December 25, 2013, extraordinarily heavy rains
associated with a tropical trough system, passed through the Eastern Caribbean affecting the islands
of Dominica, St. Lucia and St. Vincent. While meteorological services were observing the trough
system, regional forecasts provided indicated that the system was associated with moderately heavy
rainfall activity but did not indicate the potential for severe weather. Extracted from the forecast
outlook issued from Barbados Meteorological Services, the outlook for December 24 was "This
feature [the trough] will continue to advect copious amounts of moisture and showers particularly
over the north-eastern portions of the Lesser Antilles with most of the deep convection and
thunderstorm activity being concentrated in the vicinity of Dominica, Martinique and Guadeloupe
and St. Vincent to a lesser extent for at least another 12 to 24 hours.”

Along the northern portion of the island, 308.6 mm of rainfall was recorded over the 24-hour period,
but more importantly, 278 mm fell over a 3-hour period from 9 pm to 12 am. While rainfall curves
are unavailable for St. Vincent, a review of curves available for Puerto Rico and St. Lucia coupled
with interviews with affected persons and staff at the national meteorological office strongly suggest
the 3 hour rainfall intensity is in excess of a 1 in 100 year event. Additionally, previous normal
rainfall had already saturated the surface soils creating optimum conditions for maximum surface
runoff. Witnesses reported unusual lightning and thunder activity associated with the storm and,
some areas, hail during the peak rainfall event, further
confirming the system was unusually intense. Rainfall
was largely focused on the northern portion of the
island where the topography is mountainous and
includes the highest elevations on the island, namely
the Soufriere volcano. Storm interaction with the
island topography in this area likely contributed to the
high rainfall rates experienced. Most of the rainfall
was experience over the central mountain range
where eastern and western watersheds converge.
Rainfall was unevenly distributed during the storm and
the northern and central portions of the island
received disproportionately higher intensities than the
southern portions where the rain gauge at the Arnos
vale airport reported heavy but not extraordinary
precipitation rates and levels.

The intense rainfall converted rapidly to a major flash
flood event for most of the streams on the northeast
and northwest portions of the islands and provoked
major landslides. Kingstown experienced flooding
originating in the upper watersheds and flood intensity
increased to the north. Consequently, the northern
portion of the island suffered major flooding along                        FIGURE 4: PRECIPITATION DISTRIBUTION

principal rivers and tributaries, which severely damaged or destroyed public and private
infrastructure. Floods particularly affected roadways, bridges, drinking water and power generation
facilities. Landslips in the north blocked most major roadways. Numerous houses were damaged
and 9 persons lost their lives with 3 additional persons missing. Bridges were severely damaged or
destroyed, cars were swept away and numerous landslips closed much of the principal road system.
It is fortunate that the storm occurred in the evening of Christmas Eve and traffic was at a minimum,
which undoubtedly contributed to the relatively low loss of life.

and services, areas with high levels of poverty, such as Georgetown 55.6% and Sandy Bay 55.6%.
Approximately 15% of the population was directly affected and the total population will be affected
by the medium and long-term effects. With respect to of the people affected, around 44.0 % are
classified as living in poverty. A more detailed social assessment on the impact of gender would be
required in order to determine the full social impact of the disaster.


1.5 THE IMMEDIATE RESPONSE
Advisories and Warnings. On the evening of December 24, intense rainfall developed in St. Vincent
without significant advanced warning as presented in this extract from the synopsis issued by the
Meteorological Service of St. Vincent “the weather changed so rapidly between 6:00 and 8:00 pm on
the 24th December that is would have been very difficult to predict and then issue a severe weather
bulletin/flood warning with any significant lead time to alert the populace. The officer on duty
however did manage to issue a severe/special weather bulletin for the country based on her
observations of what was taking place between 7:00 and 8:30 pm. that evening. This bulletin went
out at 9:20 pm and verbal contact was made with NEMO….”

Activation of the National Disaster Plan. In accordance with the National Disaster Response Plan of
the GoSVG, the National Emergency Management Organization (NEMO) – as mandated by the
National Emergency and Disaster Management Act, 2006 - led the preliminary Damage and Needs
Assessment. The report generated from the initial assessment provides information relative to the
nature and scope of destruction to public and private sectors. Based on the information contained
within the report, the Acting Prime Minister, Girlyn Miguel – as Chair of the National Emergency
Council – declared a Level 2 Disaster on December 26, 2013. This announcement was via a formal
announcement via National broadcast, which was later published in the local newspapers.

Immediate emergency response focused on rescue, clearing of landslips, restoration of water and
electricity as well as preparation of diversions around damaged and lost bridges. Levels of
infrastructure loss were significant due to the flash flooding and efforts to restore services are
ongoing.

Following the initial damage assessment report, several sectoral reports were produced by key
agencies of the GoSVG Damage and Needs Assessment Committee. Subsequently, the GoSVG
activated the National Disaster Plan, which requires the specific identification and prioritization of
critical recovery and reconstruction activities - including critical imports.


1.6 THE DAMAGE AND LOSS (DALA) APPROACH
DaLA Preparation. After the initial assessment of damages by the government, it was concluded that
the infrastructure had been severely impacted. On December 31, the GoSVG Ambassador to the
United States requested the technical assistance of the World Bank (WB) to conduct a Rapid Damage
and Loss Assessment (DaLA) and to support reconstruction efforts in the country. In response to the
government’s request, the WB deployed a team of experts to conduct the rapid DaLA, which arrived
in the country on January 7, 2014. The team worked jointly with the national authorities, visited the
affected areas, gathered information and analyzed the results. The information in this report reflects
the results of the assessment and information available as of January 16, 2014.

DaLA Methodology. The DaLA methodology calculates the damage and losses as well as the social,
economic, and environmental impacts of a disaster. This report provides -based on the available
information- a close approximation of damages to assets and losses to the economic flows, and
provide the some inputs to summarizes total macroeconomic impacts.

The DaLA methodology uses the country’s system of national accounts and involves all
macroeconomic sectors including productive (agriculture, tourism, commerce, and industries),
infrastructure (transportation, electricity, and water supply and sanitation), social (housing,
education, and health), as well as crosscutting issues (e.g., the environment and gender).

       Damage is defined as the monetary value of fully or partially destroyed assets. It is initially
       assumed that assets will be replaced to the same condition— in quantity and quality—that
       they had prior to the disaster.

       Losses are defined as the changes in the flows of goods and services that will not be
       forthcoming in the affected area until full economic recovery and reconstruction has been
       achieved. They include production of goods and services that will not be obtained or
       provided, higher costs of operation and production, and the cost of the
       humanitarian/emergency assistance activities. Losses are expressed in current values.

 2. DAMAGE AND LOSSES ASSESSMENT
 2.1 DAMAGE AND LOSS SUMMARY
 According to the summary of the data reported from each affected sector, the December 24 and 25,
 2013 flood event resulted in total damages and losses of US$103.9 million (EC$279.3 million),
 equivalent to 15% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). Most of the flood damage was
 sustained in the infrastructure sector (97%) - followed by the social (3%) and productive sectors
 (<1%).

 2.2 DAMAGE AND LOSSES BY SECTOR
 The following report is based on estimates from national authorities in each sector following the
 same template and the same DaLA methodology. It is presented by sectors under categories of
 Infrastructure, Productive Sectors, Social Sectors, and Cross-Cutting Sectors.

                                                                                                                                      13
2.2.1 TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE

The impacts to the transportation system focused mainly on the main roads, bridges and riverbank
stability from floods and landslips. A single major road rings the island connecting all communities
to the island’s principal center of commerce, Kingstown, and hospital. This road provides access
services for the entire population and is key to all sectors of the national economy.

During the storm, the country’s international airport suffered temporary flooding of the runway
resulting in closure of the airport facility for several hours however; no significant damages were
identified with the airport reopening on December 25, 2013. The country’s principal port facilities
were not affected; however, a small pier facility on the northwest coast was destroyed. The pier in
this area is classified as lifeline infrastructure as it serves the fishing community but represents the
only access point to supply the community in the event of a major road blockage. Access to this
region is highly susceptible to landslip activity.

24 bridges (13% of all bridges) were damaged and 14 were completely destroyed (8% of all bridges)–
for a total of 21% of affected bridges. Additionally, 31 km of roads (representing 4% of total road
network) were damaged or destroyed. Estimated damage to bridges and roadways is approximately
US$67.9 million (EC$182.5 million) - representing approximately 12% of the GDP.

Total              $30,377,169 $37,491,222 $82,602,147


Assumptions. The damages and losses represented in table 5, include main roads (primary and
secondary), feeder roads (tertiary), and bridges. In order to calculate the estimated damages, all
estimates used market unit rates in accordance with an established database housed within the
Ministry of Transport and Works. This calculation also considered a cumulative
rehabilitation/reconstruction contingency of 15% and a nationally established value added tax (VAT)
rate of 15%.

Losses calculated for the transport sector include costs of: i) improved reinforced infrastructure for
roads and bridges; ii) construction of temporary structures while construction is taking place; iii)
clean-up(US$1.7 million); cost of vehicle replacements (US$24,000); and the opportunity cost
associated with increased transit times (US$460,934).The loss calculation also included a combined
design (6%) and supervision (9%) cost of 15%(US$8.9 million) for all rehabilitation/reconstruction
works activities. In addition, in order to support the rehabilitation and redesign of damaged or
destroyed civil works, the loss calculation considered the conducting of pre-engineering studies –
more specifically, hydrology and hydraulic studies for 8 affected watersheds (Richmond, Buccament,

                                                                                                                   14
Colonaire, Troumaca, Petit Bordel, Sandy Bay, Fancy and Chateaubelair) for total of US$2 million
(EC$5.3 million). The assessment also considered the increase in cost of maintenance ($108,661 for
1 year) of affected infrastructure. Total transportation losses, as of January 15, 2014, is US$8.9
million (EC$21.9 million); however, this number is expected to increase by 2% as additional losses
are realized over time.

These losses consider the value of increase the time to transit and do not include isolation of
population, increase in the prices of agricultural goods in market (affecting food security), increase in
the time and cost of transport, reduction in the export of agricultural goods, reduction in the income
of farm owners and possible reduction in the income from tourism.

2.2.2 HOUSING

Damage to housing stock on the east side of the island was significant. Areas particularly hit hard
were Vermont, Troumaca, Spring Village and Cumberland villages. Table 6 below presents the
Housing Infrastructure affected by the storm.

TABLE 6: HOUSING INFRASTRUCTURE AFFECTED

  4               61 Structure is not useable and cannot be repaired must be rebuilt
Total            662


The GoSVG organized emergency assistance and established temporary shelters. On January 7, 2014
there were 225 people occupying 7 shelters. Losses include the cost of shelter operation for one
month, the cost of vulnerability analysis to be conducted and estimated land acquisitions required
for relocation of vulnerable families. Table 7 presents the detailed calculations of the damage and
losses.

2.2.3 WATER AND SANITATION

Water. Drinking water transmission services provided by of the Central Water and Sewage Authority
(CWSA) were interrupted with 8 of the 11 distribution networks suffering major damages to
transmission pipes caused by the extensive flooding. As many as 30 major rivers island-wide
suffered major flooding many of which are traversed by the CWSA’s transmission and distribution
lines. Raw water intakes were affected with two weirs completely destroyed. Sandbags have been
put in place to temporarily restored services from these locations. As a result of damages to the
system, approximately 70% of the country was left without piped water. Through a program of
temporary emergency repairs, this number was reduced to 40% after one week and subsequently
30% after two weeks. Piped water access was fully restored to normal service levels by three weeks
after the event. As of January 13, 2014, 30% of the water infrastructure remains in a highly
vulnerable condition owing to the temporary nature of the emergency interventions.

Sanitation. Solid waste services were suspended to several communities as CWSA collection trucks
could not access communities due to the severe damages to transport infrastructure. Over the three
weeks period after the storm, CWSA worked with the affected communities to devise a means to
remove the solid waste.

Temporary Water Distribution. While emergency construction progressed to restore piped water
services, CWSA reverted to the use of water trucks to distribute water to affected communities. This
practice continued until services were restored.

Reconstruction. An estimated 2 to 3 months will be required to replace weir structures along the
two affected raw water intakes. An estimated 1 to 2 years will be required to rehabilitate the
distribution network replacing temporary repairs with permanent infrastructure. Based on the
experience from the flood event, CWSA plans to conduct studies to determine new pipeline routes
and designs for more resilient pipelines at river crossings as well as other areas in the system. These
studies will evaluate the impact of the current river conditions such as widening and/or rerouting
caused by the flood event.

Financial. The combined damage and losses to water and sanitation was approximately
US$4.5million (EC$12million).

2.2.4 ELECTRICITY

In SVG, 83% of the electricity is generated using imported fuels; approximately 17% is produced by 3
hydroelectric facilities. Power transmission is accomplished through a unified grid network with all
generator connected to same grid. Floods affected the system primarily through damage to all three
hydro facilities - taking them off line. This represents approximately 17% of the generating capacity
for the system that will be replaced through the increase in fuel based generation systems. The
need for increased reliance on imported fuels will likely result in an increase in the consumer fuel
service fee collected by VINLEC - affecting all sectors.

VINLEC expects to see an increase in the cost of electricity as the lost Hydropower generation will be
replaced by diesel generation. Electricity bills primarily consist of a base rate plus a fuel surcharge,
which is used to recover the cost of fuel. Without Hydropower generation, VINLEC will use more fuel
requiring an increase in the fuel surcharge. The Hydropower generation plants produce between


                                                                                                      16
two and three million units of electricity monthly. Hydropower generation in SVG results in costs
savings over fossil fuel plants of approximately EC $1.5 million (US$ 557.994) monthly in fuel costs.

No significant damages were noted in the transmission system and minor localized damages were
experienced in the distribution system.

2.2.5 HEALTH

The Ministry of Health and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has conducted an Initial
Damage Assessment focused on the Milton Cato Memorial Hospital (MCMH). This assessment
revealed that a number of records and essential pieces of equipment were damaged. Additionally
damage from flooding to the maternity and pediatrics wards was significant. Initial
replacement/repair costs are estimated at US$1.8 million (EC$4.9 million). Annex 3 as the list of
equipment needed.

The Ministry of Health reported, all the district clinics is functioned (only one clinic in leeward has no
water), the water tasted equipment was been provide, and improve the fogging program to reduce
the risk of dengue and the health psychologist program to assist the affected population.

The losses include the expenditures to treatment to injures, the higher expenditures on patients
referred to other facilities, loss revenue and the cost of surveillance, information campaign and
vector control in flooding areas.

2.2.6 AGRICULTURE

The agriculture sector was impacted by the flooding, primarily resulting from the interruption of
transport access services. The agricultural production in the northern affected areas, such as
Georgetown and Sandy Bay, comprises primarily banana, root crops and vegetables. Particularly
affected are low-income families whose agricultural production is primarily for personal
consumption and local sales (i.e. farmers markets). It is estimated that approximately 3% of total
population affected are farmers.

Total damages in the agricultural sector are estimated to be US$1.4 million(EC$3.69 million). 1,115
farmers were affected and 170 acres of land (equivalent 0.688 sq km). This amount represents 3% of
the total value of agriculture (WB 2012). The Agriculture sector represents 7% of the GDP (WB
2012). At the moment, the Ministry of Agriculture is in the process of determining the total damage
to the forestry sector and estimated costs of reforestation.

It is expected that the environmental damage and losses will be minimal, and therefore were not
quantified as part of this assessment.

2.2.7 TOURISM

Damages. Key tourist sites were located in the areas that suffered the most damage from the storm.
These include popular locations such as Troumaca and Vermont areas. Damage to Tourism
infrastructure includes the Botanic Gardens, Black Point Historic and Recreational Park, Dark View
Falls and the Wallilabou Heritage Park. Direct damages to the Tourism infrastructure are estimated
at US$118,739 (EC$319,195).

Losses. The major impact of the storm on the Toursim sector will be experienced due to the loss or
limitation of access to key tourism sites resulting from damages to the Transportation infrastructure.

                                                                                                       17
The following section estimates the potential loss to the Tourism sector for the national’s parks (6):
Walllilabou Heritage Park, Black Point Historic and Recreation Park, Dark View Falls, Layou
Petroglyph Park, Vermont Nature Trails, and La Soufriere Cross Country Trail. According to National
Parks, Rivers and Beach Authority, 75,502 people visit the national parks per year and pay on
average US$2 (EC$5) to enter. Assuming that it would take 3 months to restore the sites to partial
capacity and 6 months to fully restore the sites, the total amount lost in the tourism sector would be
US$52,675 (EC$470,795).

This does not include expenditures souvenirs, incidentals or food. In total, the damage and losses
for the tourism sector, to date, is approximately US$171,414 (EC$460,795).

2.2.8 EDUCATION

The education infrastructure was not directly affected; however, five of the eight emergency
shelters activated were elementary schools. These may need repairs once the shelters are closed
cost of repairs coupled with some furniture replacement is estimated at US$15,000 (EC$ 43,323).

2.2.9 INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE

The GoSVG conducted an assessment of minor commerce, in general the losses are US$6,000
(EC$16,129).


2.3 MACROECONOMIC IMPACT
The macroeconomic impact of the floods and landslides will take longer to become apparent. In the
Balance of Payments (BOP), the possible impact considered the increase of the imports; foods and
agriculture supplies, W&S supplies, rehabilitations roads and bridges and reconstruction the houses
and medical equipment.

In the Fiscal Sector, the possible impact considers the increase of the budget of public expenses and
reassignment of public investment budget resources. The increased expenditures were
accommodated by making use of the government’s budget framework - as no allocation with
respect to natural calamities was made to the budgeted contingency fund. This represents
approximately the 7% of the total budget of expenses (2011). The needs for reconstruction
represent proximally the 39% of the public investment budget (2011).

The GoSVG will need to further assess the impact to BOP, Fiscal Sector and poverty level after the
conclusion of the DaLA process.


2.4 RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION PLAN
The late December floods offer an important window of opportunity to address difficult
development issues. More importantly, this event provides a strong impetus to better understand
the localized relationship between rainfall rates and run-off volumes and the system response with
respect to flood and landslide events within watersheds. Improving this understanding will be useful
in the application of more advanced hazard and risk modeling methodologies to inform the future
investment activities.



                                                                                                   18
A robust recovery and reconstruction framework is proposed to provide a sequenced, prioritized,
programmatic, yet flexible action plan to guide the recovery and reconstruction process that is
anchored in disaster risk management – in particular flood risk management.

Short-Term Actions (1 year)
    Repair and clean up damaged houses and infrastructure - including roads, river protection
       works, drainage, schools and recover agriculture production

      Conduct a detailed post disaster needs assessment (PDNA) focused on livelihoods

      Conduct a technical inspection of damaged infrastructure – including a technical assessment
       of existing transportation and power, water and sanitation infrastructure.

      Develop or update the river basin flood risk maps and watershed calibration curves from
       CWSA data collected since 2009

      Update the landslide susceptibility maps to include other interacting risks (i.e. flood,
       rockslide, mudslide, change of river course, etc) with particular attention to areas left
       unstable after the flood event

      Evaluate and ensure the effectiveness of operation and maintenance (and in some cases
       immediate improvement) of drainage network, as well as efficient coordination between
       agencies

      Establish a standing parliamentary committee to investigate and develop risk transfer
       options with respect to government assets and private sector losses in order to prepare for
       dealing with future disaster loss events. Considerations should include activities such as
       setting aside a capital reserve, (government self-insurance), purchase of insurances,
       insurance requirements for the private sector, formal support systems for low income
       citizens. Recommend this begin with a comprehensive multi-sectoral fiscal vulnerability
       analysis and an analysis of needs for periodic rehabilitation of public infrastructure in order
       to mitigate direct budget impacts of recurrent disaster events in the future

Medium- to Long-Term Actions (1–5 years)

      Address critical data gaps needed to generate hazard and risk assessment particularly with
       respect to hydromet monitoring systems

      Advance findings under risk transfer analysis to policy and/or legislation

      Formalize the national hydromet data management system and improve data collection
       (including telemetric reporting systems for all rainfall and stream gauges) building on the
       current system managed by CWSA developed under the GOSVG/EU water resources project.
       Improve interagency data sharing and archiving and formalize the establishment of a
       national hydromet center of expertise

      Identify and map annual, 10 year, 25 year, 50 year and 100 year flood plains

      Develop a land-use/land-cover map using criteria required as inputs to watershed and runoff
       modeling systems


                                                                                                   19
         Incorporate watershed and flood risk management in the national land-use planning process

         Identify and act on the development of required legislation to manage land-use in high risk
          areas particularly in recurrent floodplain zones

         Adopt a watershed management legal framework

         Invest in transportation infrastructure and preventive maintenance and establish formal
          requirements for new infrastructure design with respect to expected service life and
          disaster resilience requirements (e.g. survives 100, 200, 500 wind, flood, seismic event)

         Advance and adopt risk reduction-based building codes and strengthen training and
          enforcement

         Identify capacity gaps and provide tailored training for staff in key ministries in disaster risk
          management and response

         Install additional meteorological and stream gauging stations at a density to accommodate
          engineering scale analysis for design and planning

         Strengthen disaster monitoring and early warning systems

         Continue and expand public education with respect to hazard avoidance, particularly with
          respect to flood awareness

         Provide engineering and non-engineering solutions for vulnerable embankments in the
          upper watershed
