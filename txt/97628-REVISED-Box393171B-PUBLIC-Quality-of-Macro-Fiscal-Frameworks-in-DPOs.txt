Overview
This paper is part of a series of Learning Products (LP) that primarily synthesize existing
evaluative material with the aim of gaining new insight into the effectiveness and design of
development policies and interventions supported by the Bank from an operational perspective.
In this series the focus of the LP is on factors that influence design, policy implementation, and
performance of Development Policy Operations (DPOs). This particular report aims to assess
the quality of the macro-fiscal frameworks in DPOs using a variety of methods (portfolio
review, case studies, and statistical analysis) to derive insights, lessons, and good practices that
could inform the future design of DPOs.1

  For the purpose of this analysis, we adopt the following operational definitions rooted in Operations Policy and
Country Services (OPCS) guidance and regulations and operational practice. Adequacy refers to the statutory
requirement that DPOs must have a macro-fiscal framework that meets certain minimum quality requirements in
three dimensions: internal consistency, credibility, and debt sustainability (OPCS, September 2013). Quality refers to
the degree to which different building blocks of macro-fiscal frameworks—consistency, credibility, and
sustainability––can be assessed as having different levels of strength upon careful inspection and analysis. For the
purpose of this analysis, consistency is defined in terms of completeness of macro-fiscal frameworks, coherence
between objectives and measures, and realism. Credibility refers to the government’s track record with macro-fiscal
management in the previous three years as well as the realism of its fiscal program. And sustainability refers to
completeness and quality of the medium-term fiscal and debt analysis.


2The percent of DPOs closed in FY2011-13 that are rated by the IEG as moderately unsatisfactory or lower was 24
percent. By contrast, the percent of all individual DPOs in the 15 case studies (including several DPO series) rated
by the IEG as moderately unsatisfactory or lower was 31.5 percent.

1. Introduction
1.1    The report is part of a series of learning products4 with limited objectives geared
towards synthesizing existing knowledge as well as learning and gaining new insights
into the factors that influence design, policy implementation, and performance of
Development Policy Loans. It aims to provide fresh insights and build on previous
evaluations of Bank investment projects and research and analytical work (e.g., Recent
Independent Evaluation Group [IEG] work on Development Policy Operations [DPOs]
includes the evaluation of Poverty Reduction Support Credits [PRSCs] [2010], Financial
Crisis Evaluations I and II [which examined crisis DPOs], recent Operations Policy and
Country Services [OPCS] DPO Retrospectives, and new research presented in this
report on aspects of DPOs using a combination of approaches.).

1.2  All DPOs are expected to include an adequate design of a macro-fiscal/budgetary
framework.

“The Bank undertakes development policy lending in a country only when it has determined that
the country’s macroeconomic policy framework is appropriate. The release of each tranche
requires the maintenance of an appropriate macroeconomic policy framework. For development
policy lending to a subnational entity, the state or region must have an appropriate expenditure
program, as well as appropriate fiscal arrangements with the central government. (OP 8.60).”

1.3    An adequate macro-framework is typically a key condition of Board presentation
in one or another form of a specific prior action. Importantly, as noted in OP 8.60, it is
also expected that an adequate macro-framework will be maintained following Board
approval and disbursement of a DPO (in the case of single-tranche DPOs) and this
expectation is sometimes formalized in explicit triggers (in the case of programmatic
series or multi-tranche DPOs). The last OPCS DPO retrospective noted that the quality
of macro frameworks in some DPOs was lacking (see box 2.1). But the quality of
macroframeworks in DPOs alone has not been the subject of in-depth study. This report

  The Learning Products (LP) are IEG informal analytical products, which primarily synthesize existing evaluative material with the
aim of gaining new insight into the effectiveness and design of development policies and interventions supported by the Bank
from an operational perspective. This learning product series consists of complementary products covering salient areas
identified in the 2012 DPO retrospective and in recent discussions of DPO evaluations held jointly between OPCS and IEG. The
main evaluative questions relate to the overall effectiveness of DPOs and factors influencing their design and performance. The
learning products are organized around several thematic tasks: (i) Adequacy, quality, and risks in DPO macro-fiscal frameworks;
(ii) the role of knowledge on Public Expenditure Reviews (PERs) and public resource allocation in DPOs; (iii) results frameworks in
DPOs; (iv) environmental and social risks in DPOs; (v) political economy analysis (PEA) and related factors influencing the
performance of DPOs; and (vi) the influence of core poverty diagnostics on DPO design and outcomes. The first four tasks are be
delivered in FY15 and the remaining ones are planned for FY16. At that time, a synthesis/capstone report will be prepared with
main findings and lessons from the learning product series.

macro-fiscal frameworks in DPOs, and (ii) a comprehensive database of project level
DPOs and related country and economic policy and statistical information, which is a
byproduct of the study.

2. What is the adequacy and quality of macro-
fiscal frameworks in DPOs?
2.1    For the purpose of this analysis, we adopt the following operational definitions
rooted in the Operations Policy and Country Services (OPCS) guidance and regulations
and operational practice. Adequacy refers to the statutory requirement that
Development Policy Operations (DPOs) must have macro-fiscal framework that meets
certain minimum quality requirements in three dimensions: internal consistency,
credibility, and debt sustainability (OPCS, September 2013). Quality refers to the degree
to which different building blocks of macro-fiscal frameworks can be assessed as having
different levels of strength upon careful inspection and analysis. While all DPOs must
meet minimum adequacy requirements, the quality of the building blocks and the
overall macro frameworks may vary and there can be weaknesses that may not be
always obvious in an ex-ante binary, statutory assessment of adequacy. Identifying and
improving upon such weaknesses would help contribute to the better design and
success of DPOs.

2.2    Consistency, broadly speaking, refers to the degree of correspondence between
policy objectives (e.g., macroeconomic stability and sustained growth) and policy
instruments (primarily fiscal [tax, expenditure] and monetary-exchange policies) as well
as the mix of financing. A consistent program should be complete with sufficient detail,
internally coherent, and realistic.

2.3     Where there is an International Monetary Fund (IMF) program in place, the IMF
assessment in program reviews provides a key input into the World Bank team’s
assessment, but the Bank team should make its own assessment (OP 8.60, footnote 4). In
cases where there are disagreements over technical or policy issues, Bank and IMF
teams are expected to discuss and reach agreement over any differences of opinion and
coordinate their policy dialogue. This is facilitated by regular consultations between the
Bank and IMF teams and an explicit understanding on the thematic division of labor on
macroeconomic and structural issues in each country. However, when there is no IMF
program in place, the Bank team’s independent assessment is central. In such cases, the
IMF may be asked for a “letter of comfort” providing its own view of the
macroeconomic policies, but such letters are typically much shorter and less detailed
than IMF program reviews (IMF 2003). Hence the Bank team’s assessment remains
critical.

2.4   Credibility is important for program implementation and success. It reflects the
degree to which the government’s actions are trusted to be executed in line with


                                                                                         3
pronouncements. Trust in pronouncement is a function of the past track record. A
credible program of reforms has a better chance of success because it encourages more
desirable and predictable responses of economic agents. Short-term credibility,
however, can unwind over a longer period: exchange rate-based stabilizations often
result in temporary expansions of activity followed by a likely slump later on, for
example (Vegh 2010).5 This, too, is related to the government’s past track record with
policy reform. Also, whether or not the government aims at a realistic scale and
structure of fiscal adjustment affects credibility. Finally, the IMF program, with its
discipline, constraints on macro-fiscal management, and incentives for compliance, can
add to credibility. So track record, the realism of the fiscal program, and the presence of
the IMF can help strengthen credibility.

2.5     Sustainability—debt sustainability in particular--is a critical element of the
adequacy and quality of the macro-fiscal framework. It is assessed through the standard
metrics of fiscal and debt sustainability analysis (DSA). An adequate macro-fiscal
framework, therefore, must include a medium-term fiscal framework consistent with at
least stabilizing or declining debt-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratios, all backed by
a consistent and credible fiscal program. In addition, sustainable fiscal measures are
durable or difficult to reverse. For example, a temporary, deep cut in public sector
wages or pensions may be an expedient way to reduce the deficit in the short term, but
it might prove politically and socially unsustainable. By contrast, a more gradual pace
of public sector wage/pension adjustments coupled with difficult but longer-term
public sector compensation and pension reform might prove both fiscally and socially
more sustainable. So the assessment of the quality of the macro-fiscal framework will
need to take into account each of these elements (OP8.60, February 2012, revised July
2014).


    Box 2.1. Issues and Recommendations in the 2012 OPCS Three-Year DPO Retrospective
    Results: Enhance the focus on sustainable results. For the most part, DPOs have been
    relatively successful in the achievement of development outcomes and quality appears to be
    holding despite increased volumes. But there are variations across regions with Europe and
    Central Asia having the largest number of DPOs rated satisfactorily by the Independent
    Evaluation Group (IEG) (South Asia and Europe and Central Asia, if the highly satisfactory
    bar is adopted) and the Middle East and North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa having the
    lowest numbers. Programmatic DPOs tend to perform better than standalone DPOs.


5 For example, if a government announces a blanket deposit insurance scheme in the middle of a currency crisis and
deposit outflows without adequate upfront measures and detailed communication to the public, it is not likely to
stem the crisis; in fact, it may aggravate it. By contrast, a well thought out and communicated plan with critical
upfront actions and timetable of further actions which also convinces the public that the government has the
resources, resolve, and intention to deliver on the promised deposit insurance has a much better chance of success.

    Economic policy/public sector/poverty/macro DPOs have also performed better than
    sectoral DPOs. The quality of results frameworks improved compared with the previous
    retrospective with most DPOs having results indicators with clear baselines and end-of-series
    targets, and a lower number of indicators showing greater selectivity. Despite this progress,
    there is room to improve links between policies and results and assess the long-term impacts
    of DPOs. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems increasingly rely on country systems but
    only a few DPOs include assessments of strengths and weaknesses of country M&E systems.
    Risks and opportunities. The Bank will need to establish standard risk assessment
    frameworks for DPOs. The Bank has heavily weighted governance and fiduciary risks in the
    decision to extend DPOs so that a larger share of DPO commitments went to better fiduciary
    and governance performers. Also, countries with stronger governance and fiduciary systems
    received a larger share of financing in DPOs compared to investment lending. Where
    governance and fiduciary risks were high, the Bank addressed these issues in the policy
    framework and prior actions as measured by the actions devoted to these areas. There is a
    need to strengthen the quality of macroeconomic assessments. The Bank requires that the
    macroeconomic framework be consistent with a clear statement of its adequacy.
    Reforms. It is recommended to mainstream Policy-Based Guarantees (PBGs) into the
    operational policy framework governing DPOs (OP 8.60). OPCS will present to the Board a
    modernized policy on guarantees, including the extension of PBGs to International
    Development Association (IDA)-only countries with a low risk of debt distress and adequate
    debt management. Also, the Bank will seek to improve the effectiveness of DPOs under Joint
    Budget Support (JBS) partnerships.

2.6     An adequate macro-framework that passes the basic requirements may be of
varying quality. Consistency may be adequate, but fiscal measures may lack sufficient
detail-raising questions about the realism of the fiscal program. The track record may be
solid, but the scale of fiscal adjustment may raise doubts about credibility. And basic
debt sustainability analysis (DSA) may be reported but not in sufficient detail or with
sensitivity analysis to account for likely shocks. So the macro-fiscal framework may be
adequate, but not “robust” enough in that it fails to account for relevant risks (OPCS
2012 retrospective). A variety of macro, sectoral, and micro risks could derail the
implementation of macro frameworks and the broader DPO-supported reforms.6




6As part of a background analysis, relevant Bank policy regulations and OPCS guidelines (OP/BP 8.60) have been
reviewed. Where possible, insights from in-depth Project Performance Assessment Reports (PPAR) were used (e.g.,
Tanzania, Vietnam, and Uganda). A number of OPCS documents (e.g., OP/BP 8.60; OPCS 2013; OPCS DPO
Academy materials; DPO retrospective 2012, OPCS Guidance Note on macroeframeworks, 2013), IEG (e.g.,
Evaluation of PRSCs 2010; Crisis DPOs, Independent Evaluation Office (IEO) of the IMF, and research studies (e.g.,
Moll, Geli, and Saavedra 2015; Geli, Kraay, and Nabokht 2014; Smets and Knack 2014; Dobronogov, Gelb and
Saldanha 2014; Denizer, Kaufmann and Kraay 2011; Dreher et al. 2010; Bogetic et al. 2010; Ossowsky 2014) relevant

3. Questions and analytical approaches
3.1       The three overarching questions in this paper are:

         What has been the quality of macro-fiscal frameworks and its building blocks?
         What factors may be related to the quality of macro-fiscal frameworks and the
          success of DPOs?
         What good practices can be identified that may provide lessons for the future
          design and implementation of DPO macro-fiscal frameworks?

3.2       We approach these questions using an eclectic analytical approach combining:

         elements of a portfolio review of DPOs with particular focus on the
          aforementioned dimensions of macro-fiscal frameworks and their links to macro-
          fiscal policy reforms supported under DPOs,
         a comparative review based on 15 case studies providing deeper narratives of
          the quality and factors that influence the design and implementation of macro
          frameworks and their contribution to DPO performance, and
         preliminary statistical analysis to understand the macroeconomic framework-
          related correlates of success of DPOs, as well as the correlates of the quality of
          macro-fiscal framework itself.

3.3    Insights from these analyses were triangulated and conclusions were drawn.
This includes some thoughts toward improving the design and implementation of
macro-fiscal frameworks in future DPOs as well as questions for further research.

3.4    The target pool of DPOs and the periodicity under study is the following: first,
all DPOs that were closed and had an Implementation Completion Report (ICR) review
during FY05-13—a total of 390 DPOs—were included in the database of basic
characteristics of DPOs. This pool of DPOs and related data are used in the preliminary
portfolio review and statistical analysis. Second, closer attention was paid to the 46
DPOs that closed and had ICR reviews completed in FY11-13. About a third of these
recent DPOs (15 in total) were selected for in-depth, desk-based country case studies to
uncover deeper country-level and project-level narratives and elements of good practice
(and weakness) in the quality of macro frameworks. Case studies were non-randomly
selected from the pool of the most recent, 46 DPOs that were closed and evaluated in
FY2011-13 to reflect diversity of DPOs in terms of programmatic and standalone DPOs,
multi-sector and sector DPOs, and DPOs reflecting all world regions. A comprehensive
Independent Evaluation Group DPO database was developed for this purpose and it
informed this learning product and other DPO learning products in the series.


                                                                                           7
4. DPOs and macro-fiscal frameworks: A basic
portfolio view
4.1  This section provides a basic portfolio review of Development Policy Operations
(DPOs) analyzed in this learning product. It focuses on the following main elements:

       A general review of trends in volumes and numbers of DPOs, as well as their
        country/income groupings (International Bank for Reconstruction and
        Development [IBRD], International Development Association [IDA], Blend) and
        regional focus.
       A review of the policy and thematic focus of DPOs as reflected in their prior
        actions.
       A review of basic metrics of the integration of macro-fiscal topics and prior
        actions in DPOs.


Trends in the volumes, numbers, IBRD/IDA, and geography of DPOs
4.2     Method. For identification purposes, the detailed Bank project theme report was
downloaded and customized from Business Warehouse in August 2014 (2c.2.1 lines).
Only DPOs were retained from the database. Independent Evaluation Group (IEG)
Implementation Completion Report (ICR) Review outcome ratings were merged and
matched with the DPO database. Observations for DPOs without an IEG validation
were dropped. Based on this selection process, 390 DPOs were identified for the period
of 2004-2013. Next, a database of prior actions was received from Operations Policy and
Country Services (OPCS), matching 387 of the 390 DPOs identified through Business
Warehouse. Thematic codes were further reviewed manually by IEG and broken down
into a few subtopics to improve the granularity of the analysis of macroeconomic
management issues in DPOs. Two main limitations apply to the underlying data. First,
administrative data for a given project are typically recorded at an early stage of
preparation, and the record is unlikely to be changed even if there may be significant
changes later on. While the thematic focus of projects is typically expected to remain
robust from preparation and concept to board approval, this may have led to some
inaccuracies when the project focus was significantly changed during preparation.
Second, the number of observations for recent years is significantly lower, as there has
been a delay in the review of closed projects. The latter is also related to technical
problems in transferring ICRs to IEG for review.




                                                                                       8
4.3     Volumes, numbers, and regional distribution. Two Regions, Europe and
Central Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean have received the most DPO lending
commitments in terms of volume (almost $18 billion each). Most were IBRD countries.
This is followed by East Asia and the Pacific, which has proportionately more IDA
countries. Next is the Africa Region, with mostly IDA countries.7

4.4     In terms of number of DPOs, the Africa Region has the more DPO operations
than any other Region, partly reflecting the large number of countries. The average size
of the DPO (in terms of US$) in the Africa Region, however, is significantly lower than
that of other Regions, reflecting the comparatively smaller size of African economies
and their absorptive capacity (figure 4.1).

2004-2013)




Source: IEG DPO database.

4.5    The average lending amount for IDA countries has remained largely constant
over time, but the lending amount increased dramatically for IBRD countries in the late
2000s. This increase was a result of the global financial crisis when DPOs were used as a
countercyclical instrument in IBRD countries. The reversal of these trends in 2012 and
2013 may simply reflect the low number of observations (low number of operations
closed and reviewed) and should be viewed with caution (figure 4.2).




7There were two recipient executed trust funds (RETFs). One in Rwanda (2010) and one Burkina Faso (2012), and
eight DPOs (e.g. West Bank and Gaza and Burundi) using the state and peace building fund (SPF). These constitute a
minor part of the portfolio, both in terms of numbers and volume.



                                                                                                                 9

4.6    The top recipients of DPO financing by volume are IBRD countries. Most notably
Mexico and Indonesia each received more than US$ 6 billion, followed by Poland and
Turkey, which received close to US$ 5 billion each. The countries that received the
largest number of DPOs were Pakistan (16 operations) and Colombia (14 operations)
(Table 4.1).

Trends in the types of DPOs
4.7  The majority of DPOs (70 percent) were managed by the Poverty Reduction and
Economic Management Network, followed by Human Development (HD) (12 percent)


10
and Sustainable Development Network (10 percent). Within PREM, most DPOs were
managed by economic policy. The Poverty (POV) and Public Sector (PS) practices each
managed 12 percent of all DPOs.

4.8    There does not appear to be substantial variation over time, regarding the
networks managing DPOs (Figure 4.3). This may reflect, on the demand side, the
thematic focus of reforms supported by DPOs, typically concentrated in economic
policy and governance issues and, on the supply side, the Bank’s institutional tendency
towards a relatively constant division of labor among networks. The notable reduction
of PREM-led DPOs from 2011 onward, however, reflects the low number of closed and
reviewed operations rather than a trend in the reduction of approvals.

operations 2004-2013)

4.9    Of the 390 DPOs, 47 percent are programmatic and 42 percent standalone. In the
early years after the OP8.60, there were substantially more programmatic DPOs than
single tranche. After 2008, there has been a steady increase in standalone operations. (12
percent were prior to OP8.60).

4.10 Programmatic DPOs appear to have performed better in terms of IEG ratings
than standalone operations between 2005 and 2008. Thereafter, performance was
relatively equal. About 80 percent of all DPOs were rated moderately satisfactory or
above.




                                                                                           11
4.11 Most DPOs were multi-sector operations (they could be programmatic or
standalone), but single-sector operations seem to be increasing. The metric used to
identify the sectoral focus of DPOs in the IEG DPO database used here is the following:
a DPO is coded for a single sector and 75 percent or more were identified as such.

4.12 Multi-sector DPOs have been performing better than single sector DPOs over the
years. The exception years are 2004 and 2006, which appear to be outliers. The trends in
these DPOs is displayed in figure 4.4.

Trends in the policy focus of DPOs: prior actions
4.13 The average number of prior actions fell from 16 to nine between 2004 and 2008.
This is in line with the OPCS guidance on simplification, reducing the number and
increasing concreteness, relevance, and quality of prior actions. After 2008, the average
number has stabilized between eight and 10 (Figure 4.5).

(43.5 percent), followed by financial and private sector development (18.3 percent), and

these systematically against protocol. These themes are clustered and summarized in

public expenditure, financial management, and procurement is by far the largest
category (23.6 percent), followed by tax policy and administration (4.4 percent), and
macroeconomic management (2.9 percent). Other prior actions include administrative
and civil service reform (7.7 percent), regulation and competition policy (7.0 percent),
and education for all (5.3 percent) (figure 4.6).

4.16 Given the majority of PREM-managed, multi-sector operations, the
comparatively small number of macro-fiscal actions and tax policy and administration
(2.9 percent and 4.4 percent of all prior actions) is unusual. While macro and tax-related
prior actions are few as a share of the total, they are better distributed by projects. In
macro, 90 out of 387 projects contain at least one prior action, which is equivalent to 23
percent. Similarly 110 DPOs contain at least one prior action in tax policy and
administration, an equivalent of 28 percent of all operations. Almost half of all
operations (45 percent) have either macro or tax policy as one prior action. About 70
percent of all operations containing macro actions were managed by PREM. Operations
that do not have such prior actions may reflect the fact that the Bank left many of the
critical macro and tax policy measures to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
programs. Only in four instances was cross conditionality with the IMF reported in the
entire set of macro prior actions.

4.17 The implementation of an adequate macroeconomic framework, or a close
derivative (e.g., PFM), was most frequently used as a macro-economic prior action. Of
all prior actions with macro-fiscal and PFM content, some 69 percent of prior actions
targeted broad maintenance of sound macroeconomic policy, followed by 27 percent of
macro-fiscal actions specifically targeting the budget (e.g., submission of the budget or


14
its amendment) and 19 percent targeted concrete expenditure policy measures. Tax
policy is covered in large part under tax policy and administration (see figure 4.6), and
is thus not well represented in measures classified as macro-fiscal. However, a
preliminary inspection of the tax policy and administration of prior actions suggest
relative paucity of tax policy and dominance of administration measures. More than
half of public expenditure policy actions targeted the medium term expenditure
framework (MTEF) explicitly, reflecting the focus of DPOs on medium-term
expenditure allocation and management issues.

4.18 In terms of the nature of macro-fiscal prior actions, most relate to the policy
implementation (75 percent). Prior actions that are documentary (e.g. the Ministry of
Finance has issued a report) were 21 percent. Legislative reform (e.g., preparing,
submitting, or passing of a bill) account for 10 percent of all macro-fiscal actions (table
4.3).

4.19 Given that many DPOs target substantial fiscal adjustments, the relative absence
of explicit prior actions on tax policy is puzzling and requires further study. It may be
that detailed tax policy dialogue and conditionality is left to the IMF, even though tax
policy is a shared thematic area of responsibility between the Bank and the IMF. It may
also be that some of the tax policy measures are part of the package of other prior
actions targeting an “adequate budgetary framework” or a “sound macroeconomic
policy framework.” The scope, structure, and the role of tax policy in DPOs and in
relation to the IMF would be a worthwhile extension of this analysis.

Consistency in the macro-fiscal framework
4.20 Method. The program documents for 174 of the 390 operations (45 percent) were
reviewed and assessed for consistency, a key element of quality of the macro-fiscal
framework. This sample, chosen for practical reasons and the time constraint,
significantly exceeds the usually required size of the random sample. The focus was on
the macroeconomic framework and debt sustainability parts of the program documents.
The team developed a 5-point scale (1 for low, 5 for high) to code independently for the
degree of consistency of the macro-fiscal framework. The program documents of these
operations were screened for the completeness of the basic macro-fiscal framework,
detail and coherence between macro-fiscal objectives and fiscal measures, and coverage
of other elements of the macro-framework including the external sector, monetary
exchange, and, especially debt sustainability. A score of 5 was allocated to operations
with a detailed, in-depth, macroeconomic outlook, with clear and credible links
between macro-fiscal objectives and detailed measures, and debt sustainability
assessment across all of the above dimensions, and a score of 1 was given to operations
where completeness was clearly lacking in a major or several dimensions of the macro-
fiscal framework. The mid-point of 3 was given to operations showing solid consistency
in terms of basic requirements.

4.21 Results. Using this approach, the results show that the consistency of the macro-
fiscal framework was solid, rated 3 or better, for the majority of operations. This is
reassuring as the majority of operations pass this independent test of consistency of the
macro-fiscal framework. It suggests that the operational framework and review
processes work well in screening for the quality of the macro-fiscal framework in most
operations. The average score was 3.4. While the mid-point (3) was most frequent (28
percent), this was closely followed by DPOs with substantial (25percent) or high (21
percent) levels of consistency. About 22 percent of operations scored modestly (rating
2), typically showing weakness in one important area of the macro-fiscal framework.
This analysis is agnostic about whether these DPOs have adequate macro-fiscal
frameworks in the statutory sense. There may be other reasons (including, for example,
paucity of data, the emergency nature of the operation, etc.) that may justify these
weaknesses. But this independent review focusing on the overall and relative quality
identifies certain weaknesses, which could be addressed in future operations. Such
weaknesses, for example, include the absence of sufficiently detailed measures in
support of the macro-fiscal objectives; weak revenue performance not matched by tax
policy or administration measures; or debt sustainability analysis that is insufficiently
detailed. Only 4 percent of operations show negligible consistency (rating 1). By
Regions, East Asia and the Pacific stands out with an exceptional number of operations
with a high consistency rating (38 percent). However, there are DPOs across the



16
spectrum of the consistency index in all the Regions. Table 4.4 provides a detailed
breakdown by Regions and scores.

4.22 This measure of consistency shows improvement over time. There has been a
steady and significant increase in the share of operations scoring 3 or above over the
years using this metric. Only in 2012 there appears to be somewhat of a decline, but this
may reflect the small sample size and this would need to be checked when more recent
operations are included in the updated analysis.

4.23 Beneath this aggregate measure, there is considerable variation over time.
Between 2005 and 2007, significantly more operations had lower consistency. This trend
was reversed in 2008. Between 2008 and 2011, more operations scored exceptional
consistency than those below the mid-point score. In 2012, the shares converged. The
share of operations with a mid-point (3) consistency score remained relatively constant
in comparison (see figure 4.7).

5. Insights from Desk Reviews of 15 Recent
DPO Case Studies
5.1    This section draws some initial conclusion on the adequacy of the
macroeconomic and fiscal framework from a set of 15 Development Policy Operations
(DPOs)—or series—in 14 countries, which were closed and had an Implementation
Completion Report (ICR) review in FY11-13. This represents a third of all DPOs in this
period having been closed and reviewed. Eight of the 15 operations reviewed were part
of a DPO series, while the rest were standalone operations. The DPOs reviewed are
presented in table 5.1.

5.2    The case studies were selected to reflect a variety of different types of DPOs. The
sample includes all World Bank Regions; International Development Association (IDA)
and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) countries;
programmatic and standalone DPOs; and a variety of multisector and sectoral DPOs,
including, for example, “green growth,” infrastructure, and social safety net DPOs.

5.3    The case studies are desk review exercises. They evaluate the following questions
organized around the four thematic building blocks corresponding to specific DPO
learning products: (i) macro-fiscal framework, (ii) the role of knowledge on public
expenditure and resource allocation, (iii) knowledge on poverty, and (iv) environmental
and social risks.




                                                                                             20
5.4     The documentary evidence reviewed comes primarily from the key project,
project validation, and project evaluation documents and related, strategic and
International Monetary Fund (IMF) documents: the program document (PD), the ICR,
ICR reviews (ICRRs), Public Expenditure Reviews (PERs), and Poverty Assessments
(PA), if they were available. As secondary sources of evidence, the country case studies
(CCS) reviewed the IMF Article IV consultation, Country Economic Memorandums
(CEMs), and any other relevant strategic analytical work, such as Country Partnership
Strategies (CPSs) or Poverty and Social Impact Analyses (PSIAs).

5.5    This analysis below synthesizes insights from these case studies focused on the
consistency, credibility, and sustainability of the macro-fiscal framework.


Main messages
5.6    Overall, the macro-fiscal frameworks presented in DPO desk reviews are broadly
adequate. Basic macro frameworks in most cases appear consistent, credible, and
sustainable based on the facts presented in the program document as well as related
evidence reviewed (e.g., IMF reports, detailed debt sustainability analysis).

5.7     In most cases, the macro-fiscal framework is highly aligned with the IMF and
related strategic lending and analytic and advisory activities (AAA). This includes IMF
program documents or Article IV consultations, as well nonlending technical assistance
(NLTA), economic and sector work (ESW), and other AAA relevant work (a good
example is the Peru DPO). From the 15 DPOs reviewed, this overall conclusion holds
for the majority of the cases (13 cases). In these cases, the macro framework presented in
the program document is consistent with the data presented, as well as with the IMF
program documents or Article IV evaluation of the economy (e.g., Peru, St. Lucia,
Indonesia, Latvia, Poland, and Romania), reflecting collaboration of Bank and IMF
teams (IMF and World Bank, 2011). In many cases, macroeconomic targets are broadly
realistic and consistent with the main measures designed to achieve them (good
examples are Peru and Romania).

5.8    At the same time, some weaknesses in the quality of macro frameworks are
identified in a few operations. Three broad types of weaknesses are highlighted: (i) the
ambitiousness of macro-fiscal frameworks in some standalone operations and links
between objectives and fiscal measures, (ii) the credibility of the framework in view of
the track record, political economy factors, or institutional fiscal rules, and (iii)
robustness of the debt sustainability analysis.

       For example, in some cases, the targets seem to be disjointed in terms of the
        level of ambition in objectives and timing of what the operation is supporting.


                                                                                          21
         In standalone operations with multiple objectives, for example, overly ambitious
         macro targets are hard to achieve within the time envisaged (e.g., St. Lucia). In
         other cases, fiscal measures in support of objectives are not sufficiently
         articulated or left implicit.
        In terms of the credibility of the macro and fiscal frameworks presented in the
         program documents, a strong track record of fiscal prudence and an existing
         robust institutional framework, such as fiscal rules, tend to coincide with a
         better ability to advance reforms while keeping the finances in good shape (e.g.
         Mexico, Poland, Peru, and St. Lucia). But rules alone do not guarantee
         compliance (e.g., Albania). Credibility is generally greater when the government
         has both a positive track record of strong fiscal measures, and the IMF financial
         support is in place (e.g. Indonesia, Romania, and Latvia). Risks are sometimes
         generic and not sufficiently tailored to the policy content of the DPO or macro-
         fiscal situations described therein.
        Sustainability analyses generally present credible baseline scenarios that result
         in the stabilizing or declining of debt-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratios. In
         most cases, it is accompanied by a useful scenario analysis showing sensitivity
         of the baseline debt trajectory in response to growth and interest rate shocks, for
         example. A question of robustness, however, could be raised in some cases
         where there is a lack of complete or clear sensitivity analysis or consideration of
         various quasi-fiscal risks (e.g., government guarantees, state-owned enterprises,
         implicit subsidies), which may jeopardize sustainability.


Weak and strong elements of macro-fiscal frameworks
5.9   Beyond these general conclusions, there are specific examples where the
elements of quality in macro-fiscal frameworks could be improved.

        For example, the mere presence of fiscal rules does not guarantee compliance or
         the implementation of prudent fiscal policy. When fiscal rules are in place but
         the borrower government has not shown a strong track record of following its
         own fiscal rule legislation, the macro framework could still lack credibility. In
         these cases, prior actions and triggers could reflect the need to ensure
         implementation of the existing legislation, ensure corrective action in the case of
         non-compliance with the rules, or strengthen the relevant institutions (e.g.
         Albania, Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil and Romania). The latter could be done via
         complementary, targeted technical assistance.
        Additionally, governments’ conflicting objectives may create difficult tradeoffs
         in terms of fiscal management during implementation and can be a cause of
         weaknesses in macro-fiscal frameworks. “Austerity” versus protection of the


22
    poor is a case in point. For example, improving public sector governance and
    management based on cutting waste and increasing taxes—as key elements in
    fiscal consolidations—may conflict with the need to improve the effectiveness of
    social safety nets, protect the poor, and combat poverty, which could call for
    higher, pro-poor government expenditures. If such policy trade-offs are not
    explicit with measures aiming to strike an appropriate balance, policy objectives
    and measures might be in conflict. Furthermore, the reasons why the
    government may find it difficult to strike an appropriate balance here tends to
    be highly political or related to political economy. A party in power may rely on
    votes of the public sector whose salaries and pensions have increased and the
    government may find it politically difficult or impossible to control public sector
    salaries and shift the composition of public expenditures towards the poor. So
    the political economy behind these objectives play an important role and should
    be further studied. Also, some important reforms may not be addressed due to
    the alignment of reforms with elections and this could be playing a key role in
    the design and quality of the reform agenda. These issues of the links between
    the DPOs, their performance, and political economy might require further
    study, but are outside the scope of this analysis.
   Another example of problems in the design of macro frameworks is that some of
    the risks and vulnerabilities are not considered adequately. Improving the
    treatment of risk in macro frameworks has been identified as an issue in the
    2012 DPO Retrospective. So this is an area for continued attention. Such risks
    may be external—for example, a high dependency on external accounts, a
    significant reliance on tourism and foreign direct investment, and exposure to
    natural disasters. This vulnerabilities affect the probability of success in
    implementing fiscal measures and the overall sustainability of the macro
    framework. Risks may be policy related but not adequately taken into account
    (e.g., measures to freeze or reduce public sector employment without taking
    account of potential increases in public sector wages or measures to reduce
    wages but nothing on employment). Finally, there may be internal Bank
    pressures to prepare the loan rapidly, perhaps due to the financial crisis, which
    results in elements of the macro-framework not being fully articulated (e.g.,
    Cote d’Ivoire, Tunisia, and St. Lucia); this may especially be the case in
    standalone or single-tranche operations.
   In the reviewed case studies, close collaboration with IMF seems to be
    associated with the better design of macro frameworks. But there is a question
    whether the Bank should do more in linking macro-fiscal frameworks to its own
    prior actions. The analysis in the program documents and IMF information,
    program, and Article IV consultations, are typically consistent in terms of
    priorities and challenges. In many cases, where an IMF program is present,


                                                                                    23
         however, several macro prior actions or structural reforms affecting fiscal
         sustainability are left for IMF to address, while the Bank program is silent (e.g.,
         Benin, Latvia, and Romania). In other cases, prior actions are linked with the
         medium-term expenditure policy agenda through formulation or
         implementation of medium-term expenditure frameworks.
        In cases where there is no IMF program or evidence of direct, substantial
         collaboration with IMF, weaknesses appear in certain elements of the macro-
         fiscal frameworks. For example, in Tunisia, the Bank’s operation supported the
         expansion of several programs without a proper fiscal sustainability analysis
         and regard for economic vulnerabilities that the country might face in the near
         future. Similarly, in Brazil’s Rio Grande do Sul, the operation showed some
         inconsistencies between the measures supported and the apparently over-
         optimistic fiscal projection. The macro framework and track record in this case
         appear not to be strong enough or credible to validate the projections.

5.10 In what follows, we divide the case studies into three groups for more granular
views of strengths and weaknesses of the DPOs reviewed: DPOs of countries in the
middle of a fiscal crisis (mainly fiscal DPOs), DPOs combining multiple fiscal and
structural objectives, and, finally, DPOs with a mostly sectoral focus.

5.11 The quality of the links between macro-fiscal design and the reform agenda and
prior actions of these operations are mixed. The lack of structural depth in the measures
supported in the Brazil Rio Grande do Sul operation resulted in a disconnect between
the severity of the problem and the actions taken. Several of the actions taken were
administrative initiatives of narrow technical character and easily reversible,
compromising credibility and sustainability of the reforms. The passage of key pension
reform legislation did not result in a much needed legislation to contain public
expenditures. According to the ICRR, progress in social security, civil administration,
and results-based management were at best mixed. The ICRR rating of this operation
was moderately satisfactory.

5.12 In the Romania DPO, design of the macro framework was particularly strong
and comprehensive. The program document identified several of the sources of fiscal
imbalance, however, several of the issues raised were left in the charge of the IMF
program. Prior actions selected in the operation lacked institutional depth, and were



                                                                                                                                                            25
easily reversible, thus hurting the credibility of the reforms in terms of the macro and
fiscal sustainability (e.g., ordinances on wages, developing a medium term expenditure
framework to be eventually passed by parliament, etc.). On one hand, coordinating
with IMF seems like a positive and desired feature of multilateral action. On the other,
lack of significant reforms such as civil service reform or strengthening the institutions
related to enforcing the fiscal rule could be seen as a missed opportunity for the Bank.
Nevertheless the ICR and ICRR rated the operation as satisfactory.

5.13 In Tunisia and Cote d’Ivoire, the operations (both standalone DPOs) took place
as emergency operations aimed to provide budget support to the interim government
and in a post conflict situation respectively. Both countries lacked strong institutions
and track records, and needed support to carry out social sector programs (in Tunisia)
and reestablish economic functions (Cote d’Ivoire). In the case of Tunisia, the budget
support was not accompanied with a proper sustainability analysis. Additionally, no
prior actions on the fiscal side were selected, and the fact that there was no IMF
program in place is worrisome in terms of fiscal sustainability after the loans have been
disbursed and spent. A programmatic series in Tunisia seems better designed, but the
implementation might not have been credible because the interim government lacked
capacity to commit to medium-term reforms. Similarly, in Cote d’Ivoire, a standalone
DPO without transformative prior actions could not be expected to have deep
institutional impact on the macro-fiscal side. Even though in this case (similar to
Romania) many structural reforms were left to the IMF program to deal with, the
Bank’s PAs selected did have not sufficient strength to advance significant reforms. The
ICR and ICRR rated the operation in Cote d’Ivoire as moderately satisfactory.

5.14 Next is a group of DPOs with mixed fiscal and structural objectives. This may
make it difficult to formulate consistent macro-fiscal programs as was the case with
Benin, for example. On the other hand, when there are strong institutions and track
records (e.g., Peru), such a DPO can be well designed and implemented.

5.15 In terms of the adequacy of the macro-fiscal framework in DPOs that had both
fiscal and sectoral reforms supported, three out of four operations (Indonesia, St. Lucia,
and Peru) presented a consistent and strong discussion of the macro situation. They
tackle how the global crisis generated new challenges in terms of fiscal sustainability
and presented consistent and credible analysis. Benin, on the other hand, did not
present a strong and credible macro framework, in particular due to the short-term
nature of the analysis focusing only on two years. Additionally, the program document
of the Benin operation did not discuss some of the most important issues affecting fiscal
sustainability, such as civil service reform, which was identified by IMF. Also, three
operations did include a number of fiscal prior actions and triggers in support of the


                                                                                                                                                                  27
DPL (Peru, St. Lucia, and Benin), while Indonesia did not include a particular PA on the
fiscal side.

5.16 While these three countries included fiscal-related PA, institutional depth of the
supporting prior action varies significantly between these operations.

5.17 Peru presents a good practice. A strong program, with a well-articulated macro
framework, listing in a logical manner all the reform steps needed to strengthen the
fiscal position. It must be acknowledged that Peru started from a very robust fiscal
position, good track record, and that the country had healthy institutions in place. The
program in Peru helped further develop existing institutions and most of the loan was
of precautionary nature, helping Peru signal to the international financial markets its
policy resolve to help it weather the effects of the crisis. The fact that the Peru operation
was a series helped lengthen the dialogue with the country, permitting flexibility in the
face of shocks. On the other hand, in the St. Lucia case, a standalone operation, there
was a disconnect between the long-term nature of the reforms and the short term
horizon of the loan. Even though St. Lucia’s program document presented a thorough
macro framework and was candid about the main vulnerabilities the country is subject
to (e.g., natural disasters, high dependency on tourism, and foreign direct investment),
the prior actions selected did not address these vulnerabilities and the reform program
supported was unable to succeed in the time frame as some of the risks materialized
(i.e., Hurricane Tomas). Additionally, some of the measures supported by the operation
did not have enough institutional depth and could be easily reversed (e.g., civil service
measures). Similarly in Benin, the measures supported were easily reversible (e.g.,
audits and procurement measures).

5.18 The last group of DPOs corresponds solely to sectoral policy loans. In this group,
two operations (Poland and Mexico) had a strong macro framework, and well
organized discussion of the fiscal standing of the country. The other two operations
(Albania and Latvia) however, presented a weaker fiscal analysis. In Albania, the
operation took place in an environment of major macroeconomic risks and no IMF
program. It is, therefore, surprising that the DPO did not include explicit actions to
contain the fiscal deficit and the overall debt level, and risks mitigation measures were
insufficient and the risks finally did materialized. The standalone nature of the
operation might have contributed to the lack of further and in-depth analysis needed to
account for the possible fiscal pitfalls encountered. The rating of ICRR for Albania was
unsatisfactory (a significant downgrade from the satisfactory rating of the ICR). The
IEG evaluation argued that:



                                                                                                                                                                    29
       “While the project was responsive to country conditions and Bank strategy, its
       design did not correspond well to the program development objectives (PDO). The
       choice of lending instrument and implementation time frame were inadequate for
       achieving the objectives. The results framework would offer little guidance on
       what improvements in outcomes could be expected, and in particular how the
       outcome indicators chosen would meet the PDO” (ICRR p. 7).

5.19 In Latvia, even though macro and fiscal consideration were highly relevant in
this operation, the objective of the operation was contributing with resources mainly to
the social safety net program. In terms of fiscal and macro stability measures, the main
players were IMF and the European Commission. The operation did not incorporate
prior action sin the macro-fiscal realm. Nevertheless the operation rating in both the
ICR and ICRR was satisfactory.

5.20 Based on these case studies and the previous portfolio and consistency analyses,
it is possible to draw some tentative examples of good practices and lessons (Box 5.1).


Macro frameworks in standalone vs. programmatic series DPOs
5.21 There are other meaningful groupings that can shed light on some
commonalities between different types of budget support operations worth analyzing.
Some important differences in the macro-fiscal framework and overall robustness of the
DPO were found in standalone or single tranche versus programmatic operations.

5.22 There are two clear difference between these two types of budget support
operations when it comes to the macro-fiscal framework. First, the length of the
operation (standalone or programmatic) affects the capacity to link substantive prior
actions to significant, longer-term fiscal and macroeconomic stability results. Second,
the time spent in preparing the operation (e.g., emergency operations) could be
affecting the dialogue with the borrower country as well as the capacity of the Bank
staff to dig deeper into relevant issues regarding macro and fiscal sustainability. Third,
standalone operations tend to show some specific weaknesses.




30
 Box 5.1. Good practices in macro/fiscal framework from the case studies

    Macro-fiscal objectives should have clearly articulated measures that are realistic and
     tailored to the problem at hand. Whether or not these measures should be prior actions is
     a matter of judgment and in relation to the related IMF program.
    A strong track record is important. Good track record of prudent fiscal management and
     sustainable macro policies can be linked to a higher credibility of the macro framework. It
     also provides room for strengthening further the already in place institutions. Thus
     advancing further the fiscal sanding of the borrower country and providing the proper
     signaling to the international and internal financial markets.
     Collaboration with the IMF is important. When presenting a credible and consistent
     macro framework, most operations relied on the Fund’s Article IV consultation and debt
     sustainability analysis. Choosing prior actions identified by the IMF could also be a good
     practice that could keep consistency between the two multilaterals.
    If track record is poor and there is no IMF program, this should be a “yellow flag” in
     reviewing the quality of the macro-fiscal program. In those cases, the burden of proof
     increases on the Bank to demonstrate that macro-fiscal program is sufficiently articulated,
     consistent, credible and sustainable, and operational reviews should scrutinize those
     operations with greater attention.
    Accompanying the DPO with sufficient diagnostic work, NLTA and AAA (Public
     Expenditure Reviews) seems to pay off. Stronger macro-fiscal frameworks were found in
     countries with more diagnostic work prior to the operation.
    Adopting focused and realistic fiscal objectives can help improve macro-fiscal
     frameworks, design of prior actions and results. When the objectives are more precise and
     less ambitious, the likelihood of success improves.
    High level of borrower and Bank ownership and significant attention to the quality of
     policy dialogue is needed to increase the probability of success.

5.23 Some of the challenges of the standalone or single tranche operations reviewed
are listed below.

        In standalone operations, there is sometimes a disconnect between objectives
         and prior actions. This may be a matter of substance or timing. Significant
         reforms with institutional transformative potential take time. As a result,
         standalone operation might not be well suited to follow through on these kinds
         of reforms. (Yet, they may open the door and dialogue leading to the deeper,
         multi-year engagement). For deeper policy reforms, a programmatic series
         could help the Bank and the borrower country engage in a broader dialogue,
         longer-term reforms, and make more sustained adjustments to achieve the
         reforms objectives. This may also result in longer-term building of institutions
         and development of trust among the Bank and the country authorities.


                                                                                               31
           The standalone operations may be particularly useful in addressing narrower
            short-to-medium term or sectoral objectives and in reengagement, post-conflict,
            uncertain, and crisis situations.
           In many cases, programmatic series are also accompanied by NLTA and AAA.
           This might help both the Bank and the Government further understand the
           development challenges and adjust the operation according to the results of the
           analytical work.


 Box 5.2. Weaknesses in macro/fiscal framework from case studies

      Conflicting macro-objectives. In some cases fiscal expenditure needs to be contracted to
       reach macro balances, but at the same time the operation is supporting expansive social
       policies without paying enough attention on the sustainability of the programs.
      Inadequate accounting of external vulnerabilities and political economy risks specifically
       tailored to policy situations at hand.
      Insufficiently articulated sustainability analysis.
      Weaker macro frameworks in sectoral operations and those without IMF programs.

5.24       The following seven lessons can be drawn from the reviewed case studies:

          Good-practice macro-fiscal frameworks feature close correspondence between
           macro-fiscal objectives and the articulation of fiscal measures.
          The government’s track record can significantly influence the realism of the
           design and success of the DPOs.
          When the track record and IMF program are absent, extra time, effort and
           scrutiny is needed in preparation and review of DPOs.
          Well defined and attainable objectives within the timeframe of the operation can
           significantly influence the quality and implementation of macro-fiscal
           frameworks.
          Standalone DPOs may be usefully combined with technical assistance to assure
           sustainability of reforms and provide the borrower with further analysis on the
           reforms and their possible fiscal and macro effect in the medium and long run.
          Political economy risks could usefully be explained in the particular country
           and policy (not generic) context and linked to specific macro-fiscal reform
           program.

6. Correlates of DPO outcomes and quality and
implementation of macro-fiscal frameworks: A
preliminary statistical analysis
6.1   This section provides complementary, preliminary statistical evidence on the role
of macro-fiscal frameworks. It seeks to empirically explore two questions.

6.2     First, it aims to identify correlates of Independent Evaluation Group (IEG)
ratings as measures of the performance of Development Policy Operations (DPOs) that
may be related to the quality of the macro-fiscal frameworks as defined in this paper,
including elements of consistency, track record, credibility, and sustainability. To this
end, an index of consistency described above is combined with other indices into a
composite index of the quality of the design of macro-fiscal framework. IEG DPO
ratings are regressed on this index (and its components) and other project, country, and
external independent variables. Also developed was an index of the implementation of
the fiscal framework and used in specific regressions.

6.3    Second, the analysis aims to identify the correlates of the quality of the macro-
framework itself using a set of regressors, and to explore the links between the quality
of design and the implementation of the fiscal frameworks.

6.4    The analysis uses the data on DPOs that are closed and with IEG Implementation
Completion Report (ICR) reviews completed in the period 2004-13. All the data and
variable definitions, as well detailed statistical tables are provided in the annex. In this
summary, we highlight four main, preliminary results. They appear broadly consistent
with findings from the findings using other methods discussed above, including the
elements of the portfolio analysis, descriptive statistics of the consistency index, and
insights and lessons from the case studies.

6.5     First, summary statistics for IEG ratings of DPOs, and indices of quality of
macro-fiscal frameworks and the implementation of macro-fiscal frameworks suggest
that (i) IEG ratings of DPOs slightly worsened in the past three years compared to the
whole period of analysis, but (ii) the quality of design and implementation of macro-
fiscal frameworks improved in recent years. It is noted that the FY11-13 only include a
relatively small number of DPOs (closed and with IEG ICR ratings) compared with the
rest of the sample, which should caveat the first statistic (Table 6.1).




                                                                                           33

  value)
Note: Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test for IEG rating. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for design and implementation quality. The last row
shows the p-value from the test that compares the distribution of each variable before and after 2011. A common test of
distributions is the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, which compares the location (mean) and the shape (standard deviation) of two
distributions. The null hypothesis is no difference. This test is appropriate when the distributions are approximately normal. Since
the IEG ratings are not normally distributed, a Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test was used, which is more appropriate in this situation.
The null hypothesis is again no difference in the distributions. Whatever the test, the last row shows that the difference in the
distribution of the variable before and after 2011 is statistically significant (at p<.1 for IEG ratings, and at p<0.04 and p<0.01 for
the macro design and implementation quality, respectively).

6.6     Second, the elements of quality of the macro frameworks design are positively
correlated with the IEG ratings. In particular, ceteris-paribus, measure of track record
(“backward-looking credibility”) and the coverage of quasi-fiscal risks are statistically
significantly correlated with the IEG ratings at less than p<0.1 (Table 6.2). The first five
columns show the correlation between the five different aspects of the macro design
quality and IEG ratings, while controlling for other important factors. The last column
shows the correlation between the combined index of these five measures and the IEG
ratings. Each of the five variables is standardized to mean zero and standard deviation
one. The combined index is a simple average of the five measures (therefore also having
a mean of zero). The coefficients for each of the variables shows the effect of a one
standard deviation increase. For example, a one standard deviation increase in the
backward-looking credibility is associated with a .1 point increase in the IEG rating, on
a scale from 1 (highly unsatisfactory) to 6 (highly satisfactory). Of interest is also that
programmatic DPOs and DPOs with economic policy thematic focus are positively
correlated with IEG ratings, which in some regressions also show statistical significance.

significantly correlated with the IEG ratings (table 6.3 below), unlike in the previous
table above (table 6.2). The macro implementation quality is standardized to mean zero
and standard deviation one. The first column examines the correlation without taking
into account the quality of the macro design. The second column takes the design into
account. The coefficients for the macro implementation variable show the effect of a one
standard deviation increase.

6.8     Fourth, the table shows that the quality matters for implementation: macro
frameworks design is generally positively correlated with the macro implementation
quality (all but the macro design consistency measure) (table 6.4). The macro
implementation quality is standardized to mean zero and standard deviation one. Each
of the five variables is standardized to mean zero and standard deviation one. The
combined index is a simple average of the five measures (therefore also having a mean
of zero). First five columns show the correlation between five difference aspects of the
macro design quality and the macro implementation quality, while controlling for other
important factors. The last column shows the correlation between the combined index
of these four measures and the macro implementation quality. The coefficients for each
of the variables shows the effect of a one standard deviation increase. For example, a
one standard deviation increase in the backward-looking credibility is associated with a
.26 standard deviation increase in macro implementation quality.

Figure A-1. IEG Ratings before and after 2011




IEG ratings on average lower in the period after 2011 (middle panel) than before 2011
(left panel). The right-most panel shows the difference for each rating category. Note
that there were no "highly unsatisfactory" DPOs during the entire period 2004-2013.

Figure A-2a Macro design quality before and after 2011




Quality of the design of macro frameworks improved after 2011 (right panel) relative to
before 2011 (left panel). The macro design quality is a standardized measure with mean
zero and standard deviation

The y-axis represents the percent share of data in each bar.

Figure A-2b Macro implementation quality before and after 2011




Implementation quality also improved after 2011 (right panel) relative to before
2011.(left panel).

Note: Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test for IEG rating. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for design and implementation quality.

The table shows more formally what was presented graphically. The last row shows the
p-value from the test that compares the distribution of each variable before and after
2011. A common test of distributions is the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, which compares
the location (mean) and the shape (standard deviation) of two distributions. The null
hypothesis is no difference. This test is appropriate when the distributions are
approximately normal. Since the IEG ratings are not normally distributed, a Mann-
Whitney-Wilcoxon test was used, which is more appropriate in this situation. The null
hypothesis is again no difference in the distributions. Whatever the test, the last row
shows that the difference in the distribution of the variable before and after 2011 is
statistically significant (at p<.1 for IEG ratings, and at p<0.04 and p<0.01 for the macro
design and implementation quality, respectively).

           for description of variables, see at the bottom
           First five columns show the correlation between the five different aspects of the
            macro design quality and IEG ratings, while controlling for other important
            factors. The last column shows the correlation between the combined index of
            these five measures and the IEG ratings.
           Each of the five variables is standardized to mean zero and standard deviation
            one. The combined index is a simple average of the five measures (therefore also
            having a mean of zero).
           The table shows that the quality of the macroframeworks design is generally
            positively correlated with the IEG ratings. In particular, ceteris-paribus,
            backward-looking credibility and the coverage of quasi-fiscal risks are
            statistically significantly correlated with the IEG ratings at less than p<0.1
           The coefficients for each of the variables shows the effect of a one standard
            deviation increase. For example, a one standard deviation increase in the
            backward-looking credibility is associated with a .1 increase in the IEG rating,
            on a scale from 1 (unsatisfactory) to 5 (highly satisfactory).

Outcome is implementation quality. Standard errors clustered by country-programmatic series.

This table shows the correlation between the macro implementation quality and the
macro design quality.

           The macro implementation quality is standardized to mean zero and standard
            deviation one. Each of the five variables is standardized to mean zero and
            standard deviation one. The combined index is a simple average of the five
            measures (therefore also having a mean of zero).
           First five columns show the correlation between five difference aspects of the
            macro design quality and the macro implementation quality, while controlling
            for other important factors. The last column shows the correlation between the
            combined index of these four measures and the macro implementation quality.
           The table shows that the quality of the macroframeworks design is generally
            positively correlated with the macro implementation quality (all but the macro
            design consistency measure).
           The coefficients for each of the variables shows the effect of a one standard
            deviation increase. For example, a one standard deviation increase in the
            backward-looking credibility is associated with a .26 standard deviation
            increase in macro implementation quality.

Figure A-3 Comparison of correlation of IEG ratings and macro design quality before and after 2008




        This figure compares the size of the correlation between each aspect of the
         macro design quality and the IEG ratings before and after 2008, controlling for
         other important factors. Each dot in the graph is the estimate of the correlation,
         analogous to the estimates shown in the appropriate table above (i.e. these are
         simply the size of the coefficient from the regression). The horizontal bar around
         the point is the 95% confidence interval (that is, estimate +/- 1.96*standard
         error).
        Each panel, separated by the horizontal dashed line, shows the estimates after
         and before 2008 for the five different aspects of the macro design quality.
        The vertical dashed line denotes zero correlation.
        The graph shows that the correlation between the macro design quality and the
         IEG ratings does not show an apparent pattern across the two periods.

after 2008




        The figure is analogous in logic to the one immediately before.
        - The figure shows that the correlation between the macro implementation quality and the
        IEG ratings has somewhat increased since 2008, but that generally, it is not statistically
        different from zero (as the confidence interval crosses zero in both periods).

Figure A.5. Comparison of correlation of macro implementation quality and macro design quality
before and after 2008




         This figure is analogous in logic to the previous two, but looks at the correlation
          between macro implementation quality and macro design quality.
         There are no obvious changes in either direction across the two periods.

Variable explanations

Key variables

Backward-looking credibility: measures the absolute difference between the average
actual fiscal balance (% of GDP) in years t-1, t-2, and t-3, and the planned fiscal balance
in the first year of the program (year t). The actual fiscal balance is taken from the WDI
database. The planned fiscal balance is taken from the WEO projections database. The
projection refers to either the April or the October WEO projection in year t, whichever
is closer to the project starting date. The final variable is standardized to mean zero and
standard deviation one.

Forward-looking credibility: measures the average planned annual rate of change in the
fiscal balance for years t, t+1, t+2, and t+3. The planned fiscal balance is taken from the
WEO projections database. The projection refers to either the April or the October WEO


50
projection in year t, whichever is closer to the project starting date. The final variable is
standardized to mean zero and standard deviation one.

Macro design consistency index: originally ranges from 1 to 5, with 5 being highly
satisfactory and 1 being highly unsatisfactory. The variable is rescaled to mean zero and
standard deviation one.

Quasi-fiscal risk coverage: the measure is derived from a text search program. It
represents the overall frequency count of the following acronyms and phrases in each
project document: QFA, SOE, NPL, NPLs, quasi fiscal, contingent liability, fuel subsidy,
cross subsidy, government guarantee, state owned enterprise, bad loan, non-
performing loan, implicit debt, implicit pension debt, interest subsidy, fiscal cost of
(bank) closure, and fiscal drain. The search was performed on text after removing
punctuation, spaces, and after "stemming" the words, so that both singular and plural
forms are returned. The variable is represented as the total frequency count of any of
the mentioned phrases as the share of the total number of words in the document. The
final variable is standardized to mean zero and standard deviation one. A small random
inspection suggests high correlation of the measure with the quality of coverage of
quasi-fiscal risks in the macro-fiscal frameworks.

Debt sustainability coverage: represents the overall frequency count of the following
acronyms and phrases in each project document: DSA, debt sustainability,
sustainability risk, debt sensitivity, shock to growth, and shock to debt. The search was
performed on text after removing punctuation, spaces, and after "stemming" the words,
so that both singular and plural forms are returned. The variable is represented as the
total frequency count of any of the mentioned phrases as the share of the total number
of words in the document. The final variable is standardized to mean zero and standard
deviation one. Small random inspection suggests high correlation with the detail and
coverage of the debt sustainability in macro-fiscal frameworks.

Combined macro design quality index: represents a simple average of the previous four
measures.

Macro implementation quality: measures the average absolute difference between the
actual fiscal balance (% of GDP) and the planned fiscal balance in years t, t+1, t+2, and
t+3. The actual fiscal balance is taken from the WDI database. The planned fiscal
balance is taken from the WEO projections database. The projection refers to either the
April or the October WEO projection in year t, whichever is closer to the project starting
date. The final variable is standardized to mean zero and standard deviation one.
