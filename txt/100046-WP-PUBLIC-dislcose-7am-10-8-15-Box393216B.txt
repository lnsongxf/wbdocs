Future of Food
Shaping A Climate-Smart Global Food System

October 2015
Foreword
The agriculture sector is a mainstay of national economies across the developing world. Agri-
culture is a major provider of food, nutrition, jobs, and export earnings, and the sector is key
to improving stewardship of the environment.

Farming affects every member of the human family, and is the basis of food security at
national, regional, and global levels. A well-performing agriculture sector is vital for achieving
the World Bank Group’s vision of a sustainable global food system that can feed every person,
every day, everywhere with a nutritious and affordable diet.

Climate change and agriculture are inextricably linked. Droughts, floods, and rising tempera-
tures are cutting crop yields, threatening food, fish and meat supply, and pushing poor people
deeper into poverty.

Agriculture and land-use changes contribute 25 percent of heat-trapping greenhouse gas
emissions. Without collective action, this number will likely rise. Food demand is projected
to increase by at least 20 percent globally over the next 15 years—with the largest increases
expected in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and East Asia—and a climate-smart food sys-
tem is urgently needed.

We must have a greater push to support widespread adoption of climate-smart agriculture
in efforts to secure the triple win of higher agricultural productivity, increased resilience to
climate change, and lower greenhouse gas emissions.

The World Bank Group is pleased to present “Future of Food: Shaping a Climate-Smart
Global Food System,” at the 2015 Annual Meetings being held in Lima, Peru. The report
aims to help improve the productivity and resilience of the current food system, and to make
agriculture part of the solution to climate change.

It presents compelling evidence and new tools for policymakers, serving as a guide to better
address the impacts of a warming climate on agriculture and food production. As the interna-
tional community works toward the new Sustainable Development Goals, the nexus of food
security, productivity, and climate change must come into sharper focus. This report argues
that climate-smart agriculture is central to efforts to end extreme poverty by 2030 and boost
shared prosperity.

We at the World Bank Group are committed to working with our partners to shape a global
food system that feeds all and creates a healthier, more prosperous, and sustainable world.

summary and key messages

Attaining a significant share of the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) rests upon
the ability to ensure the food system is productive, resilient, and contributes to tackling cli-
mate change. The growing body of operational experience implementing Climate-Smart
Agriculture (CSA) points to a large spectrum of approaches that deliver productivity and
resilience gains alongside lower emissions. This paper advocates for an increasing shift toward
securing a triple win by implementing agriculture and food production practices that not only
boost productivity but also enhance resilience and lower greenhouse gas emissions (GHG)—
the three pillars that form the basis of CSA.

Key messages
•	   Meeting the rising demand for food and ending hunger and food insecurity requires a
     climate-smart food system that improves agricultural productivity, has greater resil-
     ience to climate change and lowers greenhouse gas emissions. Droughts, floods and ris-
     ing temperatures are already cutting crop yields, threatening food, fish and meat supply and
     pushing people deeper into poverty. Climate change and the effects of climate shocks are
     dampening the prospects for future productivity growth. Agriculture and land use changes
     already contribute 25 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. A more climate-smart food sys-
     tem is urgently needed to address these challenges.  
•	   There is a growing spectrum of interventions—policies, practices and innovations—
     that must help secure the triple win of higher agricultural productivity, increased resil-
     ience to climate change and lower emissions. But in a world of constrained resources,
     prioritization of investments in climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is crucial. New tools
     are available that can help policy makers and stakeholders assess opportunities, balance
     trade-offs and facilitate identification of entry points for smart, targeted interventions
     and more efficient investments.
•	   The new Sustainable Development Goals to end global poverty and hunger by 2030
     offer a major opportunity to place the need for a climate-smart food system at the
     front and center of the development agenda and debate. This paper calls on the devel-
     opment community, scientists, investors, and civil society to rally behind governments
     and farmers to support integrated approaches and overcome barriers to adoption of CSA.

First, the paper highlights why ensuring a more climate-smart food system is needed; second,
it identifies what practices and approaches can help accomplish this endeavor and offers a
guide on how these can be better prioritized at the country level; and third, it focuses on
how these improved practices and approaches can be more broadly developed and adopted
through improved incentives, knowledge, science, and finance.

     Farmers in China currently apply approximately 200 pounds of fertilizer per acre on average,
     whereas farmers in Africa apply less than 100 pounds on average. If application rates could be
     reduced in China and increased in Africa, the net impact could be an extra 175 million tons of
     food produced in Africa and a reduction of up to 360 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent
     (CO2-e) in China’s emissions (and reduced farming costs).i
     If alternative wetting and drying could be expanded to 100 percent of eligible areas globally,
     water consumption in agriculture could be cut by 30 percent, 200 million tons of CO2-e emis-
     sions could be avoided, 65 million more tons of rice could be produced, and farmer incomes
     could be increased.ii
     The FAO estimates that emissions from livestock can be reduced by between 18 and 30 per-
     cent concurrent with an increase in productivity if producers in given production systems and
     geographies adopt the practices currently used by the 10 percent of producers with the lowest
     emissions intensity.iii
     Intensification needs to be complemented by policy planning, regulations, pricing, and finan-
     cial incentive mechanisms to promote sustainable landscape and watershed management and
     reduce the added pressure from extensification that the gains in productivity may facilitate.

Climate-Smart Agriculture Keeps Rice Bowls Filled in Vietnam
In Vietnam, climate-smart approaches to rice cultivation have helped up to 33,000 farmers produce more rice
while cutting costs and reducing methane emissions. Switching from flood irrigation to alternative wetting and
drying of plots has reduced input costs by 20 percent, raised produc-
tivity by 5–10 percent, and significantly cut methane emissions and

Climate-Smart Agriculture Delivering Results in India
Livestock: A government program to support the national dairy sector improving animal feed, nutrition and
fodder development is under way in climatically vulnerable agro-ecological regions in 15 states. The program
boosts cattle productivity by promoting breeds that are resilient and adapted to local conditions and promotes
improved animal nutrition through the Ration Balancing Program. Feed costs and methane emissions both
fell by 12 percent, a healthier and more productive pool of cattle is making the system more climate-resilient,
and at least one-third of the beneficiary farmers are women.

Climate-Smart Agriculture Helps Feed More People in Senegal
Senegal is building a more resilient and productive food system that also helps mitigate climate change through
the West Africa Agriculture Productivity Program (WAAPP). Scientists have developed seven new high-yielding,
early maturing, and drought-resistant varieties of sorghum and pearl millet adapted to local growing conditions.
On average, the new varieties yield 1.5 to 2 tons per hectare—significantly more than the 0.5 ton per hectare
yields that are the norm from traditional varieties. The seeds have been distributed to farming cooperatives
around the country, which have been charged with producing more seeds and selling them back at a price
higher than the market standard. Farmers around the country are also taught climate-smart planting techniques

productivity and resilience, with a concurrent reduction in fertilizer use, is helping to deliver the triple win.


Climate-Smart Agriculture Cuts Emissions in Bangladesh
Through Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP) funding, the World Bank is promoting an
approach that incorporates the use of optimal and timely use of new rice seeds, new fertilizer, and the implemen-
tation of new water management (including the alternate wetting and drying (AWD) approach that saves water
and offers other important benefits such as human disease control). The project funds “farmer field schools”
to demonstrate the project’s benefits to farmers in target villages. The AWD technique makes use of the cycle
of draining and re-flooding of rice paddies, keeping an optimum water level at any particular time. It typically
takes 2,000 liters of water to produce a kilogram of rice; however, AWD can reduce water use by 25 percent. AWD
also helps reduce GHG emissions, specifically methane, by up to 50 percent. This project also supports reduced
fertilizer use by promoting deep placement of fertilizer and precision application—leading to a significant drop
in methane emissions. Used in combination with soil and water conservation, these practices deliver adaptation
and mitigation benefits in crop, livestock systems and fisheries.


Partnering with scientists to achieve triple-win in coffee sector in Central America and Mexico
A GAFSP-financed project in Central America’s coffee sector, supported by the IFC in partnership with scientists,
the private sector, and farmers, is helping combat the devastating
coffee rust disease La Roya by planting improved varieties in cof-
fee plantations. In another program led by the private sector, the         Farmers, the private sector and

efits in part of Nicaragua and in Chiapas state, Mexico. Diversified production systems have helped boost the
resilience of farmer incomes throughout the year, while fruit trees provide shade, boosting resilience to drought
and heat, and absorb carbon.


Improving Livestock Productivity and Curbing Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon
In Brazil, mitigation of emissions from the livestock sector has become the centerpiece of a national strategy
to achieve voluntary targets for GHG mitigation. Brazil committed to reduce deforestation in the Amazon and
the Cerrado, scale up no-till planting, and reduce nitrogen emissions from farming. Total pledges will reduce
emissions by 700 million tons CO2-eq by 2020 within ten years. The Brazilian Cooperation Agency program pro-
vides a credit line for loans to farmers to finance a range of mitigation practices to meet pledges—intensifying
livestock production, restoring degraded grasslands, and integrating livestock and crop farming systems—that
also strengthen resilience to drought. Cattle productivity has been growing since 2004 alongside impressive
reduction in deforestation. This is also a triple win.
