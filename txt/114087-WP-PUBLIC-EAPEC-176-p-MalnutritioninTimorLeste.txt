Glossary
Term               Definition
Anemia             Anemia is defined as a hemoglobin concentration below a specified cut-off
                   point, which can change according to the age, gender, physiological status,
                   smoking habits and altitude at which the population being assessed lives. WHO
                   defines anemia in children under 5 years of age and pregnant women as a
                   hemoglobin concentration < 110 g/l at sea level. Low hemoglobin concentration
                   impairs the ability to supply oxygen to body tissues and is associated with
                   increased risks for maternal and child mortality. Anemia can be caused by
                   inadequate intake/poor absorption of iron, folate, vitamin B12 and other
                   nutrients, as well as infectious diseases (including malaria and hookworm
                   infections) and genetic causes. Iron-deficiency anemia reduces the work
                   capacity of individuals and entire populations, with serious consequences for
                   the economy and national development. In addition, the negative consequences
                   of iron-deficiency anemia on the cognitive and physical development of
                   children and on physical performance - particularly the work productivity of
                   adults - are major concerns.

Anthropometry      The measurement of physical body characteristics, most commonly weight and
                   height, but also circumference of body parts (head, arm, waist, etc.) as a tool for
                   monitoring growth. Anthropometry is also used as a proxy indicator of
                   nutritional status. Anthropometric indicators can point to malnutrition, but do
                   not provide evidence of deficiencies in specific macronutrients or
                   micronutrients.

Body Mass Index    A measure of relative weight given by weight in kilograms divided by height in
(BMI)              meters squared (kg/m2). In adults, both underweight (thinness) and overweight
                   are measured using BMI.
Colostrum          The first breastmilk secreted in the first few days after childbirth, often thick
                   and yellow. Colostrum has many health and nutrition benefits: it contains
                   antibodies and other proteins which help transfer immunity from the mother to
                   child and protect the infant from infection; it contains growth factors to keep the
                   intestines mature; and is rich in vitamin A, vitamin K, and other nutrients.


Complementary      The process of introducing age-appropriate, adequate and safe solid or semi-
Feeding (CF)       solid foods in addition to breast milk or a breast milk substitute when breast
                   milk alone is no longer sufficient to meet nutritional requirements of an infant.
                   The target range for complementary feeding is 6-23 months.

Double Burden of   The coexistence of undernutrition (as evidenced by anthropometry in children
Malnutrition       and women, or micronutrient deficiencies) and overweight/obesity in the same
                   country, community, household or even individual.




                                                                                                         v
Epigenetic               Changes in the expression of genes (rather than genes, themselves) which can
Modifications            be due to external and internal environmental exposures and influence
                         physiological processes such as metabolism and the development of disease.
                         Epigenetic modifications provide a potential link between maternal nutrition,
                         early life environmental exposures, and susceptibility to disease.


Food Fortification       Addition of micronutrients to food during or after processing.
Infant and young child   Feeding of infants (less than 12 months old) and young children (12-23 months
feeding (IYCF)           old). The key interventions of IYCF include protection, promotion and support
                         of optimal breastfeeding practices (exclusive breastfeeding for the first six
                         months and continued breastfeeding for two years or beyond) and support for
                         and promotion of optimal CF practices (e.g. timely introduction of CF). Issues
                         of policy and legislation around the regulation of marketing infant formula and
                         other breast milk substitutes are also addressed by these interventions.
Low Birth Weight         Weight of less than 2,500 grams at the time of birth. Low Birth Weight (LBW)
(LBW)                    is a significant public health concern and a major risk factor for perinatal
                         mortality. It is associated with greater likelihood of stunting and chronic
                         diseases later in life. It includes preterm neonates (born before 37 weeks of
                         gestation), small for gestational age neonates at term, and the overlap between
                         these two situations (preterm, small for gestational age neonates).
Macronutrients           Fat, protein, and carbohydrates needed for a wide range of body functions and
                         processes.
Malnutrition             A broad term commonly used as an alternative to 'undernutrition' but which
                         technically refers to any dysfunction of nutrition, including inadequate,
                         excessive or unbalanced nutrition.
Metabolic Syndrome       A group of risk factors including abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia,
                         hypertension, and impaired glucose tolerance.
Micronutrients           Essential vitamins and minerals required in miniscule amounts for the
                         maintenance of essential body processes.
Mid-upper Arm            The circumference of the mid-upper arm measured on a straight left arm
Circumference            midway between the tip of the shoulder and the tip of the elbow. Can be used to
(MUAC)                   measure acute malnutrition/wasting in children 6-59 months.

Nutrition-Specific       Address the immediate determinants of malnutrition, including fetal and child
Interventions            nutrition and development, and/or the nutritional status of older children and
                         adults (adequate food and nutrient intake, feeding, caregiving and parenting
                         practices, and burden of infectious disease).
Nutrition-sensitive      Address the underlying determinants of malnutrition and development (food
interventions            security; adequate resources) at the individual (especially maternal and
                         caregiver), household and community levels; access to health services and a safe
                         and hygienic environment; access to information about healthy food choices)
                         and that incorporate specific nutrition goals and actions. Nutrition sensitive
                         programs can be used as delivery platforms for nutrition-specific interventions,
                         which can increase their scale, coverage and effectiveness.
Obesogenic               Factors tending to make individuals overweight/fat, such as environments that
                         promote decreased physical activity and/or increased intake of energy dense
                         foods.
Overnutrition            Consumption of calories in excess of those needed to maintain growth and
                         health.


                                                                                                            vi
Overweight/obesity   Among children under-five, overweight is measured as children who have a
                     weight-for-height more than two standard deviations higher than the median for
                     a child of the same height and sex according to the WHO Growth Standard.
                     WHO has recommended classifications of overweight (BMI>=25) and obesity
                     (BMI >=30) which are associated with increased risk of some non-
                     communicable diseases. As a measure of relative body weight, BMI is easy to
                     obtain. It is an acceptable proxy for fatness and has been directly related to
                     health risks and death rates in many populations. At a population level,
                     prevalence of overweight/obesity derived from BMI cutoffs can be useful to
                     develop and implement policy actions and to facilitate prevention. BMI cutoffs
                     for overweight and obesity can also be used as screening tools to identify high
                     risk individuals and to be used for diagnostic purposes in combination with other
                     clinical measurements and risk factors.



Short stature        Often measured in women of reproductive age and defined as height <145 cm.
                     Women of short stature are at greater risk for obstetric complications because
                     of a smaller pelvis. Small women are at greater risk of delivering an infant with
                     low birth weight, contributing to the intergenerational cycle of malnutrition, as
                     infants of low birth weight or retarded intrauterine growth tend to be smaller as
                     adults.

Stunting             Often referred to as 'chronic malnutrition' and measured as low height-for-age,
                     stunting is the most common form of undernutrition. Stunting is reflected in low
                     height-for-age (being of a height that is more than two standard deviations
                     below the median height for a child of the same age and sex according to the
                     WHO Growth Standard) among children under age five. The percentage of
                     children with a low height for age (stunting) reflects the cumulative effects of
                     undernutrition and infections since and even before birth. This measure can
                     therefore be interpreted as an indication of poor environmental conditions or
                     long-term restriction of a child's growth potential.
Undernutrition       A state of inadequate and/or unbalanced intake and/or absorption of nutrients
                     needed for growth and maintenance of health, resulting in nutritional deficiency.
                     Undernutrition covers a range of disorders, including growth failure and
                     micronutrient deficiencies.
Underweight          Low weight-for-age. Among children under age five, underweight reflects being
                     of a weight that is more than two standard deviations below the median weight
                     for a child of the same age and sex according to the WHO Growth Standard.
                     The percentage of children who are underweight can represent both children
                     who have low weight-for-height and low height-for-age. As such, it is a
                     composite indicator and can be difficult to interpret.




                                                                                                         vii
Wasting   Also known as acute malnutrition. Among children under age five, wasting can
          be measured using weight-for-height or mid-upper arm circumference
          (MUAC). Using weight-for-height cutoffs, wasting is defined as a weight that
          is more than two standard deviations below the median weight for a child of the
          same height and sex. Using MUAC, acute malnutrition is defined as MUAC
          lower than 125 mm and/or presence of bilateral pitting edema. There are
          different levels of wasting severity: moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) and
          severe acute malnutrition (SAM). Wasting in children is a symptom of acute
          undernutrition, usually as a consequence of insufficient food intake or a high
          incidence of infectious diseases, especially diarrhea. Wasting in turn impairs the
          functioning of the immune system and can lead to increased severity and
          duration of and susceptibility to infectious diseases and an increased risk for
          death.

Foreword
The World Bank Group (WBG) has conducted a nutrition assessment, gap analysis, and donor mapping report as
part of the WBG’s technical assistance to the Government of Timor -Leste. This report is intended for a technical
and programmatic audience, providing an overview of the country’s “nutrition system” for stakeholders seeking to
engage in this area in the country. Specifically, the report aims to:
     Document the magnitude and severity of malnutrition in Timor-Leste and country-specific key determinant.
     Reviews the present capacity, institutional and implementation arrangements to address malnutrition and
         its determinant.
     Assesses the current nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive programs in Timor-Leste: map the coverage
         of various donor and government programs; document gaps in the scope, coverage and financing of these
         programs.
     Provides recommendations to the Government of Timor-Leste (RDTL) and the development partner
         community to scale-up programs and interventions and strengthen the overall response to malnutrition in
         the country.

Methods and Analytical Approach
The report documents the state of the nutrition system using recent data from a variety of sources, including:
    Synthesis of demographic and nutrition epidemiology data from existing surveys.
    Network assessment of key stakeholders in nutrition in Timor-Leste.
    Review of legal, strategy, policy, and guideline documents from relevant RDTL ministries and agencies in
       health and non-health sectors.
    Review of grey and published literature, as well as program and evaluation reports in health and non-health
       sectors from the Government of Timor-Leste and non-government agencies.

Primary quantitative data were not collected as a part of the assessment and the report does not serve as an evaluation
of the impact and effectiveness of programs. It draws upon extant data and sources to synthesize what is already
known about the nutrition situation, policies, and programs to identify promising areas for further consideration.

Structure of the Report
This report is organized into nine chapters:
        Chapter 1 describes the Timor-Leste country context and the global nutrition landscape to provide
           background for the subsequent analyses.
        Chapter 2 gives an overview of magnitude of the burden of malnutrition in Timor-Leste.
        Chapter 3 draws upon the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) conceptual framework and provides
           a systematic description of the key context-specific immediate and underlying determinants of
           malnutrition.
        Chapter 4 reviews the political commitments, institutional arrangements, and capacity to address
           malnutrition across sectors in Timor-Leste.
        Chapter 5 describes the nutrition-specific programs gaps.
        Chapter 6 describes programs aimed at the underlying drivers of malnutrition.
        Chapter 7 explores the nature of development partner coordination for nutrition issues.
        Chapter 8 reviews the costs of scaling up nutrition interventions and provides an overview of the fiscal
           space to do so.
        Chapter 9 provides a series of policy and programmatic recommendations to strengthen the response to
           malnutrition, leveraging opportunities and addressing the identified gaps and challenges.

Executive Summary
This report presents the findings of nutrition assessment, gap analysis, and donor mapping exercise in the
Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste (RDTL). Timor-Leste, though as a young and fragile state, has the
preconditions for successful development. However, persistent high levels of malnutrition threaten to
impede efforts to reduce poverty, capitalize on gains in human and skills development, increase
productivity, and stimulate economic growth.

Though progress has been in other areas of human development, malnutrition -- particularly maternal and
child undernutrition -- is the single greatest contributor to premature death and disability in the country and
presents an unparalleled development challenge. In 2013, over half (50.2%) of all children under-five were
stunted in their physical and cognitive development. Timor-Leste has the third highest stunting prevalence
in the world, higher than all other g7+ countries and a significant outlier relative to its level of economic
development. In 2013, nearly one in three (63.2%) children (6-59 months) and 2 in 5 women age 14-60
(39.5%) were anemic. Although the country is no longer in an emergency situation, the prevalence of
wasting (11%)—an indicator of acute malnutrition and a prominent risk factor for child mortality— exceeds
the WHO threshold for high public health significance, with emergency levels of wasting experienced in
Covalima and Oecusse districts. Overweight prevalence is low relative to global averages, but has risen
more than five-fold among adult women over the past decade. Though Timor-Leste does not yet suffer from
the double burden of malnutrition, it will soon emerge if the problem continues unaddressed.

Findings and Key Themes

Malnutrition has serious—but preventable—adverse consequences for health, human capital, and
economic development. Recent estimates indicate that malnutrition leads to US$41.0 million annually in
lost economic activity, equivalent to nearly the entire MOH budget and roughly 2% of the economic activity
in the non-oil sector. These very high levels of malnutrition affect the health of women and children,
cognitive development, schooling attainment, lifelong productivity, and wage earning potential.

The causes of maternal and child undernutrition in Timor-Leste are multiple and span across sectors.
These can be categorized as immediate (nutrient intake and disease burden), underlying (child care and
feeding practices; reproductive health and women’s status; household hygiene environment; dietary
diversity and food insecurity; and demand for and access to quality health services), and basic (household
poverty and macroeconomic context, sociocultural factors, and political context). Given the very high
burden of undernutrition in Timor-Leste, all factors play a role in the country. For these causes—as well as
dietary behaviors related to development of overweight—improvements are most often constrained by both
demand-side factors related to knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes, as well as supply side factors related to
resource availability and service delivery.

Timor-Leste has high level political commitment, overarching strategic frameworks, and a multisectoral
coordinating body to provide the foundation for a strong national response to malnutrition. The Honorable
President and Prime Minister have both publicly championed nutrition, while the National Strategic
Development Plan (2011-2030) highlights nutrition as essential input for social and economic development.
The National Council for Food Security, Sovereignty, and Nutrition in Timor-Leste (KONSSANTIL) is a
high level coordinating body established to guide the national multisectoral response to food insecurity and
malnutrition. KONSSANTIL has stewardship functions for the National Action Plan for a Hunger and
Malnutrition-Free Timor-Leste (PAN-HAM-TL), which outlines the activities required across sectors to
end malnutrition in the nation. However, the plan covers over 170 actions, and as nutrition accounts for
only one of five pillars, KONSSANTIL has focused primarily on food security and food sovereignty.

                                                                                                             1
The Ministry of Health (MOH) is the technical home for nutrition in Timor-Leste. The National
Nutrition Strategy (2014-2019) defines an approach to improve nutrition through nutrition-specific,
nutrition-sensitive, and enabling environment interventions. A Specific Nutrition Intervention Package
(SNIP) has been developed for delivery through the health system and is aligned with the global evidence
base focusing on the first 1,000 days between conception and age two. However, key gaps remain,
including: stimulating the MOH leadership and ownership over strategic directions, development partner
coordination, and technical directions; finalizing the supportive policy and strategy frameworks needed to
guide future interventions; scaling up the coverage and quality of SNIP interventions and addressing
anemia; building the nutrition capacity of frontline health workers; and enhancing community-based
delivery of nutrition services.

The Ministries of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF), Social Solidarity (MSS), Education (MOE),
Commerce, Industry, and Environment (MCIE), and State Administration (MSA) are critical partners for
addressing malnutrition in Timor-Leste. The strategies, policies, and guidelines for these ministries
acknowledge the contributions of the respective sectors in reducing malnutrition. The ministries have
programs which address underlying drivers of malnutrition, targeting areas such as: (a) increased
productivity and income from agriculture production; support to vulnerable mothers and children; (b)
provision of school meals; (c) increased access to locally produced foods; and promotion of community-
driven development, among others. However, the nutritional impact of these and other programs tends to
be limited by one or more of the following factors: (a) limited consideration of nutrition in technical
program design decisions; (b) capacity constraints in relation to organizational, human resource, and public
financial management; (c) weak data collection and availability for evidence-informed decision making;
and (d) insufficient attention to supervision, resources, and skill-building needed by frontline workers.

Development partners play a key role in the response to malnutrition and its determining factors, but greater
leadership and coordination is required to maximize the impact of these investments. Non-state actors have
filled a critical gap in the delivery and financing of nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive programs and
have provided systems strengthening and capacity building support across all relevant ministries. Though
a large number of agencies are involved in addressing the immediate and underlying determinants of
malnutrition, they often act in silos without a harmonized and convergent approach to social and behavior
change communication, training, and programming.

The current level of nutrition investment is not sufficient to support the goals outlined in national
plans. The Zero Hunger Action Plan approximates that US$176.0 million annually (roughly 1/10th of the
General State Budget) will be required to implement the plan over ten years. However, overall fiscal space
is tightening as oil revenues decline and key KONSSANTIL Ministries (Health, Education, Social
Solidarity, and Agriculture and Fisheries) experience budgetary contractions due to frontloading of
investments in infrastructure. With high recurrent expenditure on wages and salaries, ministries
increasingly rely on donor support to supplement goods and services budgets and to deliver services to
citizens. As donors begin to scale down their development assistance to the country, there is a need for
greater advocacy and engagement with the Ministry of Finance and Parliamentarians to increase budget
allocations for nutrition, maximize available resources, and develop a nutrition financing strategy to ensure
sustainable service delivery.

Recommendations

Timor-Leste has endorsed the Zero Hunger Challenge and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and has
built the necessary strategic and institutional foundations to improve nutrition. The key challenges is to
build awareness among a broad-based constituency which can elevate the quantity and quality of
implementation and financing to levels necessary to achieve the targets in these ambitious commitments.
Recommendations for rising to this challenge are divided into actions at five levels, building from the
grassroots family/community to the cross-sectoral coordination and financing of institutions at the highest
levels. Chapter 9 presents specific, recommended short-, medium-, and long-term actions which are
applicable to government and non-state stakeholders working at each level. To maximize impact and
accelerate progress, it is critical that actions are initiated at each level and build off of the comparative
advantages of the various players working in this space.

1. Family/Community: Empower families and communities with the knowledge and resources
   necessary to demand optimum nutrition and growth for their children. Improvements in nutrition
   in Timor-Leste will not be possible without close engagement with families and communities to reduce
   the normalcy of stunting, build knowledge of malnutrition, and define solutions, building off of
   community assets and institutions. Appropriately crafted messages must reach communities through a
   variety of channels, supported by a cadre of motivated frontline workers and para-professionals who
   can build the dialogue on how to take the recommendations forward.

2. Services: Scale up the delivery of a package of evidence-based nutrition-specific and key
   nutrition-sensitive interventions focused on improving nutritional status in the first 1,000 days.
   The package of nutrition-specific interventions needs to be delivered as component of an integrated
   Primary Health Care package with universal coverage. Attention is needed to implement
   supplementation and fortification interventions which can address anemia and micronutrient
   deficiencies and define and strengthen the community-based delivery platform for these intervention.

        Key evidence-based nutrition-sensitive services need to be scaled up to address the underlying
        determinants of early life malnutrition. Among others, these include: (i) improving knowledge and
        access to reproductive health and family planning counselling and services; (ii) increasing the
        prevention and identification of nutrition-related chronic diseases; (iii) harnessing agriculture as a
        means of improving dietary quality and reducing exposure to environmental pathogens; (iv)
        improving hygiene and sanitation behaviors; (v) providing safety nets and health/nutrition demand-
        generation activities for women and children; and (vi) improving parents’ ability to provide
        appropriate care and stimulation for young children. Delivery platforms for these interventions
        should also, as possible, be leveraged for the delivery of nutrition-relevant messages. In order to
        increase likelihood of impact, these programs need to focus on nutritionally vulnerable women and
        children, but also need to be available to adolescents (the next generation of parents) and support
        systems (husbands, mothers-in-law, community leaders). These programs also need clearly defined
        pathways from intervention to nutritional outcome, gather appropriate data and indicators of
        nutritional status, and address underlying assumptions.

3. Institutions: Build capacity and strengthen institutions to promote efficient, quality service
   delivery. Within ministries at the central and sub-national levels, critical systems strengthening actions
   must be taken in order for services to be scaled up and ensure that they are of sufficient quality. Many
   of these actions are ongoing and should continue, including: (a) nutrition training and capacity building
   for frontline service providers to maximize investments in the public sector workforce; (b)
   strengthening human resource management and supportive supervision functions, especially at lower
   levels; (c) improving supply chain management; and (d) strengthening public financial management
   capacity.
                                                                                                            3
4. Coordination: Strengthen coordination and accountability mechanisms for a multisectoral
   response to malnutrition. High level coordination and leadership is needed to move the nutrition
   agenda forward in Timor-Leste. Improving nutrition must become a central priority for KONSSANTIL
   and member ministries, and can be evidenced through leadership commitment, prioritization of PAN-
   HAM-TIL activities, which has five pillars, with priority nutrition results included under Pillar 2 (with
   nutrition-sensitive sub-activities found across pillars), and creation of a common results framework
   with sectors responsible for appropriate nutrition-related indicators. The creation of a multi-stakeholder
   coordination platform for nutrition, involving the public sector, donors and development partners, and
   private sectors is also urgently required and can contribute to improved convergence at national and
   sub-national levels.

5. Financing: Secure domestic and donor financing needed to deliver the package of nutrition
   programs at scale. In order for nutrition improvements to be realized, it is imperative that sufficient
   domestic, donor, and private sector financing is available and used efficiently. Advocacy with the Prime
   Minister, Parliamentarians, Ministry of Finance, and civil society throughout the budget cycle is
   needed, supported by actions to improve efficiency and execution of budget allocations. These include
   the development of a system for monitoring nutrition budget allocations and expenditures against the
   common results framework, moving towards results-based financing for nutrition as appropriate.

Chapter 1. Background

 CHAPTER 1 KEY MESSAGES
   1. Timor-Leste has made progress in building peace and establishing institutions since gaining
      independence in 2002.
   2. Economic growth has been driven by oil wealth, allowing Timor-Leste to achieve lower
      middle-income status in 2011.
   3. Although improvements have been made in human development, Timor-Leste has high fertility
      and an epidemiological profile comparable to many low-income countries. Over one third
      (36%) of all deaths are attributable to communicable and infectious diseases.
   4. Child and maternal malnutrition is an underlying risk factor for 27% of all deaths in children
      under age 5.
   5. There is a critical window of opportunity during the first 1,000 days of life from conception
      through a child’s second birthday where interventions can have the greatest impact on reducing
      the lifelong consequences of malnutrition.
   6. There is global and national momentum to accelerate progress on malnutrition as a key driver
      of sustainable development.

A. Timor-Leste Country Context

1. History, Economic Development, and Poverty

The Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste (RDTL) is a small lower-middle income country in the World
Bank’s East Asia and Pacific (EAP) region. Gaining independence in 2002, the nation is the second
youngest in the world. The Island of Timor is divided between Timor-Leste (also known as East Timor)
and Indonesian West Timor. Administratively, Timor-Leste is divided into 13 districts, with each district
further subdivided into sub-districts (65 total), sucos (442 total) and aldeias (2225 total). Administrative
decentralization is outlined in the Constitution of Timor-Leste and a slow process is underway to transfer
budgetary power from central level ministries to the districts. District and sub-district administration will
be combined into municipalities, and municipal administrators/authorities will be delegated powers for
spending and management for delivery of services (including civil registration, primary healthcare, primary
education, water and sanitation, and roads).

Timor-Leste achieved lower-middle income status in 2011, largely due to oil income and high global oil
prices. To increase the sustainability of its oil wealth, the government channels its oil revenue into the
Petroleum Fund (PF), which had a balance of $16.6 billion at the beginning of 2016 (around ten times non-
oil gross domestic product (GDP)). The annual per capita non-oil GDP growth rate peaked in 2008 at 14.2%
and has slowed steadily (World Bank 2015a). Non-oil growth has been largely driven by public spending:
the public sector experienced average annual growth of 11% over the period 2002-2010 as the civil service
was built. There have been recent improvements in poverty reduction. Data from the recently completed
2014-15 Timor-Leste Survey of Living Standards (TLSLS-3) show that the share of the Timorese
population living in poverty declining from 50% in 2007 to an estimated 41.8% in 2014 based on the
national poverty line. This provides the most accurate measure of poverty in Timor-Leste, given local
conditions but is not directly comparable with poverty rates in other countries. The share of the Timorese
population living in extreme poverty ($1.90 a day in 2011) has fallen from 47.2% in 2007 to 30.3% in 2014
(NSD 2016; NSD 2008).




                                                                                                           5
2. State-Building

Timor-Leste is a post-conflict country emerging from a long history of occupation, a violent struggle for
independence, and internal conflicts between 1999 and 2006. Substantial achievements were realized since
gaining independence in 2001, including the development of political and state institutions, physical
infrastructure, and a sustainable economy.1 Given that, on average, post-conflict countries take 15-30 years
to transition out of fragility (World Bank 2011a), Timor-Leste’s pace of peace building and state building
is impressive. The influx of petroleum revenue provided the economic basis for securing stability, including
provision of: incentives for “petitioners” to surrender; cash grants to displaced residents to encourage them
to return home; generous pension benefits for veterans; and work opportunities through infrastructure
development and construction contracts (ICG 2013). However, these programs now continue and divert
fiscal resources away from inclusive growth and human development. A recent government-led fragility
assessment2 suggested that economic foundations remain weak, as demonstrated by persistently high youth
unemployment, poor human development outcomes, regional inequities, and food vulnerability.

Timor-Leste was a founding member of the g7+ group of conflict and fragile states, which aims to draw
upon the shared experiences of these nations as they transition towards resilience and the next stages of
development. The country is also a member of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP),
aims for full accession to Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and belongs to the United
Nations group of small-island developing state (SIDS).

3. Climate and Food Production

With over 70% of the population living in rural areas, Timor-Leste is an agrarian society which has adapted
to the tropical climate of wet (i.e., November to May depending on elevation and geography) and dry
seasons. Agriculture on the island has not reached its full productive potential. Only 30% of arable land is
in use for crops or grazing. Due to chronic underproduction the food supply must be supplemented with
imported cereals. Higher elevations (over nine months in the high cold zone) and the moist zone of the
south coast tend to receive greater rainfall (as much 2000 mm per year and ~1500 mm over 7-8 months,
respectively), while the northern coast is hotter and drier. The mountainous and steep terrain is predisposed
to extensive soil erosion on the slopes. Climate change is expected to intensify wind and rainfall, increasing
erosion from steep, deforested hillsides and affect agricultural productivity. Along with climate change,
population growth will exert further pressure on the agricultural system, potentially exacerbating food
insecurity if cropping systems and varieties do not improve (Molyneaux et al. 2012).




1 Up to 70% of Timor-Leste’s infrastructure, including houses, schools, offices, irrigation systems, water supplies, and the electrical
grid was destroyed as the Indonesian military withdrew in 1999.
2 The Fragility Assessment reviewed Timor-Leste’s progress against five Peacebuilding and Statebuilding Goals (PSGs) agreed as

part of the New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States. The New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States is a compact championed
by the g7+ group of fragile and conflict affected countries and regions, a multi-government advocacy and policy body made up of
18 countries across Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The New Deal establishes new principles for development architecture and calls
for new ways of working that better respond to the needs and challenges faced by fragile countries; the PSGs promote the
development and delivery of services which do not promote conflict. Forty countries and international organizations, including the
World Bank, endorsed the New Deal at the Fourth High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Busan (November 2011).

                                                                                                                                     6
4. Demographics, Health and Human Development

According to the 2015 Population and Housing Census, Timor-Leste has a total population of 1.17 million
(NSD 2015). Timor-Leste is one of the youngest nations in the world, with estimates indicating that up to
60% of the total population is under the age of 25 (Figure 1). The population has doubled since 1980 and
is expected to reach 2.5-3 million by 2050. Population growth is slowing, and declined from 15.5% during
the period 2004-2010 to 9.5% during 2010-2015 (RDTL 2015).

Improvements have been made, but human development remains at levels expected among low-income
countries. In 2015, Timor-Leste ranked 133rd of 187 countries and territories countries on the UN’s Human
Development Index3 (UNDP 2015). Despite increased access to education, primary school completion rates
remain low and education quality is a concern: a 2009 Early Grade Reading Assessment found that 70% of
students were unable to read a single word of a simple text by the end of grade one, decreasing to 20% by
the end of grade three (World Bank 2013a). Timor-Leste continues to experience rates of high fertility and
infant mortality (Table 1), while maternal mortality is among the highest in the world, a reflection of lack
of access to health care, poor infrastructure, and insufficient care for mothers during pregnancy and
delivery. High maternal and child undernutrition contributes to poor health outcomes, low school
achievement and productivity, and a cycle of impoverishment.

An epidemiological transition, though at the early stages, is underway. Infectious, communicable, maternal
and nutritional issues remain the key causes of the disease burden (Table 2) but new challenges are rapidly
emerging. Child and maternal malnutrition remain the greatest risk for disease, but tobacco smoking, dietary
risks, high blood pressure, and high fasting plasma glucose were among the top 10 risk factors in 2013
(IHME 2015). Critically, this growing burden of non-communicable diseases and associated risk factors
has gone largely unaddressed.

B. Rationale for intervention: The Global Nutrition Landscape

1. Maternal and Child Undernutrition: The First 1,000 Days Window of Opportunity

The greatest opportunity to reduce the risk of malnutrition—inadequate, excessive, and/or unbalanced
nutrition—is in the first 1,000 days of a child’s life. Stunting, an indicator of chronic malnutrition in
children under five, represents a child’s failure to attain the height4 expected among healthy children of
the same age and sex. In 2006, the World Health Organization released the Child Growth Standards which
demonstrated how children should grow in all countries. The Child Growth Standards were developed
based on a six-year study5 of children’s growth in diverse country settings which had the pivotal finding
that “when health and key environmental needs are met, the world’s children grow very similarly” (de Onis
2006). Thus, the variance in attained height between populations is determined to a greater extent by
variations in environmental and behavioral factors than variations in genes. High levels of stunting at a
population level are associated with poor socioeconomic conditions and frequent and early exposure to poor
conditions such as inappropriate feeding, unsanitary environments, and food insecurity.

Nutrition influences child growth even before an infant is born. In utero factors related to the poor
nourishment of the mother influence fetal development and a child’s potential for growth, cognitive
development and health. Low oxygen and nutrients during gestation can lead to low birth weight, short
stature, and impaired brain tissue development (which—in terms of neuron multiplication—is largely
completed by the second trimester) (Dobbing 1974). This may explain the association between cognitive
deficiencies and some cases of stunting, as the deficiencies in utero that lead to short stature and low birth
weight are likely to have an effect on other developing organs, especially the brain.

Through a multitude of studies, the first 1,000 days between conception and the child’s second birthday
was identified as a critical window to intervene and have lifelong impacts on nutrition outcomes.
Interventions to reduce stunting will have their maximum effect during this window. The greatest losses in
mean height-for-age z-score are accumulated between 6 and 18 months of age (Figure 2) (Victora et al.
2010), and growth in height not achieved during the first thousand days from conception to two years is
largely irrecoverable. This growth failure has negative consequences across the life course (Shrimpton et
al. 2001, Victora et al. 2010) and results in deficits in later life earning and poverty outcomes (Horton and
Hoddinot 2014).




4 Height-for-age encompasses linear growth in children under five. In children under age two or <85 cm tall, linear growth is
measured as recumbent length (distance from crown of the head to heel) when the child is lying down; in children over age two,
linear growth is measured using stature, or standing height (WHO 1997).
5 The 2006 Child Growth Standards were based on the findings of the WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study (MGRS). The

MGRS was implemented between 1997 and 2003 and collected data on growth among 8440 affluent children from various ethnic,
cultural, and geographic settings (Brazil, Ghana, India, Norway, Oman, and the USA). Children were required to have been
breastfed, to have non-smoking mothers, and to live in environments which promoted optimum growth. The proportion of total
variability between sites was 3%, while the proportion of variability attributable to individuals within sites was 70%, revealing
inter-population differences (differences among the children living in one study site) were much stronger than cross-cultural
differences. This study provided the rationale for constructing a single international growth standard (de Onis 2006).

2. The Double Burden of Malnutrition

Though undernutrition has long been considered the most salient form of malnutrition in the EAP region,
the rapidly rising burden of overweight/obesity is of urgent concern. These dual forms of malnutrition are
not mutually exclusive, and the double burden of malnutrition is defined as the coexistence of
undernutrition (as evidenced by anthropometry in children and women, or micronutrient deficiencies) and
overweight/obesity in the same country, community, household or even individual (Shrimpton and Rokx
2012). While it is well-known that undernutrition can exist in an inter-generational cycle, studies have also
demonstrated associations between early life undernutrition and the development of overweight/obesity in
later life (Figure 3). Poor maternal nutrition during pregnancy can trigger metabolic reprogramming in the
fetus and elevate risk of later-life overweight and non-communicable diseases. Individuals born with a low
birth weight or who were short or thin at birth have been found to be programmed for later coronary artery
disease (Barker 1995). The processes which lead to young child stunting also increase the proportion of fat
in the body as well as the susceptibility to nutrition related Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) such as
diabetes and high blood pressure in adulthood (Darnton-Hill et al. 2004). Rapid weight gain after the first
two years of life has been strongly associated with the risk of NCDs in adulthood (Victora et al. 2008).

3. Consequences of Malnutrition

As of 2013, maternal and child malnutrition is the single greatest risk factor for premature death and
disability in the Timorese population, resulting in massive—yet preventable—health and economic
consequences. Though deaths due to communicable, newborn, nutritional, and maternal causes are
generally declining in the EAP region, substantial burdens persist particularly in low- and lower middle-
income countries. In Timor-Leste, childhood wasting remains the number one risk factor for premature
death and disability. Globally, undernutrition is a cause of 45 percent of all child deaths (Black et al. 2013).
In Timor-Leste in 2013, childhood undernutrition was the leading risk factor for death in children under
age five (Figure 4), accounting for 25.5% of all deaths in this age group. It has been estimated that ensuring
that all Timorese children under five achieve a healthy weight6 would prevent 65% of DALYs attributable
to diarrhea and 100% of DALYs due to protein-energy malnutrition (Institute for Health Metrics and
Evaluation et al. 2013).

syphilis and chlamydia (causing neonatal conjunctivitis and/or pneumonia).

Dietary factors are the leading risks for NCDs in the EAP region. Timor-Leste has the lowest prevalence
of NCD-associated death and disability in the region, yet these conditions already account for 41% of total
DALYs (Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation et al. 2013). The human development consequences of
diet-related NCDs will be of particular concern in Timor-Leste, where the systems for prevention,
diagnosis, and management of chronic diseases are not fully established.

Recent estimate of the economic burden of malnutrition in Timor-Leste are US$41.0 million annually in
lost economic activity, or 1% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 2% of the economic activity in the
non-oil sector (Ministry of Health 2014a). This is in line with global estimates of average losses of 2-3%
of GDP (Shekar et al 2006). Undernutrition reduces economic growth due to indirect losses from poor
health and high costs of care, as well as indirect losses due to cognitive deficits, low educational attainment,
decreased productivity and wage earning potential.

In addition to economic losses from undernutrition, rising burden of overweight and obesity will generate
significant costs for health care systems and productivity losses due to absenteeism and associated illness.
The economic burden of obesity worldwide has been estimated between 0.7-2.8% of a country’s total health
care costs, with obese individuals bearing medical costs that are 30% higher than those with normal weight
(Withrow and Alter 2011).

4. What Works to Address Malnutrition: An Intervention Framework

The Lancet series’ on maternal and child nutrition in 2008 and again in 2013 identified a package of
evidence-based interventions which, when delivered at scale, have the ability to accelerate reductions in
malnutrition (Figure 5). Both nutrition-specific interventions directed at immediate levels of causality (and
mostly delivered through the health sector) (Bhutta et al. 2008; Bhutta et al. 2013) and nutrition-sensitive
interventions directed at the underlying and basic levels of causality (Ruel et al. 2013) are needed to have

                                                                                                                           12
the greatest impact. The investments required to scale up these nutrition specific interventions have been
identified by the Copenhagen Consensus7 as one of the most cost-effective development solutions
(Copenhagen Consensus 2012).

5. Global Momentum to Address Malnutrition

There is now strong global consensus regarding the essential role of nutrition in achieving sustainable
development. A solid evidence base provides direction on why and how to intervene to improve nutrition,
and has ignited action and strengthened coalitions dedicated to generating awareness, building
commitments, and increasing accountability to reduce malnutrition (Box 1). Timor-Leste has endorsed the
Sustainable Development Goals, with Target 2.2 focused on achieving the World Health Assembly targets
for stunting, wasting, and addressing especially the needs of adolescent girls, women, and the elderly. This
renewed international commitment to address malnutrition in all its forms can be leveraged to accelerate
action to reduce malnutrition in Timor-Leste.




7 The Copenhagen Consensus brought together a panel of expert economists to address ten challenge areas in order to answer the
question: What are the best ways of advancing global welfare, and particularly the welfare of developing countries, illustrated by
supposing that an additional US$75.0 billion of resources were at their disposal over a four-year initial period? Topping the list
was the problem of Hunger and education, for which the panel recommended ‘bundled interventions to reduce undernutrition in
pre-school children.’

                                                                                                                               13
BOX 1. Global Initiatives to Address Malnutrition

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
Among the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted at the United Nations Sustainable
Development Summit in September, 2015, SDG 2 “Zero Hunger” aims to “end hunger, achieve food
security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.” Target 2.2 urges countries to, “by
2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on
stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls,
pregnant and lactating women and older persons.”

The World Health Assembly (WHA) Global Nutrition Targets
In 2012, the 65th World Health Assembly endorsed six global nutrition targets (WHA Targets) to be reached
by 2025. The WHA targets for stunting and wasting have been enshrined in the SDGs, and build upon the
minimal aim of the MDGs (to reduce underweight as a measure of hunger). The WHA recommended that
targets be set at the country level, and Timor-Leste was among the more than 110 countries to endorse this
resolution.

            World Health Assembly Targets
            40 percent reduction in the global number of children under five who are
            stunted
            50 percent reduction of anemia in women of reproductive aged

            least 50 percent
            Reduce and maintain childhood wasting to less than 5 percent
        Source: WHO 2012a.

Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN)
Since its launch in 2010, 57 countries have joined the SUN movement and committed to engaging multiple
stakeholders at multiple levels and scaling up action against malnutrition across sectors. SUN promotes
increasing the coverage of evidence-based interventions with a proven impact on nutrition during the 1,000
days between conception and the child’s second birthday. Timor-Leste has not signed up to be a SUN
country.

Zero Hunger Challenge
The Zero Hunger Challenge was launched in 2013 at the 69th session of the Economic and Social
Commission of Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP). It is founded on five pillars of achievement: (1) zero stunted
children, (2) 100% access to adequate food year round, (3) all food systems sustainable, (4) 100% increase
in smallholder productivity and income, and (5) zero loss or waste of food. Although more food oriented
than SUN, it proposes many overlapping outcomes: (i) the preparation of a National Action Plan through
multi-stakeholder consultation; (ii) recognition of the 1,000-day window of opportunity; and (iii) the
emphasis on sustainable nutrition-sensitive health care, water, sanitation, education and specific nutrition
interventions that empower women.

Chapter 2. Nutrition Situation in Timor-Leste

    CHAPTER 2 KEY MESSAGES
      1. One in two Timorese children under the age of five is stunted, the third highest stunting
         prevalence in the world.
      2. Stunting is a poorly understood concept and—due to very high prevalence—is largely
         invisible.
      3. Micronutrient deficiencies are common among women and children. Nearly one in three
         (63.2%) children (6-59 months) and 2 in 5 women age 14-60 (39.5%) were anemic.
      4. Child wasting declined from 18.6% in 2009-10 to 11% in 2013 and does not appear to be
         driven by poverty.
      5. High undernutrition among women of reproductive age perpetuates an inter-generational
         cycle of malnutrition, with children at greater risk of low birth weight, anemia, and growth
         faltering.
      6. A five-fold increase in overweight (Body-Mass Index (BMI) ≥25.0) among women was
         documented between the 2003 DHS and the 2014 STEPS survey.
      7. Data gaps exist, particularly with respect to measurement of low birth weight, adolescent
         nutritional status, and overweight/obesity.


This section draws upon national nutrition data from a variety of nationally representative surveys (see
Annex 1) to examine the nutrition situation in Timor-Leste, while also considering national trends over
time and the country’s status relative to global prevalence.8 Definitions of nutrition terminology are found
in the glossary.

A. Anthropometry in infants and children (0-59 months of age)

According to WHO classifications, undernutrition in Timor-Leste is a critical public health problem (WHO
2012b). Table 3 shows the severity of stunting, wasting, and underweight by level of public health
significance.

and Nutrition Survey and the 2014 WHO STEPS survey. Anthropometric measures in the 2002 MICS and 2003 DHS reports are
calculated against the CDC Growth Reference rather than the 2006 WHO Child Growth Standards. This report uses prevalence
estimates from the UNICEF-WHO-World Bank Joint Malnutrition Estimates (JME), which have been recalculated against the
WHO Growth Standards. Though the TLFNS was conducted in 2013, the official figures were not released in time for inclusion in
the 2015 JME. In comparison tables and figures in this report, we use prevalence estimates from the 2013 TLFNS as the most
recent available, rather than the 2009-10 estimates included in JME.

1. Stunting

Child stunting, an indicator of chronic undernutrition, is associated with significant adverse cognitive,
development, and productivity consequences. Measured against international standards, stunting in Timor-
Leste is a critical development challenge. Over half (50.2%) of all children under-five were stunted in 2013,
well above the regional average of 11.3% for East Asia Pacific (UNICEF-WHO-The World Bank 2015).
Furthermore, chronic undernutrition in Timor-Leste is among the highest in g7+ countries, despite having
the highest GNI per capita (Table 4).

Timor-Leste has the highest prevalence of stunting in EAP (Figure 6) and, when the 2013 estimates are
used, the third highest stunting prevalence globally (UNICEF-WHO-The World Bank 2015). Between 2002
and 2013, the average annual rate of reduction (AARR) in stunting was a mere 0.7%, less than half the
current global average (2.1%).9 The global annual average rate of reduction in stunting was 2.1% per year
between 1990 and 2011 and must accelerate to 3.9% in order to reach the WHO target of a 40% reduction
in the number of children in the world who are stunted by 2025.

Although some districts perform better than others, all districts have very high stunting prevalence
according to WHO population cutoffs (See Annex 15). Stunting tends to be higher in those districts with
higher poverty levels and a higher proportion of market orientation in agricultural production.

Impoverishment remains an underlying cause of stunting, with children from the wealthiest households
experiencing the lowest stunting prevalence. The gap between the richest and the poorest has widened over
time due to a greater reduction in stunting among the wealthiest households (Figure 7). However, poverty
is only one of many contributing factors, as evidenced by nearly 40% stunting prevalence amongst the
wealthiest households in 2013. Non-income determinants of stunting, including social, behavioral, and
environmental factors contribute to the high prevalence of stunting among the wealthiest. Perhaps
unsurprising given the concentration of rural poverty, stunting prevalence is higher in rural areas (54.5%)
than urban (38.9%) (TLFNS 2013).

2. Underweight

Underweight was the MDG 1 indicator and, as an indicator, does not distinguish between children who are
thin and children who are short with adequate weight (Gibson 2005). As such, underweight has been
replaced by stunting as the main anthropometric indicator for children (Black et al. 2013). Nearly 38% of
all children under-five were underweight. Underweight prevalence was slightly, but insignificantly, higher
among boys (39.0%) than girls (36.3%) (TLFNS 2013).

3. Wasting

Wasting is an indicator of acute malnutrition and can be caused by insufficient food intake, infectious
disease, or a combination of both factors. The WHO defines wasting as having a weight-for-height that is
greater than two standard deviations below the growth reference for weight-for-height. Severe wasting, i.e.
having a weight-for-height Z-score that is less than three or more times lower than the WHO growth
reference, is one of three criteria10 used to diagnose severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in children. In addition
to increased susceptibility to infections, moderately wasted children are 3 times, and severely wasted
children are 11 times more likely to die than healthy children on average (Khara et al. 2014; McDonald et
al. 2013).

Among children age 0-59 months, total wasting prevalence (WHZ <-2) declined from 18.6% in 2009-10 to
11% in 2013 (Figure 8). Severe wasting declined considerably between 2010 and 2013, from 7.0% to 1.9%,
while moderate wasting decreased from 18.6% to 9.1%. 11 Wasting was higher among urban children
(14.3%) as compared to rural (9.8%) and elevated to levels seen in emergency conditions in Covalima
(17.4%) and Oecusse (19.8%). Perhaps due to the concentration of wasting in urban areas, wasting was
higher among wealthier children than among the poorest: 11.0% of children in the lowest wealth quintile
were wasted as compared with 13.4% of children in the highest wealth quintile.12 The absence of a strong
association between wasting and poverty suggests that factors related to infant and young child feeding,
hygiene, and caregiving (rather than poverty-driven food shortages) may be driving the prevalence of
wasting.

   The other criteria are: having a mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) less than 115mm and or/bilateral pitting edema.
11SAM   defined as WHZ <-3; MAM defined as -3≤ WHZ<-2.
12 This was not, however, a statistically significant difference.

Growth faltering in length and weight generally accumulates across childhood, as suggested by rising
prevalence of stunting among older age children (Figure 9). The greatest increase in stunting prevalence
occurs between the 6-11 months age group and the 12-23 months age group as complementary foods are
introduced and children begin to explore their environments. On the other hand, wasting prevalence is most
common among children between one and two years of age and decreases in prevalence beyond this point
(TLFNS 2013).

1. Vitamin A Deficiency

Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) results from insufficient dietary consumption of vitamin A-rich foods (flesh
foods, liver, green leafy vegetables, etc.) and is often exacerbated by illness (WHO 2012b). VAD is
significantly associated with child morbidity and mortality, poor eye health, and blindness (Black et al.
2008). VAD (serum retinol <0.70 umol/l) has receded from a severe to a mild public health problem
according to WHO cutoffs (2012b). Prevalence declined from 45.8% in a sub-sample of the 2003 DHS to
8.1% in 2013 (DHS 2003; TLFNS 2013).

2. Anemia and Iron-Deficiency Anemia

Anemia is characterized by reduction in red blood cell volume and a decrease in the concentration of
hemoglobin in the blood, resulting in decreased oxygen carrying capacity. Anemia has multiple causes,
including congenital malformations, helminth and parasitic infections, co-existing micronutrient
deficiencies (e.g. B-vitamins) as well as iron deficiency. Infants can be born with low iron stores due to low
birth weight, preterm birth, or being born to anemic mothers (Scholl 2011). Whereas iron stores in healthy
infants can typically last for six months, anemia can emerge as early as 3 months of age in infants born with
low iron stores (Yip and Dallman 1996). Older infants and young children can also become anemic when
they are not fed sufficient iron-rich complementary foods after six months. Globally, iron deficiency anemia
tends to peak at 18 months of age and then decline as iron needs decrease (Black et al. 2008).

In Timor-Leste, there was a considerable increase in anemia among children (age 6-59 months) between
2009-2010 (38.2%) and 2013 (63.2%). There is no clear understanding of the cause of the rise in anemia
prevalence between the two survey periods, though it is not currently attributed to methodological
differences. Relative to other countries, anemia prevalence appears to peak at a younger age among children
in Timor-Leste, with the highest prevalence among the 6-11 month age group (Figure 11) (TLFNS 2013).
There are no significant differences in anemia among children based upon sex, area of residence, or
household wealth. Malaria and helminth infections were not measured in the survey.

3. Zinc Deficiency

Zinc plays an important role in protein synthesis, cell function, and immunity. Consequently, deficiency is
associated with morbidity, mortality, and a small negative effect on child linear growth (Black et al. 2013).
In 2013, 34% of Timorese children were zinc deficient (TLFNS 2013).14

C. Undernutrition in Women
Maternal nutritional status is a critical determinant of a mother’s own health as well as that of her offspring.
Figure 12 summarizes trends in the anthropometric status of women of reproductive age (WRA).15 Short
stature has remained unchanged over the past decade, whereas maternal underweight has seen a steady
decline.




14
   Zinc deficiency can be directly measured through serum concentration; however, serum zinc is not commonly measured and the
WHO does not yet have cutoffs for population prevalence of zinc deficiency. However, the International Zinc Nutrition
Consultative Group suggests a lower cutoff of <8.7 umol/L for serum zinc for non-fasting children under age 10 with afternoon
sample collection (IZiNCG 2012).

Body mass index.


1. Short stature (height <145 cm)

Short stature (<145 cm) among women results from both poor nourishment and environmental effects on
growth (Black et al. 2013). Short stature among mothers increases risk of maternal death (Black et al. 2008)
and of perpetuating the cycle of malnutrition through increased risk of low birth weight and infants being
born too Small for their Gestational Age (SGA). There is no universal population cut-off for public health
significance, however Timor-Leste has prevalence of maternal short stature (13.0%) comparable to many
South Asian countries.

2. Underweight (Thinness)

Thinness, or low maternal BMI (BMI<18.5 kg/m2) among mothers also increases risk of LBW and SGA
among offspring. In 2013, nearly one quarter (24.8%) of non-pregnant mothers in Timor-Leste were
underweight (TLFNS 2013), representing high prevalence or a serious situation (WHO 2012b).
Underweight was most pronounced among young mothers: 41.8% of mothers under age 20 were
underweight, considered to be a critical situation among this sub-population.

3. Vitamin A Deficiency

VAD among women can cause night blindness, especially during pregnancy. The TLFNS did not ask
women about clinical vitamin A deficiency (e.g. night blindness) but assessed sub-clinical VAD (serum
retinol <1.05 umol/L). In Timor-Leste, 13.5% of women are vitamin A deficient.16

4. Anemia and Iron-Deficiency Anemia

Iron-deficiency anemia among adults is largely caused by low consumption of iron-rich foods and causes
decreased productivity for both men and women. However, women have elevated risk of anemia due to
their loss of blood during menstruation and the high iron demands of pregnancy (Black et al. 2013). Anemia
during pregnancy increases the risk of maternal and perinatal mortality. Short inter-pregnancy intervals are

     There are no population cutoffs to assess the public health significance of sub-clinical vitamin A deficiency among women.

                                                                                                                                  22
associated with higher probability of anemia and stillbirths (Conde-Agudelo et al. 2012). It is suggested
that anemia during pregnancy may increase the risk of low iron stores among the infant, independent of
gestational age and birth weight (Scholl 2011). Anemia among WRA increased from 21.3% in 2009-10 to
39.5% in 2013 and is classified as a moderate public health problem (WHO 2012b). In 2013, anemia was
highest (42.6%) among women in the 35-45 years age group and more pronounced among women living
in urban (46.7%) as compared to rural (36.6%) areas. The greatest anemia prevalence was also seen among
women in the highest wealth quintile (45.7%) (TLFNS 2013).

5. Iodine Deficiency

Iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) are a leading cause of preventable cognitive impairment globally.
Maternal iodine deficiency, in particular, is a concern given its adverse consequences for fetal development
and child intelligence quotient (IQ). Children born to iodine deficient mothers experience average deficits
of 12.5-13.5 IQ points (Bleichrodt and Born 1994; Qian et al 2005). The TLFNS reports prevalence of
iodine deficiency (urinary iodine excretion (UIE))17 <100 mcg/dL) among non-pregnant mothers of 26.7%
and a median urinary iodine concentration of 170 ug/L among non-pregnant, non-lactating women.18

D. Overweight/Obesity in Children and Adults
Child overweight and obesity is a growing concern in the EAP region. Child overweight increases risk of
overweight in adulthood and can trigger the early onset of NCDs. Though the prevalence has doubled since
2009-10, child overweight in Timor-Leste remains low (1.5%), and considerably below neighboring
countries such as Papua New Guinea (13.8%) and Indonesia (11.5%) (UNICEF-WHO-World Bank 2015).

Overweight (BMI ≥25.0) among adults is a growing concern globally as well as in Timor-Leste. In addition
to increasing risk of diet-related NCDs diseases, obesity during pregnancy increases risk of gestational
diabetes, maternal death and hemorrhage, birth asphyxia, and newborn mortality. In Timor-Leste, 11.2%
of the adult population (18-69) was overweight with the prevalence higher in females (16.7%)19 than males
(8.2%) (WHO 2015b). There was very little evidence of progression to obesity (0.9% prevalence) (WHO
2015). The overweight prevalence among mothers in Dili (19.8%) was nearly twice the national average
(10.2%). The prevalence of overweight among women remains below neighboring Indonesia (25.3%) and
Papua New Guinea (50.3%), yet the more than five-fold increase in overweight among women from 2003-
2014 is concerning (Figure 13). It is possible that these rates of overweight are an underestimate of the true
population risk of non-communicable disease. This is in part due to a WHO recommendation to lower
public health action points for overweight/obesity among Asian populations given the higher percentage of
body fat at lower BMIs (and thus higher risk of disease such as diabetes and heart disease) (WHO 2004).




17
   UIE is an indicator of population status, and it should not be used to assess individual status.
18 The ‘adequate’ range for lactating women is urinary iodine ≥100 ug/L (WHO 2013a).
19 The 2014 STEPs survey results demonstrate a large increase in overweight over the 2013 estimate in the TLFNS. This may in

part due to survey inclusion criteria, with TLFNS sampling only mothers and including younger females.

The STEPs survey reports high rates of other components of the metabolic syndrome: 28.0% of women and
45.3% of men have high blood pressure.20 Nearly all (97.3%) of these individuals were not currently on
medication for their elevated blood pressure. Furthermore, 21.0% of the adult population had elevated total
cholesterol21, with the prevalence higher among women, while only 4.1% of the total population has
impaired fasting glycaemia (WHO 2015b). 22

E. Discussion of Gaps and Opportunities
Despite experiencing rapid poverty reduction since 2007, Timor-Leste has one of the highest stunting rates
in the world, and wasting, anemia, and iodine deficiency remain a concern. Acute malnutrition rates among
children under five are similar to other countries experiencing conflict and emergency situations, but the
burden of overweight among adults (especially females) is rapidly rising. Still, high malnutrition
(underweight, anemia) among women contributes to low birth weight, anemia, and growth faltering among
infants and young children and perpetuates an inter-generational cycle of malnutrition.

Stunting is arguably the most salient nutrition issue from a global public health nutrition perspective, though
it remains a somewhat sensitive and poorly understood concept in Timor-Leste. Stunting is not commonly
recognized as a form of malnutrition and is instead understood to be a genetic issue. There is very limited
understanding of what optimal child growth ‘looks like,’ nor awareness of the WHO Multicenter Growth
Reference Study’s (MGRS) pivotal finding that “when health and key environmental needs are met, the
world’s children grow very similarly (de Onis 2006). Further confusion arises from the use of language:
krekas, the common term for malnutrition in Timor-Leste, refers only to wasting. Stunting, on the other
hand, does not translate well into Tetum: badak signifies general shortness; isin kee signifies small body.

   Raised blood pressure (BP) defined as (systolic BP ≥ 140 and/or diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg or currently on medication for raised
BP.
21 Raised total cholesterol defined as total cholesterol ≥ 5.0 mmol/L or ≥ 190 mg/dl or currently on medication for raised cholesterol .
22 Impaired fasting glycaemia as defined below capillary whole blood value ≥5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dl) and <6.1 mmol/L (110

mg/dl).

                                                                                                                                    24
The MOH has recently introduced the term raes badak to denote stunting, though this new term is not
widely recognized among institutional partners and the general public, alike.

Through the review, several notable gaps emerged:
    Very few children are weighed at birth, and low birth weight is an indicator of the in utero origins
       of stunting.
    There is very limited evidence on adolescent nutrition in Timor-Leste. The TLFNS only collected
       data on women as young as age 14 if they were mothers, and as such there is a considerable gap in
       data availability on young, non-pregnant women of reproductive age. Moreover, there is no data
       on overweight among adolescents, as the overweight/obesity data is currently limited only to young
       child and adult samples from health and nutrition surveys.
    Despite the alarming increase in anemia prevalence between 2009 and 2013, there has not been a
       study to identify the etiology and potential causes of anemia in women and children.
    A limited number of indicators are collected for nutrition surveillance purposes through the MOH.
       However, these are of limited quality, and generally only include underweight and wasting (as
       identified mid-upper arm circumference) as indicators of child nutritional status. The revised
       growth card (LISIO) will monitor height and age, including other useful measurements.

     CHAPTER 3 KEY MESSAGES
       1. With very high prevalence of malnutrition, all immediate and underlying causes of
           malnutrition appear to be present and significantly associated with stunting in Timor-Leste.
       2. There are no known quantitative surveys of dietary intake in the country.
       3. Low continued breastfeeding (among children 6-23 months) and dietary diversity are key
           constraining factors in achieving acceptable diets for infants and young children.
       4. Early age at first birth, low contraceptive prevalence, and high fertility are risk factors for
           anemia and low birth weight and perpetuate a cycle of malnutrition across generations.
       5. Timorese women are exposed to multiple forms of disempowerment and toxic stress which
           can undermine nutrient absorption, impair mental health and caregiving practices, and stunt
           brain development (when also experienced by children).
       6. Poor service delivery quality, intermittent facility readiness, and physical remoteness limit
           consumption of essential health and nutrition services, including vaccination, ante-/post-natal
           care, and contraception.
       7. Open defecation and suboptimal hygiene practices increase exposure to infectious disease and
           may limit nutrient absorption and contribute to growth faltering.
       8. Low demand, as well as limited production and market availability of animal source foods
           contributes to low consumption.
       9. Households prioritize purchases of staple food (especially rice) and will sell nutrient-rich
           foods to be able to do so.
       10. The very high prevalence of stunting makes Timor-Leste an outlier relative to other countries
           at similar levels of macroeconomic development.
       11. Increasing consumption of packaged and processed convenience foods may be driving the rise
           in overweight and diet-related NCD risk factors.


A. Framework for Understanding Malnutrition in Timor-Leste
The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) conceptual framework for maternal and child
undernutrition is an internationally recognized framework describing the immediate, underlying, and basic
determinants of malnutrition.23 Recently, the framework has been updated to incorporate determinants of
overweight/obesity (Figure 14). The following sections draw upon the UNICEF and Lancet (2013)
frameworks (Figure 5, above) to review available data on the immediate, basic, and underlying determinants
of undernutrition in Timor-Leste.




23
   Individually, each determining factor is necessary, but not sufficient, to ensure adequate nutrition at the individual level. Actions
at each level are to be identified based on the given context through assessment and analysis of each country’s unique situat ion.
The framework is not intended to offer a pre-packaged set of technical interventions; rather it promotes a method for countries to
assess and analyze their malnutrition situation and identify appropriate and realistic interventions, ordering them in a logical
sequence reflecting the country-specific context.


                                                                                                                                    26

B. Determinants of Undernutrition

1. Immediate Causes: Nutrient Intake and Disease

Insufficient, or inappropriate nutrient intake is an immediate cause of child undernutrition.24 A number of
factors contribute to insufficient nutrient intake among Timorese children, including: low exclusive
breastfeeding, low dietary diversity (particularly during the lean season and in rural areas), early weaning,
and low meal frequency.

1.1. Breastfeeding
Breastfeeding forms the foundation of early life nutrition. The WHO recommends initiating breastfeeding
within one hour of birth, followed by exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) through six months in order to reduce
the risk of infection and ensure optimum nutrition (WHO 2013b). Rates of early initiation of breastfeeding
(EIBF) and EBF have risen rapidly since 2003 (Table 5), with Timor-Leste having the highest prevalence



24  As the literature review did not reveal any quantitative nutrient intake data for mothers, infants, or young children in Timor-
Leste, here we consider maternal, infant, and young child dietary practices as a proxy for nutrient intake, focusing (not exclusively)
on quantitative data from the TLFNS and DHS. Annex 2 summarizes additional qualitative data related to nutrition knowledge,
attitudes, and practices.

                                                                                                                                  27
of EIBF in EAP (Figure 15). EIBF is important as early skin-to-skin contact increases duration of
breastfeeding and mother child bonding (Moore et al. 2009).

Timorese infants are often breastfed at least predominantly—if not exclusively—for the first three to four
months (Table 5). There is considerable variability in EBF across districts, but there is little influence of
household wealth on breastfeeding status (TLFNS 2013). The mean duration of EBF was 2.95 months, and
37.6% of 5-month old children were exclusively breastfed. Exclusive breastfeeding through six months is
recommended to improve infant and maternal health, reducing the infant’s exposure to disease and
gastrointestinal illness as well as suppressing the mother’s fertility (Kramer and Kakuma 2001). Women
generally report consistent knowledge that infants should be exclusively breastfed without any solid food
for the first six months, and that breastmilk was more nutritious and offered immunity to the baby (Ba
Futuru and Rain Barrel Communications 2016).

Providing food and liquids other than breastmilk during the first six months impedes optimal breastfeeding
practices. Pre-lacteal and early neonatal feeding25 are sometimes practiced in Timor-Leste, with roughly
one in ten infants receiving anything other than breastmilk in the first three days of life. There are reports
that colostrum is traditionally discarded and newborns may be fed sugar water while the first milk is
expressed. Focus group discussions in five districts26 revealed that immediate breastfeeding and feeding of
colostrum are not traditional among many Timorese (TAIS and MOH 2007). However, health and nutrition
education programs have focused on delivering messages around the importance of feeding the first milk,
and there is evidence that this practice is changing (CRS and Monash University 2015). Barriers reported
to feeding colostrum include: the belief that breastmilk does not start straight away, or may not come until
the baby has a name suitable to the ancestors; and the belief that colostrum is dirty or bad for the baby
(TAIS and MOH 2007).

Continued breastfeeding beyond six months promotes the health of both mother and child. Early weaning,
on the other hand, contributes to poor dietary adequacy and nutrient intake among Timorese infants and
young children. The 2009-10 DHS reported that one third (32.4%) of children age 12-17 months were not
breastfeeding at all. Breastfeeding rates often decline as women go back to work. Women working in the
informal sector do not have any maternity protection, though the National Labor Law includes paid
maternity leave for 12 weeks for women working in the formal sector. However, there is no allowance for
breaks or work site accommodation for breastfeeding women at work. For women working in the informal
sector or rural areas, children are often left at home with the mother in-law or another caretaker.

Factors which contribute to early weaning include: perceptions of insufficient breastmilk production; the
belief that breastfeeding during pregnancy and illness may harm the mother and the fetus; and that
breastmilk can ‘go cold’ when mothers are away for a whole day. Mothers and grandmothers may believe
that breastfeeding is not enough for the baby, and that a child is ‘old enough’ to stop breastfeeding by ten
months of age (Osei et al. 2014; CRS and Monash University 2015). These and other perceptions can result
in the early cessation of breastfeeding. Non-breastfed infants and young children do not commonly consume
other milk feeds (infant formula, milk, or yogurt) twice per day (TLFNS 2013). Without additional milk
consumption, early weaning is particularly detrimental to Infant Young Child (IYC) nutrient intake
(Brewster 2014). There is increasing market penetration of Indonesian formula milk and mothers would
purchase these products for their infants if they had more money (Osei et al 2014).

1.2. Complementary Feeding
According to the TLFNS, minimum acceptable diet27 among children age 6-23 months is extremely low
(17.6%) and particularly alarming among non-breastfed children: only 3.5% achieved the target minimum
acceptable diet. Overall, low minimum acceptable diet is due less in part to meal frequency than low dietary
diversity: only 27.5% of children 6-23 months consumed at least four groups from out of seven during the
previous day, with staple foods and vitamin A rich fruits and vegetables being the most commonly
consumed foods (Figure 16). A plain, watery rice porridge (sosoro) is often the first complementary food
to be introduced and is rarely mixed with other ingredients (typically only vegetables). Despite having
widespread knowledge of the health benefits of feeding children a variety of foods, over 60% of households

27 Minimum acceptable diet (MAD) is a standard WHO (2010) indicator for Infant and Young Child Feeding. MAD has two

components: minimum dietary diversity and minimum meal frequency. Minimum dietary diversity is the proportion of children 6-
23 months of age who receive foods from 4 or more food groups (out of 7 food groups) during the previous day. Minimum meal
frequency is the proportion of breastfed and non-breastfed children 6-23 months of age who receive solid, semi-solid, or soft foods
(but also including milk feeds for non-breastfed children) the minimum number of times or more (where the number of times varies
depending on the child’s age).

                                                                                                                               29
reported feeding children a meal with only a starch “every day” or “several times a week (Ba Futuru and
Rain Barrel Communications 2016).

Animal source foods (eggs, milk and other dairy, flesh foods) are critical sources of essential fats, protein,
vitamins, and minerals. Low consumption of meat, fish, and/or poultry is the main cause of iron-deficiency
anemia, especially in poor people (Black et al. 2008; Bhargava et al. 2001). However, the 2009-10 DHS
notes that only 29% of breastfed children 6-8 months old consume flesh foods or eggs (NSD and ICF Macro
2010). A number of factors drive the low consumption of animal source foods among infants and young
children, including: (a) insufficient availability and affordability of these foods; (b) low demand for animal
source foods, driven by poor knowledge of appropriate feeding for infants and young children, in general;
and (c) cultural practices which result in sporadic consumption of animal source foods. Generally, financial
resources are reserved for purchasing animal foods for consumption during cultural ceremonies -- the only
time women may consume flesh foods during a given month is during their participation in these rituals.
According to the TLFNS, almost 90% of households reported raising chickens, yet eggs and meat are not
often given to children, and it is not uncommon for households to prioritize the sale—rather than home
consumption—of these animal products.

1.3. Maternal Nutrient Intake
A woman’s own nutritional status at the time of conception, throughout pregnancy, and during lactation
can affect the intergenerational transfer of malnutrition. Immediate, in utero causes of undernutrition in
offspring include inadequate maternal dietary intake of protein and micronutrients early in pregnancy. The
Timorese diet is rich in starches and low in iron and protein-rich animal source foods; among the foods
commonly consumed by mothers are: corn, peanuts, mung beans, rice, cassava, pumpkin leave, vegetables,
rice porridge and ginger (TAIS and MOH 2007). In a modified, non-quantitative seven-day food frequency
questionnaire, mothers of children under two reported consuming flesh foods fewer than one day per week,
with eggs (1.1 days) and legumes (1.5 days) consumed slightly more frequently (CRS and Monash
University 2015). In addition to poor micronutrient intake, there is concern of insufficient caloric intake
among pregnant women, particularly as caloric requirements increase during the second and third
trimesters.28 Key factors underlying maternal insufficiency to meet the nutrient demands of pregnancy
include: (i) competition for nutrients between mother and fetus in the case of adolescent pregnancy (WHO
2007); (ii) the high energy demands of women in agriculture; (iii) the general depletion of micro- and
macronutrients stores in women due to the high number of pregnancies too closely spaced; and (iv) any
concurrent infections during pregnancy.

1.4. Infectious Disease
Undernutrition and illness occur in a negative synergistic cycle: undernutrition suppresses the body’s ability
to fight infections while infections, reduce appetite, increase nutrient requirements, and impair nutrient
absorption. Diarrhea decreases nutrient absorption, reduces appetite, increases risk of dehydration. It is
therefore associated with both acute malnutrition and stunting. According to the 2013 TLFNS, nearly half
of children age 0-59 months were reported to have experienced any sickness in the previous two weeks,
with 16.7% reporting diarrhea. Sickness as more commonly reported among urban children (50.7%) than
rural (46.5%), suggestive of a possible association between illness and wasting in urban areas.

Proper care and feeding during diarrhea contributes to recovery, while suboptimal feeding and treatment
can result in increased severity and duration of diarrhea. According to the TLFNS, only 23.8% of children
experiencing diarrhea in the two weeks prior to the survey received proper feeding during illness.29
Furthermore, Timorese mothers sometimes interpret diarrhea as a normal part of childhood, thus limiting
timely and appropriate care-seeking for diarrheal episodes (Mizumoto et al 2015). Only 50% of caregivers
report that they would take their child to the clinic immediately if the child has diarrhea, compared to only
10% reporting the same if the child experienced bloody stool (Ba Futuru and Rain Barrel Communication
2016). Poor access to safe water and improved sanitation, as well as suboptimal hygiene practices (see
Health Services and Health Environment, below) likely contribute to poor nutrient absorption and increased
infectious disease.

Among women and children, malaria and helminth infections can contribute to elevated levels of anemia.
Malaria transmission incidence is less than 1%, while there has been a 97% reduction in malaria cases and
93% reduction in malaria deaths between 2006 and 2012. According to the 2015 World Malaria Report,
two thirds of the population live in low-transmission or malaria free zones (Table 6) (WHO 2015c). Malaria
in pregnancy is associated with growth restriction in utero and increases risk of infant mortality.

Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections, such as hookworm and roundworm contribute to undernutrition
and increased risk of anemia due to blood-loss, impaired nutrient absorption, and decreased appetite.
Though there are no national-level estimates of these parasitic infections, an on-going randomized
community trial in Manufahi reveals endemic STH prevalence. Nearly three quarters (72%) of individuals
had an STH infection. N. Americanus was the most common parasite, causing 62% of all infections
(Campbell et al. forthcoming).

1.5. Aflatoxin Exposure
Aflatoxin exposure is very high in Timor-Leste and may be a contributing factor to stunted growth.
Aflatoxin is a naturally occurring byproduct of the Aspergillus fungi which grows on commonly produced
staple food commodities if not processed and stored properly, particularly maize and groundnuts (peanuts).
While aflatoxin exposure is a known risk factor for liver cancer and can be lethal to humans in large doses,
the impact of chronic, low-dose exposure over time is not well understood. It is hypothesized that long-
term, low-dose aflatoxin exposure may suppress the immune system and increase infection or alter nutrient
absorption, ultimately leading to growth faltering among young children (Smith et al 2012).30 In 2013,
detectable aflatoxin exposure levels31 in Timorese children (6-59 months of age) and non-pregnant mothers
(age 14-60 years) were 83.0% and 81.4%, respectively. Significantly lower prevalence of aflatoxin
exposure was seen among children living in urban areas (75.8%) when compared with children living in
rural areas (87.1%), an unsurprising finding given the higher risk of aflatoxin exposure among members of
subsistence households. The government has called for additional research to understand the levels of
exposure in the population, causes, and potential mitigation strategies, but little additional attention has
been paid to the issue.

2. Underlying Causes

2.1. Care for Women and Children
Care for women and children—along with access to the necessary caring resources—is a critical underlying
determinant of optimum nutrition. Elements of care resources for women and children include: (a) women’s
education and employment opportunities; (b) maternal physical and mental health; (c) women’s
empowerment, social status, and control over resources; as well as (d) knowledge and beliefs. (Engel et al.
1999).




30
   Small observational studies have demonstrated associations between aflatoxin exposure and child growth (Gong et al 2002,
Turner et al 2007), but there is not yet conclusive causal evidence of the association.

2.1.1. Women’s Education
Women’s education is widely recognized as a determinant of optimal maternal and child care practices and
has been a key driver of reductions in undernutrition over the past 40 years (Smith and Haddad 2014).
Women’s education is important not only for increasing health literacy, knowledge, and economic
opportunity, but also for delaying the onset of pregnancy and childbirth (Table 7). Roughly 20% of 19 year
olds had started childbearing, and adolescent pregnancy is higher among women with little or no education
than among those with secondary or higher levels of education (NSD and ICF Macro 2010). Young girls
who are not physically mature have elevated risk of entering pregnancy with anemia and other micronutrient
deficiencies. Across Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs), children of mothers with a young age at
first pregnancy (<19 years old) are more likely to be born with low birth weight, preterm, and be stunted at
age 2 years when compared with children whose mothers were 20-24 years old (Fall et al. 2015). If
adolescent girls are still growing when they become pregnant, they can compete with their fetus in order to
meet their own nutritional needs (Scholl and Hediger 1993).

There is considerable variation in female secondary school enrollment across districts: gross attendance
ratios are 42% in Oecusse and 94% in Dili.Nationally, only 15.8% of women age 15-49 reported completing
secondary school (SD and ICF Macro 2010). Interventions to increase secondary school completion can
contribute to older age at marriage and first pregnancy, improving the chances that women enter pregnancy
with adequate nutritional reserves.

2.1.2. Women’s Social Status and Employment
In rural subsistence communities in Timor-Leste, traditional gender roles, relationships, and norms are still
adhered to: men are expected to be the Chefe Familia and stronger than women, while women are expected
to be wise and loving (Niner et al. 2013). Women play important roles in the domestic and private sphere,
yet they have limited opportunities for education, economic development, and political engagement. In a
survey of 500 rural young men, nearly nine in ten (89%) agreed with women’s equal rights to study, work,
and respect. However, these perceptions do not often translate into changes in household behavior, and men
still expect to be able to maintain power and control in relationships. Women who wish to work or study
outside of the home must also meet expectations for care and domestic services in the household
(Wigglesworth et al. 2015).

Improving women’s status and increasing their control over productive resources is associated with
improvements in children’s education, health, and nutrition (Quisumbing 2003). There are indications of
growing empowerment in women, particularly urban young women. According to the 2009-10 DHS almost
half of women married women are employed, but most are not paid for their work (Figure 17). Though men
also tend to go unpaid, the proportion of women who are unpaid is nearly double that of men. One quarter

(25.9%) of women report earning more cash than their husbands, and one third of women report having full
control over their earnings (up from 12% in 2003).

As education increases, Timorese women become less likely to take their own decisions and more likely to
make joint decisions. Though marital cooperation can be seen as a form of empowerment, it is also possible
that joint decision-making is not truly reflective of women’s status. A recent study indicated that joint
decision making is often dominated by men, and may actually serve as a means of mitigating the risk of
domestic violence (Grenfell et al. 2015). For example, women are more likely than men to agree with
justified wife beating, demonstrating profound cultural norms of inferiority which are deeply embedded in
women’s psyche (NSD and ICF Macro 2010).32

2.1.3. Stress, Violence, and Mental Health
Conflict, domestic violence, and marital control can increase exposure to chronic stress, undermining
women’s physical health, nutrient absorption, mental health, and child caring abilities (Sapolsky 2004).
Women and children in Timor-Leste are victimized by various forms of structural and cultural violence,
including child marriages, corporal punishment in the home or schools, and domestic violence (including
marital rape). Poverty intensifies the stress on women in these circumstances (Silove et al. 2015).

Ultimately, this stress and depression can result in child undernutrition due to poor maternal caring
practices, including poor mother child bonding, and poor breastfeeding practices—a critical component of
optimum child nutrition (Engle et al. 1999). A recent study published in Lancet Psychiatry found depression
in 22% of the study population of pregnant and postpartum Timorese women, with 9% diagnosed with post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Children of mothers with depression or depressive symptoms were more



32
  For example, 64% of women and 44% of men believe a husband is justified in beating his wife if she argues with him; 72% of
women and 65% of men believe a beating is justified if the wife goes out without telling him (NSD and ICF Macro 2010).


                                                                                                                         34
likely to be underweight or stunted (Surkan et al. 2011).33 Even before birth, the elevated stress hormones
in a mother abused in pregnancy can have an effect on the developing brain. Furthermore, studies in South
Asia have demonstrated the risks to a women’s own nutritional status, as women’s acceptance of physical
abuse is associated with anemia and underweight status in women (Atwood et al. 2014; Ackerson and
Subramanian 2008).

The history of violence in Timor-Leste is cited for its contribution to ongoing violence against women.
Meiksin et al. (2014) attribute the high prevalence of marital control and Gender-Based Violence (GBV)
to: (i) the patriarchal society organized around strict gender roles and norms of male dominance and a lower
status of women, (ii) the tradition of a bride price where the grooms family feels ownership over the woman
after paying the price, (iii) cultural violence that validates the practice of wife-beating as a way to educate
or control women, (iv) the history of violence in a society full of conflict. Throughout occupation, men and
women were traumatized. According to one report, men who had survived detention and torture admitted
to having “fallen into a pattern of violent behavior,” (Meiksin et al. 2014).

Given the tendency for underreporting of violence against women, the expanded report on domestic
violence in the 2009-2010 DHS paints a grim picture of the extent of physical violence, sexual violence,
and marital control in Timor-Leste.34 More than one-third (38%) of 15-49 year old Timorese women
reported experiencing either physical and/or sexual violence by their present or most recent partner.
Furthermore, 29% of women experienced physical violence often or sometimes in the past 12 months.
Urban women are more likely to have ever experienced physical violence and the proportion of physically
abused women is highest among those with secondary education (46%) and in the highest wealth quintile
(45%). It is possible that these women are more at risk because they have deviated the most from the
cultural norms of the patriarchal society, or alternatively, that their wealth and education make them more
likely to report violence.

Sexual violence is not commonly reported due to cultural taboos and perceptions of sexual empowerment.
A survey of young men found that 31% of young men do not think that forced sex is a form of violence,
and 42% do not agree that women can refuse sex with their husbands (Wigglesworth et al. 2015). On the
other hand 51% of women agreed with all three reasons for refusing sex35, while one in five believed that
these were not justifiable reasons. Refusing sex was most acceptable to urban women and those with higher
education. The men most likely to accept these reasons were urban, educated and wealthy (NSD and ICF
Macro 2010). Improving nutrition in the first 1,000 days of life will require a transformation of gender
norms and practices which can reduce exposure to violence and stress and increase women’s access to
social and economic resources.




33
   Surkan et al. conducted a metanalysis of 17 studies done in developing countries which included a total of 13,923 mother and
child pairs from 11 countries. The analysis from three longitudinal studies showed an OR for underweight of 2.2 and for stunting
2.0.
34 The report included a 23-page chapter on Domestic Violence reporting on the results of structured interviews with approximately

3000 women (one in three households were sampled). A sub-sample was selected for questions about sexual violence and violence
during pregnancy. The final results offer the most current record of domestic violence in Timor-Leste. However, it should be noted
that measuring the magnitude of domestic violence in any country is difficult for a variety of reasons, including: the private,
sensitive nature of the issue; social stigma and cultural acceptability which inhibit reporting; and threats to the welfare of the
reporters.
35 Questions in the Timor-Leste DHS explored three reasons for not having sex: (i) he has a sexually transmitted infection, (ii) she

knows he’s had sex with other women, (iii) she is tired or not in the mood.


                                                                                                                                35
2.2. Health Services and Health Environment
Timor-Leste has improved access to health facilities and health services since independence. Over 70% of
Timorese health facilities were destroyed in the war preceding independence and fewer than two dozen
doctors remained in the country (Cabral et al. 2013). According to the Ministry of Health, there were 307
health facilities in 2011, and the number of health posts and health clinics continues to increase
dramatically. Despite these improvements, physical inaccessibility—including road conditions and
transportation availability/affordability—limits timely consumption of health services. Roughly one quarter
of households resided more than 2 hours from their routine health provider (Deen et al. 2013) and distance
was reported by over half (53.3%) of women as a problem when seeking health services (NSD and ICF
Macro 2010).

Supply-side bottlenecks—including facility readiness and functionality, as well as low service delivery
quality—limit the coverage of essential health services. The 2014 joint WHO-World Bank framework for
monitoring progress towards UHC recommends a number of indicators to assess coverage of essential
health services (WHO and World Bank 2014).36 When compared to ASEAN countries, Timor-Leste has
generally low coverage levels of essential health services (Table 8). Women report a high degree of ANC
care-seeking but it is not always timely: two-thirds of women (62.3%) attended ANC during the first
trimester of their most recent pregnancy (NSD and ICF Macro 2010).

Demand-side constraints are an additional impediment to greater health care utilization. A recent review
indicated that one in ten households did not seek health care during a family member’s recent illness (Deen
et al. 2013). Poor knowledge of danger signs of childhood illness may also lead to delayed care-seeking

   The Framework suggests 11 indicators: satisfaction of family planning needs; at least four antenatal care visits for pregnant
women; measles vaccination in children; improved water source; adequate sanitation; nonuse of tobacco; skilled birth attendance
during delivery; antiretroviral therapy; TB case detection and treatment success; hypertension treatment; and diabetes treatment.
However, cross-country comparable data are not yet available for all indicators and, in some cases, are only available for a variation
of the recommended indicator data.

                                                                                                                                  36
and poorer outcomes (Ba Futuru and Rain Barrel Communications 2016). Repeated contacts with a health
system offering sporadic service availability and service delivery readiness may discourage future care-
seeking: 82.4% of women were concerned there would be no provider available during their next health
care visit, and 86.6% were concerned there would be no drugs available when they sought health care (NSD
and ICF Macro 2010).

2.2.1. Access to Maternal and Reproductive Health services
Reproductive health contributes to maternal micronutrient deficiencies and impaired fetal growth. A variety
of factors influence the degree to which women utilize available reproductive and maternal health services,
these include: women’s degree of independence in decision making power, cultural closeness, religious
values, and the desirability of children. The religious institutions may have a strong voice in the national
family planning dialogue in Timor-Leste, but there is less conclusive evidence regarding the degree to
which religion affects individual contraceptive decisions (Richards 2014; Wallace 2014). Roughly one
quarter of women (22.3%) were using any form of contraception, a figure much lower than other ASEAN
countries (NSD and ICF Macro 2010).

2.2.2. Access to Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene
Poor sanitation and access to drinking water, as well as poor hygiene practices, lead to infection and
undernutrition. Exposure to fecal contamination in the environment (due to unsafe disposal of infant and
child feces, open defecation, exposure to soil contaminated with human and animal feces, and poor hand
hygiene practices) increases the diarrheal disease burden (Mara et al. 2010). Even when exposure to feces
does not cause diarrhea, it can still impair nutrient absorption and lead to malnutrition (Humphrey 2009).
Chronic exposure to pathogens may trigger a subclinical infection in the small intestine (known as
environmental enteropathy) which results in inflammation and decreased surface area for nutrient
absorption. Furthermore, human and animal fecal matter can contaminate drinking water and soil and lead
to the transmission of bacterial, protozoa and helminth infections, decreased appetite, and anemia. In low-
income countries, it is common for children to be exposed to feces and associated pathogens when feeding,
exploring, and playing in their household environments.

In Timor-Leste, 64.4% and 50.6% of households had access to improved water sources and sanitation,
respectively, while one third of households reported an absence of hand washing facilities (TLFNS 2013).
The rate of sanitation improvement needs to accelerate to keep pace with population growth and
MDG/NSDP goals of 55% rural sanitation by 2015 (100% by 2030) and 80% urban sanitation by 2015
(100% by 2030). Household environments, particularly in rural areas, tend to be fairly unhygienic. The
TLFNS reports that 26.1% of households defecate in the bush/yard/forest, an improvement from 42.5% in
the 2003 DHS. It is not common to pen animals: chickens, dogs, and pigs tend to roam freely.

WASH-related knowledge and practices can contribute to the spread of disease and ultimately, malnutrition.
While the vast majority of households report that there are moments during the day when they think hands
should be washed, there is not sufficient knowledge of all the key moments for handwashing. Three in four
households report that hands should be washed after defecating and 80% before eating, compared to 35%
before feeding an infant or baby, 50% before preparing food; 19% after changing a baby. Less than 2% of
respondents report that hands should be cleaned to control health or prevent sickness. Most respondents
(96%) agree that “washing my hands with soap or ashes is easy for me” but 69% report that there are times
when they would like to wash their hands but are unable to. The most common reason (77%) is no water is
available, followed by being too busy (50%) (Ba Futuru and Rain Barrel Communications 2016).

2.3. Food Insecurity
Food insecurity37 has four dimensions: availability, access, utilization, and stability, all of which are a
concern in Timor-Leste.

2.3.1. Food Availability
According to FAO, there is sufficient food available to meet the country’s caloric ne eds38 (FAO 2015).
However, a large share of dietary energy comes from starchy staple foods, including cereals (rice, wheat,
maize), roots, and tubers (Figure 18). These are calorie dense but do not provide significant levels of
bioavailable protein and micronutrients. Over the past 40 years, 18% of global stunting reduction has been
attributed to increasing the percent of dietary energy from non-staples 39 (Smith and Haddad 2014) but
relatively modest improvements have been experienced in Timor-Leste.

2.3.2. Household Food Security: Accessibility and Affordability
With regard to total quantity of food available, household food security40 is not reported as key constraint
to optimum nutrition. According to the TLFNS, the majority of households reported an ‘acceptable’


37
   The World Food Summit defines food security as “when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficien t,
safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life” (FAO 1996).
38 Average dietary energy supply adequacy expresses the Dietary Energy Supply (kcal/capita/day) as a percentage of the Average

Dietary Energy Requirement (ADER). Each country's or region's average supply of calories for food consumption is normalized
by the average dietary energy requirement estimated for its population to provide an index of adequacy of the food supply in terms
of calories. There has been small but steady increase to 104% for the period 2012-2014, though this figure remains well below the
average for South East Asia (120%).
39 The author’s model the impacts of improvements in six underlying determinants of stunting on reduction ach ieved in 142

countries over the period 1970-2012. These include: access to safe water, access to sanitation, female secondary school enrollment,
female-to-male life expectancy ratio, per capita energy dietary supply, and percent of dietary energy from non-staples.
40 Household food security refers to the ability of households to secure, either from own production or purchase, adequate food to
meet dietary needs of all household members.


                                                                                                                               38
household food consumption score (FCS),41 and only 10% of households had a ‘poor’ FCS. However, this
perception of food security does not incorporate access to a nutritionally diverse diet. Factors contributing
to household food insecurity include: (a) lack of income; (b) low crop production diversity; (c) lack of
access to water for horticultural production; and (d) low market prices due to lack of demand. Households
can acquire foods through own production or purchases. Roughly 70% of Timor-Leste’s population resides
in rural areas; most farmers are smallholders and rely upon subsistence production (primarily of staples).
However, rice is associated with wealth and has displaced maize as the main staple food (Figure 19). Only
25% of cropping households grow rice; therefore purchased, imported rice is needed to satisfy much of the
country’s demand (Castro 2013; MAF and SOL 2013).

There is limited market availability and affordability of the diverse, nutrient-dense foods which are
promoted in complementary feeding recommendations and required to achieve optimum child growth.
Formal rural markets (particularly for animal-source foods and horticultural products) are not well-
functioning, constraining food purchase options for those relying on cash income. Though there is no
quantitative evidence from Timor-Leste, a study in the neighboring Nusa Tenggara Timur (NTT) province
of Indonesia demonstrated that only one in four households could afford to meet 100% of an infant’s
nutrient requirements through locally available foods, compared to 80% of households in Surabaya (Baldi
et al. 2013).42 A qualitative study of nutrition knowledge and practices revealed that households may
commonly eat meals with only two food groups, and diet was dependent on cash flow -- availability of cash
would allow the family to buy frozen chicken, else they would eat boiled maize or rice (Ba Futuru and Rain
Barrel Communications 2016).




41  The Food Consumption Score was developed by the World Food Programme and is a composite score based on food frequency,
dietary diversity and relative nutrition importance of different food groups. Dietary diversity is based on the number of individual
foods or food groups consumed over the past 7 days. Source: WFP, 2011.
42 Affordability defined as food expenditure amounting to no more than 70% of household expenditure.




                                                                                                                                39
2.3.3. Food Utilization and Demand
In addition to availability and affordability, food preferences, taboos, convenience, and storage may limit
the desirability43 and utilization of available foods. In Timor-Leste, taboos are widespread but tend to be
very specific: there are a large number of foods which could be taboo, but these are often limited to kin
groups or lineages and cannot necessarily be generalized across households or even districts (Castro 2013).

While urban areas—particularly Dili—have seen increased demand for animal source foods, fruits, and
vegetables, this same trend is not yet evident in rural areas. There is little demand for vegetable protein and
animal source foods outside of the context of rituals and ceremonies. Unsurprisingly, the Market
Development facility estimates the gap between demand and recommended consumption exceeds 50% for
supplementary foods (soybeans, mung beans, and peanuts) and 10% for fresh foods (Australian Aid Market
Development Facility 2013). This low demand contributes to the sluggish pace of rural market development
(Inder et al. 2014), with livestock used as savings and bartered/sold for economic purposes rather than
consumed. Convenience and marketing also shape consumer demand, and instant noodles are found to be
very convenient and more attractive than other foods (Castro 2013). A relatively recent introduction to rural
markets, instant noodles are desirable due to their taste, transportability, ease of preparation, and minimal
requirements for cooking fuel but make little contribution to improving nutrition.

2.3.4. Stability
Transient food insecurity is triggered by seasonal changes, with Timorese households commonly
experiencing a ‘hungry season’ between November and April (MAF and SOL 2013). Nationally, roughly
two-thirds of farmers report facing a food shortage at some point during the year. However, during any
given month there are always more farmers who report experiencing a ‘hunger season’ than there are
farmers who report experiencing a ‘food shortage’ (MAF and SOL 2013). This may be perhaps due to the
fact that Timorese may suggest that they ‘haven’t eaten’ or ‘are hungry’ when there is not sufficient rice
available (although other non-rice staples may be available). The associations between the hungry and dry
seasons, caloric deficit, low birth weight, and dietary diversity have not been well-explored in the Timorese
context.

3. Basic Determinants: Economic Growth

Economic growth is associated with reductions in malnutrition but alone is not sufficient to resolve the
problem. Economic growth has a strong, non-linear relationship with stunting, such that its impact weakens
as GDP rises. Globally, a 10% increase in GDP per capita has been associated with a 6.2% reduction in
stunting (Smith and Haddad 2015). However, economic growth has not been sufficient to reduce stunting
in Timor-Leste, where stunting prevalence is significantly higher than that of other g7+ countries as well
as its ASEAN neighbors (Figure 20). Admittedly, the comparison is confounded by the strong influence of
oil wealth on macroeconomic growth.44




43
  As described by Herforth and Ahmed (2015) desirability includes, but is not limited to, food quality.
44
 Which has been largely been diverted into the Petroleum Fund rather than invested in social development. However, the country
would still have much higher stunting than expected using non-oil GDP per capita.

C. Analysis of Determinants of Stunting
In line with the UNICEF conceptual framework, maternal and child undernutrition in Timor-Leste arises
from a variety of factors. Table 9 reports the results of the multivariate associations45 between stunting and
its determinants from the 2013 Timor-Leste Food and Nutrition Survey (TLFNS).46 The results demonstrate
that with very high stunting prevalence, there is no single factor which alone can remedy the problem of
stunting. Even after controlling for a variety of factors, nearly all variables remain significantly associated
with chronic undernutrition. The child’s age and sex, maternal nutritional status (vis a vis maternal height),
the child’s dietary intake and disease status, maternal education, agricultural livelihoods, and household
wealth are related to child stunting outcomes. Consequently, intervening to improve any single underlying
factor will be insufficient to have a significant impact on stunting.




45
   The model for underlying determinants was constructed by first entering age and sex in the model. Then all variables for
underlying determinants of stunting.
46
   For programming purposes, it is also useful to evaluate nutrition outcomes and determinants at a district level to inform
geographic targeting decisions. Annex presents the distribution of immediate and underlying determinants of undernutrition by
district.

   D. Determinants of Overweight/Obesity

   1. Dietary Intake

   Suboptimal dietary habits and physical inactivity are key risk factors for the development of
   overweight/obesity. The 2015 STEPs survey is the main source of data on these risk factors in Timor-Leste,
   albeit representative only at the national level. Adequate fruit and vegetable consumption reduces the risk
   of NCDs. In total, 77.5% of Timorese adults did not meet the recommendation to consume at least five
   servings of fruits and/or vegetables per day. Roughly 40% of both men and women consume two or fewer
   servings (Figure 21). Men and women do not commonly report eating processed foods high in salt (12.9%)
   or consuming meals outside of the home (WHO 2015b).

2. Physical Activity

Routine physical activity is high among the Timorese and only 16.7% of the adult population did not meet
the WHO recommendations for physical activity.47 This percentage was higher among women (23.3%) than
men (12.8%). Most physical activity is related to work, and only 8.4% of men and 16.7% of women had
not completed any work-related physical activity in the previous week. Recreation-related physical activity
is not common, particularly among women, 95% of whom had not participated in any leisure activity (WHO
2015b).

E. Discussion of Gaps
In Timor-Leste, a multitude of factors drive the high prevalence of malnutrition. When looking at multiple
sources of information, a number of themes emerge as key considerations in assessing the magnitude of
malnutrition in the Timorese context:

        Poor nutrient intake and feeding practices persist for women, infants, and young children in
         the first 1,000 days: Breastfeeding practices have improved but early weaning requires
         improvement. Complementary feeding, particularly dietary diversity, is very low for IYC. Rice is
         a highly valued commodity and regularly purchased, in contrast to animal-source foods (which are
         not regularly consumed aside from the context of traditional ceremonies and rituals). There is
         evidence of limited availability and affordability of an adequate diet for IYC and pregnant/lactating
         women. Thus, information and behavior change communication (BCC) alone (without provision
         of cash or other social transfer) would likely not be sufficient to realize significant improvements
         in nutrition security.

        Behaviors play a critical role in improving child growth in Timor-Leste: The poorest nutrition
         outcomes are found in the lowest wealth quintile, the prevalence of stunting, wasting, and anemia
         are still very high in the wealthiest households. This could be, in part, due to a skewed wealth
         distribution such that the richest wealth quintile includes those who are relatively poor.
         Alternatively, it is likely that social and cultural factors, rather than simply wealth alone, influence
         a number of care, hygiene, and food consumption behaviors which affect malnutrition. Given that
         there are strong enabling and inhibiting factors at play which affect IYCF practices, particularly
         with regard to culture, there is an important lack of formative research to understand the processes
         at play and the best approaches to improve practices.

        Structural, social, and cultural factors, compounded by a history of cultural violence,
         disempower adolescent girls and women: There are deeply entrenched sociocultural issues
         related to women’s status. Timorese girls have not achieved parity in secondary school completion
         and women lack autonomy in decision-making (particularly for reproductive health, child health,
         and the household). Low decision making authority may contribute to lower household
         expenditures on child and social development. The post-conflict effects (PTSD, depression, and
         chronic stress) associated with historical violence contribute to high incidence of domestic violence
         and mental health issues which place care for women and children, and their nutritional status, at
         risk. Young men accept principles of gender equity but have been slow to embody these principles
         and change behaviors at the household level. This is perhaps unsurprising as men are not commonly
         engaged in nutrition, reproductive health, and gender empowerment efforts (despite their role as

  The WHO recommends ≥150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week, 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity
per week, or an equivalent combination of the two.

                                                                                                                         44
    gatekeepers for household resource allocation and health service consumption, and reproductive
    health decision-making).

   High fertility and low birth spacing perpetuate an intergenerational cycle of malnutrition:
    Young girls are at greatest risk of maternal underweight, and when they enter pregnancy
    undernourished, they will compete for nutrients with their fetus, making them more likely to give
    birth to small children. Short birth intervals contribute to maternal nutrient depletion. Strong
    sociocultural values around fertility and large family size result in high fertility, which may
    perpetuate poverty and malnutrition due to constrained options to affordably feed the family.

   Low availability, accessibility, and affordability of nutrient-rich foods exacerbated by a
    hungry season: When food security is defined not only with regard to sufficiency, but specifically
    the availability and affordability of the foods needed for optimum nutrition (particularly that of
    infants and young children), food insecurity emerges as a stronger driver of malnutrition.
    Furthermore, the STEPs survey shows that few adults consume the recommended number of fruits
    and vegetables required to decrease risk of overweight/obesity, cardiovascular disease, and cancers.
    There is evidence of a hungry season for staple foods, and during the dry season households are
    unlikely to produce vegetables.

   Exposures to aflatoxins and fecal pathogens may contribute to poor nutrient absorption:
    Infants and young children may experience impaired nutrient absorption due to repeated exposure
    to fecal matter (due to high levels of open defecation, poor hand hygiene, and absence of animal
    penning) and consumption of staple foods contaminated by aflatoxins.

   The silent, rapidly rising burden of overweight will carry considerable health and economic
    costs if unmitigated. Women have experienced a more than 5-fold increase in overweight
    prevalence since independence. This figure is likely an underestimate of the true NCD-risk
    associated with elevated weight in the Timorese population. Dietary patterns are changing and there
    are growing signs of the metabolic syndrome among the adult population.

Malnutrition
 CHAPTER 4 KEY MESSAGES
   1. With the Honorable President and Prime Minister as champions, Timor-Leste has high level
      political commitment to address malnutrition.
   2. The National Strategic Development Plan (2011-2030) highlights nutrition as essential to
      social and economic development.
   3. The National Council for Food Security, Sovereignty, and Nutrition in Timor-Leste
      (KONSSANTIL) is a high-level coordinating body with stewardship functions for the
      National Action Plan for a Hunger and Malnutrition-Free Timor-Leste (PAN-HAM-TIL), but
      focuses largely on food production and food security rather than nutrition.
   4. The PAN-HAM-TIL is a strong advocacy document but is too costly and broad in scope to
      serve as an effective implementation guide for key ministries.
   5. The Ministry of Health is the technical home for nutrition, and the second National Nutrition
      Strategy (2014-2019) includes the nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive tasks of the MOH
      to improve nutrition. The strategies and action plans of KONSSANTIL ministries reflect the
      sectors’ contributions to increased nutrition-sensitivity.
   6. Organizational capacity constraints related to public financial management, human resource
      management, and limited collection and use of data limit the effectiveness of all services,
      including nutrition.
   7. The large number of human resources in health and other sectors presents a considerable
      opportunity for the delivery of nutrition-related education and messages, but there is not as
      yet a strategic approach to building capacity of frontline professionals to enhance nutrition-
      aspects of service delivery.
   8. Timor-Leste has a strong networks of civil society and community organizations. Most
      families belong to some type of group, providing platforms for increasing nutrition knowledge
      and behavior change at the community level.


Timorese leadership, laws, policies, and institutions form the “enabling environment” for improving
nutrition. With the determinants of malnutrition spanning across sectors, there is need for a coordinated
response which cannot be left to one sector alone. With Timor-Leste’s status as a fragile state, joint
implementation (multiectoral action) is not recommended. Rather, with clear and specific roles and
accountabilities, the approach can be to “think multiectorally, act sectorally,” with each sector
implementing its own activities with coordinated planning and monitoring (World Bank 2013b). This
chapter examines issues of leadership, policy and legal frameworks, institutional structures, and
implementation/service delivery capacity to address malnutrition in Timor-Leste.

A. High Level Leadership
Globally, nutrition has been recognized as a “chosen issue” requiring national champions to keep the issue
on the agenda. In Timor-Leste, the offices of both the Honorable President and Prime Minister have
demonstrated support for nutrition. The Honorable Prime Minister and the Sixth Constitutional Government
have renewed the focus on service delivery efficiency and effectiveness. The Program of the Sixth
Constitutional Government cites “improving the access to and quality of nutrition services at health
facilities and the community” as a priority for the area of health care (RDTL 2015a). The Unit for
Monitoring and Evaluation of Social Affairs (UMAAS) was created in 2014 to monitor progress towards
improved service delivery in the social sectors and includes essential nutrition services (vitamin A

                                                                                                       46
supplementation) as a key performance indicator. The Office of the Prime Minister has also set up a unit
for monitoring progress towards the SDGs and is identifying champions for each goal.

In 2014-2015, the Honorable President’s Office established the President’s Nutrition Awards (PNP) in
order to “inspire good practice and leadership in nutrition.” The PNP serves to (i) raise awareness of the
nutrition situation in Timor-Leste; (ii) motivate, inspire, educate the population; and (iii) recognize
achievements at the community level.48 In 2015, the Honorable President also convened government
stakeholders for a roundtable discussion on food security and nutrition to stimulate dialogue and identify
opportunities to accelerate progress to reduce malnutrition and food insecurity.

B. Multi-Sectoral Coordination
Given the need for a multisectoral response to malnutrition, supra-ministerial coordinating bodies play a
critical role in guiding a strong national response. The National Council for Food Security, Sovereignty and
Nutrition in Timor-Leste49 (KONSSANTIL) was formed in November, 2012, and is mandated to harmonize
decision-making and resource allocation across member ministries to achieve improved food security,
sovereignty, and nutrition in Timor-Leste (Table 10) (KONSSANTIL 2015).

KONSSANTIL’s strength is in its cross-sectoral participation (Annex 4), providing the opportunity for
high-level nutrition planning and coordination. According to the agreed structure, KONSSANTIL is to be
chaired by the Honorable Prime Minister. However, this responsibility has been delegated to the
Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs (Minister of Agriculture). Consequently, the body has lost its
supra-ministerial convening power and the group’s focus tends to be on agriculture and food security. The
Permanent Technical Secretariat (PTS) meets monthly and has responsibility to: (a) institutionalize
KONSSANTIL and its governance structure; (b) discuss action plans and priorities; (c) monitor
implementation, mobilize resources; and (d) provide technical support to and coordination with
stakeholders. However, the Head of Nutrition Department does not participate in the PTS from the MOH
side.

In an attempt to improve coordination and focus, KONSSANTIL ministerial membership was scaled back
in 2015 (Table 10). However, the restructuring also limited participation of development partners (DPs);
the PTS now includes only one development partner agency each from agriculture and nutrition, with two
additional seats for UN agencies (UNRC and FAO).




48 Awards of US$10,000 are awarded to both a suco and to a women’s association, group, or individual demonstrating promising
practices to improve nutrition for suco members, women, and children. The achievements of the selected groups/individuals are
documented and the experiences shared on social media, through promotional videos, and community site visits.

In addition to national level coordination, deconcentration will raise the need for inter-ministerial
coordination at the district level. The KONSSANTIL Terms of Reference specify the group’s role in
enhancing decentralization, increasing participation at all levels, and involving multiple stakeholders in
problem solving to reduce food insecurity and malnutrition via the creation of district-level KONSSANTIL
groups. However, these groups have not been institutionalized across the 13 districts/municipalities.

C. Capacity to design and execute nutrition programs and policies
In the period since independence, development partners have provided support to strengthen the capacity
of government institutions, including those responsible for nutrition policies and programs. However,
capacity constraints remain. Limited capacity—simply defined as the ability to carry out objectives
(Goodman et al. 1998)—has been identified as one of the critical barriers to the widespread scale up of
nutrition programs (Heikens et al. 2008). Determining the ‘who’ and ‘how’ related to nutrition interventions
is perhaps equally as important as identifying ‘what’ to do. This report uses the nutrition capacity
assessment framework proposed by Shrimpton et al. (2013) which proposes four levels of capacity
assessment: (i) system; (ii) organization; (iii) workforce; and (iv) community (see Annex 9) across key
ministries.50

1. System Capacity

System capacity includes the broad social, cultural, economic, legal environment and provides the
foundation for the remaining three tiers, which more directly affect ability to act (Shrimpton et al. 2013).


50
 As the technical home for nutrition in Timor-Leste, emphasis is placed upon exploring capacities and constraints within the
MOH, with additional information included across sectors as relevant.

                                                                                                                         48
The Government of Timor-Leste formally recognizes nutrition as a development priority. In 2005, the First
Constitutional Government of Timor-Leste adopted the National Food Security Policy. In 2010, the Fourth
Constitutional Government endorsed the Comoro Declaration, a joint commitment from seven line
ministries to address nutrition the right to food. It also outlines the need for cross-sectoral collaboration and
cooperation to improve nutrition (RDTL 2010a). In the five years following the Comoro Declaration,
nutrition and food security has maintained an elevated political profile (Table 11).

1.1 Policy Frameworks

1.1.1 The Timor-Leste National Strategic Development Plan (2011-2030)
Policy frameworks serve to coordinate the response to development challenges (including malnutrition);
their absence can be a cause of fragmented, ineffective service delivery. The National Strategic
Development Plan (SDP) (2011-2030) outlines the framework and actions needed to "transition Timor-
Leste from a low income to upper middle income country, with a healthy, well-educated and safe population
by 2030" (RDTL 2010). Though aligned with the Millennium Development Goals, the SDP aims to set a
broader course for sustainable, inclusive development in Timor-Leste. The SDP is based upon four pillars:
social capital, infrastructure development, economic development, and governance. Nutrition-relevant
considerations are captured under each of the first three pillars. Optimum health and nutrition are
highlighted as a necessary precursor of efforts to raise incomes, reduce poverty, and increase productivity.

The Pillar 1 health sector targets and activities are linked to nutrition through the immediate, underlying,
and basic determinants of undernutrition, including: disease prevention, food security, improved water and
sanitation access, education, social inclusion and women’s empowerment, and economic development
(RDTL 2010). Under Pillar 3 (Economic Development), agriculture (particularly livestock and aquaculture

              “The children of Timor-Leste, in particular, deserve access to good
              health care, nutritious food, clean drinking water and good sanitation.”
                                                                           (RDTL 2010)

                                                                                                              49
sub-sectors) is also recognized for its role in enabling the consumption of more diversified and nutritionally
balanced diets. Targets include increasing dietary diversity through production of non-staple foods,
including fruits, vegetables, meat, and fish products. Pillar 2 (Infrastructure) targets include the
development of water and sanitation facilities, though targets are related to urban sanitation, rural water
supply, and drainage; there are no targets related to rural sanitation, which is critically important for the
improvement of nutritional status.

1.1.2 The Zero Hunger Challenge: National Action Plan for A Hunger and Malnutrition-Free
Timor-Leste (PAN-HAM-TIL)
The National Action Plan for a Hunger and Malnutrition-Free Timor-Leste (PAN-HAM-TIL) is a cross-
sectoral action plan “to reduce hunger and malnutrition to a state of insignificance.” PAN-HAM-TIL
provides the framework for a multisectoral response to food insecurity and malnutrition in Timor-Leste. In
2013, KONSSANTIL, the President, Vice President, and UN Resident Coordinator launched the United
Nations’ Zero Hunger Challenge. Shortly thereafter, Timor-Leste also signed on to the CPLP “Together
against Hunger” campaign. KONSSANTIL developed the PAN-HAM-TIL to consolidate activities aligned
with both the Zero Hunger Challenge and CPLP commitments.51 The Plan is divided into five pillars, with
priority nutrition results included under Pillar 2 (though nutrition-sensitive sub-activities can be found
across pillars) (Table 12).




51
   The launch of the Zero Hunger Action Plan was accelerated such that the action plan was finalized even before the country had
a supportive cross-sectoral policy and strategic framework in place. The country is now developing a policy framework aligned to
the Zero Hunger architecture.

                                                                                                                             50

The PAN-HAM-TIL has served as a successful advocacy tool and raised the profile of food insecurity and
nutrition issues. In addition to covering many areas of food security, the Action Plan addresses key
                                                                                                            51
immediate and underlying determinants of undernutrition. However, there is a tradeoff between
comprehensiveness and pragmatism: there are 47 outputs and 170 activities under the five pillars. With the
number of included activities, it is not surprising that the cost to implement the action plan is enormous,
averaging $176 million per year over 10 years. The plan has yet to be operationalized; there is neither a
results framework nor accountability mechanism.

In addition to the overarching strategic frameworks and coordinating mechanisms described above, there
are a large number of sectoral policies and strategies which are relevant to nutrition action in Timor-Leste
(Table 13). To a large extent, these strategies and policies highlight the link between nutrition outcomes
and the underlying determinants.

1.1.3.1.1. The National Health Sector Strategic Plan
The Timorese Constitution enshrines the right to universal healthcare under article 57 stating, “All Timorese
citizens are entitled to health care and the State has a duty to promote and protect this right free of charge,
in accordance with its capabilities and in conformity with the law” (RDTL 2002). As such, the provision of
universal, free, and high quality health care is a central focus of the health sector. Within the National

                                                                                                            52
Health Sector Strategic Plan – NHSSP (2011-2030), the Ministry of Health outlines its vision for achieving
“A healthy East Timorese people in a healthy East Timor,” (Ministry of Health 2011). Improving service
delivery for women and children is identified in the NHSSP objectives, resulting in a strong focus on
maternal and child undernutrition and its underlying causes (Annex 5). Though diet-related NCDs appears
in the results framework, there is no mention of overweight/obesity as an emerging potential health concern
for Timor-Leste. Neither adolescents nor men are considered as a priority population for health services,
with the NHSSP referring to adolescents only under “nutrition” and “maternal health” sections.

1.3.1.2. National Nutrition Strategy
The first National Nutrition Strategy (2004-2010) for Timor-Leste focused on two primary areas: maternal
and child nutrition and food security (MOH 2004). To accelerate progress toward achieving nutrition results
and build off of renewed global nutrition landscape, the MOH signed an updated nutrition strategy in 2014
(MOH 2014b). The Timor-Leste National Nutrition Strategy (2014-2019) (NNS) was prepared with
financial support from DFAT and technical support from UNICEF.52 The NNS aligns with the targets in
SDP and has been framed by some as the operationalization of the MOH approach to Pillar 2 of Zero
Hunger Challenge. The NNS (2014-2019) emphasizes direct, nutrition-specific interventions while also
highlighting the importance of nutrition-sensitive approaches and the enabling environment (Box 2).

There are number of challenges which may inhibit the success of the NNS. Most importantly, the strategy
is a health sector strategy and the relevant activities only extends to the support MOH must provide to other
sectors as they implement sectoral activities. However, the achievement of Outcome 2 depends largely upon
buy-in from non-health sectors. Because these ministries do not have a mandate or incentive to collaborate,
and because there is not yet a dialogue regarding how to do so, cross-sectoral buy-in will likely be limited.
Additionally, there is some operational risk as key strategies and laws that could motivate the NNS actions
are lacking. The WHO Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding (2003) calls on Member States
to develop comprehensive, context-specific policies to ‘protect, promote, and support’ appropriate IYCF
practices, but these have not been prepared for Timor-Leste. Consequently, efforts in these areas may be
prone to fragmentation due to a lack of strategic vision.




52
  A number of stakeholders within and outside the Nutrition Working Group were consulted in the NNS development process, yet
nutrition stakeholders expressed concern over the inclusivity of the strategy development process.

                                                                                                                         53
 BOX 2. KEY FEATURES OF TIMOR-LESTE’S NATIONAL NUTRITION STRATEGY
 (2014-2019)
 Vision: The vision of the Timor-Leste National Nutrition Strategy (TL-NNS) 2014-2019 is to
 contribute to sustainable achievement of national socioeconomic and human development goals by
 improving the quality and productivity of its human capital.

 Goal: The goal of the TL-NNS 2014-2019 is to improve the nutritional status of Timorese population.

 Purpose: To accelerate reduction of maternal and child undernutrition through implementation of
 nutrition specific and nutrition sensitive interventions.

 Objective: To reduce malnutrition and micronutrient deficiency among children and women.

 Strategic Priorities:
     1. Improved nutrient intake by mothers, children and adolescent girls.
     2. Improved care for mothers and children.
     3. Improved food security at household, community, and national levels.
     4. Improved hygiene and access to water and sanitation.
     5. Optimal nutrition behavior and practices promoted at all levels.
     6. Improved policies and capacity for multisectoral nutrition action.

 Planned Outcomes:
     1. Increased coverage of nutrition-specific interventions.
     2. Increased coverage of nutrition-sensitive interventions.
     3. Enabling national policies, programmes and coordination mechanism.

 Expected Impact: Improved nutritional status (reduced stunting, reduced micronutrient
 deficiencies).



1.1.3.2. Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF)

The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries Strategic Plan (MAFSP) (2014-2020) has the stated objective of
increasing production and productivity of crops, livestock and fisheries, which are each intended to improve
the quality of food intake and household nutrition. The Strategic Plan also explicitly links agriculture and
nutrition, highlighting that agricultural and rural development for small scale farmers is necessary to
improve market access and “reduce poverty, ensure food and nutrition security, and promote economic
growth in rural areas, and thus, across the nation” (Box 3) (MAF 2013a). The strategy maintains that
“targeted investments around staple food crop production and marketing will deliver improved nutrition at
the household level.” Not only is agriculture essential for economic development and livelihoods, but also
has a role to play in promoting peace and stability. Specifically, the MAFSP notes the importance of
“providing food for a growing population at an affordable price” to ensure food security and political
stability. Nutrition components of the MAFSP fall primarily under Development Objective 1. However,
programs aimed at improving market access for rural farmers producing nutrient-rich foods, and
strengthening opportunities for value addition may also be nutrition-sensitive.

1.1.3.3. Ministry of Social Solidarity (MSS)
As defined by the Organic Law of Sixth Constitutional Government, MSS is responsible for the design,
execution, coordination and policy for the areas of social assistance, social security, natural disaster
management, issues of veterans’ affairs, and the social protection of the most vulnerable people in society.
The MSS Strategic Plan 2014-2017 does not mention nutrition explicitly, though nutrition-relevant
considerations are included under the themes of social reinsertion and social assistance and cohesion (Table
14). MSS plays a critical role in reducing poverty among nutritionally vulnerable households and promoting
nutrition and food security in emergencies. The MSS strategy is unique among the strategic plans of
KONSSANTIL ministries in that it explicitly mentions participation in KONSSANTIL as a means to
improve the intra-agency response to social and humanitarian needs, including food security and emergency

The Ministry of Education National Education Strategic Plan (2011-2030) is aligned with the priority of
achieving the Millennium Development Goals, not limited to the education goals, but also including the
poverty/hunger, maternal health, and child health goals. The Constitution of the Democratic Republic of
Timor-Leste enshrines the right to education and espouses the creation of a universal, compulsive, and free
(to the extent possible) system of education. The guiding sector policy is the National Education Policy,
approved by the Council of Ministers in 2008 (MOE 2011).

The National Education Strategic Plan includes twelve priority programs, with the Early Childhood
Education and Social Inclusion programs having greatest relevance for nutrition. The Early Childhood
Education program is focused on achieving universal pre-school education by 2030. The Social Inclusion
Program supports the removal of barriers to education for girls and women and those who are
disadvantaged, prioritizing gender parity, particularly in the areas of secondary and higher education. The
school feeding program (SFP) is also included under social inclusion and framed as a policy tool to ‘ensure
enrolment and retention’ rather than a nutrition intervention. The SFP is intended to be complemented by
other programs, such as Conditional Cash Transfers (CCTs) for girls in secondary school and transportation
solutions.

1.2 Institutional Arrangements
Nutrition functions and responsibilities are found across a variety of agencies. Within the MOH, the NHSSP
defines an institutional at the central level, which was most recently updated in 2015 (See Annex 6).
Development partners such as WHO, DFAT, EU, UNICEF, WFP, USAID, Menzies School of Health
Research and World Bank have provided support for institutional strengthening at the central level which
have direct or indirect effects for nutrition, including financial and technical support for the development
of policies, strategies, and guidelines within MOH directorates.

The Nutrition Department is one of seven departments in the National Directorate of Public Health (DNSP).
The Nutrition Department provides technical, strategic, and M&E support for the nutrition program but is

                                                                                                         57
not responsible for implementation (Figure 22). Nutrition-related responsibilities are also found within the
Departments of Maternal and Child Health, Health Promotion, and Environmental Health. The DNSP
reports that human resources and transportation constraints limit the ability of the Nutrition Department to
perform routine monitoring and evaluation of the nutrition program at the district level.

Figure 22. Structure of Nutrition Department, Directorate of Public Health, Ministry of
Health




Source: MOH 2015

Each of the 13 districts has its own National Directorate of District Health Services (DHS) which maintains
responsibility for nutrition service delivery. DHS provides health services at the following levels:

    1.   Community
    2.   Health Post
    3.   Community Health Center at sub-district level
    4.   Community Health Center (with inpatient)
    5.   District level referral hospitals (only in 5 districts)

While nutrition is intended to be mainstreamed through the new Primary Health Care (PHC) model,
operationalization of the PHC guidelines--released in 2015 -- has been slow. DHS continues to structure




                                                                                                         58
their services as vertical programs.53 Supervisory visits from the central level to district level, and district
level to CHC level have been found to be insufficient in general, and for the nutrition program, specifically
(MOH 2015a). Because monitoring and evaluation (in the Nutrition Department) remains institutionally
siloed from service delivery (in the DHS), there is little accountability or incentive mechanisms to promote
coordination, improve quality, and availability of nutrition services.

2. Organizational Capacity

Organizational capacity refers to the nature and factors of organizations working in nutrition-related areas
which develop, support, and enable an effective workforce. A number of organizational constraints are
common across ministries responsible for the delivery of nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive
programs.

2.1. Public Financial Management
Timor-Leste’s ministries face public financial management challenges, including disconnected planning
and budgeting processes, unreliable and insufficient budgets, and the absence of accountability structures.
Budget disbursement to districts is commonly delayed beyond the first quarter, severely limiting the
availability and quality of service delivery. With development partner support, MOH has instituted the
detailed implementation plan (DIP) preparation process for bottom-up district-level planning. However,
this exercise is disconnected from the budget process. The ongoing national Budget Performance Reform
will introduce a system of Program-Based Budgeting and provide an opportunity to budget for nutrition.
However, the reform’s success rests upon strengthened PFM capacity at central and sub-national levels.

2.2. Data, Monitoring, and Evaluation
Receiving consistent, reliable data and information is often a challenge in Timor-Leste. MOH has relatively
advanced system of reporting from the districts to Dili, and with plans to roll out DHIS-2, a digital reporting
system. On the other hand, MAF does not have a sector-wide M&E system to collect and analyze data. In
MSS, information systems are not well-established, undermining the effectiveness of targeting, payment,
monitoring and controls (World Bank 2013). The lack of reliable data results in conflicting reports between
the Ministries, Development Partners, and National Surveys that can create confusion and difficulty in
program planning. Furthermore, without reliable monitoring and evaluation data, ministries are not able to
demonstrate their results and advocate for greater budgetary allocations.

2.3. Human Resource Management
Civil service capacity constraints are not necessarily rooted in numbers and distribution of employees, but
instead in the lack of structural support, management and oversight for improved workforce performance.
Job descriptions and terms of reference tend to be vague and may be written for an individual rather than
for the qualifications and competencies necessary to perform job functions. Disconnects between staff
skills, experience and responsibilities are not uncommon. In general, public sector workers, even at the
technical level, are regularly rotated through the civil service. Efforts to build organizational capacity and
institutional knowledge need to be regularly repeated due to high turnover. The MOH and DHS have
increased their attention to supportive supervision, including regular monitoring visits by DHS to health
facilities in order to monitor the availability of human resources, supplies, and medicines as well as the
general facility environment, with the ultimate goal of improving the quality of service delivery. However,
the frequency of visits may be constrained due to a lack of operational budget for transportation and fuel.
Repeated retraining is necessary as individuals shift roles within and across ministries. The Sixth

Constitutional Government is currently leading Public Administration Reform, which has the potential to
improve many of the aforementioned challenges.

2.4. Number and Distribution of Workforce
The Government of Timor-Leste has dramatically increased the number of civil service staff in recent years.
As such, numbers and distribution of workforce has become less of an issue (though some constraints
remain), while performance and efficiency of the current workforce has surfaced.

2.4.1. Ministry of Health
At the central level, the Nutrition Department has expressed a concern over the small number of staff
relative to the workload required to deliver MOH and partner-supported programs. Within District Health
Services, a District Public Health Officer is employed to oversee the Nutrition Program. Some DPHOs
work solely on nutrition, while others are responsible for multiple programs. Though the Nutrition Program
is typically regarded as the responsibility of a nutritionist, nearly all cadres of health professionals play a
role in delivering nutrition interventions in Timor-Leste. However, these nutrition-related functions are not
included in the job description of health professionals (Annex 10).

A number of health cadres are available to deliver frontline nutrition services (Table 16). The PHC
Guidelines call for the deployment of 1 doctor, 1 nurse and 1 midwife to each Health Post, to be expanded
to 7 workers over time (MOH 2015b). A review of the health workforce indicated a service delivery staff
numbering 2,439 workers in 2014, an estimated health worker density in Timor-Leste of 1 service delivery
staff per 469 people54 (World Bank 2016a). The Cuban Medical Brigade55 has provided medical training to
roughly 1000 Timorese doctors, resulting in an excess of doctors relative to the WHO ‘Threshold’ model.
(World Bank 2016a). On the other hand, there is a shortage of midwives: 42% of health posts were without
midwives, and the current workforce stands at roughly 50% relative to the WHO threshold requirements
(World Bank 2016a). From a nutrition perspective, doctors tend to have responsibility for fewer critical
nutrition functions relative to midwives and would require that their job descriptions be revised in order to
promote effective use of the workforce for nutrition.

Most CHCs at district level had 1-2 nutritionists who were responsible for the nutrition program. The PHC
Guidelines call for an additional Public Health Technician for Nutrition to staff the CHC at sub-district
level. Over the past year, UNICEF has supported the deployment of sub-district nutrition focal points56 to
16 CHCs in 3 districts.

   Which is below the WHO threshold of 1 service delivery staff per 439 people.
55 The Cuban Medical Brigade (CMB) trains (either in Cuba or in Timor-Leste) the majority of doctors serving in the country.
Students enrolled in or after 2008 are trained in Timor-Leste by the CMB in collaboration with the National University of Timor-
Leste (UNTL). The training includes a five years of medical schooling and a one-year field internship.
56 The focal point for nutrition at the CHC level is referred to as “Public Health Technician for Nutrition”, though the current terms

of reference use the title “Sub-District Nutrition Focal Point”.

2.4.2. Workforce Available for Nutrition Outside of the Health Sector
Non-health staff are also deployed throughout the country (Table 17) and can be leveraged for the delivery
of nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive interventions.

2.5 Supply Chain Management
The Ministry of Health continues to receive training on commodity procurement and supply chain
management for SAMES (the national autonomous medical stores). With EU support, UNICEF procures
all vitamin A, deworming, and therapeutic feeding commodities for MOH. In order to ensure adequate
supply, WFP procures commodities for supplementary feeding and uses its own supply chain to deliver
these to the CHC level.

3. Workforce Capacity

Workforce capacity refers to the knowledge, skills and attitudes required to perform the competencies
required to carry out nutrition-related work, as well as the materials and job aids needed. A number of
constraints are common across ministries. Performance incentives are non-existent in the civil service, and
there are few disincentives for poor performance. Strong mentorship is needed to support individuals
responsible for community-level service delivery who are often tasked with engaging in community
facilitation and building knowledge, adapting processes, and changing behaviors.

3.1. Ministry of Health
At the central level, there is and a critical absence of staff with public health nutrition qualifications and
expertise. At the health facility level, doctors, nurses, midwives, and nutritionists each play a role in the
delivery of nutrition-specific interventions (Table 16, above).

Pre-service and in-service training have generally not prepared the health workforce to deliver the full
package of nutrition interventions. Pre-service training in nutrition in Timor-Leste is limited to the Bachelor
of Science level.57 The National University of Timor-Leste (UNTL) has launched a Diploma 3 course (BSc-
level) in Nutrition and Dietetics, with Community Health/Public Health Identified as a track. Unlike other
health professionals trained at UNTL, graduates of the Nutrition and Dietetics program are not guaranteed
entry into the civil service (and so it is unclear where the graduates will be placed). Doctors, nurses, and
midwives have components of the nutrition package included in their pre-service training, but without
accreditation standards, there are no formally required nutrition competencies.58

The National Institute of Health (INS) is responsible for in-service training in Timor-Leste. The EU-funded
Integrated Nutrition Project, UNICEF/WFP supported the Ministry of Health to develop in-service training
on the Specific Nutrition Intervention Package (SNIP) for all health service providers. Fifteen master



57
   Given the small number of Master’s level positions which would potentially be available in the country, the development of a
Master of in public health nutrition is not warranted. However, it may be necessary for an individual in the Nutrition Department
to receive this training abroad.
58 Core competencies are being developed for nurses at the National Hospital, but nutrition is not included as a required clinical

skill.


                                                                                                                              62
trainers have been trained with and district level training provided in Ermera, Ainaro, and Bobonaro.
Additionally, INS has a nutrition and food security training supported by Menzies University and DFAT
which covers the theory and practice behind key nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive interventions.
MOH and INS have not yet developed a comprehensive, competency-based training plan for health
professionals. In-service trainings provided by INS are often ad-hoc and provided to meet the programmatic
requirements of DPs. For example, half of nurses and midwives reported participating in three or more
short-term trainings in the previous three years, while 25% reported not attending any (World Bank 2015c).

In addition to the absence of a country capacity building plan, there is no country-wide protocol for follow-
up after training (FUAT) or supportive supervision for nutrition. Engaging in strong FUAT, perhaps
through the Learning Lab approach (Box 4) can build confidence and competencies provide nutrition-
specific interventions, especially IYCF promotion, community-based management of acute malnutrition,
and nutrition counseling during pregnancy. USAID had previously supported the development of nutrition
supportive supervision tools, but these have been replaced with new programmatic guidelines and job aids
aligned with SNIP.


 BOX 4. BUILDING PROVIDER COMPETENCIES AND CONFIDENCE THROUGH THE
 LEARNING LAB APPROACH

 Even after receiving training, health providers have demonstrated limited improvements in job
 performance and attainment of competencies. To address this issue, the INGO Health Alliance
 International collaborated with the National Institute of Health (INS) and MOH to develop the
 Learning Lab approach to follow up after training on Essential Newborn Care.

 A Learning Lab is a 2-3 hour session provided once per month for six months after national in-service
 training. Labs are structured learning within the facility setting rather than a classroom. HAI conducted
 a comparison evaluation of the approach, which demonstrated that the skills, competencies, and
 confidence of midwives who participated in Learning Labs were substantially and consistently higher
 than non-participants (Kerrison 2014). Qualitative interviews with the midwives, DHS staff, and INS
 staff revealed high acceptability of the approach, and support for applying the approach to other
 services.


4. Community Capacity

Community capacity is essential to ensure that services meet the needs and priorities of beneficiaries.
Timor-Leste’s strong coalition of civil society organizations and social networks can be leveraged
contribute to effective community participation in achieving better health and nutrition outcomes. Village
structures (i.e. suco councils) provide the platforms for bringing communities together to promote behavior
change. Most families belong to community or thematic groups, be it religious, farming, savings, social,
health organizations, etc. These groups provide a platform for community mobilization and awareness
raising. Social auditing has recently been introduced to Timor-Leste and offers the opportunity for
communities engage in participatory governance and transparent, effective development.

However, in order to engage communities in improving the delivery of nutrition services, knowledge of
optimum nutrition practices needs strengthening. There is a commonly reported lack of ability for
communities to identify stunting and to engage in optimum infant and young child feeding behaviors. A
recent report prepared for FAO suggests that a combination of advocacy, social mobilization, and behavior
change communication is necessary to improve community-level practices (Lantican 2015). Community
mobilizers and facilitators are needed who have an understanding of the importance and contributions of
                                                                                                             63
immediate and underlying determinants of malnutrition and can negotiate with communities. These
mobilizers can leverage traditional values of family and strong intentions to take the best care of children
in order to promote action on behavior change.

F. Leadership and Capacity Gaps and Opportunities
Timor-Leste has the necessary foundation for a strong national response to malnutrition, including: high
level political commitments, recognition of nutrition as a foundation of development, and a cross-sectoral
framework for action. However, gaps and opportunities identified include the following:

       The existence of a high-level coordinating institution is a critical asset. However, MAF
        chairmanship contributes to a narrow focus on food security and food security sovereignty and an
        inability to hold KONSSANTIL member ministries accountable for results.

       The Zero Hunger Challenge/PAN-HAM-TIL is a strong advocacy tool but is a weak guide for
        implementation. PAN-HAM-TIL lacks a common results framework and is in need of
        prioritization.

       The plan is food-centric, and embeds stunting within a plan focused on achieving food security.
        Combined with KONSSANTIL (chaired by Ministry of Agriculture) focus on food security, this
        may contribute to the lack of ownership by non-agriculture line ministries.

       There is a need for greater harmonization and consistency between the PAN-HAM-TIL and NNS.

       Policies, strategies, and laws needed for a coordinated response to malnutrition (e.g. IYCF Strategy,
        BCC Strategy, Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes, Salt Iodization Law, Food
        Fortification Strategy) are not in place.

       The MAFSP takes a narrow view on improving food security, highlighting production and
        productivity of staple crops as key to delivering improved nutrition.

       Central level departmental staff need greater ownership, coordination and collaboration of policies
        and strategies to align implementation with sectoral directives. Strong involvement of development
        partners in the policy making and strategy development processes contributes to a lack of
        ownership of implementation, particularly at lower levels within central ministries.

       Deconcentration will present a critical challenge across ministries, as the processes of planning,
        budgeting will shift to the district level. While development partners have traditionally provided
        central level agencies with technical assistance for systems strengthening, management capacity in
        district agencies is lacking.

       An integrated approach to malnutrition has not been realized. Nutrition still operates as a vertical
        program with an emphasis on diagnosis, management, and treatment of acute malnutrition; there is
        less understanding of MOH role in preventing stunting, low birth weight, and overweight.

       Capacity-building efforts within MOH to address malnutrition have tended to focus on the medium-
        to long-term organizational and system. There is no systematic, strategic approach to building
        nutrition capacity of the frontline health professionals to scale up and enhance quality of nutrition
        services. In-service trainings are driven by DP needs. Relatively few efforts have been made to
        build nutrition capacity of non-health civil servants.
                                                                                                          64
   There is a strong civil society network in Timor-Leste, yet community capacity for bottom up
    management to achieve better nutrition outcomes remains weak. Communities need access to high
    quality information along with community mobilizers capable of negotiating thedisconnect
    between food sufficiency, nutrition, and IYCF and traditional practices. The emphasis on social
    auditing can be seen as an opportunity for nutrition. Additional efforts are required to educate
    communities on services that should be available to them so they are able to provide feedback on
    service delivery.

Chapter 5. Nutrition-Specific Interventions and Approaches

     CHAPTER 5 KEY MESSAGES
       1. The Ministry of Health has defined a Specific Nutrition Intervention Package (SNIP) to be
          delivered as part of the package of Primary Healthcare (PHC) services.
       2. Due to remoteness and low care-seeking, community outreach is a key component of nutrition
          service delivery in Timor-Leste. The SISCa program and Saude na Familia programs are not
          fully implemented with quality and at scale.
       3. Coverage of SNIP supplementation interventions remains low: in 2013, vitamin A
          supplementation was 53%; 32% of women consumed >90 iron-folic acid tablets during their
          previous pregnancy; 33% of children received zinc for the treatment of diarrhea.
       4. Not all health providers have been trained in infant and young child feeding promotion. NGO-
          supported cooking demonstrations and mothers support groups are the primary platforms for
          mothers to receive information on IYCF and do not operate at national scale.
       5. Nine districts are without any intervention to address the very high prevalence of anemia
          among children and there is no program for anemia reduction in non-pregnant women.
       6. Donor support has focused on supporting the Integrated Management of Acute Malnutrition,
          including targeted supplementary feeding for treatment of moderate acute malnutrition.
          However, with low compliance, it is unclear whether the approach is sustainable and should
          be scaled.
       7. Nutrition still operates as a vertical program, with aspects of supply procurement, distribution,
          monitoring and evaluation, and supervision operating outside of mainstream Primary
          Healthcare.
       8. There is no food fortification policy, legislation, or program. The Salt Law has been in draft
          for many years and only 43% of households have adequately iodized salt.
       9. Interventions for prevention and diagnosis of non-communicable diseases, including dietary
          counselling and blood pressure measurement, are not common.


Scaling up a package of evidence-based, nutrition-specific interventions (Annex 11) targeted at the first
1,000 days window of opportunity is a cost effective manner of avoiding lifelong consequences of
malnutrition. This section reviews delivery platforms and coverage of for evidence-based nutrition-specific
interventions and alignment with the burden of malnutrition in Timor-Leste.

A. Primary Health Care (PHC) Package
Nutrition-specific interventions are intended to be mainstreamed through the Primary Health Care (PHC)
Package. The Constitution Republic Democratic Timor-Leste, in Article 57, provides for a universal, free
health care system (RDTL 2002). In 2015, the Honorable Prime Minister officially launched the PHC
Programme. The package of services provided under PHC are intended to achieve more equitable, efficient,
and low cost health care while accelerating improvements in health status (RDTL 2015b). PHC includes
six packages59 which provide all Timorese women and children to guaranteed access to essential nutrition-



59 The packages include those to: reduce maternal mortality ratio; reduce infant mortality rates; reduce maternal and child
malnutrition; control and prevent communicable diseases; control and prevent non-communicable disease; and control
environmental health (MOH 2015).


                                                                                                                        66
specific interventions. These interventions are to be delivered through both health facility and community
delivery channels.

In 2015, under joint EU/UNICEF support, the MOH initiated the development of guidelines and training
modules for the Specific Nutrition Intervention Package (SNIP)60. Using as its foundation the direct
nutrition interventions, MOH defined a package of interventions which are known to be effective and cost-
effective globally (Box 5). UNICEF/WFP provided technical support to the Nutrition Department to ensure
that the SNIP interventions (as well as supplies, staffing, human resource functions, and reporting) were
integrated into the PHC package and essential medicines list.

 BOX 5. Timor-Leste Specific Nutrition Intervention Package (SNIP)

      1.     Infant and young child feeding and care practices including stimulation, growth and
            development monitoring and promotion, multiple micronutrient supplementation as part of
            complementary feeding practices promotion, and feeding during and after childhood illnesses.
      2.    Supplementation of IFA in pregnancy and in adolescent girls.
      3.    Use of Zinc (and ORS) for treatment of diarrhea.
      4.    Vitamin A supplementation.
      5.    Integrated Management of Acute Malnutrition (I-MAM)
      6.    Iodine deficiency prevention, control and elimination.
      7.    Deworming of children, deworming during pregnancy and helminth control in population.
      8.    Nutrition in emergencies.
      9.    Nutrition program monitoring and evaluation.
      10.   Nutrition program management and supportive supervision.




B. Outreach
Community-based strategies are particularly critical for delivering health, nutrition, and hygiene
interventions, especially those which require household and individual behavior change. Because coverage
is low for promotive interventions delivered only through health facilities, community-based platforms will
be essential to increase nutrition intervention coverage in Timor-Leste.

1. Servisu Integradu da Saude Communitaria (SISCa)

The Servisu Integradu da Saude Communitaria (SISCa) (Integrated Community Health Services) program
has served as Timor-Leste’s platform for nutrition outreach. SISCa services include: growth monitoring,
hygiene promotion, and provision of Ante-Natal Care (ANC) services (see Annex 13 for details). SISCa is
intended to be implemented monthly through collaboration between CHC staff, community
leaders/members, and Volunteers (PSFs). However, the future of SISCa is unclear and questions have been




60The MOH-proposed package of nutrition specific interventions was initially referred to as “high impact nutrition interventions”
(HINI). This terminology was used in the development of the National Nutrition Strategy and Primary Health Care Guidelines, but
has since been updated to SNIP. This report will use the acronym SNIP unless quoting from a pre-existing MOH document.


                                                                                                                             67
raised regarding the efficiency of investing in building PSF capacity and SISCa quality given the
deployment of health professionals to the suco level and growing emphasis on home visits.61

2. Saude na Familia/Domicilliary Visits

The Saude na Familia (SnF) visits are a new addition to health service delivery outlined in the 2015 PHC
Guidelines. Based on the Brazilian model of home visits, the SnF program intends to deploy the HP team
to conduct data gathering and health risk assessments for all Timorese households in 2016. The first visit
will consist of mapping and stratifying households based upon burden of disease and disease risk.
Subsequent SnF visits are carried out to conduct health promotion and disease prevention and monitor the
family’s health status. Though the SnF program will ensure that each household has access to he alth
services, there are significant risks to achieving the program objectives, including: (a) the lack of resources
(human and transportation62) required to conduct the visits; (b) the high supervision requirements; and (c)
the need to provide continued training to up-skill medical professionals to serve the population’s health
needs, particularly nutrition-related diagnosis, counseling, and treatment.

C. Infant and Young Child Nutrition

1. Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) Promotion

There is strong support for optimum infant and young child feeding within international organizations such
as UNICEF, WHO, FAO, and WFP, and local NGOs (especially the Alola Foundation). However, delivery
of IYCF promotion through government programs is minimal. Despite the large number of players, only
recently has the IYCF guidelines been incorporated into the SNIP guide, yet a behavior change
communication (BCC) strategy is lacking for IYCF, creating duplicity and lack of harmonization in
approaches and in the development of information, education, and communication materials.

1.1. Breastfeeding
Breastfeeding promotion is delivered through a variety of channels. Skilled antenatal care offers a contact
point for breastfeeding promotion. Most (86%) of women go for at least one antenatal care visit with a
skilled provider, though dropout of ANC is high (NSD and ICF Macro 2010). Midwives are trained in
breastfeeding promotion, which is included in PHC and should be provided by midwives at all facility
levels. However, as noted above, because of the critical shortage of midwives, women may not receive
these services when reporting for ANC.

1.2. Complementary Feeding Promotion
There is currently limited capacity to deliver complementary feeding promotion. During field visits, the
health professional staff did not mention complementary feeding promotion as a key nutrition activity. PSFs
were often mentioned as the cadre to deliver these messages, but training is not adequate nor is time
sufficient for one-on-one behavior change counseling with mothers (5-15 minutes recommended)
(Griffiths, Dickin, and Favin 1996). The Haburas Nutrisaun flipcharts were developed by MOH and include
the nine key practices for appropriate complementary feeding, including essential hygiene actions.


61
   Under PHC, MOH is scaling up the deployment of health professionals to the suco/HP level. The short-term intention is to
employ one doctor, one nurse, and one midwife at each HP, with the PHC Guidelines proposing an increase to a total of 7 health
staff per HP (MOH 2015c). Because of the considerable financial implications of this plan (World Bank 2016a) a more efficient
use of resources may be to strengthen health promotion capacity of the HP team.
62
   Even prior to the institution of SnF, 50% of health workers reported lack of transportation to see patients as a significant challenge
(World Bank 2015c).

                                                                                                                                     68
EU/UNICEF/WFP/KOICA are providing support to MOH to develop a package of IEC materials to support
the implementation of SNIP interventions.

1.3. Mother Support Groups (MSGs)
The PHC package includes reference to community-based Mother Support Groups (MSGs), though these
have not yet been scaled up by the government. NGO-run MSGs are operational in all 13 districts, though
they do not cover 100% of sucos. Groups typically consist of 10-20 women who are led in regular peer-to-
peer information sharing sessions. Though they have “mother” in the name, these groups may be open to
adolescent girls, grandmothers, and husbands. Sessions cover integrated maternal and child health, and
address a number of nutrition issues, including: breastfeeding promotion, IYCF promotion, newborn care,
community management of acute malnutrition. The NNS proposes the national scale up of MSGs using the
Alola model. However, there has not been an evaluation of the approach to identify the quality of messages
provided and extent to which MSGs are effective in addressing context-specific barriers to optimum IYCF.

1.4. Cooking Demonstrations
Cooking demonstrations are one of the most commonly cited interventions for IYCF promotion.
NGOs/INGOs commonly utilize cooking demonstrations as a means of transferring knowledge and
awareness around IYCF. A leader will prepare a nutritious meal based upon locally available foods in order
to build women’s self-efficacy with regard to preparing proper foods for IYCF. Cooking demonstrations
have provided a platform for the preparation of recipes using Timor-Vita (locally available fortified
supplementary food, described below), indigenous crops, and other nutrient-dense foods. The MOH has
distributed a recipe book which promotes the preparation of culturally acceptable, improved complementary
foods using local ingredients.63 However, cooking demonstrations can be costly and there is no evidence of
impact on improving complementary feeding behavior. Demo leaders report facing challenges in obtaining
the appropriate mix of diverse, nutrient-rich foods in the market. Consequently demonstrations may not
model optimum behavior, but rather reinforce the current feeding practices including limited quantity of
nutrient-rich foods.

1.5. Growth Monitoring and Promotion
The PHC package includes monthly growth monitoring (at SISCa or health facility) for children under 24
months and every trimester for children from 2-5 years. Capacity to deliver growth promotion is limited.
PSF training is not rigorously standardized and not all volunteers have been trained in growth monitoring.
It is commonly reported that weight measurements are taken but not recorded on the LISIO (See Annex 14)
by PSFs. Not all facilities have the scales/height boards needed to take anthropometric measurements.64
Survey estimates of growth monitoring activities are not available.

1.6. Micronutrient Powders
SNIP includes the provision of micronutrient powders (MNPs) to IYC (6-23 months of age) at the
introduction of food and to be consumed every other day. Currently, UNICEF supports the procurement
and distribution of MNPs to four districts: Aileu, Ainaro, Bobonaro, Ermera. At the time of the 2013 TLFNS
when MNPs were being piloted in Aileu district, 72% of children age 6-23 months had received the MNPs,
with 84% of these children consuming their sachets (RDTL 2013a).




63
  EU/WFP are planning a revision of the book and accompanying posters.
64UNICEF supplied length/height boards, scales, and weighing trousers at all health facilities to Health Post level in Ainaro,
Bobonaro, and Ermera in 2015 and intends to roll out nationwide in 2016.

                                                                                                                           69
2. Vitamin A

The SNIP guidelines support the provision of vitamin A supplementation (VAS) to children ages 6-59
months twice annually. Vitamin A is delivered through semi-annual campaigns and through routine service
delivery at all facilities down to the health post level. Despite the use of campaigns, vitamin A
supplementation coverage among children age 6-59 months is low by international standards, and roughly
half of children age 6-59 months receive VAS. There was a marginal increase in coverage from 2009-10
(51%) to 2013 (53%). Vitamin A supplementation coverage ranged from 62.4% in Aileu to 44.7% in
Lautem.

3. Therapeutic Zinc

Providing zinc supplements with oral rehydration salt (ORS) for children under 5 years of age with diarrhea
can reduce the duration and severity of diarrheal episodes. In 2013, one third (33%) of all children
experiencing diarrhea in the past two weeks had received zinc, while 29% received ORS plus zinc. This is
an increase from 2009-10, when only 5.8% of children with diarrhea received zinc.

4. Deworming

The SNIP guidelines support the delivery of deworming tablets for children 1-5 years of age and school
children ages 6-11 years of age. Deworming tablets are provided at both health facilities and through school-
based platforms. In 2013, 43% of primary schools reported providing deworming treatments during 2012
(World Bank 2013a), while in the 2013 TLFNS, 39% of children had received deworming tablets in the
previous 6 months (RDTL 2013a).

5. Integrated Management of Acute Malnutrition

The SNIP guidelines include the Integrated Management of Acute Malnutrition (JMAK) to be fully
integrated into PHC.65 JMAK is based on four components (Table 18). MOH receives off-budget support
from the EU, channeled to UNICEF and WFP to scale up JMAK. UNICEF supports the procurement of F-
75, F-100, and ready-use therapeutic food (RUTF) for outpatient treatment (OTP) and in-patient treatment
(ITP) for severe acute malnutrition (SAM) nationwide. WFP supports the Targeted Supplementary Feeding
Programme (TSFP) for treatment of moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) in six districts. MOH had agreed
to fund the scale-up of JMAK in the districts without development partner support, to date this commitment
has not been realized.

An independent mid-term evaluation found that although the interventions were aligned with the NNS,
geographic and temporal alignment of the two components remained a gap.66 In addition to community-
based treatment, the quality of in-patient treatment of SAM needs to be strengthened. At the National
Hospital, stock-outs of therapeutic milks are common and there is difficulty ensuring that admitted children
are adequately fed when and as needed.



65
    In 2015, HIAM Health—the only organization providing dedicated in-patient therapeutic feeding—closed. Inpatient
management of acute malnutrition occurs only at CHCs with inpatient facilities, referral hospitals, the national hospital, and private
clinics.
66 UNICEF was funded for 2014-2017 to cover all districts with SAM treatment and CHC Nutrition Focal Point in Bobonaro,

Ermera, and Ainaro. These CHC Focal points have received one week additional training in JMAK. WFP was funded for 2014-
2016 to support supplementary feeding in six districts. WFP phased in implementation, beginning in Bobonaro, Covalima, and
Oecussi, to be followed by Ermera, Ainaro, and Dili. Only Bobonaro has Sub-District CHC Focal Point + SAM + TSFP.

Previously, there had not been strong evidence of effectiveness in delivering MAM treatment to children
under 5 in Timor-Leste.67 The target population for the TSFP was 8,600 children with MAM over the course
of one year, or 719 children per month. WFP estimated that about 30% of children with MAM in the
catchment area enrolled in 2015. Main challenges faced in implementation have been the identification of
fewer cases of malnutrition than expected and a high rate of default among enrolled children. Poor
community sensitization was cited as a key contributor to the high default rate. For commodities provided
to children, field visit carried out under this study indicate that mothers preferred receiving the fortified
corn-soy blend over the ready-use supplementary food (RUSF), in part because the blended food could be
shared with all family members. To that end, nearly 100% of underweight pregnant and lactating women
have been enrolled and receive Timor-Vita. WFP reports indicate that in 2016, with the access to Timor-
Vita for women and additional community mobilization, coverage rates of 65% for children are being
maintained.

D. Pre-pregnancy and Maternal Nutrition

1. Adolescent Nutrition

The NHSSP, the Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (RMNCH) strategy, and NNS propose
to target adolescent girls with nutrition messages and services. PHC guidelines support the strategic
targeting of adolescent girls (10-18 years) with iron-folic acid supplementation (MOH 2015c), and the NNS
proposes a feasibility study of scaling up weekly IFA and semi-annual deworming for school-going and
non-school going adolescent girls in three districts (MOH 2014b). WHO recommends intermittent IFA
supplementation for menstruating women due to the high prevalence of anemia (WHO 2011). However,
in Timor-Leste there are currently no formal programs targeted at improving nutrient intake and behaviors
for adolescent girls, and their nutritional status is not monitored.

2. Maternal Nutrition

2.1. Micronutrient Supplementation and Anemia Prevention
Iron-folic acid supplementation is a core component of ANC services in Timor-Leste. The WHO
recommends daily iron supplementation during pregnancy as a standard of care in populations at risk of
iron deficiency (WHO 2012c). IFA coverage is increasing over time (59% of women took IFA during the
first trimester and 32% took more than 90 tablets) (RDTL 2013a). Quality of ANC is a concern: MOH data
indicate that 41% of health posts and 27% of CHCs had stockouts of IFA tablets (MOH 2015b). A baseline
program survey conducted among 570 women in Ainaro and Manufahi revealed that although 88% of
women received iron tablets, only 55% took more than 90 tablets. There is evidence that this may be due
to rationing at the health facilities, as women reported receiving only 7-12 tablets per ANC visit (HAI
2012). Through interviews with key informants, a number of programmatic constraints to IFA
supplementation were identified, including: low consumption of antenatal care services; late presentation
to ANC and foregone protective effects of folic acid; and low maternal awareness of benefits of IFA.




67 An independent evaluation of the previous WFP country portfolio (Mokoro 2013) found that the provision of supplementary
food was effective in increasing access to health services (at SISCA, the distribution site) but there was less evidence of achieving
primary objective of improving nutritional status of beneficiaries. Consequently, the evaluation recommended discontinuing
supplementary feeding for children 24-59 months to focus only on 6-23 months and pregnant and lactating women. However,
targeted feeding for MAM in children 6-59 months continues. With the change of product for children to a Ready-to-Use
Supplementary Food, nutrition results have been improved with a cure rate of over 60% (2015/2016).

                                                                                                                                 72
Deworming of pregnant women was fairly uncommon, with fewer than one in five (19.3%) of women
receiving deworming tablets during ANC visits (RDTL 2013b). Use of insecticide treated bed nets during
pregnancy can also contribute to malaria prevention and risk reduction for anemia and low birth weight.
The Global Fund supports distribution of ITNs across Timor-Leste and has reported 58% coverage among
pregnant women. Maternal micronutrient supplementation has also been shown to have significant effects
on reducing LBW, SGA, and preterm birth (Haider and Bhutta 2012), but neither the NNS or PHC
Guidelines mention the potential to scale up this intervention in Timor-Leste.

2.2. Dietary Supplementation
The importance of balanced protein-energy supplementation for underweight pregnant women was
highlighted in the 2013 Lancet series. As a part of its Maternal and Child Health and Nutrition Program,
WFP supports the distribution of fortified blended food (FBF) to underweight pregnant and lactating
mothers in its intervention districts. In the 2013 TLFNS, nearly half (45%) of mothers reported receiving
FBF during their last pregnancy (RDTL 2013b). This figure is perhaps higher than anticipated, given the
prevalence of maternal underweight of around 25% in both the 2009-10 DHS and the 2013 TLFNS.

2.3. Information and Communication Technology for Optimum Maternal Nutrition
USAID, DFAT, Catalpa, and Health Alliance International are piloting a mobile messaging service Liga
Inan to promote healthy birth outcomes in Manufahi, Liquica, and Aileu. Midwives register pregnant
women to receive regular text (SMS) messages with health information relevant to their stage of pregnancy,
continuing through 6 weeks after birth. Messages related to optimal maternal nutrition (including
consumption of iron pills, use of insecticide treated bed nets, diet during pregnancy and lactation,
consumption of iodized salt, deworming, as well as early initiation of breastfeeding) are included in the
package of text messages. Over 5,000 women have been enrolled in the program, which has increased
demand for maternal health services at health facilities.

E. Food Fortification
Food fortification has been identified as one of the most cost-effective strategies of increasing population
access to essential micronutrients. However, in Timor-Leste, strategic and legal frameworks for salt
iodization and staple food fortification do not exist. The National Salt Law was drafted in 2004 but has not
been signed. About 40% of salt in Timor-Leste is locally produced, with current iodization efforts cover
roughly 15% of local salt production. In the 2013 TLFNS, 57.3% of households consumed iodized salt, and
a total of 43% of households had adequately iodized salt. There was a vast disparity in iodized salt
availability across districts: 87% of households in Viqueque and 11% of households in Oecusse had
adequately iodized salt.

Given the high reliance on imported foods, Timor-Leste could benefit from strengthened regulations
mandating fortification of imported staple foods (especially rice) and oil. However, there is not yet a
program for mandatory food fortification. Since 2010, WFP has supported the private sector firm Timor
Global in the development, and domestic production of a FBF (maize) product known as Timor Vita.
Though local production was intended to improve efficiency, improve program sustainability, and increase
government ownership, there are challenges to consistent production. In 2012, Timor Vita constituted only
22% of the FSB provided by WFP; the remainder imported corn-soy blend (Mokoro 2013). Production at
Timor Global was suspended in 2014 due to concerns over high levels of aflatoxin in the locally sourced
maize and has only recently resumed. However, there remains opportunity to expand the scope of
distribution to the private sector if appropriate market channels are developed.

F. Non-Communicable Disease (NCD) Service Delivery
The WHO STEPs survey indicates low NCD health care coverage. According to the WHO STEPs survey,
few Timorese receive health promotion advice from their health care providers. Less than 20% of adults
had received advice from their healthcare providers to reduce dietary and physical activity NCD risk factors
(Figure 23); 87.3% had never had their blood pressure taken.

F. Discussion of Gaps and Opportunities in Nutrition-Specific Programs
The Specific Nutrition Intervention Package (SNIP) included in the PHC guidelines covers many of
evidence-based nutrition interventions. While the horizontal integration of nutrition-specific interventions
into PHC increases the likelihood of long-term sustainability (assuming adequate government financing),
in the near-term, low intervention coverage is likely to persist given the current capacity of the health system
and health professionals to deliver these interventions. The coverage of the package is not sufficient to
reduce stunting. EU/UNICEF support the procurement of a number of nutrition commodities for nationwide
distribution but several nutrition-specific interventions are available only in EU/KOICA supported districts.
There is a critical need to rapidly scale up direct nutrition interventions for adolescents, women, and young
children.

1. Infant and Young Child Nutrition

There is no known effective treatment for stunting, and prevention is needed to prevent rapid growth
faltering in early childhood. Challenges remain to mobilize community demand for services and ensure
quality service delivery that is aligned with the standard of care. Specific gaps include:

        High micronutrient deficiencies but absence of scaled-up interventions. Anemia exceeds the WHO
         threshold for daily iron supplementation to infants and children (WHO 2016) but MNPs are
         provided in only four districts; the majority of districts are without micronutrient interventions for


                                                                                                             74
        infants and young children. Coverage of therapeutic zinc supplementation (with oral rehydration
        solution) for the treatment of diarrhea and vitamin A supplementation is low.
       Peer-to-peer knowledge sharing is the primary modality of IYCF promotion but there is no
        evidence of effectiveness. Husbands and mothers in-law are key influencers of IYC practices but
        are not targeted with IYCF information and messages. Moreover, recent experience in Bangladesh
        demonstrated that in resource constrained environments, IYCF messaging alone achieved
        improvements in knowledge but little impact on behavior (Mbuya and Ahsan n.d.) Accelerations
        in stunting reduction can be achieved by combining strong BCC with a cash transfer.
       Current quality of growth monitoring is not sufficient for early identification of faltering growth.
        Quality growth promotion is nearly inexistent. Length/height of children under five is not
        traditionally been measured, and health providers do not plot growth on growth charts.
       MAM prevalence has fallen rapidly and progress has been made towards reducing acute
        malnutrition. The government does not have resources to scale up supplementary feeding, but
        rather than developing an exit strategy, supplementary feeding was integrated into national
        guidelines. There is no clear international decision criteria to determine whether or not the
        supplementary feeding program is necessary, but high default combined with limited evidence of
        cost-effectiveness, warrant a review of the guidelines.

2. Adolescent and Maternal Nutrition

Specific gaps in the delivery of nutrition-interventions for adolescent girls and women include:
    Lack of nutrition programs specifically targeting adolescents results in their inclusion in programs
        for women without considering the strong social, cultural, and behavioral factors which may affect
        the openness of girls to address issues of reproductive health, nutrition in front of elders.
    Anemia is high in pregnant women but there is low coverage and quality of nutrition interventions
        delivered through ANC and PNC due to delayed care seeking, commodity stockouts, and low
        provider capacity for nutrition and IYCF counseling.
    Absence of interventions to reduce anemia in non-pregnant women of reproductive age. There is
        no iron fortification of staple foods, post-partum IFA supplementation, intermittent IFA
        supplementation or MNP provision.

3. Food Fortification

       There is no overarching strategy for food fortification. Technical assistance is needed to develop
        quality standards for locally produced and imported fortified foods.
       Greater collaboration is needed between MOH and MCIE to advocate for finalization of the Salt
        Law which would provide the foundation for universal salt iodization and allow for regulation of
        salt iodization levels.

Chapter 6. Nutrition-Sensitive Programs and Approaches
Address Underlying Determinants of Malnutrition
 CHAPTER 6 KEY MESSAGES
   1. Neither agricultural production nor homestead food production is sufficient for the exclusive
      adoption of food-based strategies to reduce stunting and micronutrient deficiencies.
      Agriculture investments are biased towards increasing the production and productivity of
      staple grains (especially rice) and income generation. Some agricultural programs supported
      by development partners are now focusing on areas related to the production of animal
      products (though still insufficient) and the development of rural markets for these items.
   2. The school feeding program is not properly targeted to have impact on stunting and faces
      implementation challenges.
   3. Increasing women’s involvement in local leadership and government, group structures, and
      local development processes is a critical step for all programs striving to be nutrition sensitive.
   4. Bolsa da Mae has the potential to be an integrated anti-poverty and nutrition program but does
      not currently have sufficient capacity, administrative systems, or fiscal space to scale up
      provision of a reliable, adequate-sized benefit to beneficiaries.
   5. Challenges remain in achieving high coverage and quality of health services delivered at the
      facility level. Community-level service delivery under the PHC model needs to be defined.
   6. Reproductive health and family planning is a critical but under-recognized contributor to
      malnutrition in Timor-Leste. Reproductive health and family planning support is not provided
      in all districts, and services for men and adolescents are particularly lacking.
   7. PAKSI, the locally-adapted community-led total sanitation program, provides a platform to
      reinforce the links between malnutrition, hygiene, and sanitation but this is not done explicitly
      and consistently.
   8. Community-driven development programs (PNDS/PDID) exist at national scale and can
      utilize design elements to address constraints toward optimum nutrition.


The global evidence and Timor-Leste’s strategies acknowledge the importance of addressing the underlying
causes of undernutrition (Figure 13). This section reviews RDTL and development partner support for these
interventions. Some meet the criteria for nutrition-sensitive programs, while others have the potential to
improve their nutrition sensitivity through the incorporation of explicit nutrition goals and actions (Box 6).

 BOX 6. NUTRITION-SENSITIVE INTERVENTIONS AND PROGRAMMES
   • Interventions or programmes that address the underlying determinants of fetal and child nutrition
       and development -- food security; adequate caregiving resources at the maternal, household and
       community levels; and access to health services and a safe and hygienic environment -- and
       incorporate specific nutrition goals and actions.
   • Nutrition-sensitive programmes can serve as delivery platforms for nutrition-specific
       interventions, potentially increasing their scale, coverage, and effectiveness.
   • Examples: agriculture and food security; social safety nets; early child development; maternal
       mental health; women’s empowerment; child protection; schooling; water, sanitation, and
       hygiene; health and family planning services.

A. Agriculture and Food Security
The linkages between agriculture production, food security, and nutrition are hypothesized to operate
through three main pathways: food production, agricultural income, and women’s empowerment (Figure
24). Programs from the MAF Strategic Plan addressing these areas are described below.

Figure 24. Pathways from Agriculture to Nutrition

1. Increasing Agricultural Production and Productivity

MAF proposes to increase production and productivity of smallholder producers through a number of
programs: intensification of horticultural production; animal vaccination; increasing cattle population and
beef production; smallholder dairy development and introducing new breeds of goats and pigs (MAF
2013b). Current activities in the agriculture sector include: (a) improved seed production and distribution;
(b) strengthening the agriculture extension service; (c) farmer training and farmer field schools; and (d)
aquaculture development.

The Directorate General of Livestock and Veterinary participates in the Livestock Working Group,
organized jointly with development partners and the private sector. MAF itself does not have programs in
this area, but has identified that the availability and quality of meat remains an issue in the country. Private
sector companies (including banks and supermarkets) are playing a key role in the livestock sub-sector,
supported by development partners such as the ACIAR, DFAT, GIZ, and ILO.

MAF’s main programmatic engagement in agriculture is the Centro Dezenvolvimentu Comunidade
Agricola (CDCA) program aimed at building centers of learning, training, problem solving, production,
and farmer business in select villages for specific commodities (many of which were identified through
MAF’s Suku Ida Produto Ida” program to focus suco production on specific market-oriented commodities).
The CDCA program was implemented in 40 sucos from 12 districts in 2014 and 20 villages from 11 districts
in 2015.

                                                                                                             77
A number of development partners (World Vision, Care, MercyCorps, Catholic Relief Services) support
rural smallholders to implement homestead food production. Agencies commonly support the preparation
of small kitchen gardens for vegetable production, with a smaller number promoting homestead fish ponds,
and poultry raising. These programs have faced sustainability challenges, particularly with regard to
ensuring the supply of necessary inputs and technical support beyond the project completion. Because MAF
has experienced tightened fiscal space for agriculture programs (due to a reduction of the overall budgetary
envelope and pressures from increased human resources and wages/salaries) these and other programs are
essential forms of programmatic support to farmers.

2. Increasing Agricultural Income

USAID has funded commercial-oriented agriculture projects in its last two country programs. The first,
Developing Agricultural Communities (DAC) was oriented towards improving the commercial viability of
horticultural production in Timor-Leste. DAC provided farmers with training in harvest, production, and
drip irrigation techniques and facilitated market linkages with supermarkets in Dili. DAC helped
supermarkets to develop contract agreements with farmers, helping to reduce the reliance upon imported
produce in the national market. These linkages have continued beyond the program’s horizon, with a
number of Dili supermarkets maintaining their direct provision of inputs, extension, credit, and
transportation to contracted famers to build national markets. The current USAID project, Avansa
Agricultura, is working to develop the agriculture sector’s capacity for export-oriented production.

3. Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture

UN Women is supporting gender mainstreaming in MAF. At the project level, many agriculture projects
include women’s groups68 as a primary target population. However, the extent to which increasing women’s
knowledge and capacity can yield improved nutrition needs to be measured. After leaving the group
sessions, women return to their family plots to implement improved practices. Men traditionally maintain
control over the income from these holdings, and as such there may be little impact on women’s overall
access to and control of resources. On the other hand, there could be positive effects on maternal and child
nutrition outcomes if the practices can improve women’s time al location. No studies or evaluations were
identified examining the impact of agricultural interventions on women’s income or time in the country.

4. Food Quality and Food Safety

The agriculture sector plays an important role in controlling aflatoxin exposure which—through improved
processing and storage—can improve food security and nutrition. IFAD supported the distribution of
improved maize storage drums between 2009 and 2013. Though the project proved effective, it was not
taken over by MAF. Since that time, Seeds of Life (SOL) has been supporting MAF to assess aflatoxin
levels in food and seed with the aim of strengthen the evidence on aflatoxin contamination in food. In 2015,
MAF received training and technology to perform the Aflatoxin Quick Test to measure aflatoxin levels in
maize, peanut, and cassava. There has been no close coordination between MOH and MAF on the issue of
aflatoxin control; KONSSANTIL has raised the issue but cross-sectoral collaboration has not moved
forward.




68
   Due to widespread geographic dispersion, many agriculture projects target farmers groups. Roughly 10-20 farmers will join
together and meet at a central location in order to receive training on a specific topic, technique, etc.

                                                                                                                         78
5. School Feeding

The School Feeding Program (SFP) provides for the free daily provision of a school meal to all children in
grades 1- 6 and is framed as component of the Social Inclusion Policy. In the 2012 Education Survey, 95%
of school directors reported providing school feeding, but 21% of primary school students reported not
receiving food the previous day (World Bank 2013a). Ultimately, the program is not properly targeted to
have impact on stunting or designed to improve nutrition. Globally, small improvements in weight and BMI
-- but not height -- have been achieved through daily feeding of primary school children (Kristjansson et al
2007), but there has not been a review of nutritional impact in Timor-Leste’s program.

MCIE procures imported, unfortified rice for the SFP and schools receive funds from District Education
Services to purchase vegetables and protein-rich foods as outlined in the SFP Manual (RDTL 2013b). The
volunteer mothers face difficulty in procuring the quantity and quality of foods outlined in the menus with
the limited budget allotted. The manual also promotes the use of locally produced products to the extent
possible, but the adoption of a ‘homegrown school feeding’ approach69 has amplified implementation
challenges. In addition to limited availability of vegetables and prohibitive costs of locally produced protein
sources, there are food safety concerns associated with the use of locally sourced animal products.
Outbreaks of foodborne illness due to the SFP have been reported.

6. Gaps and Opportunities in Food Security and Agriculture Programs

Timor-Leste’s agriculture programs aimed at rice self-sufficiency do not address the key nutrition issue of
low dietary diversity. Agricultural production is not sufficient to exclusively adopt food-based strategies to
reduce malnutrition. Agriculture investments are biased towards increasing the production and productivity
of staple grains (especially rice), undermining the potential of agriculture to deliver the diverse foods
needed to reduce micronutrient deficiency and stunting.

The country seems to have fallen into the ‘cereals fundamentalism’ policy trap, whereby increased staple
food production is the near-exclusive goal of policies, programs, research, technology development,
infrastructure investment, and sector subsidies. This phenomenon is not unique to Timor-Leste: countries
across Southeast Asia and the Pacific seem to have adopted similar policy frameworks. Traditionally, food
security in many EAP countries has been defined in terms of self-sufficiency in staple grains (primarily
rice) (World Bank 2015d). In Timor-Leste, the government has actively sought to manage the availability
and price of rice in domestic markets and through international trade. Even within the rice sector, the
government’s own import policy aimed at decreasing rice price volatility is at odds with efforts to
incentivize domestic rice production through subsidized inputs. Investments in domestic staple food
production have been costly (e.g. expenditure on rice irrigation at over the past five years) but not resulted
in significant improvements in domestic production. Over time, credits, price support, and subsidies of rice
and other staple foods have the effect of crowding out production of non-staples, distorting supply, and
tending to drive the increase in price of micronutrient-rich non-staples relative to staples (Pingali 2015).
This policy environment is not only detrimental to staple food production within the country, but is further
misaligned with shifting food demand and need to produce greater quantities of nutrient-rich foods,
including meats, fruits, and vegetables. Rice-centric policies have failed to fully address the environmental,
natural resources, nutrition, food safety, food consumption considerations inherent in feeding and providing
adequate        nutrition      to      growing       and       increasingly       urbanized       populations.




69
  Homegrown school feeding refers to the concept of linking school feeding programs with local agricultural production, an
emerging trend globally.

                                                                                                                       79
       Agriculture is commonly viewed through an income-generating lens, with activities focused on
        improving livelihoods through commercial agriculture production.
       Markets for produce and animal-source foods are not well-functioning, with scarce opportunities
        to purchase nutrient-rich diets.
       Homestead food production is not sufficient to meet nutrient needs of women, infants, and young
        children. Homestead food production focuses on leafy green vegetables, with few programs
        incorporating animal-source food production. Households producing these high-value crops as
        eggs, livestock, fish, and certain vegetables tend to sell these for income generation rather than
        preserving them for own consumption. Low water resource availability means produce is not
        available year-round.
       The SFP is positioned as a food security and nutrition intervention but it is not targeted to age
        groups most at risk of malnutrition, is not accompanied by strong nutrition education. There has
        not been a comprehensive evaluation of the SFP and its impact on dietary diversity for children.
       Aflatoxin exposure remains widespread and there is no collaboration between MAF, MCIE, and
        MOH on aflatoxin control.
       Many projects claim to promote “nutrition-sensitive agriculture” but there are not strong linkages
        between agriculture and improved nutrition.

B. Care for Women and Children
MSS is responsible prevention of poverty and promotion of child welfare, and the MSS Strategic Plan
moves beyond the first-generation programmatic focus on stability (World Bank 2013c). The plan places a
strong emphasis on targeting vulnerable populations, which include priority populations for nutrition
interventions. These investments in child and social protection and poverty reduction—along with
complementary efforts to improve parenting and women’s empowerment—are critical for breaking the
intergenerational cycle of malnutrition.

1. Education of Women and Girls

The Ministry of Education’s Social Inclusion program prioritizes gender parity in education, particularly in
the areas of secondary and higher education. The MOE has developed a comprehensive plan for gender
equality in education. However, Timor-Leste has neither (i) innovative programs (such as cash transfers)
to stimulate enrollment of girls in secondary school (as proposed in the National Education Strategic Plan
2011-2030); nor (ii) an official re-entry policy which would allow for the re-enrollment of girls who drop
out of secondary school for reasons such as unplanned pregnancy.

Absenteeism, especially among secondary school girls, remains a cause for concern. The Ministry of
Education’s Eskola Foun (or child-friendly schools) approach incorporates the installation of water supply
and latrines that are child-friendly, inclusive, and gender sensitive. WASH in School guidelines are
currently under preparation with the approach supported by UNICEF. According to the 2012 Education
Survey, one third of primary schools did not have a toilet (World Bank 2013a). A 2011 survey of schools
in Dili found that even when toilets exit in schools they are often too large for the youngest students; are
not disaggregated by sex; and are often claimed by teachers (World Bank 2011b).

2. Domestic Violence

The Popular Organization of Timorese Women (OPMT – FRETILIN’s women’s wing) – was instrumental
in pushing for Timor-Leste’s ratification of the Convention for the Elimination of All forms of


                                                                                                         80
Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) in 2003. Women’s groups70 and NGOs succeeded in lobbying
for the passage of the Law Against Domestic Violence (LADV) in May 2010 making Domestic Violence
(DV) a punishable crime. The LADV includes marital rape and has been disseminated in all districts,
targeting local authorities, village chiefs, traditional leaders, and communities (UN 2014). The government
has committed to: (i) train police on the protection and assistance of DV victims; (ii) increase counseling,
health, and human services to protect victims; and (iii) expand access to support centers to victims of DV.
However, local systems of justice and leadership—as well as common laws and practices—continue to play
a critical role in gender identity and equality in Timor-Leste. Customary leaders (Chefe Suco, Chefe Aldeia)
maintain their authority within communities and are legitimized by the elections within the local population.
These laws, processes, and values may not recognize the equal status of women but are observed within
local populations (Wigglesworth 2013).

Nevertheless, gender equality and domestic violence feature as key areas of the Sixth Constitutional
Government. The PHC Guidelines include women’s mental health and a National Mental Health Strategy
has been drafted to strengthen the MOH response to mental health disorders in the country. However, these
services are not widely available. PRADET, a national NGO was formed in 2002 and offers support for
women, men, children, and families who suffer from severe mental trauma, violence, and severe social
problems due to extreme violence.71 PRADET supports INS in the training of health professionals to
develop competencies in forensic medical examination as well as to build awareness among health
professionals in referral hospitals regarding the referral pathways for victims of DV. A costing exercise is
underway to identify the financial resources required to deliver a package of essential services to respond
to DV and advocate for the required budgetary allocations.

3. Gender Empowerment

The SEM and UN Women support gender mainstreaming, analysis of Gender Responsive Budgeting,
trainings for women’s participation in politics, and technical and advocacy role in developing gender-
sensitive policies and programs. Women hold 38% of seats in Parliament (the highest in the Asia-Pacific
region) but have less influence in local level governance, where roughly 2% of Chefe Sucos are women.
NGOs and INGOs provide training and support for women’s economic empowerment and political
participation.

4. Bolsa da Mae

Targeted social transfers play an important role in lifting poor households out of intergenerational poverty
trap, and—when properly designed and targeted—have the potential to improve maternal and child
nutrition. Conditional cash transfer programs can improve nutrition by targeting nutritionally vulnerable
groups, providing regular additions to household finances, and stimulating the demand for health, nutrition,
and human development services. Despite persistent high poverty in Timor-Leste, many of the poor and
vulnerable, especially those in the bottom 20% of the population, are not reached by any form of social
assistance (World Bank 2013c). Specifically, 56% of households in the lowest wealth quintile were not
beneficiaries of any cash transfer program.

The MSS administers Bolsa da Mae (BdM), a conditional cash transfer (CCT) program. BdM had over
55,000 beneficiary households in 2014 and was the only social transfer program targeting poor and
vulnerable households with children (World Bank 2015e). However, the coverage and benefit of the BdM
program were found to be too low to impact household welfare and overall national poverty rates. The
average BdM benefit is equivalent to roughly only 3% of the average household budget, much smaller than
the international benefit standard of 10-15% of household expenditure (World Bank 2013c). Poor banking
infrastructure and low benefit amounts often result in a disbursement of a once-annual, lump sum benefit,
which yields little effect on smoothing consumption (World Bank 2013c). Because of the unreliable quality
and availability of essential health and nutrition services, the decision has been taken to make use of soft
conditions.

MSS is currently working with UNICEF and the local NGO Ba Futuru to pilot a Framework for Family
Development. The package may potentially be delivered alongside BdM, including family development
sessions for BdM participants, media campaigns, and home visiting/peer-to-peer contact. These parenting
development sessions have the potential to build community capacity and promote attitudes aligned with
optimum care and nutrition practices for IYC. However, the implementation capacity within MSS must
continue to be strengthened and coverage/benefit levels increased before BdM can become efficient, large-
scale nutrition sensitive program.

5. Early Childhood Development

Interventions in early childhood (before the child enters primary school) have the greatest potential to offset
the negative impacts of poor nutrition on learning and cognitive outcomes. Early stimulation, early learning,
and pre-primary education interventions (community or facility based) are highly cost-effective (Heckman
2006) and a means of improving analytical, language, and socioemotional skills (Schonkoff et al. 2012).
The Government of Timor-Leste has prioritized pre-school education using a child-friendly school
approach, and established the National Directorate for Pre-School Education. Though Early Childhood
Education has primarily focused on pre-school education, MOE, MECAS, and UNICEF convened a
stakeholder workshop in 2015 to discuss the establishment of a Holistic Early Childhood Development
Strategy and the development of a legal framework, cross-sectoral coordination mechanism, and integrated
programming. This process is still in an early phase but momentum is building to cultivate stronger linkages
between MSS, MOE, MOH and MECAS in the areas of early nutrition, stimulation, and learning. The
National Directorate of Primary Education, with the support of UNICEF and New Zealand, has piloted an
alternative, community-based preschool approach in two districts. This initiative reflects a shift in the
approach to early childhood development.

6. School Gardens and School Health

The Basic Education Curriculum Reform included the preparation of School Garden and School Health
curricula. With the support of the local NGO PERMATIL72, a curriculum was developed for classes 1-6 to
integrate gardening with basic science, math, and cultural skills. It is envisaged that once developed, a
School Garden may serve as a cultural learning center and also providing vegetables to the school feeding
program. Areas requiring further clarification relate to water and human resources required for cultivation.

Basic and Secondary School curricula also include School Health, with a formal reproductive health
curriculum introduced at Grade 4. The School Health unit of the Health Promotion Department is intended
to coordinate activities with MOE to train teachers on “Focusing Resources on Effective School Health.”

                                                                                                            82
However, the program had not been implemented since 2010. District Public Health Officers maintain
responsibility for implementing School Health activities in cooperation with the Ministry of Education,
though these activities are not delivered on a routine basis (Ministry of Health 2015a).

7. Gaps and Opportunities in Care for Women and Children

There are evidence-based linkages between women’s empowerment and improvement of nutrition
indicators. Increasing women’s involvement in local leadership and government, group structures, and local
development processes is a critical step for all programs striving to be nutrition sensitive. However,
operationalizing “women’s empowerment” in Timor-Leste will require careful consideration, including the
timing, location, and structure of formal meetings which can enhance women’s participation.

       Additional opportunities are needed to include women’s voice and participation. Agriculture
        programs which target ‘women’s groups’ may include women in training, yet traditional patterns
        of income distribution prevent them from seeing the economic impacts of their improved
        knowledge. Similarly, projects like the Programa Nasional Dezenvolvimentu Suco (PNDS) have
        tried to strengthen women’s participation in decision making through program protocols; however
        women rarely voiced opinions in broader meetings, did not participate in women’s only meetings,
        and did not adhere to female-only voting requirements (World Bank 2015b).
       Participatory community education on gender-based violence, gender roles/norms, and parenting
        is needed to build community capacity on the rights, responsibilities, and care for women and
        children.
       Bolsa da Mae has the potential to be an integrated anti-poverty program but does not currently have
        sufficient capacity, administrative systems, or fiscal space to scale up provision of a reliable,
        adequate-sized benefit to beneficiaries. Identification, targeting, verification, and enrollment
        systems remain weak. The Framework for Family Development has the potential to improve
        community knowledge and attitudes related to optimum care and nutrition.
       There are not yet clear linkages between health, nutrition, early learning/stimulation interventions
        to provide a complete package of holistic early childhood development services.

C. Health Services and Health Environment

1. Reproductive, Maternal, Neonatal, Child, and Adolescent Health and Family Planning

Timor-Leste has an Expanded Programme on Immunization but has faced challenges in achieving high,
routine vaccination coverage. The TLFNS reported that 74.3% of children age 12-23 months were fully
immunized according to the national vaccination schedule. Measles coverage remains low, at 70%, while
TT2 was 81% (MOH 2016). Due to low routine coverage, a vaccination campaign for polio/measles was
carried out in 2015. Bottlenecks include low community mobilization, and insufficient cold chain, vaccine
logistics, and program management.

The RMNCH Strategy identifies the importance of reducing fertility and increasing birth spacing in order
to achieve national goals for human and economic development outlined in the SDP (RDTL 2010). Bhutta
et al. (2013) highlight that the linkages between fertility, repeated pregnancy, and the effects on maternal
and fetal nutrition are not made frequently enough. This is true in Timor-Leste, where nutrition is commonly
positioned with respect to food and food security; high fertility and low birth spacing are rarely introduced
into the discussions of nutrition interventions.

Family planning has a significant influence on achieving key nutrition outcomes for both women and
children. By helping women and couples have the number of children they want at the healthiest times in
                                                                                                          83
life, family planning can benefit mothers, infants, and children. Well-spaced births allow women’s bodies
to recuperate and replenish essential nutrients and lead to better nutritional outcomes, such as healthy birth
weight for their infants. Family planning can also have an indirect impact on nutrition by reducing
unintended pregnancies among adolescents, allowing them to stay in school and complete more years of
education. Research shows that greater education among women leads to greater productivity,
empowerment, and control of resources—allowing them to make better choices that ultimately benefit the
health and nutrition of children and families (Naik et al, 2015).

Family planning and contraceptive services are available through the public and private sectors, but
contraceptive coverage remains low. The PHC package includes family planning services, including
counseling, a range of natural methods of contraception, condoms, oral contraceptives, intramuscular
injections, intrauterine devices, tubal ligations at HNGV and implants (MOH 2015c). Marie Stopes Timor-
Leste (MSTL) is the only INGO working specifically on the issue of family planning, providing provider
capacity building to MOH staff and family planning counseling and services (emphasizing birth spacing
and appropriate methods for the family’s needs) in eleven districts. The Catholic Church officially endorses
the Billings method (periodic abstinence during periods of high fertility), but midwives are able to promote
all methods of family planning; the Church encourages husbands and wives to make the decision together
(Richards 2014). One quarter (24.2%) of women with secondary education report currently using modern
contraception compared to 14.7% of those with no education (NSD and ICF Macro 2010). Roughly one
third (30.8%) of women have an unmet need for family planning, indicating a need to expand services
and/or change behavior related to contraceptive decision making at the household level.

Adolescents have insufficient access to sexual and reproductive health information, education, and services.
A 2014 review found that no budget had been provided since 2012 for training for district level health
professionals and teachers on adolescent reproductive health; thus central level staff in the Adolescent
Reproductive Health unit (Maternal and Child Health Department) were not able to carry out these activities
(MOH 2015a). The Ministry of Education has developed a comprehensive curriculum on adolescent sexual
and reproductive health, yet knowledge levels are thought to remain insufficient; pervasive taboos around
sexuality, combined with provider biases and the tendency towards privacy, prevent youth from seeking
reproductive health services. The only intervention for adolescent reproductive health is the MSTL national
youth hotline, Lina Foin Sae, manned by youth counselors who provide callers with reliable information
on adolescent reproductive health, puberty, and relationships. MSI reported over 65,000 calls since its
launch in 2011 (MSTL 2016).

There is low availability of reproductive health counseling and services for men and youth (Belton et al.
2009), with little progress over the past six years. “Men” are completely absent from the PHC Guidelines,
and there are no government-sponsored health services or awareness raising activities specifically targeting
men. The private company Cooperative Café Timor (CCT) runs private clinics for its staff. CCT has
received support from Family Planning Australia and DFAT to develop and implement the first Men’s
Health program in Timor-Leste. In the program’s baseline survey, 48% of respondent men (age 16-65) had
not received any health information or education in the past year, and only 24% could name two or more
methods of family planning (CCT et al. 2013). The curriculum is currently under revision and will include
messages on nutrition.

2. WASH

The PHC includes a package to control environmental health. During SnF visits, health professionals are
intended to complete the KUBASA (Kategoriasaun Uma Baseia ba Saude Ambiental) or “Home
Classification Based on Environmental Health” form. The KUBASA includes information on latrine
availability in villages, education on cleanliness, washing hand before and after toileting, and hygienic

                                                                                                           84
households and surroundings.73 Hygiene and sanitation information is also provided at SISCa by PSFs and
with NGO volunteers (see Annex 13).

The community led total sanitation (CLTS) has been locally adapted (called PAKSI) and was rolled out in
2012. The MOH has little WASH implementation capacity, and non-state agencies, including WaterAid,
UNICEF, Plan International, World Vision, Child Fund, Red Cross (CVTL), and Care play a major role in
supporting the implementation of PAKSI. Reducing open defecation (OD) is a key goal within the WASH
sector. Subsidies for household toilets have largely been phased out. Programs are aimed at achieving open
defecation-free (ODF) suco status with the goal of achieving national ODF status by 2017 (WSP 2015).
Though the PAKSI program currently covers all districts, it does not yet reach all sucos or aldeias. PAKSI
includes ‘software’ of sanitation promotion and behavior change triggering, and common, MOH-endorsed
BCC materials are available for all partners to use.

The DFAT-funded project Bee, Saneamentu no Ijiene iha Komunidade (BESIK) supports Timor-Leste’s
rural water supply, sanitation, and hygiene sector and is ongoing between 2007 and 2020. DFAT is currently
the sole bilateral donor supporting rural sanitation and hygiene in Timor-Leste. Its role in service deliver
ceased in 2014 and the focus is now on institutional strengthening at the national and district levels (Box
7). The ADB is the major funder of urban water supply, while JICA provides grant aid for rural and urban
water supply. MSS is currently developing a Program of Assistance for Basic Sanitation to provide
subsidized support for vulnerable households to improve sanitation.

 BOX 7. THE BOBONARO PAKSI SECRETARIAT
 In Bobonaro, BESIK has piloted the implementation of the PAKSI Secretariat. Launched in 2015, the
 Secretariat serves as a coordinating group housed in the District Administrative Office. BESIK
 provides technical and management support to a cross-sectoral team from MOPW, MOH, and MOE to
 guide coordinated implementation of the PAKSI program. BESIK supported institutional triggering
 (targeting district officials and chefe sucos) and experienced great success in building high-level
 institutional support. Through this district-level coordination mechanism, relatively rapid progress has
 been made in building sub-national institutional capacity, though community mobilization has
 remained a challenge.



3. Programa Nasional Dezenvolvimentu Suco (PNDS)

Traditional community-driven development (CDD) programs provide grants to communities to address
problems identified by the community. Timor-Leste created a national CDD program, the National Program
for Village Development (Programa Nasional Dezenvolvimentu Suco) in 2013 to build community capacity
and development leadership. The initial phase of the program will involve an investment of US$300.0
million dollars over eight years. The PNDS aims to contribute to rural development by funding the ‘missing
link’ to services (e.g. basic village infrastructure) and provide jobs and training. Sucos receive an annual
grant of between US$50,000-US$75,000 directly from the government to plan, construct and manage their
own small-scale community infrastructure projects (which may include shared community toilets and water
resources). Though the infrastructure developed through these programs cannot contribute to household
sanitation targets, they can, however, promote improved water and sanitation in communities. Since its
launch in 2013, over 600 village infrastructure projects have been constructed or are nearing completion.


73
   KUBASA forms had previously been completed by PSFs through outreach, and a number of districts reported publicly posting
the KUBASA scores to promote community accountability. At the time of writing, there was a demand for KUBASA forms in the
districts, yet there was a national stock out due to lack of funding for reprinting.

                                                                                                                        85
Though traditional CDD provides financing to communities based upon the existence of a plan, CDD
platforms have the potential to incentivize results for nutrition (World Bank 2016b). As was done in
Indonesia with the PNPM Generasi program, there is the potential to shift the design of CDD to provide
community financing based upon the achievement of priority human development results (including
nutrition). This may require additional awareness raising for communities to recognize and prioritize the
problem of malnutrition, but can also stimulate collective action and ownership in addressing the problem.


4. Overall Gaps and Opportunities in Health Services and Health Environment


       Challenges remain in achieving high coverage of health services delivered at the facility level.
        There is not a clear definition of how services will be delivered at the community level under the
        PHC model but reducing illness and improving ANC, skilled birth attendance, and PNC are
        important to improving nutrition.
       Reproductive health and family planning is a critical but under-recognized contributor to
        malnutrition in Timor-Leste. There is insufficient coverage of reproductive health and family
        planning in general, but especially for men and adolescents.
       The PAKSI Secretariat provides a strong example of progress which can be realized through close
        mentoring at the sub-district level.
       Social mobilizers involved in the PAKSI triggering process provide an opportunity to reinforce
        nutrition messages and the links between malnutrition, hygiene, and sanitation but these are not yet
        explicitly linked.
       PNDS offers a potential platform to incentivize community investments in nutrition outcomes
        through projects outside of infrastructure. Infrastructure projects are easy to implement but have
        less impact on the development of human capital in local communities. Strong facilitation and
        support for community prioritization processes will be needed.

Chapter 7. Development Partner Coordination and Support
for Nutrition

 CHAPTER 7 KEY MESSAGES
   1. Many development partners are engaged in the financing and/or delivery of nutrition-specific
      and nutrition-sensitive programs.
   2. Stronger government leadership and coordination is needed in the sector in order to harmonize
      efforts and development partner response.
   3. UN agencies and bilaterals play a key role in the development of an enabling environment for
      nutrition and the financing and delivery of nutrition specific interventions.
   4. The agriculture/food security sub-sector has the greatest number and reach of nutrition-
      sensitive projects.
   5. Limited attention has been paid to converge projects at the district and suco levels and ensure
      that donor resources are distributed proportionately to the burden of malnutrition.


With growing global momentum to address malnutrition, development partners have greater funding
opportunities for nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive programs in interventions in Timor-Leste.
Consequently, there has been a proliferation of projects and players addressing this issue. As a founding
member of the g7+, Timor-Leste has positioned itself as a leader in driving the agenda of the New Deal for
Engagement in Conflict and Fragile States, necessitating country leadership and ownership in defining a
development agenda.

However, there have been difficulties in operationalizing this approach to government leadership and
building ownership. Despite calls from development partners, the Government is yet to take a lead in
defining priorities and stimulating a coordinated response to malnutrition. Strategic plans (especially PAN-
HAM-TIL) are sufficiently broad and allow partner agencies, often in competition with one another, to
pursue their institutional agendas. A 2011 OECD-led review in Timor-Leste suggested that at the sector
level, advisers, donors, and NGOs supporting policy development and program implementation tend to be
influenced by the biases and systems of their agency and home country rather than the particular context of
Timor-Leste (OECD 2011). This finding is relevant for the nutrition community in Timor-Leste, which is
currently fragmented and operating as if in an emergency context. The bilaterals and multilaterals have
carved out spheres of influence which may not respond to government identified needs. Development
partners themselves have recognized the degree of discoordination in the sector and have called on the
government to take a stronger lead.

Although RDTL is the largest financier of national development, donors continue to play a significant role
in filling gaps to implement nutrition-related programs in the absence of sufficient government goods and
services budgets (see Chapter 8). Limited public financial management capacity has resulted in only
tentative approaches to provide budget support at this time, yielding a significant portion of nutrition
financing delivered through off-budget support to non-government actors. Australia, EU, USAID, Japan,
KOICA, and New Zealand, are the main bilataterals operating in the nutrition sector, with Australia the
largest contributor of total ODA in the country.

A. Nutrition-Specific Partners
At the central level in MOH, the UN agencies (WHO, UNICEF, WFP) and bilaterals (DFAT, EU, USAID)
have provided support for systems strengthening for the development of policies, programs, guidelines, as
well as monitoring and evaluation tools. DFAT financed the 2013 TLFNS and the National Nutrition
                                                                                                         87
Strategy, while more recently the EU has prioritized the financing of evidence-based, nutrition-specific
interventions through the Integrated Nutrition Program. EU support, channeled through WFP and UNICEF,
has contributed to strengthening the “nutrition system” and improving the delivery of nutrition-specific
interventions in the project districts. In addition to building the enabling environment for nutrition, the
funds have also supported the procurement of nutrition commodities and the provision of supplementary
and therapeutic foods for treatment of acute malnutrition, which KOICA has also started to support (see
Chapter 5). However, there are concerns over the degree to which the project activities have truly been
“integrated” into the MOH and PHC systems and limited inclusivity in the nutrition policy making and
systems strengthening dialogue for nutrition.

INGOs and NGOs provide support for IYCF promotion (see Chapter 5), community mobilization, and
social/behavior change communication at the community level. The Alola Foundation developed the
preeminent Timorese model for Mother Support Groups, which has been replicated to varying degrees by
agencies such as World Vision, Child Fund, CVTL (Red Cross Timor-Leste), Catholic Relief Services, and
Care International. However, in the absence of an overarching strategy and MOH-endorsed IEC/training
materials, organizations continue to pursue their activities in an ad-hoc, project-specific manner. A recent
social and behavior change communication assessment highlighted redundancies and lack of harmonization
in the approach to social and behavior change communication (SBCC). This was attributed, in part, due to
the absence of a central repository for nutrition-related IEC and training materials (Lantican 2015).

B. Nutrition-Sensitive Partners
A large number of development partners are involved in the following nutrition-sensitive areas: (a)
agriculture and food security; (b) reproductive health and family planning; (c) WASH; (d) maternal,
neonatal and child health; (e) early childhood development/protection/education; and (f) women’s
empowerment. Agriculture and food security is by far the largest and most active nutrition-sensitive sub-
sector: the MAF DP Working Group reported over 45 projects and development partner support totaling
roughly US$28.0 million in 2016.

C. Development Partner Coordination
With the restructuring of KONSSANTIL, there is no forum for regularly convening DPs working across
sectors on nutrition. Thus, development partner coordination for nutrition is divided between nutrition-
specific partners and nutrition-sensitive partners. The MOH invites DPs to semi-annual review of the health
sector. However, MOH has not held regular meetings with DPs, though the DPs meet monthly as a Health
DP working group. This group—which includes EU, DFAT, USAID, World Bank, UNICEF, WFP, WHO
and a number of INGOs—serves as a platform for DPs to share information and strengthen their own
coordination. The MOH convenes a Nutrition Working Group, though attendance is largely limited to MOH
nutrition staff and the DPs working on nutrition-specific interventions; the DPs working to address the
underlying determinants of malnutrition meet in their own thematic groups rather than attending the
Nutrition Working Group meetings. MAF convenes regular Agriculture Development Partners meetings
with EU and DFAT serving as co-chairs. The MAF DP working group brings together partners working on
nutrition-sensitive agriculture and has been subdivided into a number of thematic working group.

D. Geographic Convergence
Chapter 3 highlighted the multiple underlying determinants of malnutrition in Timor-Leste. As no sector or
program alone will be capable of reducing malnutrition and multisectoral implementation is not necessarily
feasible, it is critical to enhance the geographic convergence of programs addressing the determinants of

                                                                                                         88
malnutrition. Targeting the same beneficiaries with a package of services/programs can serve to reinforce
messages and address multiple underlying drivers.

Districts are a frequently utilized unit of geographic targeting. The greatest concentration and convergence
of DP support is in the horticultural belt and the west of the country. Bobonaro and Ermera receive the
greatest share of nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive support, while Liquica, Viqueque, and Manatuto
receiving the least support (Figure 25 and Figure 26). Agriculture and livelihoods interventions are greatest
in number, with fewer interventions in reproductive health and family planning and WASH. Districts with
the highest stunting prevalence are receiving the greatest support, yet there are districts such as Manatuto
where need remains high but relatively few DPs are present. Geographic disparities in financial and
programmatic support have the potential to incite conflict if not appropriately monitored. Rethinking
geographic targeting is critically important to reducing fragmentation and building stability in the country.




                                                                                                          89

Convergence of programs at the suco is critically important but difficult to achieve. Partners often report
only district level coverage, but rarely support 100% of sucos in a given district. As a consequence, there
is considerable variability in the degree to which sucos receive DP assistance. Due to issues of accessibility,
DP support within a district tends to concentrate around the district capital. Taken as an example, in Lautem,
partner interventions are concentrated around Lospalos sub-district, with fewer interventions in remote
areas. (Figure 27). Because there is no repository of project data that includes coverage at the suco level,
collecting information at this level of granularity is remarkably resource-intensive.

Figure 27. Convergence of interventions addressing immediate and underlying drivers
of undernutrition, Lautem, 2015




There are some notable DP efforts aimed at encouraging convergence and coordination to achieve nutrition
outcomes. DFAT is piloting the Nutrition Collective Impact project in the Holarua suco of Manufahi in
order to evaluate the impact of converging programs in reproductive health, nutrition, agriculture, WASH,
and community development. Similarly, UNICEF has targeted its WASH, nutrition, and child health
activities in overlapping geographies in order to promote additive effects. World Vision has adopted a
convergence approach such that sucos selected for support benefit from maternal and child health and
nutrition, agriculture and livelihoods, and early childhood development programs. Strong monitoring and
evaluation will help to understand the benefits and challenges of such an approach in Timor-Leste.

E. Research, Monitoring, and Evaluation
There have been limited investments in research (formative and quantitative) and program evaluations to
identify ‘what works’ and ‘how’ to deliver nutrition interventions in Timor-Leste. Partners often call for
                                                                                                            92
the use of evidence-based interventions and approaches, but there is not routine support to build the Timor-
Leste-specific evidence base. In addition to understanding behaviors and drivers of malnutrition, there is
also further opportunity to evaluate effectiveness of interventions and delivery platforms. Research
questions to be answered include: What are the key barriers to optimum IYCF in Timor-Leste? Do
frequently utilized approaches (mother support groups, cooking demos, kitchen gardens) help families to
overcome these barriers? Why (not)?

As nutrition-sensitive interventions expand in scope, there is a need to strengthen their technical design,
actively integrate indicators along the pathways between agriculture and nutrition, and address the socio-
cultural, economic, and environmental constraints which may inhibit the achievement of results. Nutrition
objectives tend to be folded into maternal and child health, food security and livelihoods, or early child
development programs but there is a need to integrate appropriate output and outcome indicators to monitor
and evaluate impact on nutrition.

F. Gaps and Opportunities in Development Partner Support for Nutrition

       Strong, directive government leadership has not yet emerged in the ‘nutrition sector’.
       Disorganization is in part attributed to the lack of a common results framework and a cross-sectoral
        platform to convene multiple stakeholders (DPs, civil society, private sector, and government)
        working on nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive areas. DPs have made efforts to coordinate
        themselves and align activities with national strategies, but they remain driven by their institutional
        priorities.
       There has been no standardized approach to nutrition behavior change communication, or common
        training/education materials, and incentive or mandate for organizations to share their materials,
        perpetuating duplication of efforts (though recent efforts are being made).
       More evidence is needed to understand how to reduce malnutrition in Timor-Leste. Building the
        Timor-Leste-specific evidence base could garner a broader set of champions for greater nutrition
        investments.
       Little attention is paid to the convergence of nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive programs.
        Communities need to receive a comprehensive package of nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive
        interventions in order to address the multiple causes of malnutrition, yet little is mapped about
        which programs are underway and where (particularly at the suco level).
       Given the push towards deconcentration and the importance of local level convergence for
        nutrition, there is an opportunity to strengthen engagement at the sub-national level to accelerate
        reductions in malnutrition.

Chapter 8. Costing and Financing for Nutrition

     CHAPTER 8 KEY MESSAGES
       1. Implementing the Zero Hunger Challenge will require US$34.00 per capita per year while the
          National Nutrition Strategy, focusing on high impact nutrition interventions will cost US$7.00
          per capita per year.
       2. The National Nutrition Strategy has a financing gap of roughly 50% over five years, but
          obtaining an additional US$4.00 per person per year is not unfeasible.
       3. Analysis of fiscal space for nutrition can identify opportunities to sustainably secure
          additional resources for nutrition.
       4. Improved prioritization of evidence-based nutrition programs and greater efficiency of
          nutrition spending present the greatest opportunities for increasing fiscal space for nutrition.
       5. Greater quality and quantity of public financing is needed to build human capital and sustain
          economic growth.


Ultimately, budgets are more important than policies, and investments in nutrition necessary to accelerate
improvements in health, social, and economic development. This section reviews the projected costs of
scaling up nutrition interventions in Timor-Leste.74 Second, we draw upon available data on government
and non-government spending in key sectors for nutrition service delivery to identify bottlenecks and
opportunities in the availability of nutrition financing.

A. Estimated Costs of Scaling Up Nutrition
Due to the multisectoral causes of malnutrition, scaling up nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive
interventions carries a considerable cost. Costing exercises have been completed for both the PAN-HAM-
TIL and the National Nutrition Strategy (NNS). Scaling up the 51 activities under Pillar 2 (Zero stunted
children under two years of age) of PAN-HAM-TIL is estimated to cost US$396.0 million over 10 years,
roughly US$34.00 per capita per year. The MOH Costed NNS Operational Plan (C-NNS-OP) estimates are
significantly lower than PAN-HAM-TIL (US$38.8 million for the period 2015-2019), or roughly US$7.00
per capita per year (MOH 2016e).75 Cost: benefit analyses have not been completed, so the return on this
level of investment is unclear.

Availability of Financing for the NNS

The financing needed to implement the NNS is described in the C-NNS-OP (Table 20). This MOH review
concludes that only US$3.00 per capita per year (of a required US$7.00 per capita per year) is available
through 2017, with the share of the plan financed decreasing from 2017. The C-NNS-OP demonstrates
strong reliance on donor support in the nutrition sub-sector of health, with DP contributions far exceeding



74
   Costing exercises were completed for the Zero Hunger Action Plan and the National Nutrition Strategy. We have not duplicated
this process and our estimates reflect the assumptions and estimates generated through these processes.
75 The NNS is a MOH strategy. Consequently, the C-NNS-OP costs three of eight nutrition-sensitive outputs. It is assumed that the

remaining five outputs were/will be costed under the strategies and plans of different departments of the MOH and other relevant
ministries. The nutrition-sensitive outputs not costed include: (a) coverage of maternal, newborn, and child health services; (b)
improved access to hygiene and sanitation practices; (c) increased access to improved source of drinking water (WASH strategy);
(d) increased coverage of intervention promoting income generation by women of the poorest wealth quintile; and (e) improved
food production, storage and use at household level. As such, a multi-sectoral nutrition strategy has not been fully costed.


                                                                                                                             94
those of MOH.76 Current financing has not achieved national coverage, and there has not been a discussion
of how to close the financing gap while scaling up and maximizing benefits.

B. Fiscal Space for Nutrition77
The previous chapters highlighted malnutrition as the greatest risk factor for premature death and disability
and as an underlying driver of persistent poverty and economic losses. However, coverage of key nutrition-
specific interventions is low and government financing accounts for just over 1% of all resources for
nutrition (see Table 20). The disproportionate reliance upon donor financing for essential nutrition services
raises questions related to the ability of government to meet its priorities and sustainability of nutrition
financing. An assessment of fiscal space for nutrition should be undertaken to identify from where resources
can be obtained to finance the scale up of priority interventions, reach national goals, and achieve the SDG
targets.

Aligned with previous definitions of fiscal space for health (Tandon and Cashin 2010), we define ‘fiscal
space for nutrition’ as the ability of governments to increase spending for the nutrition sector without
jeopardizing the government’s long-term solvency or crowding out expenditure in other sectors needed to

   The C-NNS-OP includes only Nutrition Department funds. The MOH invests considerable resources in the human resources
needed to deliver nutrition services, but, as outlined in the C-NNS-OP assumptions, it was agreed not to include these human
resource costs in the C-NNS-OP. Commodity costs and financing are included in the C-NNS-OP (essential nutrition commodities
procured by UNICEF and WFP with EU and KOICA funds) though the recurrent costs associated with these interventions are not
included.
77 This section draws heavily upon a recent review of health expenditures in Timor-Leste (World Bank 2016).




                                                                                                                         95
achieve other development objectives. This section seeks to answer the question: given the need for
additional financing for the scale up of nutrition interventions, what are the prospects for increasing
government spending for nutrition in the short-to-medium term? To answer this question, we review the
following five areas78 which have the potential to generate additional fiscal space for nutrition:

     1. Conducive macroeconomic conditions such as economic growth and increases in overall
        government revenue which could lead to increases in government spending for nutrition;
     2. Reprioritization of nutrition within the government budget;
     3. An increase in nutrition-sector specific resources (e.g. through earmarked taxation);
     4. Nutrition sector-specific grants and foreign aid; and
     5. An increase in the efficiency of existing government nutrition outlays.

1. Conducive Macroeconomic Trends

Timor-Leste is one of the most oil dependent countries in the world and has suffered over the past two to
three years due to the collapse in global oil prices. Overall GDP (including oil production) fell from US$6.8
billion in 2013 to projected US$2.6 billion in 2015, with government oil revenue declining from US$3.9
billion to US$0.96 billion over the same time period. Consequently, overall economic growth was estimated
at just over 4% in 2015, a slowdown from the decade of double-digit growth following independence. The
finite petroleum wealth provides a window of opportunity to build the non-oil economy and public system
foundations for improved growth prospects in the future, but the government faces the challenge of
balancing the current economic need with ensuring the sustainability of the Petroleum Fund (PF).
Government is financing development by drawing double the estimated sustainable income (ESI) from the
PF, as domestic revenue has held constant over the period 2010-2016 (Figure 28). Consequently, the overall
budget balance has fallen from a surplus of 53% of GDP in 2013 to a deficit of 6.6% in 2015 (World Bank
2016c).




78
   Due to the strong evidence for the key nutrition-specific interventions which can be delivered through the health sector, the
analysis focuses on the Ministry of Health. The current structure of the General State Budget uses only economic expenditure
categories which creates difficult to identify levels of expenditure on nutrition. Consequently, at some points expenditure on health
is used as a proxy for expenditure on nutrition-specific interventions under the assumption that nutrition accounts for a constant
share of the total health budget over time. Where data are available and as appropriate, we incorporate data from non-health sectors
to identify fiscal space for nutrition related to nutrition-sensitive interventions.

Note: *Projected figures. PF: Petroleum Fund. ESI: Estimated sustainable income which can be withdrawn

the government over-financed the budget by US$390.0 million, and used savings in government accounts
to finance part of the budget for 2013 and 2014. Estimates of development grants beyond 2016 should be
interpreted cautiously. The decline may be due, in part, to the manner of data collection.

Steady macroeconomic growth in recent years has allowed for large increases in actual government health
expenditure over last decade from approximately US$27.6 million in 2008 to US$60.2 million in 2014
(47.7% growth in real terms and an average annual real growth of about 6.8%) (World Bank 2016c). The
result has been a growth of per capita health expenditure in real terms. However, there has been little change
in the share of government health expenditure as a proportion of GDP over the same time period (Figure
29), and at 1.3%, Timor-Leste is among the lowest in the world. Assuming that nutrition as a share of health
expenditure has remained constant over the same period, it can be inferred that any nominal increases in
per capita expenditures on nutrition were derived primarily from macroeconomic growth. With
conservative economic projections for the short- to medium-term, it is unlikely that additional fiscal space
for nutrition will be achieved through economic growth.

2. Reprioritizing Nutrition: Trends in Government Spending for Key Sectors

The share of government expenditures on nutrition (and health) signal government commitment to the
issues. With a subdued growth outlook for the Timorese economy, a second source of fiscal space for
nutrition would be from re-prioritization of nutrition within the overall budget. The government has
controlled total spending, setting the overall budget ceiling in 2016 at US$1.56 billion. Thus, augmented
fiscal space for nutrition would result from contracting fiscal space for other sectors.

Richer countries will generally spend more on health, nutrition, and human development due to greater
political will to prioritize human capital. At 2.4% of total government expenditure, Timor-Leste’s public
expenditure on health is among the lowest in the world and lower than the EAP average of 9-11%. Timor-
Leste has committed less public funding to health care than similar low- and middle-income countries
(LMICs). Over the period 2008-2013, public health expenditure as a share of total government expenditure
averaged 5% (Figure 30), declining significantly between 2008 and 2011 and hovering around 2-3% in the
years thereafter. Per capita government health expenditure was estimated at US$57.00 annually (World
Bank 2015a), relatively low for the EAP region, especially when compared to countries making strong
progress towards UHC (Figure 30).

When comparing health to other sectors, infrastructure receives a large share of budgetary allocations: the
2016 General State Budget (GSB) includes an increased physical infrastructure budget financed through
contractions in the health, education, and agriculture budgets (Table 18). In 2016, the both the health and
agriculture resource envelopes declined by 18%.79 It is believed that this is due, in part, to low budget
execution and inefficient spending in these sectors. Timor-Leste has among the highest levels of social
assistance spending in the world, as reflected in the large budget for Ministry of Social Solidarity. However,
these funds are not targeted towards poverty reduction or nutrition. Fiscal prioritization of Bolsa da Mae
program could be one way of securing additional nutrition resources.

Due to line item budgeting, it is not possible to track budget allocations or expenditures for nutrition
programs, resulting in little data on the extent to which nutrition is prioritized within sectors budgets.
However, the 2016 GSB narrative outlines a number of related investments (Table 19). At US$13.4 million,
the school feeding program receives the largest goods and services allocation of all nutrition-sensitive
programs, while the 2016 allocation for social transfers (US$144.1 million) accounts is comprised primarily
of transfers for the Veteran’s Pension program.

largest portion of non-salary recurrent spending (World Bank 2016), making it likely that transfers to SISCa will account for a
small share of the US$7.6 million.



3. Nutrition-Sector Specific Resources

In the EAP region, taxes on tobacco, alcohol products, or sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) earmarked for
health have been discussed as a means of generating sector-specific resources. In theory, there is potential
that these could be further earmarked for delivery of nutrition education and interventions, but this is not
under discussion in Timor-Leste at this time.

4. Nutrition Grants and Foreign Aid

In general, donor support to the RDTL is aligned with Government’s own budgetary priorities (Figure 32).
Over the period 2013-2016, infrastructure development received the greatest share of DP support, with
social capital receiving roughly half the level of support as infrastructure.

Total ODA in Timor-Leste rose steadily over the period 2008-2011 before beginning a strong progressive
decline (Figure 33). Health has accounted for an average of 12% of total ODA over the period 2008-2014,
but has contributed on average 38% of total health expenditure. At US$35.00 per person in 2011, per capita
donor health spending in Timor-Leste is low relative to the burden of disease, compared with Sri Lanka
(US$54.00), Fiji (US$58.00) and Cambodia (US$38.00) in the same year. Based on planned donor
spending, it is possible that donor funding may continue to decrease (World Bank 2016a).

Disaggregated by sub-sector, water and sanitation accounts for the greatest share of health ODA, followed
by Family and Child Health and Communicable Disease. Between 2011 and 2014 total value of health
ODA declined, but basic nutrition increased as a share of health ODA (Figure 34). Non-communicable
diseases receive a marginal share of ODA.

The nutrition sector is currently heavily dependent on donor assistance, raising issues for the sustainability
of nutrition financing. Timor-Leste is now a lower-middle income country and is expected to see reduced
donor aid due to the favorable macroeconomic growth. When including both nutrition-specific and

                                                                                                                      101
nutrition-sensitive interventions, donors play a significant role in: (a) financing and procuring essential
nutrition commodities, all family planning commodities, and share of immunization supplies; (b)
supporting delivery of WASH software and hardware; and (c) financing nutrition-sensitive agriculture
programs. While the SDGs may draw additional, continued donor support for nutrition in the short- to
medium-term, strategic planning is needed to ensure the continuity of nutrition service delivery across
sectors in light of declining donor assistance.

5. Efficiency in Nutrition Spending

Increasing efficiency of government spending for nutrition will require that inputs such as staff, supplies,
equipment, and buildings are utilized to achieve the optimum mix of services to address the burden of
malnutrition. The following parameters are utilized to assess the efficiency of spending on nutrition: (a)
alignment of the geographic allocation of resources with the burden of malnutrition; (b) distribution of
spending across government and facility levels; (c) distribution of expenditures on inputs; and (d) efficient
use of public sector workers.

5.1 Geographic Targeting of Resources Aligned with Burden of Malnutrition
Nutrition services are mainly preventive and promotive and are financed primarily through District Health
Services (DHS) budgets. Across the districts, there is considerable variability in total District Health
Services budget allocations. In the 2016 GSB, total DHS budgets (calculated on a per capita basis) ranged
from about US$9.75 to US$37.00. DHS goods and services budgets, in particular, have seen massive
reductions since 2013, ranging US$0.06-US$17.81 in 2016 (down from a range of US$1.25-US$6.00 in
2013). From a nutrition perspective, efficient resource allocation would align district health spending --
both total and goods and services -- with the burden of stunting, but this is not the case (Figures 35-36). A
2014 World Bank review attributed the misalignment to the system of setting line item budgets
incrementally or arbitrarily, rather than taking into account district needs or activities (Nixon and
Bredenkamp 2014).

5.2 Distribution of Spending Across Government and Facility Levels
When resources are distributed efficiently for nutrition, we would expect the expenditures to be
concentrated at the level of greatest need. Health-related government spending is divided between the
Central, Hospital, and District levels, and the same can be said for nutrition. At the Central level, the
Nutrition Department is financed through the budget of the National Directorate of Public Health, which
covers the costs of training, program development, advocacy, materials, monitoring, and evaluation for
nutrition. Nutrition service delivery expenditures will fall primarily under District Health Services (with
hospital budgets covering a small minority of expenditures for the in-patient treatment of acute malnutrition
and ANC/PNC/IMCI visits at hospital level). However, within the Ministry of Health, the greatest share of
health expenditure (46%) is at the Central level (Figure 37). A World Bank (2016) review found that the
extremely high expenditures at central level are placing severe pressure on the health budget. The C-NNS-
OP estimates that 10% of total nutrition costs will be borne at the national level, while 4% is shared between
national/municipality; 21% shared between national/municipality/administrative post; and 3% between
national/municipality/administrative post/community. Even assuming that the national budget would cover,
rather than share, joint expenses, central level government expenditure on nutrition would still exceed the
level of need.

5.3 Allocation of Input Expenditures
In large part due to the growing cadre of medical doctors, MOH has experienced rapidly rising expenditures
on wages/salaries. Between 2008 and 2014 the MOH salary/wage expenditures increased from US$5.5
million to US$24.4 million (Figure 38). As a proportion of total government health expenditure, the salary
expenditure grew from 20% of total government expenditure in 2008 to 40.5% in 2014. The increase in
salary/wages has been offset by decreases 2008. The MOH budget declined by 18% between 2015 and
2016. These high levels of recurrent wage expenditures necessitated a 51% cut to goods and services budget
(reflected in Figure 36) to accommodate spending on salaries (MOF 2016a). Consequently, donors are
relied upon to finance a growing share of goods and services in the health sector, particularly at the district
level.

High levels of government expenditures on the salaries of doctors is inefficient from a nutrition perspective.
Most interventions in the SNIP can and are provided by lower levels of health professionals at the frontline,

                                                                                                                         104
including community health volunteers, nurses, and midwives. Doctors rarely provide nutrition-specific
interventions (aside from the treatment of acute malnutrition), a finding corroborated by a 2015 health
workforce study which found that only 19 of doctors had been trained in community health and 75%
required training in the Integrated Management of acute malnutrition (World Bank 2015).

6. Gaps and Opportunities in Nutrition Financing

Significant financing gaps remain to scale up implementation of the activities described under the NNS,
which has a five-year financing gap of 63%. However, in real terms this only requires an increase of
US$4.00 per capita. An assessment of fiscal space for nutrition can provide insights into the options for
closing the nutrition financing gap. Table 20 summarizes the prospect for creating fiscal space for nutrition
in Timor-Leste using each of the five pillars. Among the available options, improving prioritization and
increasing efficiency of nutrition services have the greatest potential to accelerate results for nutrition in
Timor-Leste.

Given the magnitude of malnutrition in Timor-Leste, the investments in nutrition are disproportionate to
the level of need. Though the SDP provides a foundation for investing in nutrition and human capital,
infrastructure remains a priority,80 with the Ministries of Health, Education, Social Welfare, and Agriculture
experiencing declining budgets as infrastructure expenditures rise. The SDP argues that infrastructure is
necessary to achieve social development goals in health and education as well as drive economic growth,
but global evidence has shown that the investments in economic development are slow to trickle down and
improve nutrition. At the same time, the issue of absorptive capacity cannot be ignored. Relevant ministries
must demonstrate the ability to spend resources efficiently.81

80 Infrastructure spending peaked at US$543.0 million in 2011, equivalent to nearly half of total expenditure and one of the highest
rates of infrastructure spending in the world (MOF and World Bank 2015). The government intends to “front -load” infrastructure
finance to stimulate economic and social development.
81 As reported in the MOF Budget Transparency Portal, total budget execution in 2015 for KONSSANTIL Ministries was as

follows: MAF: 70.8%; MOH: 89.4%; MSS: 94%; MOE: 98.5%; MCIE 94.2%.

                                   interventions.

On the whole, government investments in Timor-Leste are not well aligned to meet the SDP objectives
related to the reduction of malnutrition and development of human capital. Specific gaps in financing for
nutrition include the following:

       The current PAN-HAM-TIL and NNS have large financing gaps and no indication of increased
        availability of funds for nutrition in the short- and medium-term. Improving nutrition outcomes
        will be largely dependent upon a discussion of how best to increase fiscal space for nutrition.

       Decreased prioritization and budgetary allocations from the Consolidated Fund affects the service
        delivery and implementation of nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive programs in Health,
        Agriculture, and Social Solidarity.

       Key KONSSANTIL ministries lack the absorptive capacity to deliver on additional programs, even
        if financing is provided.

       Within the Ministries of Health and Agriculture, donors provide a large share of service delivery
        financing; government investment in nutrition-relevant activities is limited, which poses
        sustainability challenges as donors reduce their support to Timor-Leste.

       There are opportunities for increasing the likelihood of greater nutrition results even within the
        current budget envelopes for the KONSSANTIL ministries including MAF, MOE, MSS, MOH,
        MCIE, and Ministry of State Administration. Increasing the nutrition-sensitivity of current
        budgetary expenditures requires both (i) a technical discussion of program design and delivery; and
        (ii) budgetary allocation to programs which have nutrition-related objectives.

       Increasing the technical and allocative efficiencies of currently available resources is a strong
        option for increasing fiscal space for nutrition. Shifting resources to the scale up of interventions
        targeting the first 1,000 days can accelerate reductions in malnutrition. However, country-specific
        cost:benefit analyses are not available which could identify estimates on returns to spending and
        inform an evidence-based discussion of priorities in each line ministry, and KONSSANTIL has not
        convened a cross-sectoral discussion of prioritization, planning, and budgeting.

       Nutrition investments span a number of sectors and DP agencies, and there is currently no
        mechanism to track total spending for nutrition-sensitive and nutrition-specific programs.

Timor-Leste has made remarkable progress in scaling up the coverage and quality of essential services and
transitioning out of conflict since independence. Malnutrition is perhaps one of the greatest development
challenges facing Timor-Leste but its impact remains largely under-recognized. With one in two children
experiencing chronic undernutrition, stunting is an impediment to maximizing on the human potential in
the country. Stunting is highest among the poor, but very high stunting prevalence is found even among the
wealthiest households, pointing to behavioral and non-economic determinants of stunting in the country.
With a high number of malnourished women, there is strong evidence that malnutrition will continue to be
passed across generations if not directly, comprehensively, and immediately addressed.

High level political leadership and commitments to the Zero Hunger Challenge and Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs) provide the necessary strategic and institutional foundations to improve
nutrition. The key challenge is to build awareness among a broad-based constituency and focus on the scale
up of high impact interventions. Ultimately, this scale up will only be possible if quantity and quality of
implementation and financing is elevated to levels necessary to achieve the targets in ambitious national
commitments.

Adequate nutrition in the first 1,000 days of life will set the foundation for building the human capital
required to compete in the global knowledge economy; the stakes are too high to rely solely on
macroeconomic growth. National investments over the past decade have focused on achieving stability and
building infrastructure as the basis for non-oil growth (e.g. MSS veteran’s benefits, MOE school feeding,
and MCIE rice subsidies).82 The strong political will for these initiatives, combined with low budget
execution and results orientation in health and agriculture spending, has yielded the budgetary
deprioritization of ministries responsible for human development and poverty reduction. However, the
losses to human capital only accumulate with every year investments in the early years are forgone.
Strengthening access to health, nutrition, education, and agricultural services will not only be fundamental
to improving the nutrition situation in Timor-Leste, but also to ensuring the development of a sustainable,
inclusive economy and vibrant Timor-Leste.

Recommendations
This section provides recommendations to address the gaps and opportunities identified throughout this
report. The recommendations are divided into actions at five levels, building from the grassroots
family/community to cross-sectoral coordination and financing of institutions at the highest levels. Specific
recommended short-term (1-2 years), medium-term (2-5 years), and long-term (5 or more years) actions—
applicable to government and non-state stakeholders—are included at each level. To maximize impact and
accelerate progress, it is critical that actions are initiated at each level and leverage the comparative
advantages of the various players working in this space.

1. Family/Community

Recommendation 1: Empower families and communities with the knowledge and resources necessary to
demand optimum nutrition and growth for their children.




82 It is important to note that conflict can arise from a host of complex and non-linear factors, including hunger, community,
livelihoods, and basic welfare (World Bank 2011).

                                                                                                                         107
Families and their communities form the backbone of Timorese society. Widespread improvements in
nutritional status will be difficult in the absence of strong families and community engagement.
Communities require support to reduce the normalcy of stunting, build knowledge of malnutrition, and
define solutions, building off of community assets and institutions. Appropriately crafted messages must
reach communities through a variety of channels, supported by a cadre of motivated frontline workers and
para-professionals who can facilitate the process of defining barriers and solutions. Development partners,
in particular, should invest in the high quality formative research and expand the technical content of
behavior change messages to include nutrition, health, hygiene, reproductive health, parenting, food
production/consumption, household decision making, and self-esteem, respect, and gender roles (especially
for youth). The audiences must also be broadened to include new groups, such as: adolescents (boys and
girls), mothers-in-law, husbands, and community leaders.

 enforcement.
 Strengthen nutrition knowledge of civil society organizations and use community              Ongoing
 structures to disseminate nutrition behavior change.

2. Services

Recommendation 2: Scale up the delivery of a package of evidence-based nutrition-specific and key
nutrition-sensitive interventions focused on the first 1,000 days.

Substantial progress has been made in developing the policies and guidelines for an integrated approach to
nutrition. However, the package of nutrition-specific interventions needs to become a fully integrated
component of Primary Health Care and delivered nationally. Specifically, the Ministry of Health needs to:
(a) focus on achieving higher coverage of deworming; (b) vitamin A, iron-folic acid, and therapeutic zinc
supplementation; and (c) infant and young child feeding promotion delivered skilled professional/para-
professional channels. Strengthening the community-based delivery platforms for these interventions can
accelerate attainment of higher coverage. To address anemia, supplementation and fortification
interventions can address anemia and micronutrient deficiencies for children, women and adolescent girls.
Where new delivery platforms are needed (e.g. targeting non-pregnant women and adolescent girls with
IFA) these should be rapidly pilot-tested and scaled. Wasting remains a serious issue (especially in specific
geographic pockets), requiring prevention and treatment for children with acute malnutrition. However,
there is not yet clear evidence of adherence and effectiveness for the costly supplementary feeding for the
treatment of moderate acute malnutrition in Timor-Leste. A program evaluation is needed to determine



                                                                                                         108
cost-effectiveness and the return on investment expected from targeted supplementary feeding before
continuing to scale up this component of SNIP.

 increasing coverage of IYCF promotion and supplementation of deworming,
 therapeutic zinc, iron-folic acid for pregnant and lactating women, and vitamin A
 supplementation.

 appropriate scale.
 Define and strengthen the community-based platform for delivery of nutrition               Short/Medium
 services through PHC, focusing especially on infant and young child feeding
 promotion and growth promotion.
 Pilot and scale up delivery of supplementation and counselling to address anemia              Medium
 in adolescent girls.
 Scale up universal salt iodization: adopt Salt Law, improve production and quality         Medium/Long
 assurance, establish partnerships between MCIE, MOH, and private sector.
 Introduce mandatory food fortification: develop partnerships with MCIE, private            Medium/Long
 sector, and development partners to develop policy and legislation and develop
 programs for market-based fortification of oil, staple foods and/or complementary
 foods.

Evidence-based nutrition-sensitive services also need to be scaled up to address the underlying determinants
of early life malnutrition. Delivery platforms for these interventions should be leveraged for the delivery of
nutrition-relevant messages. In order to increase likelihood of impact, these programs should prioritize
targeting towards nutritionally vulnerable women and children, but also need to be available to adolescents
(the next generation of parents) and support systems (husbands, mothers-in-law, community leaders). The
pathways from intervention to nutritional outcome need to be clearly defined, the inherent assumptions
addressed in the program, and effectiveness assessed through the collection of appropriate indicators of diet
and nutritional status.

Health Sector
Health inputs such as facilities and workforce have improved over the past decade, but coverage of essential
health services remains low. Demand generation and outreach are necessary to stimulate consumption of
health services, while additional incentives and performance-based management can help improve service
delivery quality. Specific recommendations include: (a) scale up the delivery of reproductive health and
family planning services to ensure universal coverage; (b) improve delivery of essential NCD services
through PHC; (c) revive the KUBASA to be implemented through SnF visits; and (d) strengthen provision
of messages linking hygiene, sanitation, and nutrition through the PAKSI program.

 Scale up the PAKSI program to universal coverage.                                               Medium

Agriculture Sector
In the agriculture sector, the focus should be on increasing women’s empowerment and improving dietary
quality through increased demand for and production, productivity and market availability of nutrient-rich
foods (especially fortified and animal-source foods). There is a need to rethink how price, income, and other
agricultural supports can shift from producing ever more staple grains and instead promote nutrition-
sensitive and climate smart agriculture aimed at eradicating poverty and food insecurity (World Bank 2015).
Specifically, there is a need for programs which focus on the production and productivity of pulses, poultry
and poultry products, livestock, and aquaculture. For these programs to be successful, complementary
activities are needed to: (a) increase access to irrigation for smallholders; (b) expand and improve the quality
of the veterinary service to promote livestock and poultry heath; (c) build the capacity of agricultural
extensionists to provide information to farmers who produce these products; and (d) build the rural markets
for these products. Increasing agricultural income will not be effective in improving nutrition if nutrient
rich foods are neither available in rural markets nor affordable. Additional activities to improve post-harvest
handling and storage can help improve food security and decrease exposure to aflatoxins. In the design of
agriculture programs, stronger linkages between agriculture activities and nutrition outcomes need to be
measured, as well as intermediate outcomes related to food group consumption, dietary diversity, household
expenditures, and women’s empowerment.

                                                                                            Implementation

 vegetables.
 Build value chains and increase market availability of nutrient-rich foods                 Medium/Long
 (legumes, dairy, flesh foods) in rural areas.

Education Sector
The role of the education sector in improving nutrition is two-fold: (1) provide programs and services which
can improve health status of children and adolescents; and (2) provide skills, knowledge, and tools which
will enable children and youth to effectively prevent malnutrition as parents of the next generation.

The education services which can be nutrition-sensitive span from pre-primary through secondary
education (tertiary addressed as a part of capacity building). In the area of early childhood development,
the focus should remain on identifying effective community-based platforms for parenting education
(including early stimulation and nutrition) and early learning. In primary school, a rigorous evaluation of
the school feeding program is needed to provide a better understanding of the effectiveness and cost-
effectiveness, not only from a food security and social inclusion perspective, but also to identify the impact
of the SFP as a nutrition intervention. This evidence on effectiveness can inform budgeting and technical
design decisions of school feeding (Bundy et al 2009). In the short-term, the provision of fortified rice
through the program will improve the nutritional impact of the program. Beyond the school feeding
program, services which meet the needs of the growing youth population are severely lacking (SSYS 2014).
School-based deworming can and should be rapidly scaled up, along with access to WASH in schools and
supplementation. In the medium- to long-term, programs should be explored which can incentivize girls’
secondary school completion.

The education interventions to build nutrition knowledge and skills will not provide immediate impact on
reducing early childhood stunting, but are necessary nonetheless. Health and nutrition promotion activities
using school- and non-school delivery platforms (including delivery of these topics into
vocational/technical training and second-chance education curricula) need to be scaled up. While curricula
exist on paper, teacher training and supervision are needed to ensure that the materials are delivered
according to guidelines. Youth need to be targeted with appropriate information regarding sexual and
reproductive health and basic anatomical knowledge. Peer-to-peer sharing groups via extra-curricular
channels may be an effective method of knowledge transfer, particularly for the sensitive topic of sexual
health.

Commerce, Industry, and Environment / Private Sector
The Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Environment (MCIE) plays a key role in the interface between
the public and private sectors as related to nutrition in Timor-Leste. In the short-term, MCIE can increase
access to fortified staple foods through mandatory fortification of all products delivered through the school

                                                                                                          111
feeding programme and other safety net programs. In the medium- to long- term, MCIE should take a
leadership role in facilitating the coordination with MAF and MOH needed to accelerate progress on salt
iodization, food fortification, and aflatoxin control. Furthermore, MCIE involvement will be critical in
developing food policies, standards, and regulations which can help mitigate the development of
overweight/obesity.

Social Welfare and Community Development
The Ministries of Social Solidarity and State Administration implement programs which can address
constraints to nutrition at the community and household levels. Timor-Leste’s community-driven
development programs (PNDS and PDID) offer publicly financed platforms to respond to the community
needs and constraints to improved nutrition (Recommendation 1). Timor-Leste can implement a pilot of
nutrition-sensitive CDD with strong facilitation and community capacity building and incentivize locally-
identified solutions to malnutrition. The Ministry of Social Solidarity has the responsibility for providing
social safety nets and protective measures for the most nutritionally vulnerable. MSS should continue to
pilot and refine its use of strong parenting and nutrition accompanying measures and look to scale up the
coverage of the Bolsa da Mae program.

3. Institutions

Recommendation 3: Build capacity and strengthen institutions to promote efficient, quality service
delivery.

Institutional strengthening will be fundamental to achieving quality nutrition-specific and nutrition-
sensitive services delivered at scale. Many of these actions are ongoing and should continue.

Massive public investments have been made to build the civil service. Nutrition training and capacity
building for frontline service providers is necessary to maximize this investment in the public sector,
beginning with health providers and expanding to agriculture extensionists, social animators, teachers, and
community mobilizers. The skills and ambitions of trained professionals need to be supported by stronger
human resource management and supportive supervision, especially at lower levels. Civil service reform
will help ensure that individuals have security to remain in the positions for which they have been trained.


                                                                                                        112
Supply chain constraints impede the availability of nutrition supplies and commodities. These items are
included on the essential medicines list and nutrition should be integrated into existing efforts to strengthen
the independent medical stores (SAMES) forecasting, management, and delivery functions. Improved
public financial management will support ministries to better plan and budget for essential nutrition-related
programs. This includes requesting goods and services budgets which are sufficient to cover the operational
costs associated with community-based outreach. Strong monitoring and evaluation, supported by
appropriate data collection, will allow ministries to undertake evidence-informed decision making and
provide the basis for monitoring progress against a common results framework. In addition to these
activities, development partners -- in particular -- should increase their focus on implementing nutrition
research and conducting rigorous program evaluations to improve service delivery in the Timorese context.

4. Leadership and Coordination

Recommendation 4: Strengthen coordination and accountability mechanisms for a multisectoral
response to malnutrition.

Timor-Leste has many strategic frameworks and high level champions to motivate a strong response to
reducing malnutrition. However, stronger and sustained leadership and coordination is needed to move the
nutrition agenda forward in Timor-Leste. Improving nutrition must become a central priority for
KONSSANTIL and member ministries, and can be evidenced through leadership commitment,
prioritization of PAN-HAM-TIL activities based on cost:benefit analyses, and creation of a common results
framework with sectors responsible for appropriate nutrition-related indicators.

The strong global and domestic momentum to address malnutrition has contributed to a proliferation of
projects and stakeholders involved in addressing the immediate and underlying determinants of
malnutrition. However, the nutrition community is fragmented and lacks focus; in the absence of strong
government leadership and coordination, the stakeholders supporting policy development and program
implementation tend to be driven by their institutional priorities. A multi-stakeholder coordination platform
for nutrition should be created with strong government leadership. This platform should involve the public
sector, donors and development partners, and private sector. Such a platform could facilitate mapping down
to the suco level and promote improved convergence at national and sub-national levels.

5. Financing

Recommendation 5: Secure domestic and donor financing needed to deliver the package of nutrition
programs at scale.

Increased quality and quantity of nutrition investments are necessary to achieve national economic and
human development goals; the current level and utilization of resources will not be sufficient to improve
nutrition in Timor-Leste. Development partners provide the greatest share of nutrition-specific and a large
share of nutrition-sensitive financing (particularly related to agriculture/food security and reproductive
health), yet national coverage has not been achieved for many of these programs. Despite nutrition’s
elevated public profile, it appears little has changed with regard to investment priorities. Economic growth
alone is not enough to improve nutrition. It is imperative that sufficient domestic, donor, and private sector
financing is available and efficiently used, prioritizing those interventions and programs with greatest
evidence of effectiveness.



                                                                                                          114
The first step is to build awareness of the magnitude of the challenge and the benefits to be reaped from
prioritizing investments in evidence-based programs. Advocacy with the Prime Minister, Parliamentarians,
and Ministry of Finance throughout the budget cycle is needed to expand knowledge and awareness of all
forms of malnutrition and its consequences. The definition of “malnourished” must be expanded beyond
hunger acute malnutrition, raising stunting as a health and development issue in a sensitive manner, while
also improving the understanding of anemia and low-birth weight.

Increased political awareness must be matched by greater total financing for nutrition, as well as improved
efficiency of nutrition spending. Actions to support this effort will include the development of a system for
monitoring nutrition budget allocations and expenditures (through program based budgeting) against the
common results framework, moving towards results-based financing for nutrition as appropriate. With
development partner support expected to decline in the medium-term, there is need for a critical assessment
of the sustainability of nutrition financing and the development of a nutrition financing strategy for the
country.

 Key Recommendations and Supportive Actions for Nutrition Financing                        Timeline for
                                                                                          Implementation
 Advocate for nutrition with Prime Minister, Parliamentarians, and Ministry of                 Short
 Finance throughout the budget cycle.
 Review program-based budgeting to ensure that nutrition budget allocations can be              Short
 identified and evidence-based interventions are included.
 Increase efficiency of nutrition budget allocations: prioritize financing of programs        Medium
 which have greatest evidence of impact; allocate budgets proportionate to nutrition
 need; integrate and cost out the Primary Health Care Package.
 Develop a financing strategy for nutrition.                                                 Medium
 Establish a system for monitoring nutrition budget allocations and expenditures.            Medium

        STEPS Survey Timor-Leste (2014)
        Programa Nasional Dezenvolvimentu Suco Baseline Survey (2014)

        Timor-Leste Demographic and Health Survey (2003)

The 2013 Timor-Leste Food and Nutrition Survey (TLFNS) provides the most up-to-date source of
information on maternal and child nutrition, and was administered in May-September, 2013 and launched
by the Timor-Leste Ministry of Health in October, 2015. The TLFNS collected data from infants and
young children (age 0-59 months) and their non-pregnant mothers (age 14-60 years).83 The quantitative
household and anthropometric survey is representative at the national and district levels, whereas the
biochemical survey of micronutrient status and aflatoxin exposure is representative only at the national
level.

The most recent available overweight/obesity data for children are found in the TLFNS. Adult (male and
female) overweight data come from the 2014 STEPS survey of non-communicable disease risk factors. The
STEPS was conducted in collaboration with the WHO and Universidade Nacional Timor Leste (UNTL) in
2014 and included socio-demographic and behavioral information, height, weight, blood pressure
measurements, and biochemical indicators. The sample included 2609 adults age 18-69 and is
representative at the national level.




83 The inclusion criteria for women in TLFNS varies from that of the DHS. TLFNS reports findings from non-pregnant mothers
age 14-60. DHS reports findings for all women (pregnant and non-pregnant) age 15-49. For simplicity, “WRA” will be used to
denote women of reproductive age throughout this report, but interpretation should be based upon the inclusion criteria of the
particular survey.

There are not distinct trends between the prevalence of stunting and its determinants at the district level
(Figure), which indicate that the various districts will have context-specific drivers of stunting. Looking
across the multiple immediate and underlying causes, a determination can be made regarding whether or
not nutrition interventions need to be national (for instance, increasing knowledge and use of reproductive
and family planning services; improving access and use of sanitation facilities) and where others will be
appropriate in smaller geographic areas or during certain seasons (improving income generation
opportunities; improving food affordability).

            representatives, children and young people in leading promotional activities, community
            dialogues, reflection on child and family welfare (including child protection, gender-based
            violence) and promotion of community values.

            point and the local administration.84
          Cooperate with focal points of the National Division of Social Security, National Division of
            Social Services, National Division of the National Liberty Combatants and the National
            Division of Disaster Management.85
          Plan and manage activities within the sub-district in coordination with the district officers and
            the CFWO, ensuring maximum time spent in communities.

84 This assumes that the data collection and verification of potential beneficiaries in the Bolsa de Mae programme is reconsidered
and the workload shared between the district level, the subdistrict and the local administration.
85 This assumes coordination at the district level, willingness to have the focal point do more work and less daily reliance of the

focal point on the social animator.

Annex 13. The SISCa Program
SISCa is based upon the principal of “from, with, and to the community” and provides integrated of health promotion,
prevention, and treatment at the community level (MOH 2008). Health workers and volunteers from NGOs—including
World Vision, CVTL, and CARE—are often utilized to fill gaps in the public health system and provide the health
promotion and health education along with doctors and nurses. SISCa is the site for a number of health promotion and
nutrition activities (Box A13.1). In the districts, there is a high regard for SISCa as a platform for increasing access to health
services. SISCa is often recognized as the primary site for women and children to receive nutrition interventions, particularly
with regard to growth monitoring. In focus group discussion, men and women have expressed a high degree of satisfaction
with the types and access to services that SISCa provides (Dookhan-Khan 2015). However, there are many challenges faced
in the implementation of SISCa at the community level which constrain the coverage and quality of nutrition-related
services:

 BOX A13.1 The SISCa Program

 The six table system is the foundation of the SISCa program. Services are delivered as follows:

 Table 1: Registration - Volunteers (PSFs) register all participants in SISCa register as well as in LISIO (mother-child
 book). health map of suco.

 Table 2: Nutrition Assistance - PSFs provide growth monitoring (weight and MUAC) on all children under 5 and
 pregnant mothers. Identify children and pregnant women with malnutrition, and arrangements made between health
 workers, volunteers, and suco chefe for home visits.

 Table 3. Health Assistance for Pregnant Mothers and Children
    a. LISIO: Complete, review, and explain growth chart (to mother and/or husband).
    b. Antenatal care: Counselling, monitoring for anemia, blood pressure, weight and height, physical exam, distribution
        of IFA, and provision of tetanus toxoid injection. High risk pregnancies are identified and referred to CHC/referral
        hospital.
    c. Postnatal care for recently delivered infants.
    d. Care for sick children under 5 (IMCI): Provide ORS, education on danger signs.
    e. Family planning: Provide counselling on natural and modern methods; provide injections, pills, condoms, and refer
        to CHC for others.
    f. Immunization: Provide all routine immunizations for children under 5.

 Table 4. Personal Hygiene and Sanitation - PSFs deliver information on personal hygiene, sanitation, and healthy home
 environment. Also clip fingernails.

 Table 5. Health Assistance - Health workers provide treatment for diseases based on MoH protocols. Includes
 deworming.

 Table 6. Health Promotion and Education - Volunteers and/or health workers use adult participatory methods to provide
 information on infectious disease prevention and treatment, non-infectious disease prevention and engage in cooking
 demonstrations, film screenings, games, songs, and/or simulation.

                                                                                                                             151
Coverage: Community participation can be low due to both poor community mobilization on behalf of the PSFs and
community leaders as well as low incentives for participation. One DPHO indicated that community members will not
participate without receiving an incentive, a finding reflected in women’s discontent with the decision to discontinue
providing supplementary food through SISCa (Dookhan-Khan 2015). Furthermore, though SISCa services were intended
to penetrate the entire community, a recent process evaluation i n Bobonaro revealed that “those who live in remote areas
(far from SISCA) have not been covered and have not shown a significant change [in behavior]” (Dookhan -Khan 2015).
SISCa participants are usually those who live closer, and those living more remote don’t attend. Adolescents are
hypothetically eligible to attend SISCa but don’t, for the most practical reason that SISCa is often held during school hours.

Quality service delivery: There are limitations in the capacity to delivery high quality services through SISCa. These stem
from low human resources capacity (especially for PSFs) as well as insufficient availability of necessary supplies and
materials. It is rare that all six tables are set up and utilized according to the guidelines. Supervision is not consistent, in part
due to limited access to transportation for DHS staff, who struggle to supervise all 50 suco activities per month without
regular access to vehicles and fuel.

Through the EU-funded Integrated Nutrition Program, UNICEF intended to provide support to MOH to improve the quality
of nutrition services through SISCa. However, these activities have been delayed as MOH has not provided a clear statement
on the future role of SISCa. The World Bank trust-funded National Health Sector Support Program had funded operational
costs for the SISCa program into calendar year 2015. Interviews with key health stakeholders demonstrated a lack of clarity
amongst government and non-government stakeholders regarding the continuation of SISCa. In some districts, it was
reported that SISCa remained operational and PSFs continued to report for duty, while in others the back pay was beginning
to prevent PSFs from turning up.
