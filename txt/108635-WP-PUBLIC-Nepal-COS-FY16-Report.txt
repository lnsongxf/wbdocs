I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better understanding
of how stakeholders in Nepal perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
     General Issues Facing Nepal
     Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
     World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
     The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
     Working with the World Bank Group
     World Bank Group’s Work in Response to the Earthquake in Nepal
     The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Nepal
     Communication and Information Sharing
     Background Information


II. Methodology
From May to June 2016, 481 stakeholders of the WBG in Nepal were invited to provide their
opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a Country Opinion Survey.
Participants were drawn from the office of the President/Prime Minister, office of a Minister,
office of a Parliamentarian, employees of ministries/ministerial departments/implementation
agencies, Project Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects or
consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs, local government office
or staff, bilateral/multilateral agencies, private sector organizations, private foundations, the
financial sector/private banks, NGOs/community-based organizations (CBOs), the media,
independent government institutions, trade unions, faith-based groups, youth groups,
academia/research institutes/think tanks, and the judiciary branch.

A total of 324 stakeholders participated in the survey (67% response rate). Respondents either
received an invitation to complete the questionnaire via email and completed it online or
respondents received the questionnaire via post and, once completed, returned it accordingly.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the WBG’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions
are identified throughout the survey report.

The results of this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY ’13 (response rate was 76%, N = 310). The data were weighted to reach similar
stakeholder compositions across the two survey years, allowing for more statistically reliable
comparisons. Also, stakeholders who identified themselves as “Other” in the stakeholder
category options were not included in these comparisons. As a result, mean ratings, percentages
of respondents, and the total number of respondents in both years are slightly different from
those of the original data reported in the FY ’13 COS report and the non-weighted data presented
in this report. For the weighted stakeholder breakdown and year comparison results, please refer
to Appendix E (see page 94).

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
      For all further analyses, the small number of respondents from private foundations, youth
       groups, women’s groups, and trade unions were combined with those from NGOs/CBOs
       to form a “Civil Society” category. The few respondents from the office of the
       President/Prime Minister, the office of a Minister, the Office of a Parliamentarian, and
       independent government institutions were included in the “Other” category.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
        Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey indicated statistically
         similar levels of familiarity with the WBG compared to respondents from the FY ’13
         Country Survey (weighted mean in FY ’16 = 5.9; weighted mean in FY ’13 = 6.1)1.
        Collaboration: Respondents who collaborate with the WBG gave significantly higher
         ratings of familiarity with the WBG (mean rating = 6.7) than respondents who do not
         collaborate with the WBG (mean rating = 5.3).
        Impact of Familiarity: Respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the WBG were
         moderately, significantly correlated with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
         in Nepal and the extent to which the WBG plays a relevant role in development in Nepal.

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
Attributing Failed/Slow Reform Efforts

      Year comparison: Respondents in the FY ’13 Country Survey indicated that they most
       often attributed failed or slow WBG assisted reform efforts to ongoing political instability
       (percentage of respondents = 39%), followed by an inadequate level of civil society
       participation (31%), the government working inefficiently (30%), and political pressures
       and obstacles (30%).

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (continued)
As noted in the “Methodology” section, the indicator questions referred to throughout the survey
report are questions that are asked in every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey.
These will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.


The World Bank Group’s Overall Effectiveness (Indicator Question)
        Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey had significantly higher
         ratings for the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Nepal (weighted mean = 6.2) compared to
         respondents from the FY ’13 Country Survey (weighted mean = 5.7)3.
        Stakeholders: Employees of ministries gave the highest ratings for the WBG’s overall
         effectiveness whereas respondents from bilateral/multilateral agencies and the financial
         sector/private banks gave significantly lower ratings.
        Collaboration: Respondents who are collaborating with the WBG gave significantly
         higher ratings for the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Nepal (mean rating = 6.5)
         compared to respondents who are not collaborating (mean rating = 6.0).

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (continued)
Overall Ratings for Indicator Questions by Stakeholder Groups
      Stakeholders: Respondents from PMUs/Consultants on WBG-supported projects had the
       highest mean ratings for the aggregated responses to the twenty-six COS indicator
       questions whereas respondents from the financial sector/private banks and
       bilateral/multilateral agencies had significantly lower mean ratings. Responses for
       individual indicator questions by stakeholder groups can be found in Appendix B (see

Effectiveness of WBG’s Support in Sectoral Areas (continued)

      Stakeholders: There were significant stakeholder group differences across eight of these
       thirty-three development areas (refer to Appendix B, page 67, for a complete
       breakdown). For the most part, respondents from PMUs/Consultants on WBG-supported
       projects, the media, and other organizations tended to give the highest ratings for the
       WBG’s effectiveness in these areas whereas respondents from bilateral/multilateral
       agencies and the financial sector/private banks tended to give significantly lower ratings
       of effectiveness. Those development areas which had significant stakeholder group
       differences were:
           “Gender equity”;
           “Transport”;
           “Urban development”;
           “Regulatory framework”;
           “Social cohesion/Inclusion”;
           “Health”;
           “Public sector governance/reform”; and
           “Education”.

Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Nepal, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty-three specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Nepal. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at environmental sustainability;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at urban development;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at natural resource management; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at rural development.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Nepal, suggesting that ratings of
       effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
       analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at social cohesion/inclusion;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at local governance and institutions;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at economic growth;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at job creation/employment; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at water and sanitation.

Comparing responses across Country Surveys reflect changes in attitudes over time, but also changes in respondent
samples and changes to the survey instrument itself. To reduce the influence of the latter factor, only those
questions with similar response scales/options were analyzed. Although the FY13 and FY16 samples were fairly
similar, the samples from both years were weighted to have equivalent stakeholder groups.

                            World Bank Group Country Survey FY16 – Nepal


The World Bank Group is interested in gauging the views of clients and partners who are either involved in
development in Nepal or who observe activities related to social and economic development. The following survey
will give the World Bank Group’s team that works in Nepal, greater insight into how the Bank’s work is perceived.
This is one tool the World Bank Group uses to assess the views of its stakeholders, and to develop more effective
strategies that support development in Nepal.

A local independent firm has been hired to oversee the logistics of this survey. This ensures anonymity and
confidentiality. We hope you’ll be candid.

Finally, the survey relates to the World Bank Group’s work. The World Bank Group consists of IBRD, IDA, IFC,
MIGA, and ICSID. When responding to the survey, please consider the area of the World Bank Group with which
