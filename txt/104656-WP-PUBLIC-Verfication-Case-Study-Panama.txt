Abstract: Verification differentiates results-based financing (RBF) from other health-financing
mechanisms, and it is considered an important process of RBF program design and
implementation. Despite the vital role it plays in RBF, not much has been written about verification
as a process, and information about different elements of the process—frequency, cost, and direct
and indirect effects among others—is scarce. Panama’s Health Protection for Vulnerable
Populations Program (PSPV) uses an RBF mechanism to deliver health services to the country’s
rural poor. As in many RBF schemes, a major component of the PSPV is the verification of results.
This study focuses on PSPV’s verification process, highlights its results and their application, and
identifies lessons learned. Such information is useful to policy makers and technical experts
interested in or designing RBF mechanisms.

Keywords: verification, PSPV, Panama, results-based financing (RBF), lessons learned

This case study is part of a World Bank-published series that examines verification in results-based
financing (RBF) programs in six countries. The series is intended to provide RBF practitioners,
technical experts, and policy makers with practical information they can use to inform the design
and implementation of the verification process in their respective RBF programs. This particular
case study on Panama’s Health Protection for Vulnerable Populations Program (PSPV) follows a
framework developed to permit cross-country comparisons. More specifically, this study presents
an overview of the PSPV’S RBF mechanism and the program’s verification process. The study also
outlines the findings and results of verification, as well as the costs associated with verification.
Finally, it provides a brief summary of lessons learned. The complexity of verification in Panama’s
PSPV makes it an especially interesting and informative case.

                                       INTRODUCTION

Panama is an upper-middle income country located at the southern tip of Central America. The
country of 3.86 million boasts high economic and development indicators. In 2013, its Gross
National Income (GNI) per capita was USD 10,700, and its Human Development Index (HDI) was
.765, ranking it 65th in the world out of 187 countries and fourth out of the 20 countries in the region
(UNDP, 2013).

Panama’s health spending is generally in line with its income status and level of development. Total
health expenditure in 2012 accounted for 7.6 percent of the country’s GDP, and per capita spending
was USD 723. On average, the country performs well on key health indicators. Panama’s infant
mortality rate in 2012 was 16 per 1,000 live births, and under-five mortality was 19 per 1,000 live
births. The country’s maternal mortality rate in 2013 was 85 per 100,000 live births (World Bank,
2013).

                     HDI                                   .765
                     Total health expenditure (% GDP)      7.6
                     Total health expenditure per capita 723

                     Maternal Mortality Rate (per 100,000) 85
                     Infant mortality rate (per 1,000)     16
                     Under-five mortality rate (per 1,000) 19
                                   Source: World Bank Open Data, 2013



These averages, however, mask the disparities in health outcomes between urban and rural and
indigenous areas where access to quality health services is less equitable. For example, in 2010
the infant mortality rate in the rural province of Bocas del Toro was 26.6, and in Guna Yala, an
indigenous area, it was 22.3 (PAHO, 2012). Under-five mortality was, respectively, 2.6 and 0.6
times higher than the national average (PAHO/MINSA, 2012).

Over the past decade, the Government of Panama (GOP) has used different results-based
financing (RBF) approaches to improve health outcomes and to address the inequity of health
services. In 2008, it introduced the World Bank-financed Health Equity and Performance
Improvement (HEPI) project to implement the Health Protection for Vulnerable Populations (PSPV)
program. The PSPV is one of two components of the Ministry of Health’s (MOH) Coverage
Extension Strategy (EEC), and provides health services to the rural poor. Since its implementation,
the PSPV has provided more than 200,000 beneficiaries with direct and continuous access to a
package of health services.

As in many RBF schemes, a major component of the PSPV is the verification of results. This study,
therefore, will focus on PSPV’s verification process, highlight its results and their application, and
identify lessons learned.

                                       METHODOLOGY:
This case study is part of a larger, six-country series on verification, and it follows a framework
developed to permit cross-country comparisons. This comparative framework includes the
following sections: i.) an overview of the PSPV; ii.) a description the program’s verification process;
iii.) the findings and results of verification; iv.) the costs associated with verification; and v.) a brief
summary of lessons learned.

The case study, which covers the years 2011 and 2012, is primarily based on two sources of
information: quarterly reports and interviews with government counterparts. The quarterly reports,
which formed the basis of the results section, were produced during the verification process and
are known as the Informe de Certificación del Padrón de Población Beneficiaria (Report on the
Certification of the Population Registry). The interviews were conducted with officials involved in
the implementation of the PSPV program, and the information yielded in these interviews
concerned the program, the verification process, and lessons learned.

                            CONTEXT: RBF IN PANAMA
Panama has used different RBF approaches to address the country’s gaps in access to health
services and to improve health outcomes. In 2006, the GOP introduced the Opportunities Network
(RDO), a conditional-cash transfer program targeting poor households. Under this program, cash
transfers are made once households have met certain conditions. Two conditions of the RDO are
health related: i.) completing antenatal care for pregnant women and; ii.) ensuring that vaccinations
of children under five are up-to-date.

Another example is the Health Coverage Expansion Strategy (EEC, for its Spanish acronym), which
uses capitation payments that create financial incentives for providers to achieve better results.
The EEC facilitates the delivery of two related packages of health services: i.) the Integrated
Package of Health Care Services (PAISS+N), targeted to indigenous communities; and ii.) the
Health Protection for Vulnerable Populations program (PSPV, for its Spanish acronym) targeted to
the rural poor, non-indigenous populations. The PSPV is the focus of this case study.

The PSPV program’s organizational arrangements are the following: the MOH’s Technical
Coordination Board, (CODIPRO) directs the PSPV program at the central level. The Directorate of
Health Service Provision (DPSS) and the Health Management, Administrative, and Financial Unit
(UGSAF) are responsible for its technical oversight and financial management. The Directorate for
Regional Health Services (DRS) supervises the Basic Health Units (UBAs). The organizational
structure of the PSVP is represented visually in Figure 2 below.

The PSPV’s package of health services is delivered through basic health units (UBA), which also
identify and enroll beneficiaries. There are 79 UBAs in 12 regions, and they operate as mobile
health teams. Mobile health teams could be: i) not-for-profit private health provider contracted by
MOH central level to deliver the health package, referred to as external organizations
(organizaciones externas - OE), or ii) mobile health teams consisting of government health
professionals designated by the MOH’s Directorate for Regional Health Services (DRS), referred
to as institutional groups (grupos institucionales - GI). Table 2 below highlights the type (i.e. GI or
OE), population coverage, and capitation payment of the UBAs in the regions in which they operate.

Under the PSPV, capitation is used to pay the UBAs, all of which have different capitation rates,
which can range between USD 41 and USD 53 annually. The calculation of these capitation
payments is based on the costs associated with the delivery of services (including human resources
and supplies/equipment) and the cost of performance-based payments for the indicators described
below.

The capitation is divided into three separate payments. One payment is made every two months,
following the completion of an UBA’s health visits to rural areas called “rounds”, based on the
percentage of targets achieved for five coverage indicators. This payment can be a maximum of
65 percent of the capitation rate (Tables 2 and 3).

                                    a population group during each health round.
     Population groups              UBAs should “protect” a minimum of 80 percent of the
     protected                      resident beneficiary population in the communities
                                    belonging to the population group that they are
                                    responsible for during each round. A population group is
                                    considered to be protected when at least one of its
                                    inhabitants has received the package of PSPV preventive
                                    and curative services via the UBA in its community or

Another payment, which is made every four months, is based on the achievement of ten service-
provision indicators (Table 4). Each indicator is weighted equally, and over the course of a year,
health facilities can be paid a maximum of 30 percent of the capitation rate. Taken together, the
five coverage indicators and the ten service-performance indicators form a portfolio of 15
incentivized indicators (CPP).

Notice that there are no indicators related to quality of care, however, compliance with protocols is
part of the verification process and sanctions are made accordingly. Based on scientific evidence,
the MOH of Panama, similar to its Latin-American pairs, has developed and approved protocols for
medical care. The protocols aim to put evidence into practice and standardize it, establishing what,
how, when and where preventive and curative health services must be provided. In the case of
Panama, there has been an innovation: compliance with protocols is part of the agreement with
UBAs and therefore is monitored and evaluated as part of the verification process. For instance,
there is a MOH protocol for the management of patients with diabetic and hypertension that UBAs
must follow. If protocols are not properly followed, in areas such as clinical records, the delivery of
services, or even in the reporting of the attentions in the information system, penalties will be
imposed to the UBAs.

The final third payment is made annually based on a social audit, which evaluates patient-
satisfaction through a survey given to beneficiaries. This payment is five percent of the capitation
rate.

It should be noted that the UBAs receive a 20-percent advance in order to sufficiently cover
operational costs. This amount is deducted from subsequent payments based on the verification of
achieved indicators.

                   INTERNAL VERIFICATION IN THE PSPV
General Facts about the Internal Verification Process

An internal verification process is conducted by the MOH prior to the verification process performed
by an external third party. This internal process is linked to payment. Two components make up
the internal verification process:

    1. Verifying the authenticity of PSPV’s beneficiary population information using the National
       Database of Civil Registration and Identity Cards.
    2. Verifying the five coverage and ten service-provision indicators.

There are four actors involved in this verification process, namely the UBAs, the DRS, the DPSS,
and the UGSAF. Figure 3 (below) visually represents the role of these actors in the internal
verification process, and it highlights the flow of information.

How is the PSPV’ Beneficiary Population Register Internally Verified?

The objective of verifying PSPV’s beneficiary population register is to ensure that all eligible
beneficiaries are listed and that the information required for enrollment (i.e. demographic data) is
accurate and complete. The accuracy and completeness of this information affects the UGSAF’s
payment to the UBAs.




                                                15
The Process

The UBAs are responsible for initially enrolling individuals in the PSPV. An enrollment form
consisting of demographic data is completed for each beneficiary. A copy of this form is kept in the
beneficiaries’ records, and another is sent to the DRS. The UBAs send monthly reports to the DRS
in which they detail any additions (i.e. births or individuals previously not enrolled) or subtractions
(i.e. death or change of residence) to the list of program beneficiaries. The UBAs also send the
DRS an updated report after each health round; quarterly reports are also sent. The UBAs enter
and update all beneficiary information in the EEC database.

The DPSS consolidates the beneficiary lists and information from the UBAs’ monthly, post-health
round, and quarterly reports, and then sends a report to the DPSS. The DPSS is responsible for
beneficiary records at the national level and maintains the PSPV beneficiary population register.
Once it has received the DRS’ report, the DPSS crosschecks beneficiary names and associated
information in the EEC’s database against the Identification Verification System, which draws from
the GOP’s National Database of Civil Registration and Identity Cards. Any missing beneficiary
information or discrepancies are noted, and changes are made to the beneficiary population
register accordingly. The DPSS notifies the UGSAF of these changes. Based on these changes,
the UGSAF issues payment.

How are the Coverage and Service-Provision Internally Verified?

The objective of verifying the coverage and service-provision indicators is to ensure that program
beneficiaries have received at least one incentivized service and that providers have met quarterly
performance targets.

The Process

The UBAs register all the services they provide in the EEC’s database and beneficiary health-
related information in the MOH’s health information statistics system. They also detail their
fulfillment of coverage and service-provision indicators in their monthly, post-health round, and
quarterly reports to the DRS. The OE UBAs have their own data entry personnel; the GI UBAs use
the MOH teams already in the field. The DRS consolidates this information and sends it to the
DPSS. The DPSS compares the UBAs’ coverage and service-provision targets with the information
reported in the EEC’s database, and subsequently determines which indicators have been
achieved. The UGSAF then receives a report on the indicators and issues payment to the UBAs.

          MAJOR CHARACTERISTICS OF THE THIRD-PARTY
                   VERIFICATION PROCESS

General Facts about the Third-Party Verification Process

Under the PSPV program, a private firm with experience in project evaluations is contracted as
third-party (ATE) to carry out a verification process, which includes the following three components:

    1. Verification of the beneficiary population registered in the National Database of Civil
       Registration and Identity Cards.
    2. Verification of the coverage and service-provision indicators.
    3. Carrying out a social audit.

Two teams from the ATE jointly conduct the verification process. One team is technically oriented,
and is typically composed of nine physicians. This technical team ensures that the reported
services have been delivered following the appropriate protocols. The other team is administrative,
and its members include three accountants and eleven data-entry clerks. This administrative team
reviews the data associated with the beneficiary list. In total, the verification process requires an
average of 326 UBA staff hours per region. This number is high due to the fact, as previously noted,
that each region has multiple UBAs. Figure 4 (below) outlines how the ATE carries out its
verification process.

                                                17
How Is the Beneficiary Population Register Verified by the Third Party Verifier (ATE)?

The ATE’s verification of the beneficiary population register is carried out on a quarterly basis. The
verification is completed in two stages, and each stage has multiple stages.

Stage One

In stage one, an ATE team reviews the beneficiary population register in its entirety (one-hundred
percent of listed beneficiaries) to ensure that the information entered for each beneficiary is
complete and accurate. This information consists of a range of demographic data. Any missing or
inaccurate information is noted. The information for each beneficiary listed in the beneficiary
population register is then checked against the Identification Verification System. If discrepancies
are found between the beneficiary population register and the Identification Verification System,
the information in the latter is used and entered in the beneficiary population register.
Crosschecking the two databases allows the ATE team to identify beneficiaries not included in the
beneficiary population register, deceased beneficiaries still included in the Identification Verification
System, or cases where it is impossible to crosscheck the data.

Stage Two

Stage two occurs in the field and is carried out using records of a sample of beneficiaries. The
sample, which draws from the beneficiaries listed in the verified beneficiary population register,
represents ten percent of a population group linked to a UBA and is composed of a sub-sample of
records from the following demographic categories:

       Pregnant women
       Children less than one year
       Children between one and two years
       Children between two and three years
       Children between three and four years
       Children between four and five years
       Individuals with high blood pressure
       Individuals with diabetes mellitus
       Women over 20 years
       General Population

Once the sample has been determined, the ATE requests that the facility make the corresponding
beneficiary records available. A team from the ATE then goes to the facility. The team first confirms
that the requested beneficiary records are available, and notes the availability of these records in
a monitoring matrix. The team then assesses if the records include beneficiary enrollment forms
and if the beneficiary information is complete. If any gaps in information have been noted, the ATE
team checks the beneficiary information on the enrollment forms against the beneficiary information
listed in the beneficiary population register. The team then accepts or rejects the records based on
a set of previously established administrative and reporting criteria. This process results in a verified
list of beneficiaries and a report of rejected records.

How Are the Coverage and Service-Provision Indicators Verified by the third party verifier
(ATE)?

There are also two stages associated with the verification of the coverage and service-provider
indicators, and there are multiple steps in each stage. These stages are:

    1. Verification of services provided and received during health rounds.
    2. Verification of quarterly performance objectives and administrative processes.




                                                18
Stage One

In stage one, an ATE team first verifies beneficiary information listed in the EEC’s database by
crosschecking it against the information listed in the Identification Verification System. This process
ensures that the services recorded in beneficiary records were actually delivered and that the
beneficiary has received at least one incentivized service. Each service is associated with a
checklist of required data. Any missing or inconsistent data is noted, and results in rejection of the
record.

During stage one, a team from the ATE also reviews the UBAs’ reported number of community
visits and the number of days of services they provided. This information is checked against the
EEC’s database. Currently, this process is done manually using Excel, but the ATE is in the process
of developing an automated system.

Stage Two

Stage two is carried out in the field and draws from the same sample of beneficiary records selected
in stage two of the beneficiary population register verification process. These beneficiary records
are crosschecked against the clinical records kept at the facility level. Beneficiary identities are
matched to these clinical records, and the ATE team confirms whether or not the beneficiaries
actually received the services reported in the clinical records. Compliance with treatment protocols
is also verified. Records that were accepted during stage one may be rejected during stage two
due to inconsistencies in information or an absence of documentation. Over the course of 120
rounds of verification, 1,168 inconsistencies or lapses in information were found.

During stage two, the ATE team also reviews the facilities’ administrative processes. These
processes include accuracy of documentation and compliance with the PSPV’s financial
regulations, such as use of funds and incentives.

The ATE reports the results of the verification to the UGSAF. The DPSS and the UBAs are also
informed of the results. If there is disagreement with the results, the UBAs can file complaints,
which are then reviewed by the UGSAF.

How is the Social Audit Performed?

The ATE carries out a social audit, which is designed to assess patient satisfaction. The social
audit aims to inform the population about the services covered by the GOP; promote transparency
and accountability in the management of public resources; improve how healthcare professionals
handle the doctor-patient relationship; and get information about challenges for the proper delivery
of health services.

Social audits are carried out in each of the 12 regions and in all of the UBAs (either OE or GI).
Social audits are performed three times a year:

    •   Twice a year. Immediately after receiving medical attention in the field by the UBA, five
        people from the community are interviewed.
    •   Once a year. When an UBA has provided health services to a community for a year, five
        people from the community comprising the protected group are interviewed about UBA’s
        performance.

Social audits evaluate the complete package delivered comprising promotion, preventive and
curative services. The questionnaire contains 10 simple questions covering waiting times, proper
explanation of procedures and prescriptions, and bedside manners of health personnel (Annex 2).

Finally, based on the interviews described above, a report is prepared giving the UBA a score from
1 to 5. As previously noted, the results of the social audit are directly linked to the final five percent


                                                 19
of the payment to the UBA. According to the score obtained by the UBA, the final 5 percent of the
payment is made according to the table below:

Implementation Challenges

Throughout the life of Project implementation, the RBF processes followed were generally the
same. All the procedures mentioned above heavily relied, at least at the beginning of the program,
on paper reports and manual procedures. Later, a software solution was implemented that allows
the use of CDs which helps to reduce the number of paper reports produced. However, the
verification process still demands a significant amount of time from the human resources of all the
organizations involved.

Despite having an RBF approach, the verification process involves several actors performing
repetitive tasks. For instance, reports prepared by UBAs are reviewed by the DRS, DPSS, UGSAF
and finally the ATE and in many cases the information reviewed by these offices was similar such
as: the name and existence of a beneficiary to prevent false reporting, the correct recording of each
beneficiaries’ information and the health service delivered, and the results indicators. In addition,
the verification cycle requires a high number of reports per UBA: one every two, six and twelve
months. In total, approximately 720 reports had to be reviewed every year by the offices mentioned
above. Key personnel from the MOH and UGSAF dedicated several hours to oversee this
procedure.

To complete the verification process for each report took at least three months if there was no
discrepancy. However, in cases with discrepancies, the process could take up to a year or more.
In these cases, significant delays in payments occurred which subsequently affected the provision
of health services in the rural areas by the mobile teams. For instance in 2010, from June to August,
services were not delivered.

Finally, in order to strengthen the stewardship role of the MOH and support the decentralization
process, the program decided to involve the sub-national levels of health, the Directorate for
Regional Health Services (DRS), and established that funds were transferred from the central level
MOH to the DRS and finally to the UBAs. Although it was a good initiative, implementation shows
that it adds an additional layer of compliance with laws and control mechanisms (both the national
and sub national levels have to comply with these mechanisms) increasing the number of
administrative steps from 16 to 32, contributing to the delays in the verification process and
payments.

The RBF indicators monitored are, on the one hand, coverage levels and, on the other hand,
service-provision of priority health services. Table 5 shows the results of UBAs for the coverage
indicators. These are the most recent results available, they belong to the 2013-2014 period.

The first payment was based on coverage indicators and was made every two months (at the end
of each health round) and could be a maximum of 65 percent of the per capita amount. Payment
was based on achieving target coverage levels for the 5 indicators in Table 5 above. If these
targets were not met, the percentage of the per capita amount that the UBA received was adjusted,
it will be explained in the next section.

Table 6 shows the results of UBAs for the service-provision indicators. These are the most recent
results available, they belong to the 2013-2014 period. In this case, it has been possible to separate
them by the results achieved by OEs and GIs. As the table shows, the OEs had a better
performance in achieving the service-provision indicators compared to the GIs

The second tranche payment, paid every 4 months, was based on service-provision levels
achieved and could be for a maximum of 30 percent of the per capita amount. The results from
the previous period were supposed to be used as the basis for setting the targets for the next
period; and the MOH, UGSAF and the DRS would meet every four months to establish the
threshold levels by indicator and by population group. However, the complexity of the process
generated delays in the flow of information that made this planning exercise difficult.

Table 7 shows the average percentage of service-provision indicators by region accepted by DPSS

In collectively assessing these results, they indicate that there are differences in the indicators
achieved by region and type of UBA delivering the package of health services (OE or GI). The main
differences are seen in Bocas del Toro, Darien, and Panama Este. These regions may struggle to



                                                   22
achieve the indicators due to their remote locations or difficult climates. These challenges often
prevent the OE UBAs from making health rounds, or individuals from accessing the GI UBAs. In
general, OE UBAs tend to perform better because they are structured as firm contracts, and have
access to additional funding they can use to make health rounds happen. GI UBAs, conversely,
lack access to this additional funding.

What Are the Findings Used for?

The results of the verification process are used for three purposes:

    1. Adjustments to payments.
    2. Determination of penalties.
    3. Establishing targets for indicators.

Adjustments to Payments

The results from the verification process are used to determine payment adjustments. The ATE
makes its recommendations to the UGSAF, and the UGSAF then adjusts payments accordingly. In
2011, for example, the UGSAF’s adjustments amounted to USD 1.1 million compared to the ATE
recommendation of USD 560,709, approximately 2.8 percent of the total amount of capitation. The
UGSAF’s adjustments can be greater than what the ATE recommends because the total of the
UGSAF’s adjustments include penalties, which are described in the sub-section below.

Table 8 shows how these adjustments are calculated for the coverage indicators. As the table
illustrates, payment is related to the degree of achievement of the indicators. The rule used to
determine the payment was choosing the lowest percentage achieved for the five indicators. For
the service-provision indicators, no payment is made if an indicator is not achieved.

  Determination of Penalties

  ATE’s verification results are used to penalize UBAs for non-compliance with protocols, delays in
  service provision, and other issues. Penalties are expressed in terms of days that are given a
  monetary value based on the capitation payment. Generally, one penalty is associated with one
  day, which results in a deduction of payment between USD 10 and USD 25, depending on the size
  of the UBA’s catchment population. In 2011, there were 18,667 days of penalties at the rate of an
  average value of USD 8.64 per day. These penalties and the reasons behind them are shown in
  Table 9 below.

Establishing Targets for Indicators

The results from the verification process are also used to set the coverage and service-provision
targets. The UGSAF, DPSS and the DRS meet every four months to establish the targets for each
UBA. However, as described above, the verifications process involves several actors and is
manually intense, which generates delays in the flow of information that made the planning exercise
very difficult.

                                VERIFICATION COSTS
The firm Gesaworld SA was hired to conduct the ATE. The firm’s initial contract was for two years
(from 2010 to 2012), and it has been extended for another two. Excluding taxes, the two-year
contract amounted to USD 1,595,000; including taxes the contract was for USD 1,834,250.
Approximated, the cost of verifying one UBA per month (based on eight DRSs and five UBAs, i.e.
13 entities and 24 months) equates to USD 5,879.

Gesaworld is responsible for verifying the results of the PSPV and the conditional-cash transfer
program RDO, which they do in tandem. Therefore, the estimated cost of contracting the firm for
five years to carry out verification for both programs would be approximately USD 4.59 million
(based on 2.5 times USD 1.83 million). This figure translates to almost eight percent of the total
cost of the PSPV program and 12.8 percent of IBRD loans.

                                  LESSONS LEARNED
What Has Been Learned?

This case study has presented an overview of the verification process used in Panama’s PSPV
program, and from this overview, several thematic lessons emerge. They are discussed below.

The Use of IT Systems in the Verification Process

The verification process uses multiple IT systems, including the EEC database, the MOH’s health
information statistics system, and the Identification Verification System. These systems, however,
are not well integrated, and a manual review is subsequently required in some stages of the
verification process. Indeed, during stage one of the verification of the coverage and service-
provision indicators, the ATE must manually check the information in the EEC database against
the Identification Verification System. Such manual reviews are inefficient, carry high transaction
costs, and can result in higher error rates of reporting. Integrating the IT systems, specifically the
Identification Verification System and the EEC database, would thus improve the efficiency of the
verification process.

Synchronizing the Verification Process among Different UBAs

The different UBAs do not coordinate the dates of their health rounds and the subsequent
submission of reports. This lack of coordination results in a disjointed, internal monitoring process,
and ultimately, in an unsynchronized verification process. The unsynchronized process leads to
greater complexity and increased inefficiency, like delays in payment to the UBAs. Such payment
delays can undermine the RBF incentive system.

The ATE’s Relationship with the PVSP Stakeholders at the MOH

The ATE’s role in the PSVP and its relationship with different stakeholders at the MOH (i.e. DPSS
and UGSAF) have evolved over the years. The UGSAF’s development of guides and semi-
computerized tools—a process that presented a learning curve for all program stakeholders—
altered the ATE’s role and its set of responsibilities. Its role and responsibilities are now highly
specific and sensitive to changes in norms, procedures, and staffing of the program. Due to this,
the ATE could be better integrated into the overall program to strengthen its relationship with the
internal verifier, the DPSS. The role of the ATE needs to be reconsider; a better integration among
ATE and MOH stakeholder’s roles, namely the DPSS, could result in gains in efficiency and
program administration.

The Sample Size of Beneficiary Records and Indicators

The sample of beneficiary records constructed during the verification process represents the total
population within the UBA catchment area in ten population sub-categories (i.e. children between
three and four years). The sample does not represent each indicator, and therefore, may be too
large to accurately capture indicator achievement. For example, in six of the ten indicators, a
sample of 100 percent of the population sub-category (i.e. pregnant women) is required because it
is small relative to the total population. This requirement, however, may distort the actual
achievement of the indicators. The constructed sample and its size have cost implications:
overpayment could occur for indicators that were not actually achieved. A sample that is
representative of the indicators could be more cost-effective.

The Verification of Protocol Compliance

The ATE’s detailed verification of protocol compliance was not initially included in the process, but
was later incorporated after associated data collection and analytical tools were developed. This



                                               27
aspect of the verification process is particularly interesting because its results have value beyond
affecting payment. Indeed, verifying protocol compliance, and more specifically, the degree of
protocol compliance, has quality-related implications for the implementation of the EEC, which
gives the verification an added health value.

The Need for Simplification of Payment and Verification Processes

The simplification of payment and verification processes is needed to ensure a focus on the actual
results achieved and not the processes. Currently, the complex payment and verification processes
require multiple steps by multiple actors, and requires the preparation of approximately 72 reports
per quarter. Such complexity causes the program to lose sight of the end goal (i.e. the achievement
of results) and instead focuses on process compliance. Additionally, the complexity of these
processes has caused significant payment delays. These delays can ultimately negate the
objective of the incentive payment—the reason that the payment is being received is forgotten due
to the delay. Simplifying these processes will be particularly important as the MOH develops a new
global strategy that builds on previous experiences (that is, World Bank-financed PMES Inter-
American Development Bank-financed Fortalecimiento) to use simplified and coordinated payment
and verification systems.

These lessons demonstrate there are several opportunities for improving the verification process,
which would allow for program focus to rest on tasks that are more cost-effective and have greater
added value. In sum, there are six key lessons:

    1. The information technology (IT) systems used during the verification processes should be
       better coordinated.
    2. The verification process of the different UBAs should be better synchronized.
    3. The relationship between the 3rd party verifier (ATE) and MOH stakeholders should be
       better integrated.
    4. The sample size used in the third-party verification process should better reflect the
       indicators.
    5. The verification of protocol compliance has value beyond simply affecting payment.
    6. The simplification of payment and verification processes is needed to ensure a focus on
       the results achieved and not the processes.

                                       CONCLUSION
The complexity of the verification process in Panama’s PSPV makes it an especially interesting
and informative case, and one that provides a number of learning opportunities. As the MOH
develops a countrywide RBF strategy, it can draw on the lessons learned from the PSPV
verification process. RBF practitioners, technical experts, and policy makers in other countries can
learn from the case study and apply this learning while designing or implementing their respective
RBF programs.

Verification differentiates results-based financing (RBF) from other health-financing mechanisms, and it is
considered an important process of RBF program design and implementation. Despite the vital role it plays in
RBF, not much has been written about verification as a process, and information about different elements of
the process—frequency, cost, and direct and indirect effects among others—is scarce. Panama’s Health
Protection for Vulnerable Populations Program (PSPV) uses an RBF mechanism to deliver health services to
the country’s rural poor. As in many RBF schemes, a major component of the PSPV is the verification of results.
This study focuses on PSPV’s verification process, highlights its results and their application, and identifies
lessons learned. Such information is useful to policy makers and technical experts interested in or designing
RBF mechanisms.
