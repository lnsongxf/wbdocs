  The Abu Dhabi Dialogue Group is a partnership of senior members of government, academia, and civil society from the seven countries that share the rivers of the
Greater Himalayas, namely: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Nepal, and Pakistan. It is an informal, non-attributable platform for discussions on water
resources in the region, supported by the World Bank and the South Asia Water Initiative. Its vision is: ‘A cooperative and knowledge based partnership of states fairly
managing and developing the Himalayan river systems to bring economic prosperity, peace and social harmony, and environmental sustainability from the source to

Figure 2 indicates the contributions of the major         Figure 3
tributaries of the Ganges Basin. The Yamuna River,        Creation of the Himalaya
the Mahakali/Karnali/Ghaghra River, the Kosi River,
and the main Ganga River are the system’s biggest
flow contributors. The distributary system is also
extensive. In India, the Damodar-Hooghly River
system defines a distributary system that flows out
to the Bay of Bengal near Kolkata. The main outlet
of the Ganges, however, is in Bangladesh where
the main stem of the Ganges (called the Padma in
Bangladesh) merges with the Brahmaputra (called
Jamuna in Bangladesh) before flowing into the Bay
of Bengal through a 380-kilometer-wide delta.

A continental collision created the Himalaya.
The geomorphic history of the Ganges suggests
that the basin was shaped by the collision of the
Indian tectonic plate with the Eurasian plate about
20 million years ago (Figure 3). This event caused
the formation of the Himalaya, which were uplifted
by the collision. The Himalaya continue to grow as
the Indian plate continues to push northward under
the Eurasian plate causing it to rise. Some of the
Ganges tributaries (e.g. Ganga, Karnali, Kosi) are
‘antecedent rivers’ that existed before the Himalaya
were pushed up. These rivers rise north of the
Himalayan range and appear to run ‘up and over’
the mountain range to drain in the south. These
powerful rivers sustained their southward flow by
cutting deep gorges even as the mountains rose up
around them.

The Himalaya are the ‘water tower’ of Asia,
the source of the Ganges and many great
rivers. The Greater Himalayan Region sustains the
largest mass of ice outside of the north and south
poles, and is therefore often referred to as the ‘third
pole.’ From this region rise more than a dozen major
rivers including the Ganges, Indus, Brahmaputra,
Salween, Mekong, Yangtze, and Yellow. The rivers
of the plateau flow west as far as Iran (where the
Helmund River terminates in the swamps and lakes          Source: Based on USGS (2011).
of the Afghan-Iranian border), and flow east as
far as the East China Sea where the Yangtze River
empties near Shanghai.

  The monsoon brings heavy rains three
  months a year. The monsoon delivers about 80
  percent of annual rainfall in just three months of
  the year (mid-June through mid-September) with a
  corresponding peaking in the river flows in July to
  October. Figure 7 depicts the flow of the Ganges
  at Farakka Barrage near the India-Bangladesh
  border. The peak is caused by intense monsoon
  rains from mid-June through mid-September,
  against the relative low flows for the remainder of
  the year. April and May are the lowest flow months
  with negligible rainfall and a low base flow into
  the system. In addition to the significant seasonal
  variation within years, there is also great variability
  between years (especially in monsoon months),

Enduring Challenge of Floods Tackled by Modern Technologies


      Bangladesh has piloted a range of innovative approaches to flood management in recent decades,
      including innovative forecasting (hydrologic forecasts based directly on weather forecast ensembles),
      modeling (using a suite of hydrologic and hydrodynamic modeling tools), and communications (using
      cell phones and community warning systems). These innovations have been highly effective in reducing
      flood losses.

      The Indian state of Bihar recently created a new Flood Management Information Systems Center
      to improve its capacity for flood forecasting and response. Nepal is investing in crucial real-time
      information that will strengthen forecasting and warning capacity. Real-time data from Nepal is
      routinely shared with India’s Central Water Commission to issue flood warnings in downstream areas.
      National systems are being updated in all countries. Significant opportunities remain, however, to
      improve data acquisition, public data access, forecasting techniques using integrated ground and
      satellite systems, modeling, and communication systems. In addition to technological innovations,
      robust institutional arrangements both within and among basin countries will be needed to diminish
      annual losses of lives and livelihoods caused by floods.

Note: a. Population estimates include the total population of Nepal, and the populations of districts within the Ganges Basin for Bangladesh and India. Nepal’s 2011
population is estimated using the 2001 census figures and the presumed decadal growth rate calculated in that census. Estimates for Bangladesh use relevant district level
populations from the 2001 census and the decadal growth rates for 2001-2011 from the 2001 census. Estimates for India use district-level data from the 2001 census and
assume 2011 preliminary state population growth estimates and uniform growth across districts within a state (district level population growth rates are not available.)
b. The residual basin area is in China.

    Note: The chart is based on illustrative poverty estimates for the Ganges Basin. The estimates are for 2005. Population estimates are for all of Nepal and the Ganges
    Basin districts in India and Bangladesh. Population numbers for India and Bangladesh are mid-census estimates from national sources and for Nepal from the WDI.
    Poverty estimates use a $2 Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) poverty line for comparability across countries. Since virtually all of Nepal lies within the Ganges Basin, the
    poverty estimate (% of people below the $2 PPP poverty line for 2005) is taken directly from the WDI. For India and Bangladesh, however, only some districts lie
    within the Basin and therefore estimates were made using state-level poverty estimates ($1.03 poverty line) available from national sources (Ghani, 2010). The state
    level estimates were extrapolated to a $2 poverty line assuming that the national level difference between $1 and $2 PPP in poverty obtained from WDI is also a valid
    approximation in all the states. It was also assumed that state level poverty rates apply to the districts of that state which fall within the Basin.

   The Water and Energy Commission (WEC) was established with the broad objective of developing water and energy resources in an integrated and accelerated
manner. The Water and Energy Commission Secretariat (WECS) is a permanent secretariat of WEC, established in 1981 under the then Ministry of Water Resources
(MOWR) and is currently under the Ministry of Energy since the 2010 split of the MOWR into the Ministry of Energy and Ministry of Irrigation. The primary
responsibility of WECS is to assist the Government of Nepal in the formulation of policies and planning of projects in the water resources and energy sectors.

Defining Floods and Droughts


  National institutions define floods and droughts based on hydrological information (i.e. the presence or
  lack of water), and typically measure rainfall or water levels of a particular area. On the local level, the
  comparison with purely hydrological flood or drought has little meaning. People use measures of floods that
  relate to their immediate surroundings: in a ‘normal’ year, flood waters would not reach the house, or would
  not surpass residents’ knees, whereas in an ‘extreme’ year, water levels would submerge their houses.

  Where the discrepancy between the two definitions of floods and droughts is most visible is in the distribution
  of relief aid. Relief and support from state and national governments is dependent primarily on the official
  definitions and not local definitions. Even when official droughts/floods are declared, the lag time between
  the actual drought/flood occurring and the declaration make it very difficult for the most vulnerable to cope.

    Dams could arguably be built in the middle and lower reaches of the river basin, but alluvial plains are not generally favorable for dam construction, and the
  combination of high temperatures and flat reservoirs with high surface area-to-volume ratios would lead to large evaporation losses. Plus, because of the very high
  population density in the Ganges plain, dams with large surface area would have great impacts in terms of resettlement.

A Chronology of Recent Floods in Bihar


     1998:	 High river discharges in most rivers in North Bihar in the first week of July cause embankments of Burhi
            Gandak, Bagmati, Adhwara and Kosi to be partially damaged.
     1999:	 Unexpectedly heavy rains in October threaten the Kamla Balan river system and Kosi spurs.
     2000:	 Kamla Balan and Bhutahi Balan catchments receive heavy rainfall in first and last week of July, causing
            flooding. In first week of August, Eastern Kosi embankment punctured.
     2001:	 North Bihar is very flood affected. Western Kosi embankment, Bhutahi Balan right embankment, Bagmati left
            embankment and Burhi Gandak left embankment are partially damaged.
     2002:	 North Bihar again experiences serious flooding caused by overtopping of Kamla Balan left embankment and
            Khiroi right embankment.
     2003:	 Flood levels at Patna breaks 1994 record in Ganga and downstream. Bhagalpur breaks 1978 record. Status
            in rivers other than Ganga and Gandak is normal.
     2004:	 Initial monsoon rains in the first week of July break previous three years’ flood record and surpass the 1987
            flood in north Bihar. Bagmati, Burhi Gandak, Kamla Balan, Bhutahi Balan, and Adhwara group of rivers set
            new flood level records. Embankments breach in 53 locations, inundating a vast area of north Bihar and
            causing widespread damage and loss of life. Kosi remains normal.
     2005,
     2006:	 Normal floods.
     2007:	 Very serious flooding in north Bihar. Heavy rainfall at beginning of flood season, with regular continuing
            rainfall in July and August, keep the Burhi Gandak and Bagmati rising. About 28 embankment breaches
            occur, affecting nearly the whole of north Bihar with floods and consequent heavy losses of life and livelihoods.
     2008:	 Kosi embankment breached on August 18 at Kusha in Nepal causing the entire river to divert to an old
            channel, flooding areas that had not been flooded in hundreds of years.

     A flood cushion is created by lowering the water level in a dam reservoir to make space to capture anticipated flood waters. Lowering dam reservoir levels, however,
   creates tradeoffs with hydropower and irrigation uses where higher levels are generally more productive.

   In comparison, the 23 dams under consideration could yield some 38 billion cubic meters of additional water for irrigation (Table 8). Evaporative losses and leakages,
however, can be anticipated to approach 50 percent before the water would arrive on farms downstream. Add to this the inefficiency of farmers being unable to control
surface water timing as effectively as they can control groundwater application, and the productivity gains of the two scenarios become roughly comparable.
60
    This is not to imply that ecosystems and navigational services should be subordinated to agricultural water uses. It is only to note that there should be little concern
that investments focused on the productivity of irrigation water would lead to a situation in which the water that was saved would have no other use or value.

   Installed capacity is the theoretical capacity of all of the turbines in a power plant if they were run at full design capacity year round. In a monsoonal climate like the
Ganges in the absence of very large-scale storage, there will be many months each year without adequate river flows to run all turbines at their full capacity.

Box 4
Are Embankments a Good Flood-Control Strategy? A Case Study of the Kosi River

  On August 18, 2008, the Kosi River breached its embankment in Nepal close to the Bihar border. The
  Kosi’s westward loop was cut off, flooding a vast, roughly triangular area with the apex of the triangle at
  the breach site and the base of the triangle 150 kilometers to the south. According to official sources,
  493 people were killed and some 3,500 reported missing after the disaster. In all, 3.3 million people in
  Bihar were affected and, at the peak of the flood, 440,000 were living in camps.

  In February and March 2009, a survey was conducted of 10 flood-affected villages in Bihar. Eight were
  flooded by the Kosi after it breached the embankment (‘unexpectedly flooded villages’). The other two,
  located near the Ganga and the Kosi, are flooded annually during the monsoon by their respective
  rivers, thus they are adapted to flooding. In fact, both of these villages have most of their fields inside an
  embankment.

  The following year, in April and May 2010, the researchers resurveyed the 10 villages. They also
  surveyed eight more villages for comparison. Some of these additional villages were regularly flooded;
  others were not regularly flooded by river overflow, nor were they unexpectedly flooded due to the
  embankment breach (‘control villages’).

  The researchers compared these three types of villages – unexpectedly flooded, regularly flooded, and
  not flooded – over the period July 2008 to March 2010. Their objective was to see whether a strategy of
  allowing floods but building dispersed infrastructure to cope with them would be better than the current
  government strategy of flood protection based on embankments.

  The study found that, in fact, the regularly-flooded villages were, on average, no worse off than the
  control villages. The most striking finding was that the gross value of crop output in the regularly flooded
  villages was the same or higher than that in the control villages, despite the fact that three out of four of
  the regularly-flooded villages in the sample are located inside embankments, and, therefore, are highly
  exposed to seasonal and concentrated river flooding. The second major finding was that mean wages
  of agricultural and casual workers were no lower in the regularly-flooded villages than in the controls.
  Third, these regularly-flooded villages do no worse on measures of schooling, health, wealth, and
  household amenities.

  There was one big difference between the regularly-flooded villages and the controls: in the regularly-
  flooded villages, agricultural output varied much more sharply over the year, which caused dips in the
  proportion of households getting sufficient food during the monsoon.

  These results suggest that a strategy of gradually moving away from reliance on embankments and instead
  building infrastructure to live with floods would (1) not result in a net loss of agricultural or other output
  or health indicators (2) save money currently going into embankment maintenance, and (3) prevent the
  apparently inevitable disasters that occur every few years when there is a major embankment breach. The
  infrastructure to replace embankments, apart from obvious measures like raising buildings on stilts and
  digging new channels for river flow, should include the social infrastructure of employment generation or
  other social and food security during the monsoon for areas that will face increased flooding.

The Ganges system as a whole is unlikely to be
significantly affected by glacier melt, but melting
glaciers will have serious local impacts. Communities
living in some glaciated sub-basins, for example,
could face dramatic changes in water availability.
In the Nepal Himalaya, the annual contribution of
glacier ice melt to total river volumes varies among
the nine catchment basins from 2 to 30 percent.

Established in 2009, the South Asia Water Initiative (SAWI) aims to increase regional cooperation in the management
of the major Himalayan river systems in South Asia to deliver sustainable, fair and inclusive development and climate
resilience. It is designed to support countries improve and deepen transboundary dialogue, enhance the basin and
water resources knowledge base, strengthen water institutions, and support investments that lead to reducing extreme
poverty and promoting shared economic development. SAWI is a multi-donor trust fund managed by the World
Bank on behalf of the governments of United Kingdom, Australia and Norway and supports activities related to the
management of the Greater Himalayas transboundary water systems in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China,
India, Nepal and Pakistan. SAWI’s program is built around the theme of knowledge, dialogue, cooperation; the
region’s three shared river basins – the Brahmaputra, Ganges and Indus rivers; and the Sundarbans landscape.
