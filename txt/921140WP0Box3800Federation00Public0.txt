THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

Note: DB2014 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2014 that capture the effects of such
factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practic e or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

Russian Federation is a set of specific procedures—
the bureaucratic and legal steps that an entrepreneur
must complete to incorporate and register a new                 Legal form: Private Limited Liability Company

collecting the data (see the section in this chapter on
what the indicators measure).

       Filled out and signed registration application must be notarized. A
       standard registration application form exists and it must be notarized.
       There is a stamp duty of RUB200 per copy. This cost does not include
       fees for technical work charged by notaries or lawyers if this application
       form is completed by them – the cost of RUB 200 assumes that the
       application form is filled out by the entrepreneur themselves. Fees of
       technical work by lawyer/notaries are only applicable in cases where
       there is a need to draft a charter, and thus are not applicable to our
       case study.

       Starting from May 5, 2014 this procedure ceased to be compulsory. If
       the founder is able to attend in person the Tax Service and file all the
       documents on his/her own, the application does not have to be
       notarized and the tax officer can certify the founder’s signature.
       However, this is possible only in case when all the founders are able to
       visit the Tax Service in Russia in person, otherwise the application must
       be notarized.

        organization. A report is prepared as a result of the topographic survey

        carry out a detailed survey of the land, based on which the Rosreestr

      Information about conditions of the land plot (geological, geodesic and
      ecological) is needed for project design. There are 5 types of
      mandatory engineering surveys. All or a few of them are requested,
      depending on the land plot and surrounding territorial conditions.

      Mosgorgeotrest conduct these surveys, but private licensed companies
      can also conduct these surveys but in that case, the companies are

      * Request and obtain technical conditions for water and sewage

      The technical conditions are defined by the Moscow Water and Sewage
      Company.

      Under Government Regulation No. 83 dated February 13, 2006:
      • A list of technical conditions must be prepared by the local
      government when preparing the city development plan of the land
      plot.
      • If the city development plan of the land plot does not contain this
      information, the technical conditions, as well as the information on

      respective agency within 14 business days after receiving the request.
      However, in practice it takes longer.

      According to the fee schedule of Moscow State Unitary Enterprise
      “Vodokanal” for 2009, the fee for obtaining the technical conditions has

      building by the chief architect of the city and subordinate agencies
      within the relevant municipality. Regulated by the Decree of the
      Government of Moscow № 284-PP dated 30 April 2014 (as amended).

      The required documents include:

      Commission. The Commission includes representatives from different
      agencies, such as ecology, the prefecture, the local government, the
      sanitary services, the company, and the designer. After the Commission
      has convened, BuildCo collects the signatures of all its members.

      required for approval of the building depends on the state of the
      building (whether it is ready to be occupied or not) and on the
      inspection results. In practice, this takes on average 60 days. The most
      difficult part is to convene the members of the Commission and gather
      their signatures for approval.

DB2010              introducing cadastral passports in place of the previously
                    required inventory documents and cadastral maps.
                    Russia made registering property transfers easier by
DB2012              eliminating the requirement to obtain cadastral passports on
                    land plots.
                    Russia made transferring property easier by streamlining
DB2014              procedures and implementing effective time limits for
                    processing transfer applications.
                    The Russian Federation made transferring property easier by

  The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is
defined as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall distribution for all years included in the analysis. It is calculated and adjusted on a
yearly basis. The threshold is not based on any economic theory of an “optimal tax rate” that minimizes distortions or maximizes efficiency in the tax
system of an economy overall. Instead, it is mainly empirical in nature, set at the lower end of the distribution of tax rates levied on medium-size
enterprises in the manufacturing sector as observed through the paying taxes indicators. This reduces the bias in the indicators toward economies
that do not need to levy significant taxes on companies like the Doing Business standardized case study company because they raise public revenue
in other ways—for example, through taxes on foreign companies, through taxes on sectors other than manufacturing or from natural resources (all
of which are outside the scope of the methodology). This year’s threshold is 26.1%.

Social protection schemes and benefits & Labor disputes

Doing Business collects data on the existence of unemployment protection schemes as well as data on whether
employers are legally required to provide health insurance for employees with permanent contracts.


Doing Business also assesses the mechanisms available to resolve labor disputes. More specifically, it collects data
on what courts would be competent to hear labor disputes and whether the competent court is specialized in
resolving labor disputes.
