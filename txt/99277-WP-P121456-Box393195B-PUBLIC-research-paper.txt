The peri-urban is a distinct phenomenon within the larger process of urbanization. Whichever
way one defines it, whether as a place a concept or a process, the peri-urban continues to bat-
tle the efforts of planners and administrators to establish spatial order and justice. It represents
the spontaneous and seemingly organic transformation of rural to urban and the limits of both,
as it becomes an unplanned, unaccommodated type of development, leaving a trail of over-
burdened resources and uncontrolled growth. Similar to the other nefarious outcomes of poor
planning and governance, such as socio-economic disparity and environmental degradation,
the peri-urban expansion of the Indian metropolis delivers a heavy burden on the public realm.
The only foil to this debilitating and unsustainable expansion of cities seems to be an improved
framework for planning and management of metropolitan areas.

With three mega-cities that are sprawling into mega-urban regions, and another five cities ex-
pected to become mega-cities during the coming decade. India has already become the host
to an urbanization story that will continue to interest and confound experts and administrators
alike. Peri-urban expansion of Indian cities has assumed a peculiar form, with farm lands being
converted into urban areas faster than can be planned, and governments are unable to contain
this form of haphazard territorial expansions. Preparation, notification, monitoring and revi-
sion of spatial and physical plans is unable to keep pace with growth, and the resulting chaos is
inflicting huge hidden costs to economic and social transformation, which is the stated need of
the hour.

As a precursor to a more in-depth study, NIUA has attempted to explore the phenomenon of
peri-urban expansion and efforts to manage it through planning and governance frameworks
in three different locations and countries - Delhi, Beijing and New York. While the Chinese and
American examples do not present clear analogies, they serve as cases that illustrate alternative
frameworks with relevance to India. Whereas New York is located in a highly urbanized country,
both Delhi and Beijing are in countries that are attempting large scale ‘induced’ urbanization
by state-led and artificial means. Whether this form of induced growth is indeed the way to
achieve a higher urbanization level and concomitant economic outcomes is a question that will
probably find some answers in the Govt. of India’s new urban impetus to strengthen existing
urban centres, through the Smart City and AMRUT (Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban
Transformation) missions.

There are clear lessons to be learnt from the Chinese and American examples, which can inform
our own. The distribution of socio-economic, spatial and functional planning respectively be-
tween national, provincial and local government in China and the American approach of tracking
socio-economic and employment data by designating Combined Statistical Areas for economic
planning within metropolitan agglomerations are two such lessons that can yield better results
from India’s urban interventions.



In the context where both the Regional Plan proposals (2001 and 2021) for the National Capi-
tal Region have only partially succeeded in driving planned outcomes, leading to sub-regional
disparities and unplanned growth of the urban fringes, the paper aims to map the planning sys-
tems employed by the collaborative setup for the four states. The cases of Greater Beijing with
a ‘unified metropolitan government’ and the Tri-state region of New York, which is also a case
of collaboration between states, help in understanding the key challenges and strategies, and,
additionally, the institutional structures and planning methodologies formulated for effective
management of growth in other global settings.

What is clearly brought into question is whether ‘induced’ growth can produce any other out-
comes than the somewhat unfair choice between China’s ‘ghost towns’ and India’s uncontrolled
sprawls. While the ‘green field’ city is an option that can distribute urban population, the fact
that such new towns in a democratic polity cannot be protected from speculative forces is a
serious consideration, not to mention the fact that their horizons for development span over
three decades and it is difficult to predict what outcomes they will actually present except
in the limited forms of industrial townships which do not have the occupational diversity and
economic vitality of the metropolis. There are many such issues that need further examination.
This study is an attempt to tease out some such issues and open new lines of inquiry into one of
urban India’s key challenges.

         While there have been metropolises since ancient times, these remained confined to little more than the scope of
      ‘‘walking cities’’ until the emergence of modern transportation technologies, beginning with horse trolleys. And though
        the gentry has had its villas beyond the outskirts of the city since at least Roman times, it was only over the last two
        centuries that technological developments made suburban dwellings available to progressively broader segments of
     society. Railroads made possible the first remoter suburbs for the wealthy, electric trolleys the denser closer-in ones for
     the ‘‘common man,’’ and, finally, the unconfined automobile, with its steadily increasing affordability, allowed cities and
         suburbs to grow in all directions. Automobiles enabled the huge residential expansion of suburbs and, importantly,
       these were followed by trucks, which overwhelmingly enabled the commercial and industrial ‘‘sprawl,’’ which gave us

INTRODUCTION
Delineated in the 1970s, presently the NCR is the largest
defined planning region in the country, around 34,000
sq. km. in area with an urban population of 21.75 million
(total population of 46 million).** With the exception of
the NCT Delhi, which is 97.5% urbanised, only 42.5% of
the remaining region is urbanised. This indicates that a
significant population resides in rural settlements with
agricultural related employment. The NCR includes six
districts of Uttar Pradesh (UP), nine districts of Haryana
and one district of Rajasthan forming the three sub-
regions. The figure 03 shows the percentage area
distributed between the four states, the percentage
population share and the percentage urban in each sub-
region, with NCT Delhi with the highest urban population
and the least area covered. The UP sub-region shows a
total population almost as much as NCT Delhi but with
just about 50% urban.

ECONOMIC PROFILE OF THE REGION
 NCR is a major economic hub for the whole of North
India and is rapidly transforming into an industrial base
due to changes in policy, privatisation of public sector
undertakings (PSUs), downsizing of government shares
and elimination of subsidies and tax incentives for
            13
industries.    A number of existing and proposed
industrial areas (especially as part of the proposed
investment regions of the Delhi Mumbai Industrial
Corridor) are expected to have a significant impact on
the economy of NCR, trends indicate that the tertiary
sector, particularly value-added services, is fast emerging
as an important source of employment in the NCR. The
tertiary sector contribution to GDP (67%) ranks the
highest followed by secondary (25%) and primary (8%)
sectors for the year. While Delhi is the largest
contributor to GDP in the NCR, the growth rate of GDP is
the fastest in the Haryana sub-region amongst the
states. Delhi has become the main centre for various
services, Haryana sub-region is a mix of industries and
service sector (with a fast growth of IT / ITES in
Gurgaon), while Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan sub-
regions are dominated by agriculture. In terms of                   Figure 04: District-wise and Sector-wise GDP

INTRODUCTION
China has experienced one of the highest rates of
urbanisation in the past three decades. In 2010, the
People's Republic of China (PRC) was home to 1/5 of the
world's population with 1.3 billion people of which
                           22
almost 49% were urban. China's urban population (in
about 600 urban areas with a population above 100,000)
grew from 346 million (27% of its total population) to
477 million people (36%) between 2000 and 2010.23
China has five cities with population above 10 million,
around 73 million plus cities and around 519 cities with a
population of above 1 lakh. While the average
population density in Chinese cities has dropped by more
than 25% in the last decade, its urban land which was
about 99,000 sq. km in 2000, increased to 127,000 sq.
                                                     24
km in 2010, an average growth of 2.5 % a year. This                   Figure 08: Urbanisation in China

Beijing and Tianjin are directly controlled municipalities
of the Central Government. Beijing is spread over a total
of 16,250 sq. km with a mere 1368 sq. km area
urbanised and an urban population of 18.6 million
surrounded by rural districts. Tianjin is around 11,760 sq.
km with a 200 sq.km. urban area and an urban
population of 11.5 million. The Greater Beijing Economic
Region (GBER) has been demarcated for integrated
development as a metropolitan area with Tianjin and
autonomous 'satellite' areas in teh surrounding province
of Hebei .
This aims to serve three broad purposes:
(1) It will provide an opportunity for creating the much
needed economic centre to boost the economic growth
                                 25

in some of these further echoes these fears. Such a
process of urban expansion in the absence of any market
force or demand has led to peculiar patterns of suburban
expansion and peri-urban conditions. The absorption of
260 million rural migrants into Chinese cities has led to
conflicts with the urban hukou holders who perceive a
decline in service quality.27 Presently, land laws for urban
and rural areas in China are different, with significant
uncertainties for farmland tenures. This makes
acquisition of rural lands easier.

Governance Reforms and Urbanisation: With reference
to figure 11 that charts the events and policies
influencing urban growth. The substantial reduction of
state budgetary commitment to local economic
development since the 1980s and the reformation of the
central-local taxation scheme since 1994, shifted the
responsibilities of capital mobilisation and regional
development from the central to the local level. With
increasing inter-city competition to attract investments
and jobs and the absence of any finance generating tools
such as property tax, service charges, value added tax
and market bonds, the empowered local governments
heavily invested in infrastructure primarily through
borrowings. One of the most significant aspects of this
decentralisation of governance in China is the provision
of acquiring land and subsequently processing it for
development to the local government. In absence of land
policies to methodically allow this, it has resulted in
fragmented developments in the peripheries. Thus,
much of the expansion of Chinese cities led to an official
annexation of the rural peripheries into the cities.

PLANNING PROCESS
China has a centrally controlled planning system which
consists of three kinds of plans: the Socio-Economic
Development Plans prepared by the National                           Figure 12: Schematic governance structure for PRC

administrative province and hence require special
metropolitan plans which act as regional plans for these
regions covering multiple administrative units.
Metropolitan planning is directly coordinated by the
national level ministries. However, the various
concerned administrative units, provinces, counties,
cities and municipalities are responsible for
implementation,      demanding       higher      regional
cooperation. The plan for the Pearl River Delta has been
approved and has been under implementation since
2005. Similarly, the Yangtze River Delta plan has been
sanctioned in 2010. After decades of proposals for
development the Beijing - Tianjin - Hebei region (the

 Rapid industrialisation and immigration from abroad led to the growth of urban centres (in the United States). The ability of city
  boundaries to keep up with the explosion of urban population and the expansion of urban land development proved a difficult
      challenge, with the main method being annexation by the city government of surrounding towns and villages, officially
 incorporating them within the city's newly enlarged borders through legal authority granted to the municipal corporation by the
    state government. Thus for a time, city growth kept pace with metropolitan growth. For example, cities such as New York,
Philadelphia, and Chicago all grew through annexation and consolidation from their original boundaries of just a few square miles
and an original population of a few thousand people early in the 19th century, to cities with hundreds of square miles and millions

from a mere 30 million (in 1900) to 250 million (in 2010).
In 1920 there were just 5 urban areas with a population
above 1 million and 9 urban areas with a population of
0.5 million to 1 million. By 2010, this increased to 42
urban areas with a population above 1 million and 38
urban areas with a population of 0.5 to 1 million. New
York and Los Angeles are two of the most populated and
the most sprawling cities in the United States. While Los
Angeles Metropolitan Area has a population of around
13 million spread over 12,500 sq km, the metropolitan
region of New York has a population of 20 million                     Figure 15: Population Density in Urban Areas since 1920

Planning in the Tri-State: Four key agencies are broadly
responsible for planning in the Tristate Metropolitan
region of New York. The City Planning Department at
the local government level is responsible for planning for
the city of New York. The New York Metropolitan
Transportation Council (NYMTC), created in 1982 as the
Metropolitan Planning Organisation (MPO) for New York
City, Long Island and the lower Hudson Valley, provides a
collaborative planning forum to address transportation-
related issues from a regional perspective, plans for the
future, and also makes decisions on the use of federal
transportation funds. Established in 2008, the
Metropolitan Area Planning (MAP) forum crosses the
boundaries of New York, Connecticut and New Jersey
and comprises of five primary MPOs in the tri-state New
York City metropolitan area to address shared
transportation challenges that stem from the region’s
unique scale and population density and focus on goals
which can be realistically achieved through sharing data            Figure16: Metropolitan Area Planning Forum Map

model. However, except the inter-state transport
authority, the MAP that addresses shared transportation
challenges for the region, there is a glaring absence of an
integrated authority for addressing environment,
employment, growth, housing, infrastructure and quality
of life concerns for the tri-state region.

The RPA, an association of professionals, planners,
architects and other has been involved in proposing
integrated plan since 1929 (First Regional Plan). For lack
of any statutory planning body, most of the plans and
proposals are designed such that they are easily adopted
by the concerned local government departments and
service district authorities. Based on rigorous surveys of
ground conditions, mapping of issues and public
aspirations, future projections of environment,
infrastructure, economy, and social needs and support of            Figure 17:The Tri-State Region

URBAN SPRAWL CHALLENGES
Urbanisation in the twentieth-century is marked with                      limiting, necessitating a focus on underlying features and
expanding urban boundaries manifested through the                         involved processes. The juxtaposition of rural and urban

Urban sprawls are generally linked with transformations                   Various concepts have emerged to describe the
of the 'rural' into 'urban' resulting in the formation of                 phenomenon of urban sprawl, its causes and impacts at
transient urban peripheries. These peri-urban conditions                  different points in time in the last century. Some of these

 (i) Autonomous urban authorities, where cities, towns and municipalities within a city-region are distinct from each other both
 functionally and territorially. Every local authority is in charge of its own planning, policymaking, regulations and
 programme/project execution.
 (ii) Mixed systems of regional governance, where authority and power are vested in formal structures such as central
 government departments, regional authorities, metropolitan bodies, special-purpose authorities, cities, towns and villages.
 Each of these government bodies is responsible for functions such as policy setting, financing, planning and implementation of
 programmes and projects. Specific functions can be carried out by separate agencies operating at different levels. These
 functions can also be shared by a number of government bodies.
 (iii) Unified metropolitan government, where city-regions come under a single governing body which plans, manages, finances,
 supports and maintains services in an area-wide territory. Any local authorities within the city-region are subordinated to the
 unified government. This approach has been used mainly in national capitals where the central government’ s authority is
 dominant (e.g., Seoul). Historical and cultural factors have influenced the evolution of each type of governance system. Each
 type also comes with specific benefits and shortcomings.

  Box 02: Portland Case of Urban Growth Boundary
  The Growth Concept states the preferred form of regional growth and development and includes the Growth Concept map.
  The preferred form is to contain growth within a carefully managed Urban Growth Boundary (UGB). Growth occurs inside the
  UGB in the form of infill and redevelopment with higher density developed in areas where it is appropriate. Expansions of the
  UGB are done carefully to allow for the need for additional land. This concept is adopted for the long-term growth
  management of the region including a general approach to approximately where and how much the UGB should be ultimately
  expanded, what ranges of density are estimated to accommodate projected growth within the boundary, and which areas
  should be protected as open space.
  Mixed-use urban centers inside the UGB are one key to the Growth Concept. Creating higher density centers of employment
  and housing and transit service with compact development, retail, cultural and recreational activities in a walkable
  environment is intended to provide efficient access to goods and services, enhance multi-modal transportation and create
  vital, attractive neighborhoods and communities. The Growth Concept uses interrelated types of centers:
  · The central city is the largest market area, the region’s employment and cultural hub and accessible to millions of people.
  · Regional centers serve large market areas outside the central city, connected to it by high-capacity transit and highways and
    are accessible by hundreds of thousands of people.
  · Connected to each regional center, by road and transit, are smaller town centers with local shopping and employment
    opportunities within a local market area and accessible to tens of thousands of people.
