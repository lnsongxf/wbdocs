  Box 1.1: The Mambili Bridge: Symbol of Economic Growth and Socio Political Unity
  A 120 meter long concrete bridge crossing over the Mambili river, the Mambili bridge was constructed in 2011 in the framework
  of ongoing efforts carried out by the country to ensure a sustained regional integration through the connection of all of the
  capitals of Central Africa’s countries. Construction works carried out targeted not only the river, but also consisted of a huge
  amount of earth backﬁlling to ﬁll in existing swampy areas that covered an area over ten kilometres long. The treatment of
  that area, coupled with the construction of this crossing, has a dual signiﬁcation and importance for the Republic of Congo:

      • Physical and geographical connection of the whole Sangha Division to the rest of the country. The existence of the
        Mambili Bridge contributed in reducing the socio cultural distance between Congolese by bringing them closer each
        to other. On the political side of it, this also contributed to bring administration closer to the population, reinforcing
        decentralised entities;
      • Infrastructure of a great economic value. The construction of this infrastructure has hugely contributed (impact is yet to
        be assessed) to boost the vehicle trafﬁc (from nothing to almost 20 trucks per day, not counting light vehicles) on the
        studied corridors, consequently allowing and easing the transportation of freight from the northern area of the country
        up to Brazzaville (the main consumption centre of the country) and other localities. As a transit country located at the
        heart of the region, this improved infrastructure is a signiﬁcant contribution to regional integration.

     All of the people met agreed on the fact that before the crossing was built, the movement of persons and their goods used
  to be a nightmare. Goods coming from Cameroon used to be ofﬂoaded in Ouesso and then conveyed to Brazzaville on the
  river stream. For human transportation, it used to involve being transferred from one means of transport to another, or walk
  from one end of the river to another, using a monkey bridge, with lot of risks to be encountered.

      Box 1.2: Penalty Fares of the Trade services: A ‘Two Weights Two Measures’ Approach
      According to the Law N°03/2007 of 24/01/2007 regulating importations, exportations, and re exportation activities in the Republic
      of Congo, any importation of goods should be declared to the ministry in charge of trade and controlled at the country’s border
      by existing services (customs, phytosanitary, etc.). Staff of the ministry in charge of trade are also habilitated to carry out control
      and inspection missions, even at the border of the country.
          However, these control and inspection missions provide an opportunity for divisional staff of the ministry in charge of trade
      to carry out wrong practices and misbehave. As clearly mentioned by the document, infractions can result from inspection and
      control missions, which should be sanctioned in different ways, including penalty fares and conﬁscation of goods. This measure
      is supposed to be applied only once, at the entrance of the country. However, from observations made on the ﬁeld, this penalty
      fare is paid both at the entrance of the country (Ouesso, Sangha division) and inside the country at Owando (Cuvette division
      next to the Sangha). A quick look and comparison of some documents produced by these two administrations showed that,
      despite mentioning the same types of infractions, the amount of penalty fares is sometimes different. Basically, even if the law
      opens the way to designate the various infractions, there is no clear and objective way of ﬁxing the penalty fares of each. Fares
      are said to be ﬁxed as a result of a transaction/bargain between the trade administrator and the shipper (transactional penalty
      fare). It is understood that this way of operating results in bad practices.
          On the other hand, all collaborators of the Trade administration at divisional levels keep in contact when communicating
      information regarding any vehicle that has entered the country, to make sure the above mentioned fees are taken at other
      points apart from Ouesso. They use their own mobile phones for this purpose.

  Box 1.3: CEMAC Regional Economic Program (REP) 2009–2025
  Launched in 2009, the REP is designed to take advantage of the sub-region’s resources and potential, with a view to turning
  it into an emerging economic area. To this end, ﬁve engines of growth have been identiﬁed, namely: energy, agriculture and
  agro-industry, forestry, livestock farming and ﬁshing, and mining and metallurgy.
      The activities to be carried out during the initial phase 2011–2015 have been grouped in the following three categories:
      • Governance and macroeconomic stability: this involves strengthening economic governance, introducing tax reforms, and
        improving multilateral surveillance. The regional Community also intends to reform Government procurement, improve
        transparency and governance in the raw materials and extractive industries sector, and harmonize the legislative and
        regulatory frameworks for the public ﬁnances, with a view to reforming the tax system.
      • Common market and trade facilitation: at the common market level, the Community intends to activate the existing
        provisions relating to freedom of movement, approval of preferential regimes, and the right of establishment. Trade
        facilitation will involve the interconnection of customs administrations, the effective implementation of a Community
        transit regime, and the strengthening of facilitation measures at the borders and along the road corridors.
      • Integration of physical infrastructure: the aim is to build priority road links, to open up the landlocked countries, and to
        connect all of the capitals with paved roads. Where energy infrastructure is concerned, the objective is to interconnect
        the electricity networks and build hydroelectric dams. With respect to telecommunications infrastructure, the objectives
        are not only to harmonize the legislative and regulatory frameworks, but also to interconnect the networks and develop
        the optical ﬁber network. The development of rural and local authority infrastructure (feeder routes, electriﬁcation, cattle
        trails and markets, etc.) also falls within this category.
     Economic infrastructure for supporting the pillars of growth: a strategic development plan will be established for each pillar
  of growth to strengthen the economic infrastructure and support services for these pillars. Common regional policies in the
  areas of electricity, transport, telecommunications, and new information and communication technologies will also be drawn up.
     The ﬁnancing requirements for this initial phase of the program are estimated at about CFAF 20,000 billion. More than half
  of this ﬁnancing (56 percent) is expected to be provided by the private sector, 37.5 percent should come from concessional
  resources, and 6.5 percent from trust resources. To mobilize this ﬁnancing, CEMAC has adopted a strategy that begins with the
  mobilization of trust resources to carry out studies and initial programs. This should make it possible subsequently to attract
  private capital. The Community integration tax would appear to be the only source of ﬁnancing at CEMAC level; it is not even
  capable of covering the operating costs of the Commission. However, the concessional resources required cannot be expected
  to come entirely from the development partners.
     A solution suggested in the PER is to create a fund fed by a charge of US$3 per barrel on exported oil (CEMAC Emergence
  Fund). This fund could contribute to the co-ﬁnancing of the projects or the acquisition of holdings in the companies.

     Box 1.4: The Cameroon – Chad and Cameroon – CAR Bilateral Conventions
     Due to the political willingness of the Central African States, the materialization and legalization of transit corridors resulted
     in the signature of two conventions, namely: i) Road transport Convention between Cameroon and Chad (signed on April 13th
     1999) and; ii) Road Transport Convention between Cameroon and Central African Republic (signed on December 22nd 1999).
     Both conventions refer to the CNUCED July 8th 196 Convention on transit trade of landlocked States, as well as on UDEAC Acts,
     adopting: i) the Convention regulating land transport in UDEAC (December 19th 1984) and; ii) the Inter-State Convention on
     road transportation of various freight (July 5th 1996). They aim to favor ‘Land transportations’ (CAR) and ‘Road transportations’
     (Chad) between the two countries, as well as transit through their territory.
         These two Conventions on road transportation for transit freight (transshipping is not allowed) aim to:

        • Offer access to the sea to the landlocked countries in the region (CAR and Chad);
        • Deﬁne transport itineraries for freight in transit, involving the selection of ‘legal road ways to be used by transit freight’
          that include both unimodal (road) and multimodal means (rail/road);
        • Ofﬁcialize the application of freight ratios departing from Douala (Port) between Cameroonian transporters, and those
          of landlocked countries according to the following keys:
           With Chad: 65 percent allowed to Chadian transporters and 35 percent for Cameroonians;
           With CAR: 60 percent to Central African transporters and 40 percent for Cameroonians.
        • Introduce a special tax disc (license tab) applied to vehicles carrying out international transportation, and create an
          international safe conduct (sauf conduit), in addition to the obligatory vehicle letter each time a vehicle travels;
        • Deﬁne unique control/checkpoints that will gather all of the services and administrations in charge of controlling/inspecting
          the transit process along itineraries. These checkpoints will be aimed at reducing the number of stops.

        Moreover, these agreements state the following measures:

        • The respective national freight management bureaus (BGFT, BARC and BNF) should be responsible for the ratio of freight
          distribution, the issuance of vehicle letters, and the management any other instruments of transit and transport facilitation;
        • Agreement for a regular exchange of data on the ﬂow of international road transportation and their distribution between
          transporters;
        • A mixed permanent technical commission on transport, which should be in charge of making a status of the balance sheet
          on the transport relationship between the two countries, and should solve existing problems/difﬁculties in implementing
          the convention.

  Box 1.5: Example – The Impact of an Economic Corridor on Cambodia and Lao Peoples’
  Democratic Republic
  The East–West Economic corridor is an economic development program that was initiated to promote the development and
  integration of four Southeast Asian countries, namely: Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam. The concept was agreed upon
  in 1998 at the Ministerial Conference of the Greater Mekong Subregion, organized in Manila, the Philippines. This corridor
  became operational on December 12, 2006.
     “A study of the Southern Economic Corridor’s (SEC) impact on Cambodia conducted by the Mekong Institute found an
  increase in living standards of those along the corridor. The study reported improved access to healthcare, education, and
  markets as well as the development of additional public service facilities. It also reported an improvement in trade routes and
  reduced trade costs at cross-border points.” Although Cambodia’s contribution to subregional trade has been low (1.8 percent),
  the SEC is expected to generate opportunities to increase Cambodia’s exports to other countries in the Greater Mekong
  Subregion, contingent upon investments in Cambodia and the resolution of other bottlenecks.
     The development of the East-West Economic Corridor (EWEC) also gave the province of Savannakhet in Lao Peoples’
  Democratic Republic better connectivity and regional integration. It reduced travel times, in some cases from 12 to three
  hours, and cut the cost of transportation, increasing competitiveness. The transportation sector grew, with the number of buses
  growing from 600 in 2000 to 1,600 in 2005, while the number of transport operators doubled over the same period. Townships
  and economic activities also grew, and new concrete houses, markets, guesthouses, restaurants, petrol stations, automobile
  repair shops, and other micro enterprises emerged.

  Box 2.1: The Consensual Transport Master Plan in Central Africa
  The Consensual Transport Master Plan in Central Africa (CTMP) is an intra-regional vision based on an integrated network, which
  aims to connect together all ten ECCAS countries with countries in other economic regions (ECOWAS, SADC, and COMESA),
  through a number of intermodal transport solutions. Special attention is given to four landlocked countries (Chad, CAR, Rwanda,
  and Burundi). The CTMP’s long-term objective is to endow the sub-region with a multimodal transport system whose infrastructure
  and services will ease the free movement of people and goods, and which will be able to support trade development between
  countries and hence promote economic integration. In the medium-term, it will be possible for the sub-region to have a consensual
  framework for its negotiations to mobilize investments in the area of transport infrastructure. In the shorter term, it was supposed
  to allow for free movement on paved roads from one capital city to another by 2010, but this currently has not been achieved.
      The CTMP’s strategic guideline lays down the transport master plan, which consists of i) supporting actions undertaken to
  improve infrastructure and open-up corridors; ii) consolidating policy and institutional reforms in the transport sector; iii) taking
  full advantage of all transportation modes and fostering inter-modalism for the opening up of landlocked countries and coastal
  countries’ hinterlands; iv) giving priority to a single road link for any two capital cities; v) reviewing facilitation issues by developing
  a simpliﬁed transit system inspired from the TRIE convention, and ensuring the effective implementation thereof; vi) supporting
  initiatives for the pooling of internal resources, both within countries and at the level of RECs; vii) helping RECs in particular to
  make the autonomous funding mechanisms operational and sustainable; viii) developing mechanisms to ensure the effective
  implementation of the community level’s harmonized regulatory frameworks; ix) considering the interconnection of railway
  networks as a long-term objective; x) promoting coastal shipping development; xi) promoting the establishment of facilitation
  committees in ports that service landlocked countries; xii) supporting the implementation of air transport liberalization and
  service improvement policy, as well as safety and security measures in the sub-region; and xiii) adopting the corridor approach
  to plan trade in landlocked countries and coastal countries’ hinterlands.
      A total of around 63 corridors are concerned, linking together all targeted countries from/to various capital cities, and ensuring
  a good access to/from sea gates. Selection criteria for targeted corridors combine together those of CEMAC, ECCAS, and the
  Yaoundé declaration on transport infrastructure and regional integration in Central Africa.

  Box 2.2: The World Bank – Total Partnership of Road Safety
  Signed on January 10th 2010, under a MoU between the two parties, the scope of work for this partnership includes:

     • At the national level: i) supporting CAR and Chad in designing a Road safety Strategy document, accompanied with an
       action plan to implement it; ii) providing the corridor with safety signs and signals; iii) carrying out a safety audit on the
       corridor; iv) carrying out a diagnosis of emergency services; v) setting up a road safety database for fatalities; vi) training
       staff in road management and coordination; and vii) involving the private sector in the ﬁght for road safety, through the
       adoption and implementation of best practices;
     • At the regional level: i) revising the CEMAC Community Road Code; ii) designing and implementing a harmonized
       system to allow access to the goods transport sector; iii) designing a harmonized training system for drivers of goods
       transportation vehicles, and training the trainers; and iv) designing and implementing a harmonized system of capacity
       building on road safety, targeting police and gendarme forces.

       Targeted activities are in line with the ﬁve pillars set by the agenda of the Global Road Safety action decade, involving
  stakeholders from public, private, and civil society. The outcomes and outputs of these initiatives are already perceptible in
  Cameroon, but are yet to be seen in CAR and Chad. Public, civil society, and private sectors are increasingly becoming involved,
  with greater awareness being raised.
       With the help of private partners, tangible outcomes include: i) the creation of an experience sharing platform, gathering
  eight companies of various sectors; ii) the training of drivers and transporters; iii) the benchmarking of good practices (leading
  to the reinforcement of safety culture through self-regulated norms); iv) improving vehicles’ technical control (check-list); and
  v) transport management for reduced risks.
       With the help of civil society, the following can be obtained: i) the gathering of 30 road safety associations into a coalition; and
  ii) better capacity building through better organization. Other outcomes include: i) a more harmonized vision on road safety in the
  CEMAC zone and the design of a priority actions plan; ii) the inclusion of a road safety component in all road construction tenders;
  iii) the introduction of a road safety expert in the supervision of road construction works; iv) the instauration of road safety audit;
  v) the design of 12 norms of self-regulation; and vi) the organization of sensitization campaigns and controls checks operations.

     Box 2.3: Republic of Congo – Road Classiﬁcation
     The ﬁrst road classiﬁcation operation in Congo was performed in the 1970s, with a total of 17 289 kilometers of all types of roads
     classiﬁed. Access within the country is determined by the level of development of road network. This access has essentially
     been developed since 1945, when the country’s growing economic activities required the development of roads all over the
     national territory (resulting in the set up a road construction/rehabilitation program). The lengths of the various classes of roads
     in Congo are contained in the table below.
        The Transport National Plan (NPT) proposed a new road classiﬁcation, which included national roads, divisional roads,
     and local roads. National roads link the nation’s capital to the divisions. They also provide connections with neighboring
     countries and major domestic road networks. The total number may increase from six to 15 in the next 10–15 years of the
     NPT. Divisional roads connect districts and towns to national roads. They also serve as complementary inter-connections
     with neighboring countries, and can help to link the major road networks. They are tracks that have been rehabilitated by
     international development donors. The total number may reduce from 46 to 33, and will be put under the responsibility of
     divisional administrations. Local roads will be under the responsibility of divisions and districts, and will be maintained by
     the Road Funds (RF).

  Box 4.1: Republic of Congo – Government Actions Promoting Agricultural Development
  For over a decade, the Government has demonstrated its commitment to develop agriculture. To do this, it has put in place several
  agricultural development projects and has signed agreements with foreign companies that are able to support it in this process.
  1. Agricultural development programs and projects
  Several programs and projects have been created and implemented, the most important of which are as follows:
     (i) the Programme National pour la Sécurité Alimentaire (PNSA) (National Food Security Program); (ii) the Projet de Développement et
  de Réhabilitation des Pistes Rurales (PDARP) (Rural Roads Development and Rehabilitation Program); (iii) the Projet de Développement
  Rural (PRODER) (Rural Development Program); and (iv) the Projet Création des Nouveaux Villages Agricoles (Project for the Creation
  of New Agricultural Villages).
  The Programme National pour la Sécurité Alimentaire (PNSA). The overall objective of the PNSA is to develop the natural potential
  of the country to alleviate the state of food insecurity and poverty. Its speciﬁc objective are: (i) increasing the national agro-
  pastoral and halieutic production through the use of innovative technology and quality inputs; (ii) strengthening the capacities
  of the socio-economic actors; (iii) improving the marketing, conversion, storage, and preservation of products; (iv) establishing
  and strengthening a system for monitoring, early warning, and rapid response; (v) improving the income and standard of living
  of rural producers, in particular for women and young people; (vi) diversifying the sources of income of rural populations;
  (vii) guaranteeing the availability of foodstuffs; and (viii) protecting the environment and conserving natural resources.
  The Projet de Développement et de Réhabilitation des Pistes Rurales (PDARP). The main objective of this project is to improve agricultural
  production in Congo. It is co-ﬁnanced equally by the World Bank and the Government, for an overall amount of XAF 20 billion.
  This project, which had targeted some 600 activities, is currently being adjusted. It concerns in particular reducing the number
  of activities, the number of agricultural roads to rehabilitate, the number of market infrastructures and the number of micro-
  projects to be ﬁnanced.
  The Projet de Développement Rural (PRODER). The project is part of the Government’s policy aimed at improving food supplies of
  villages and increasing rural incomes. The project is focused on national biological control and research. To this end, several
  streams of activities are being developed, including: (i) a component for developing crops and farms based on cassava,
  groundnuts, maize, and lowland rice; and (ii) a component for developing animal husbandry (cattle and small ruminants) with
  the establishment of a self-funding system of distribution of inputs and credit.
  1. The “Création des Nouveaux Villages Agricoles” project. Funded by the Congolese State for an amount of XAF 13 billion, this project concerns
  the development of special villages to increase production. By creating the agricultural villages, the Government envisages to
  professionalize agriculture. The agricultural villages of Knouo, Odziba, and Imbouba in the Ignié agricultural area (in Pool)
  were carried out within the scope of this project. The activities to be developed here are linked to the production of Cassava,
  pig rearing, and broiler meat. The State has given each young person in these villages 792 laying hens and the equivalent of
  two hectares in cassava cuttings. The 40 families selected (among 358 applicants) are living in houses built by the State, with a
  minimum of town standing. These farmers are not agents of the State but work for themselves.
                                                                                                                         (continued on next page)

     The Fonds de Soutien à l’Agriculture (FSA). The aim of this fund is to ﬁnance farmers, stock breeders, and ﬁshermen on the basis
     of viable projects. The FSA received an amount of XAF four billion (approximately US$8 million) to ﬁnance its activities during
     2010. This funding has made it possible to support ﬁve priority sectors: poultry farming, pig rearing, ﬁshing, ﬁsh-farming, and
     the vegetable sector.
     2. Cooperation agreements
     In order to accelerate the development of agricultural production, the Government has strengthened its cooperation with other
     countries, notably China, and has concluded several partnership agreements with multinationals. Besides the ﬁnancial lever,
     the objective is to beneﬁt from the expertise and advanced technologies of these partners. Within this scope, partnerships
     have been established with South African, Brazilian, and Malaysian companies.
     The partnership with the South African company “Congo Agriculture”. The Congolese State has donated 80,000 hectares of land to
     “Congo Agriculture”, a company established by South African farmers from Agri SA, following the agreement signed on March
     10, 2011 in Pointe-Noire. These lands situated in the Niari (63,000 hectares) and the Bouenza (17 000 hectares) departments, have
     been set aside for the establishment of an agro-industrial complex for food crops and fruit growing, as well as cattle rearing.
     The partnership with the Brazilian company BR AFRICA. BR Africa signed a partnership agreement with the Government on November
     5, 2010, authorizing its establishment in the Congo under the label BR Africa Congo. The agreement provided for capital
     distribution amongst the shareholders as follows: the Congolese State (49 percent) and the Brazilians (51 percent). This company
     will produce cassava, as well as convert and market the products derived from the agro-industrial complex that will be built in
     the Pool division, between Imbouba and Mbé. The area set aside for cassava production is 19,500 hectares.
     The partnership with the Malaysian company ATAMA Plantations: In December 2010, the Congolese Government donated 470,000
     hectares of land located between Makoua and Mokeko to the Malaysian company ATAMA Plantations. This company intends
     to produce 9,000 tons of palm oil.
     Agricultural cooperation between the Congo and China. Cooperation with the Chinese is manifested through the creation of the Centre
     de Démonstration des Techniques Agricoles (Demonstration Centre for Agricultural Techniques) located on the outskirts of Brazzaville.
     This center conducts experiments aimed at supplying the country with new high-yield varieties of fruit and vegetables adapted
     to the ecology of the country.

      COMESA experience
      The Chirundu One Stop Border Post (OSBP) between Zimbabwe and Zambia is an example of best practice in trade facilitation
      measures. This pilot trade facilitation project on the North-South Corridor (NSC) launched in December 2009 is the ﬁrst functioning
      OSBP in Africa. It incorporates a community-based computer system that harbors the information and communication (ICT)
      platform. It accepts the required data from all of the border agencies and allows authorized access to limited datasets by
      different users to enhance the establishment of a single-window system at the border. Since its launch in 2009, clearing time at
      the border post has reduced from three days, to six hours (or one day at maximum). It therefore offers practical examples as a
      best practice from which other RECs can draw practical lessons for similar initiatives in the future.
          Simpliﬁcation of customs procedures at border posts: All COMESA partner States have Installed, and are using the
      ASYCUDA++ system at all of their customs checkpoints. Djibouti, Seychelles, and Zimbabwe are using the most improved
      version of the system, ASYCUDA World, which is the latest version of the ASYCUDA system. It offers more ﬂexibility, has a faster
      and easier processing mechanism, and is the most accepted and most used system worldwide. Kenya, however, is using the
      Simba System, which is different from ASYCUDA. In Mauritania, the time required to process a declaration at the airport was
      cut from 20–48 hours to 30 minutes when the ASYCUDA++ system was installed.
          ECOWAS is in the process of implementing ASYCUDA systems. Cote d’Ivoire, Liberia, and Mali are the only members currently
      using ASYCUDA World, thus offering examples of best-practice countries for putting in place better automated systems to
      facilitate trade in the Community. Senegal, on the other hand, is using a locally developed system.
          Simpliﬁcation of documentation at customs checkpoints: The COMESA Customs Declaration Document (COMESA CD)
      is a standardized document for customs transit trafﬁc control. Angola, Burundi, DRC, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar,
      Malawi, Mauritius, Rwanda, the Sudan, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe are using the COMESA CD, and the document takes
      into account the data elements required for the ASYCUDA systems. Holders of COMESA CD get to minimize the time spent
      at border checkpoints signiﬁcantly. The document caters for imports, exports, transit, and warehousing and is said to have
      replaced on average 32 documents in some member States (COMESA Cross Border Trade Bulletin, 2010).
          Once data is entered at an initial customs checkpoint, it automatically becomes available on the system at all other customs
      checkpoints. Since the document is harmonized, the holder of the document only has to conﬁrm with the next checkpoint if
      the document matches the one on the system to get clearance. In this regard, the document is a best example of how customs
      procedures can be simpliﬁed at border posts.
