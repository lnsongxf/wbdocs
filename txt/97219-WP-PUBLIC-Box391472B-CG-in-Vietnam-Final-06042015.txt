   HSC’s inception, it had an initial capital base of VND50 billion

   investor in 2005.

  Chi Minh City and chalked up a sale record of 10,000 phones

  Capital as a financial partner which has invested US$3.5 million

  benefits of corporate governance. When Mekong Capital invested

  the US$500 million mark in September 2014, ahead of 2015                founders had all divested their side businesses (1). At the same
  target stipulated by Mekong Capital.                                    time, family members of the founders were no longer employed

  Founded by five entrepreneurs who were used to having constant

  these founders represented the board. There were no third party
