Preface
Financial capability, as defined by the World Bank and in this report, is the capacity to act in one’s
best financial interest, given socioeconomic and environmental conditions. It encompasses knowledge
(literacy), attitudes, skills and behavior of consumers with respect to understanding, selecting, and using
financial services, and the ability to access financial services that fit their needs (World Bank 2013d).
Financial capability has become a policy priority for policy makers seeking to promote beneficial
financial inclusion and to ensure financial stability and functioning financial markets. Today people
are required to take increasing responsibility for managing a variety of risks over the life cycle. People who
make sound financial decisions and who effectively interact with financial service providers are more likely to
achieve their financial goals, hedge against financial and economic risks, improve their household’s welfare,
and support economic growth. Boosting financial capability has therefore emerged as a policy objective that
complements governments’ financial inclusion and consumer protection agendas. To this end, policy makers
are increasingly using surveys as diagnostic tools to identify financial capability areas that need improvement
and vulnerable segments of the population which could be targeted with specific interventions.
In response to a request of the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MEF) of Senegal, the World Bank
has implemented a financial capability survey. Senegalese authorities have embarked on several reform
initiatives to adopt measures to improve the operational and legal environment of the financial sector. As part
of this goal, financial inclusion, financial capability and consumer protection (FCCP) are important priorities
for the Senegalese government. FCCP are critical elements in building an inclusive financial system and
Senegal authorities seek to identify sustainable methods of delivering financial education through effective
partnerships. As the Senegal government’s financial inclusion initiatives are expected to usher in more
Senegalese, including small and medium size business (SME), to access a wide range of financial services
from a variety of financial institutions, they need to acquire knowledge and develop skills to enable them to
make better financial decisions. This survey constitutes a key diagnostic tool that aims to guide the authorities
on the models for delivering financial education and to set quantifiable and concrete targets. Moreover, it
serves as a baseline to assess a detailed national financial inclusion strategy (NFIS) and an action plan for
implementing reforms to make the financial sector more inclusive and access to credit for SMEs easier.
The key findings and recommendations presented in this report cover three main areas: 1. Financial
Inclusion, 2. Financial Capability, and 3. Financial Consumer Protection. The remaining chapters are
structured as follows. Chapter 1 explores the financial inclusion landscape in Senegal. Chapter 2 gives an
overview of Senegalese levels of financial capability, in particular about their financial knowledge, attitudes,
and behaviors. Chapter 3 explores the relationship between financial inclusion and financial capability. The
last chapter investigates if the products which financially included individuals use are effectively meeting their
needs.

Executive Summary
Financial Inclusion
 Approximately 17 percent of surveyed adults in Senegal report owning an account at a formal
 financial institution (a bank, a microfinance institution (MFI), or an e-money agent), a commonly
 used metric for international comparison. As compared to other lower-middle income economies,
 Senegal is in the middle of the pack in terms of financial inclusion, although it does lag behind the average
 level among Sub-Saharan African economies. This pattern is generally in line with the other financial
 sector indicators for Senegal as compared to its country peers. Global Findex and the Financial Capability
 survey show that Senegal’s financial inclusion level has increased between 2011 and 2014 - 2015, from
 close to 6 percent in 2011 to reach 15.4 percent in 2014 and its current level in 2015.
 There are meaningful variations across socioeconomic and demographic categories, especially
 gender, urban/rural residence - in the commonly used measure of financial inclusion. Men are 9
 percentage points more likely than women to be financially included, a difference that remains statistically
 significant. One of the main reasons of women’s lower financial inclusion, is the fact that they generally
 participate less in financial and budgetary decisions of the household. On the other hand, 13 percent of
 those living in a rural setting are financially included against 22 percent of the urban population.
 Significant differences can also be observed across income categories in the use of financial
 services, a potentially key obstacle to achieving inclusive growth. While 24 percent of those in the
 top quartile of the income distribution use a formal account, only 7 percent of those in the bottom quartile
 percent report the same. Without the necessary tools to manage their day-to-day finances and make
 important educational and entrepreneurial investments, the poor in Senegal are thus limited in their
 ability to improve their economic well-being.
 The strength of Senegal’s banking sector is not matched by high usage of banking institutions
 among Senegalese adults. The banking sector dominates Senegal’s financial system. Despite the
 improvement and diversification in the supply of financial products in Senegal during the last several
 years, banking sector penetration remains fairly low which explains in part the low level of utilization of
 bank products in Senegal. Though 69 percent of adults in Senegal are familiar with the products offered
 by commercial and postal banks, only 29 percent of respondents have reported to have ever used
 them. In particular, only 10 percent of Senegalese adults declared having a formal bank account or a
 bank product (the remaining 7 percent of those 17 percent financially included use either MFI or e-
 money agents). The urban/rural and low income/high income gaps are wide. Only 6 percent of the rural
 population have a bank account, compared to 13 percent of urban dwellers. While 14 percent of those
 in the top quartile of the income distribution use a bank account, only 2 percent of those in the bottom
 quartile report the same. Men are more likely to access financial bank services.
 Money transfers are the most used financial services, which is not surprising, as they are linked
 to the development of Senegalese remittances. Senegal is now among the top remittance receiving
 countries in the world. Within the African continent, Senegal is the third highest recipient in terms of
 amount among other African nations. Money transfer services dominate the formal Senegalese market
 of remittances recipient channels. As confirmation of this trend, 39 percent of the respondents said they
 currently used money transfer services, 14 percent have used them yet 18 percent said they didn’t
 know what money transfer services were. These services are mostly used by men, by urban dwellers
 and by those belonging to the richest revenue quartile. The socio demographic gaps between those
 that mostly use money transfer services and those that do not are significant.
 Mobile financial services haven’t attained their full potential. Aside from banks and money transfer
 services, the Senegalese also use e-money. Only 5 percent of the Senegalese population use mobile
 financial services such as e-money, although 75 percent of the population have said to be familiar with

                                                       4
    these products. Senegal is far behind compared to other West African economies. Senegal also has a
    mobile money account penetration (measured as the number of mobile money accounts per 1,000
    adults) between 17 and 27 times less than Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania who together lead mobile
    money usage in Sub-Saharan Africa. There is room for potential growth, considering that Senegal has
    a high percentage of households with at least one mobile phone. New partnerships and products are
    furthermore now available in the Senegalese market.
    Borrowing and saving patterns are similar: very few adults use formal providers. An astounding
    66 percent of the Senegalese population does not borrow at all and 28 percent borrow only informally.
    Only 3 percent of the population borrow using formal credit. In rural areas, this is mostly credit extended
    by MFIs, while in urban areas, this mostly takes the form of the use of credit cards. Concerning savings,
    71 percent of the population does not save. Among those that save, informal saving is more popular
    (19 percent) than formal saving in Senegal (6 percent).
    The approximately 6 million financially excluded adults – those who use no formal financial
    products or services – are disproportionately female, poor, and living in rural areas. Among
    these adults, the most commonly reported obstacle to formal account ownership is lack of enough
    money to use one (54 percent), followed by preference for cash (19 percent), lack of need for such
    products (14 percent), and finally by the expensive cost of such products (8 percent). While lack of trust
    is not a widely reported reason for not having an account among the general unbanked population,
    those who have used commercial and postal bank services in the past but do not currently have a
    formal account are more likely to cite this reason.


Recommendations3
There is evidence that under the proper supervision, expansion of access to finance generates
                                                                                                   4
opportunities for economic growth, greater welfare and growth of firm competitiveness . Different
studies have shown that financial inclusion could meet macroeconomic and microeconomic goals. For
example, on the macro side, Han and Melecky (2013) found that a broader access to and use of bank deposits
could significantly mitigate bank deposit withdrawals or growth slowdowns in times of financial stress.
Similarly, Sahay and al. (2015a) confirmed that the marginal returns to growth from further financial
development diminish at high levels of financial development. This basically means that there is a significant
“bell-shaped” relationship between financial development and growth. On the micro side, the impact
evaluation of biometrically-authenticated payments infrastructure (through the use of smart cards), suggests
that the supply of secure payments contributed to the development of welfare programs, to the benefit
of employment and pension programs recipients in India (Muralidharan et al 2014). Also, Jack and Suri 2014
show that households in Kenya with access to mobile technology were more likely to receive a larger amount
of remittances in the form of mobile money compared to non-technology users when they experienced
financial shocks. Materializing the financial inclusion initiatives and recommendations presented in this study
would contribute to the attainment of Senegal's inclusive goals of economic growth.
To ensure that public and private stakeholder commitment to advance financial inclusion in Senegal
is explicit, strong and sustained over time, the MEF in Senegal should continue its efforts to put in
place a National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS). Financial inclusion is probably only achievable with
the deliberate and effective actions by a range of stakeholders from the public and the private sector. A NFIS
helps stakeholders to strengthen and publicize their commitments, clarify complementary roles, coordinate
                                                                                  5
actions, and resolve overlaps over a defined period of time (typically 3-5 years). A NFIS could also usefully
set forth ambitious but achievable quantitative targets for increasing financial inclusion in Senegal. Well-

defined, publicized, and monitored targets can be a powerful tool to translate the ambition of goals into
practice outcomes. Tracking progress against targets can provide valuable insights into obstacles and/or
opportunities for financial inclusion. Embedding financial inclusion modules into regular household surveys is
a critical element of a robust monitoring and evaluation framework for financial inclusion. Thus, to maximize
effectiveness of the NFIS the MEF is planning to develop, it needs be aligned with the regional financial
inclusion strategy of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU); result from and reflect broad
consultations with the private and public sectors as well as further in-depth diagnostics if the need for such is
identified; in addition to demand-side constraints revealed through this survey, it should also identify key
supply constraints to inclusion; identify priority segments based on the results of this survey; set headline and
specific targets for financial inclusion (realistic albeit ambitious targets); and list actionable steps to overcome
the constraints and achieve the targets within a defined timeframe. The following recommendations highlight
opportunities for relatively fast and far reaching financial inclusion which could be further explored and
covered in the upcoming strategy.

Allowing, and advocating for branchless banking offers the potential to further expand the coverage
of financial services and to reach un- and underserved parts to the population, in particular the poor,
rural dwellers, and women. Due to low population density and poor infrastructure, banking channels are
poorly developed in Senegal (4.7 bank branches per 100,000 habitants), especially in rural areas. New
business models such as mobile or agent banking can dramatically reduce the costs of delivering financial
services, in particular in low-density and remote areas. Moreover, it can not only reduce explicit costs for
those 8 percent of the financially excluded adults who reported not having an account because they are too
expensive but also implicit costs such as the opportunity cost of time lost to traveling and waiting for those 54
percent of the adult population who indicated lack of sufficient income as a main barrier to use a formal
account. The success of mobile financial services (MFS) rests on the vast pool of agents (often small retailers)
who connect remote based clients to urban centers, allowing them to make transactions. Sub-Saharan Africa
is now the region with the most elevated rate of use of MFS. Recent estimates show that 12 percent of adults
in Sub-Saharan Africa use MFS compared to 1 percent for the rest of the world. This rate exceeds 10 percent
                                             6
in thirteen countries in Sub-Saharan Africa . In Senegal, however, this rate is less significant (5 percent of
the population). Despite various measures introduced by the UEMOA (such as regulations that allow non-
                                                                                             7
bank establishments to issue electronic money), several obstacles highlighted by the IMF remain: the limited
interest by the private sector or MFIs; the high cost associated with small transactions; the current state of
the regulatory framework (that imposes the intermediation of a banking institution); the low level of
diversification of services (mainly money transfers and bill payments); and the problems related to
interoperability and national accreditation that hamper domestic as well as cross-border money transfers.
Policies addressing these obstacles and facilitating the spread of these low-cost technologies including the
development of a proportionate legal and regulatory framework or increased interoperability can not only help
rural populations and people living on low incomes, it can also help to close the identified gender gap since,
as shown by international evidence, women tend to be more adoptive to technology than their male
counterparts.
Consideration should be given to polies that encourage uptake and usage of basic transaction
accounts at little or no cost. In October 2014, the BCEAO has introduced a new regulation that gives any
person a right to a basic bank account at no cost. Any person wishing to open an account to simply presents
two photo identifications. Financial institutions are not supposed to impose any charges, nor are they
authorized to require minimum balances, or minimum deposits to open the account. A number of other basic
services including issuing debit cards, monthly statements, cash deposits or withdrawals at any branch or
ATM belonging to the same provider, and closing of accounts, are also provided at no charge. Any provider

carried out by the Payment aspects of financial inclusion (PAFI) task force among its members on basic
accounts indicated that there may be little economic incentive for private sector parties to voluntarily offer
these accounts to their customers. Fifty-four percent of unbanked respondents report that not having enough
money as main barrier to formal accounts while 33 percent give a clearer indication that they have a
preference for cash or are not interested in owning accounts, suggesting that the availability of these basic
no-frills accounts and their benefits are not widely known. International experience in countries such as India
or the Philippines shows that the introduction of basic accounts needs to be complemented with public
awareness campaigns to mitigate the risk that uptake and usage of basic accounts may be very low. These
campaigns must be aimed at fostering the understanding and the demand for such fundamental products, in
particular among the poorest segments of the population including women and rural dwellers. Experience
from countries such Mexico shows that another policy to be considered to increase uptake and usage of basic
accounts is to channel government to person payments, including social cash transfers, government
employee salaries, and pensions through this accounts.

In addition to basic accounts, the development and provision of diversified financial services for the
poor geared towards their specific needs should be promoted. Despite banks’ efforts to improve and
diversify the supply of financial products and services to low income customers, the survey data indicates a
lack of suitable products addressing the needs of this segment. Even though many Senegalese have little
money, this survey revealed that they still save, although mainly relying on informal channels. Formal savings
products thus have potential and their promotion could contribute to safeguard savings, which can help
households manage cash-flow spikes, smooth consumption and build lump sums. Developing insurance
products could be another approach given that insurance is a useful instrument mitigate shocks and manage
expenses related to unexpected events such as medical emergencies, a death in the family, theft, or natural
disasters. With two percent of the adult population using insurance products, there is a business potential to
be targeted by insurers and other providers. In recognition of the importance of this market, Senegal is part
of the Inter-African Conference on Insurance Markets (CIMA), which encourages the development of
insurance products and harmonizes regulations in the sector. CIMA groups countries in the Franc Zone
(excluding the Comoros Islands that signed the treaty of CIMA but has not ratified it) and encourages micro-
insurance activities that could significantly raise the penetration rate in the region by adopting a regulatory
framework for promoting innovation in the development of micro-insurance products.

Financial Capability
 Knowledge of basic financial concepts is a significant challenge in Senegal which is mirrored
 by the fact that on average, Senegalese adults were able to answer 3.5 out of 7 financial
 capability-related questions correctly. Senegalese adults are most comfortable with performing
 simple financial calculations (92 percent), whereas they may lack the numeracy skills needed to
 identify better bargains (31 percent) as well as the specific knowledge required to calculate compound
 interest (28 percent). Senegal performs well in terms of their understanding of simple division.
 Compared to respondents from 21 countries, respondents in Senegal perform well in terms of their
 understanding of this last concept. Senegalese adults are in the middle of the pack in terms of their
 understanding of compound interest, while their understanding of the effect inflation has on their
 savings is lower than in most other countries. Location matters in the sense that those who live in
 inner city areas achieve significantly higher financial literacy quiz scores as compared to those who
 live in urban, peri-urban, or rural areas. Similarly, those belonging to the highest revenue quartile and
 residents who live in wealthy areas respond better to financial knowledge questions than those who
 live in areas with lower standards of living.
 The challenge in Senegal persists concerning the awareness of financial products;
 respondents were familiar on average with products provided by 3.6 out of 9 different types of
 providers. Survey participants are mainly familiar with money transfer services (82 percent), followed
 by products offered by e-money agents (72 percent), commercial and postal banks (69 percent), and
 money changers (60 percent). MFIs and their products are known by slightly less than a fourth of the
 sample (24 percent), whereas insurance products are known by less than a sixth of the sample (12
 percent). Much less, only 9 percent indicate to be familiar with the products offered by brokerage
 houses. Respondents who are the least familiar with financial products offered by financial providers
 tend to live in rural neighborhoods and to earn a low income.
 An international comparison of survey participants in twelve countries confirms that
 Senegalese adults tend to monitor expenses and plan for old age, but they are among the most
 challenged with respect to choosing financial products. Survey participants in Senegal
 outperform respondents from ten other countries in terms of monitoring their expenses and outperform
 six other nations when making provisions for their old age expenses. However, the cross-country
 comparison confirms that Senegalese respondents display weakest performance with respect to their
 ability to shop around, read terms and conditions and choose financial products that fit their needs.
 An important personal characteristic, which is found to be strongly associated with higher
 scores in different financial capability areas, is higher income. High income earners are more
 inclined to shop around and choose products that fit their needs. They also tend to save, plan for old
 age expenses, live within their means, and tend to be more farsighted and less impulsive as compared
 to those who live on low incomes. In particular, faced with low and irregular income streams, the
 poorest segments have a lower ability to save (a notable difference of 25 points) and struggle to think
 about the future (a difference of 11 points). Consequently, daily hardship can draw the attention of
 low income groups away from their long-term considerations and needs.
 Other patterns which emerge show that living in a rural environment as well as not having
 learned sound financial habits from a young age are related with lower financial capability
 scores. There is a gap between rural and urban populations in their propensity to live within their
 means, save, and think about the future (9 and 8 points respectively). Another significant social
 characteristic associated to financial capabilities is age. The capacity to accurately budget is much
 lower for respondents younger than 35. Those that mostly monitor their expenses are in fact between
 35 and 54 years old and, not surprisingly, the tendency to plan for old age increases with age. Starting
 to save at an early age also has important value. Respondents who saved as a child scored, on
 average, higher than their counterparts who did not save during their childhood, with respect to saving
 dimensions in financial behaviors.

Recommendations
Either a stand-alone National Financial Capability Strategy (NFCS) or a dedicated financial capability
section in a broader NFIS can be an important organizing framework to scale up and maximize
effectiveness of financial capability interventions in Senegal. In 2015, according to the OECD, 59
countries reported to be developing a NFCS, implementing one or revising it and developing a new one, with
                                     9
an additional five planning one. Financial capability programs and policies can also be part of a broader
                                                                                             10
NFIS. Based on the analysis of 17 publicly available NFIS a recent WBG publication concluded that 15
countries included a dedicated financial capability section in their broader NFIS. Experience in countries
which have been engaging in such an effort at the national level shows that it can promote co-operation
between relevant stakeholders, avoid duplication of resources, and minimize gaps and overlaps in addressing
the challenges identified through this survey. Regardless if it is a stand-alone strategy or a dedicated financial
capability section as part of an overarching NFIS, this document should outline a set of priority programs to
enhance financial capability levels of the overall population and specific subgroups. Priorities could be set
based on a number of criteria, including the need, goals, costs and availability of resources. Other lessons
learned from countries which have developed and implemented such strategies are that essential elements
of such a document include the roles and responsibilities of all involved stakeholders, the main groups which
shall be targeted, the timeframe of implementation, and most importantly the resources for the implementation
of the strategy. An essential step to initiate the preparation of the NFCS is the mapping and review of existing
financial capability initiatives in Senegal. This work helps to ensure that the strategy and future programs are
informed by existing experiences, benefit from lessons learned, avoid duplication and potentially leverage
successful programs. For more information about the process of developing a NFCS see OECD/INFE High
                              11
Level Principles on NFCS.
A clear mechanism for results monitoring and impact assessment needs to be developed, along with
the development of the NFCS. The goal of the M&E framework is to outline a robust M&E system for the
NFCS that extends beyond a simple list of national-level impact indicators to include program-level
intermediate indicators, a theory of change, coordination details, as well as an emphasis on evaluation and
                                                                                               12
improvements in data collection. This framework may also build on international best practices as well as
                                                                                                      13
analytical work to determine a range of ambitious yet achievable targets for each impact indicator. The
results of this survey should also be used to track progress against outcome indicators.
To scale up financial capability efforts in Senegal and address areas for improvement identified
through this survey, it will be necessary to harness the potential of mass media and edutainment
programs in particular which are likely to be effective and help reach a large number of adults. Recent
research has shown that innovation on delivery matters for inducing and sustaining behavioral change.
Conveying financial messages through innovative ways such as using popular TV soap operas, films, videos
or radio programs can be quite effective, not only in improving knowledge but also in altering behavior (Berg
and Zia 2013, Di Maro et al 2014). So called edutainment programs are also presumed to be much more
effective if messages are delivered in an engaging an entertaining manner through appealing stories that
stick to memories, and if they are repeated and reinforced over time. An example how low product awareness

   This process may include projections for increases in levels of financial capability over the time span of the NFCS based on “best
performer” countries in the region and among high-income economies (providing an upper-bound target value).

                                                                    9
levels and low levels of financial capability could be addressed is a popular television soap opera in Kenya,
Makutano Junction, which includes financial education messages in some of its stories. These messages
have included encouraging people to open a bank account, rather than to keep money under a mattress;
saving money; how to apply for a loans; drawing up and tracking a budget; and avoiding pyramid schemes.
Viewers are able to send text messages to obtain a leaflet related to these topics. As with other soap operas,
people watch Makutano Junction because they identify with the characters and enjoy the stories; but in the
course of watching the programs, they benefit from the financial education messages.
In addition to TV and radio programs, periodic text messages and mobile applications could be
another promising and cost-effective outreach channel. The survey results indicate that in Senegal
mobile phones are the most used type of media suggesting opportunities to use this channel to reach out to
a large number of individuals and households. Studies in Bolivia, Peru, and the Philippines show that simple,
timely text messages reminding people to save can boost savings rates in line with earlier established goals
                                                              14
(Karlan et al. 2010). More recently, Rodriguez and Saavedra found that financial education messages via
SMS are not effective at increasing savings, while reminders are effective at doing so. In fact, account
balances of youth who received monthly and semimonthly reminders during one year increased by 28 and
43 percent compared to those who didn’t receive any reminder. Given the high degree of mobile phone usage
in Senegal, this reminder approach could induce the population to pay attention to the benefits and task of
saving as well as making provisions for old age (lowest financial capabilities according to the survey). Mobile
applications could be another promising outreach channel, especially to facilitate budget planning among
young adults. A good example of a mobile app is the mobile budget app (Mobile Financial Assistant – maFin)
which has been developed for young adults by the polish Financial Supervision Authority. This mobile app is
designed to address another area of improvement identified through this survey. Specifically, it helps monitor
and analyze personal spending and to facilitate budget planning and is available free of charge to users of
mobile phones and other mobile devices.
Over the long-term provision of financial education from an early age should be encouraged as the
survey results suggest that starting early can have value. Respondents who already saved as a child
scored on average higher than their counterparts who did not save during their childhood. If people form
sound habits on how to manage their money from a young age, they are more likely to adhere to them
throughout their lives. International evidence on the effectiveness of school-based financial education
programs in changing student behavior is mixed. Nevertheless, there are lessons learned from other countries
which have implemented such programs. For example, the rigorous evaluation of a large scale school-based
financial education program in Brazil showed that such programs are particularly effective when financial
education is provided in ways that students find relevant to their lives either currently or in the near future,
and if it is interactive (Bruhn et al. 2014). High-quality material or textbooks are therefore required, and
teachers need to be well-trained on the content and techniques. There are a number of websites containing
                               15
links to teaching resources . The MEF in partnership with The Ministry of Education could evaluate
possibilities to leverage any curriculum reform efforts in the future to develop a curriculum that integrates
lessons on financial education for young people. As existing curricula may already be saturated, it is advisable
to integrate financial education into a variety of existing subjects including math, economics, or social studies
rather than adding a new subject into the curriculum. In case resources to train teachers and to develop and
provide teaching materials are limited, it may be best to focus, at least at the onset, on incorporating financial
education into one or two subjects over three or four consecutive academic semesters.

Relationship between Financial Inclusion and Capability
  Senegalese who use formal savings or borrowing instruments appear to have high awareness
  of financial products. Senegalese who save and borrow from formal sources are more aware of
  various financial institutions and their products than those who tap into only informal sources, or those
  who do not save or borrow at all. If formal financial providers offer services of higher quality, this
  pattern may suggest that Senegalese with more information of the financial sector select better
  products and institutions than those with less information.
  In Senegal, differences in levels of understanding of financial concepts among users and non-
  users of formal financial products and services are not substantial. However, Senegalese
  without formal financial products are less likely to know about services offered by formal financial
  institutions. Those who currently use formal financial products perform slightly better in the financial
  literacy quiz than those who have no financial products at all. These results indicate that a substantial
  proportion of excluded Senegalese have a similar understanding of financial concepts as do
  Senegalese with established relationships with financial institutions. There is room for policies aimed
  at enhancing financial literacy levels and numeracy skills among Senegalese users and non-users of
  formal financial products.
  In contrast to the patterns observed for financial awareness, there are no substantial
  differences in the financial behaviors and attitudes of financially included and excluded
  respondents, as well as Senegalese who use formal savings or borrowing instruments. Slight
  differences arise between Senegalese with a formal account and those without in terms of their
  financial attitudes and behaviors. The most evident differences are in terms of saving for the
  unexpected and choosing products (6 points behind financially included adults in each case). A similar
  pattern is found among borrowers or respondents who declare saving.


Recommendations
In order to enable financially included Senegalese to benefit from the products they use, financial
knowledge and capability-enhancing programs could be combined with available financial products
that most people can access. Financial education programs could be tied to existing formal financial
products most people can access and use, for example, when opening a bank account, taking out a loan, or
taking an insurance policy. Research shows that financial education works best when delivered to adults
during teachable moments (Yoko et al 2012) when they are more likely to be receptive to new information.
These education programs should not only help to close existing gaps in their customers’ understanding of
financial concepts but also inform about the need to build up savings cushions for unexpected financial shocks
and old age expenses. However, educational materials must be truly informative, clear, impartial, and free
from marketing, and this should be monitored.
Share results from this survey with financial institutions to help them develop tailored products that
promote better habits and behaviors. Since the large majority of the population seems to struggle with
saving and being achievement oriented, it could make good business sense for financial service providers to
develop products which meet the needs of their clients and underserved populations. For example, they could
develop savings products with design features that help people to reach personal savings goals, such as
commitment savings account or labeled accounts. The former consists of accounts where a certain amount
of funds is deposited and access to cash is relinquished for a period of time or until a goal has been achieved.
The latter describes accounts created with explicit savings goals, such as the establishment or expansion of
a business, a car purchase, housing, or education (World Bank 2013a).

Financial Consumer Protection
     Although users of financial services have expressed in general satisfaction with the services
     offered by a range of providers, survey results suggest that banks fare less favorably than most
     other types of financial institutions. Banks seem to effectively meet the needs of 78 percent of their
     consumers. Although this satisfaction rate appears high in isolation, it is relatively low considering the
     overall high satisfaction rate of financial service products in Senegal. Most notably, the highest
     satisfaction rate is achieved by Money Transfer Operators (MTOs) with 93 percent, followed closely by
     MFIs appear to be earning the praise from around 90 percent of their consumers.
     Another important finding is that 11 percent of the surveyed respondents experienced financial
     service provider conflicts, the majority of whom did not try to solve the conflicts they
     encountered. Slightly more than twenty percent of those Senegalese adults who encountered a dispute
     took actions to try to solve it. Interestingly, 38 percent of those who did not experience a conflict stated
     that if they faced a conflict they would try to solve it.
     In terms of actions taken in the event of a dispute, legal courts were barely sought by those who
     experienced a conflict with their financial service provider. The most common actions taken to try
     to resolve disputes were to stop using the services before the contract expired (93 percent), to submit
     a grievance to company which sold the product (50 percent) and to submit a claim to the appropriate
     government authority (28 percent). While 12 percent approached legal courts to redress conflicts, only
     one out of ten reportedly approached the service provider through friends, family or community elders.
     The former can most likely be explained by perceived high costs and lengthy time of proceedings.

     The main causes for inertia are either related to perceived power imbalances between financial
     providers and their clients or they relate to lack of trust in or lack of awareness of respective
     government authorities which can be approached in the event of a dispute. Less than three-
     quarters of those who did not take any actions to solve a dispute reported as main reason for their
     inertia that they perceived financial institutions as being too powerful. Two thirds indicated that they
     think the government authorities do not work properly, followed by 52 percent who were not aware of
     any government agencies they can approach for help. Almost one quarter of those who did not try to
     solve a conflict mentioned that they did not take any actions because they think the law does not
     adequately protect consumers. Between five and six percent of those who did not take any actions to
     solve a dispute declared that they are too shy to redress the dispute or they don’t have time to go
     through the process.



Recommendations
These findings highlight that financial capability efforts need to be complemented by measures to
strengthen the financial consumer protection framework, including regulations in the area of
disclosure. As previously highlighted, it is important that customers have sufficient information to allow
themselves to select financial products that are most affordable and suitable. In line with international best
                                                                                      16
practices, such as the WBG’s Good Practices for Financial Consumer Protection , financial institutions
should thus be required to provide a standardized KFS that explains the key terms and conditions for each

   The World Bank has developed the Good Practices for Financial Consumer Protection as an assessment tool for diagnostic reviews
of a country’s consumer protection and financial literacy framework for the financial sector (Good Practices). The Good Practices were
developed using international benchmarks, such as the principles released by the Basel Committee, the International Organization of
Securities Commissions (IOSCO), the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) and the Organization for Economic Co-
operation and Development (OECD) recommendations for financial literacy and awareness on pensions, insurance and credit products.

consumer-protection.pdf


                                                                  12
product. Qualitative testing of KFS is critical to ensure that the KFS are properly understood by consumers
and that they are used to shop around to identify products which fit their needs best. Specifically, focus group
discussions with consumers help to identify the key information that consumers preferred to have disclosed,
the information on which they typically focus, the amount of information they can comprehend, the most
coherent design, and ultimately, how consumers’ decision-making is affected by the different presentations
of loan information.
BCEAO should also give consideration to assess whether regulatory action is needed to improve
disclosure of consumer rights and recourse which may help to deal with the identified issue of
perceived power imbalances which discourage clients to take actions in the event of a dispute.
Specifically, it is recommended to assess whether legal and regulatory provisions follow international best
practices and require bank and other financial institutions to disclose in all pre-contractual and contractual
disclosure documents detailed information on the right to lodge complaints, the manner in which complaints
may be filed, and the mechanisms for how complaints are handled (including contact information and time
limits). At the minimum, contact information and a reference where more information can be found should be
disclosed. The disclosure documents could also include a summary of next steps the consumer may take if
not satisfied with the resolution, including the option to contact the Observatoire de la Qualité des Services
Financiers (OQSF), which has allowed out-of-court conflict resolution on financial matters between any
individual customer and firm, since 2010.
To ensure that adequate mechanisms are in place to handle complaints fairly in-house, BCEAO
should give consideration to review and assess if minimum standards for complaints handling within
financial institutions could be established or further enhanced by setting more specific rules For
instance, minimum standards rules could require banks and other financial service providers to: (i) provide
the complainant with regular written update on progress of the investigation of customers/complainants’
complaints; (ii) inform the customer in writing of the outcome of the investigation within a maximum number
of days; (iii) explain in simple terms the nature of any offer of settlement made to the customers; (iv) maintain
up-to-date records of all complaints received, including information of the nature of the complaint, copies of
the financial institutions’ response and other relevant documents; (v) make these complaints records available
for review by BCEAO or competent authorities.
Consideration should also be given to enforce full compliance of financial institutions with consumer
protection requirements including information disclosure, fair advertising, complaints handling and
redress, and promote sound business practices by using adequate market conduct supervisory tools
including mystery shopping. Mystery shopping can be a useful tool to inform consumer protection policy
and measure market conduct issues such as how well sales staff comply with disclosure regulations, quality
of customer attention and suitability of financial advice, access to and use of recourse systems when things
go wrong, and disparate treatment of vulnerable consumers. However, to realize the benefits of this
supervisory tool, mystery shopping needs to be well structured, the shoppers need to ask the same questions
at each provider based on a simple and plausible scenario, and it needs to cover a reasonable sample of
providers and products.
It is further recommended that BCEAO, MEF, and the OQSF consider jointly re-visiting the existing
mediation mechanisms in order to quickly and effectively resolve disputes that are not resolved by
financial providers' internal complaints procedures. Given the fact that more than 60 percent of those
who reportedly encountered a conflict did not try to solve it because they think the government agencies do
not function properly, it appears to be critical to make the existing mediation mechanisms more user-friendly
and relevant for those clients who experienced a conflict with a financial service provider. In view of 52 percent
not taking any actions in the event of a dispute because they were not aware of any government agencies
they can approach for help is also crucial to conduct public awareness campaigns to explain the role of the
OQSF.

Over the medium-term, consideration should be given to give adequate powers to the OQSF to
effectively function as an independent external out of court dispute resolution (EDR) mechanism for
all disputes between consumers and financial providers. An EDR is a third party who deals independently
with complaints from consumers about their individual dealings with financial services providers that have not
been resolved by the providers, which has been implemented in many countries including Australia, UK, and
Germany. It is usually favored for its accessibility, transparency, and low cost as compared to courts. It also
reduces the burden on courts. In addition, a financial ombudsman is well-positioned in analyzing trends in
financial consumer complaints and proposing ways of encouraging improved business practice by financial
institutions. While the OQSF partially plays this role, given its current legal mandate and structure it lacks
adequate powers and resources to effectively conduct its mission and oblige financial institutions to inform
consumers of the possibility of addressing the OQSF and provide them with its contact details. In fact, it
should be taken into consideration, to align this with international principles which have been summarized by
            17                                                                                     18
the WBG and developed by the international network of the financial ombudsman and include:
independence; fairness; clarity of scope and powers; effectiveness and efficiency; accessibility; transparency;
and accountability. To identify the most effective institutional setup-up further analysis may be needed, in
particular given the dichotomy between a national OQSF and a regional regulator. Such an analysis should
explore how adequate powers and funding should be given to make the OQSF jurisdiction mandatory for all
regulated financial institutions and to oblige those institutions to contribute to its budget, in accordance with
                             19
international best practice.

    Because of the many other pressures on public finances, it is more common for the cost of such a scheme to be borne by the industry
from which the ombudsman work arises – though perhaps with some upfront contribution from public funds to help initially establish the
ombudsman scheme.

Background on Senegal Survey
The financial capability questionnaire used for this survey has been extensively tested in the context
of middle- and low- income countries. The survey instrument used is based on a questionnaire developed
with support by the Russia Financial Literacy and Education Trust Fund and is tailored to measure financial
capability in low- and middle-income countries, although it can also be used in high-income countries.
Extensive qualitative research techniques were used to develop this survey instrument, including about 70
focus groups and more than 200 cognitive interviews in eight countries to identify the concepts that are
relevant in middle- and low- income settings, and to test and adapt the questions to ensure that they are well
understood and meaningful across income and education levels. The instrument is currently used or planned
to be used in 14 countries in Latin America, Africa, Middle East and East Asia and the Pacific.
The survey instrument used allows financial capability, financial inclusion, and consumer protection
issues to be assessed and measured. Financial capability is measured by knowledge of financial concepts
and products, and by attitudes, skills and behavior related to day-to-day money management, planning for
the future, choosing financial products and staying informed. In order to jointly analyze financial capability
and inclusion, the survey instrument captures information on usage of different kinds of financial products
and providers. The financial consumer protection section gathers information on incidence of conflicts with
financial service providers and levels of satisfaction with financial products offered by different financial
institutions. The survey instrument has been further customized to Senegalese context, through adding
specific questions, for example relating to usage of Islamic products and services and to measure the
elasticity of these products.
The Senegal survey is representative of the financially active population and comprises a total sample
                  20
of 3,210 adults . To fulfill the requirement of a scientifically sound survey which allows inferences to the
whole universe of financially active adults in Senegal, probability sampling techniques were used to select a
sample of 3,210 adults. Thereby, the most recent 2013 General Census of the Population, Housing,
Agriculture and Livestock of Senegal, kindly provided by the Agence Nationale de la Statistique et de la
Démographie (ANSD), was used as a sampling frame. The population was divided into 9 strata based on
area (urban Dakar, rest of urban and rural) and levels of quality of living (low, medium and high). The quality
of living score, for the rest of urban and rural areas, was estimated using five variables extracted from the
census dictionary of variables associated to the dwelling characteristics, type of material of the ceiling, type
of material used for the roof, type of material of the floor, main type of waste management system and main
source of energy. “Missing a meal in the past seven days because of lack of resources,” “missing a meal
because of lack of resources during the past 12 months, excluding the last seven days,” “possession of an
Internet connection at home,” and “ownership of a car” offered much better insight into the levels of quality of
living of households in urban Dakar.
The sample of individual respondents within households was selected through a three stage cluster
sampling. Enumeration areas were randomly selected as primary sampling units (PSUs) with probability
proportional to size (PPS) (number of households) at the first stage, and consisted in selecting 250 primary
sampling units – the smallest Enumeration Areas (EAs), or as they are known in Senegal, DR (District de
Recensement) – of which 36 were for eventual replacement purposes. In each selected PSU, after a complete
and effective listing of all households, 20 households (out of which five were reserve households for
replacement purposes only) were randomly drawn, of which 15 households were targeted for surveying at
the second stage. Finally, within each selected household, eligible adults either responsible for personal or
household finances were randomly drawn by means of the Kish grid. Individual weights were calculated and
used in the ensuing analysis to adjust for varying probabilities of selection (design weights).

Between February and September 2015, a Canadian survey firm implemented the survey using
computer-assisted personal interview methods (CAPI). Étude Économique Conseil (EEC Canada), a
Montreal based consulting firm, was hired to conduct the Financial Capability Survey in Senegal. To ensure
highest data quality and avoid common errors associated with paper-and-pencil surveys, an electronic version
of the questionnaire including internal consistency tests were programmed and the survey was administered
using power PCs. Due to extensive efforts and different strategies used (e.g. training of enumerators on
refusal conversion strategies, communication with respondents to inform them of the coming survey as well
as explaining the surveys’ objectives, up to five contact attempts at different moments during the period of
the survey, etc.) the total non-response rate was around 8 percent of the total sampled households.
The adult population for which the results of this survey are meant to be extrapolated has the
following key characteristics: 47 percent of the population lives in urban areas, while the remaining 53
percent live in rural environments (see Figure 50). Slightly less than half of the population is female (49
percent, see Figure 52). Ranking all individuals by their reported household income and dividing them into
four groups, 25 percent of the population fall in the lowest income segment (up to 41300 XOF per month), 25
percent in the second lowest quartile (between 41301 XOF and 71350 XOF), 25 percent in the second highest
(between 71351 XOF and 140600 XOF), and 25 percent in the highest income quartile (more than 140600
XOF, see Figure 57). Thirty-four percent of the population is younger than 35, 40 percent is between 35 and
55, and 26 percent of the population is older than 55 (see Figure 57). In terms of the education attained, 2
percent of the population has some or completed tertiary education including university or other higher
education, 13 percent has some or completed secondary schooling or technical and vocational school
education, 75 percent has some or completed intermediate schooling, primary schooling, or special
education, while around 10 percent of the population has no schooling at all (see Figure 55). Irregular and
uncertain income flows characterize 68 percent of the population, while the remaining 32 percent is
characterized as earning stable income, (see Figure 56). The average number of adults per household is
four, whereas an average sized household comprises nine people. As shown see Figure 54 in Appendix, 13
percent of the respondents live in households with one to three members, 26 percent in households
comprising four to six members, 24 percent in households comprising seven to nine members, 15 percent in
households comprising 10 to 12, and 22 percent live in households with 13 or more members.
The profile of Financial Capability Survey matches with key characteristics of Senegal’s general
census. As Table 1 presents, there are minor differences between Senegalese population distribution and
the surveyed population.

     1 Financial Inclusion
     1.1 Introduction
Increasing the access to and the quality of financial products and services has become a policy
priority in Senegal. Over the past years, Senegalese authorities have embarked on several reform initiatives
to adopt measures to improve the operational and legal environment of the financial sector. A particular focus
has been given to increase bank penetration rates, develop safeguards against vulnerabilities in the sector
and enhance access to finance for SMEs, through the creation of a bank dedicated to the SME segment - the
National Economic Development Bank (BNDE) - that has become fully operational at the beginning of 2014.
The government has also put in place a guarantee fund for priority sector lending (FONGIP) and a sovereign
fund for strategic investments (FONSIS); nevertheless, there is still a lot of room for improvement. There is a
need for coordination of these various activities, and a need for a balance between direct investment and
long-term viability of these investments, not to mention that the cost of credit still remains high.
Senegal has made positive progress towards achieving its financial inclusion priorities. The Ministry
of Economy and Finance (MEF) has demonstrated its strong commitment to financial inclusion by signing the
Maya Declaration and implementing several initiatives to enhance financial inclusion and access to finance
for SMEs. They include: (i) several awareness campaigns and a general survey on financial inclusion which
have been conducted by the Ministry of Gender, Youth, and Microfinance; (ii) several mechanisms have also
been established to increase access to credit for SMEs; (iii) in 2011 the MEF in collaboration with CGAP has
conducted a consumer protection diagnostic; (iv) the Observatoire de la Qualité des Services Financiers has
allowed out-of-court conflict resolution on financial matters between any individual customer and firm since
2010.
Senegalese authorities are also members of global and regional networks and strategic partnerships
with the aim of making financial services more accessible to the world’s two billion unbanked people.
In particular, Senegal is among the 60 developing countries that are members of the Alliance for Financial
Inclusion. Members of the AFI consist of central banks and other financial regulatory authorities in developing
           21
countries . Together, they represent nearly 90 percent of the non-financially included. Senegal is also a
member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA). Together with the other member
           22
countries , Senegal builds the foundations for a common and coherent economic and monetary policy
                                                                                                23
seeking to fight poverty and for financial inclusion. Finally, Senegal is part of the Franc Zone . The BCEAO
(the Central Bank of West African States) is part of the Global Partnership for International Inclusion (GPFI),
launched in 2010 by the G20, connecting governments, central banks, public and private institutions in the
financial sector of member and non-member counties of the G20. Moreover, Senegal is part of a financial
inclusion working group of central banks of francophone nations with the following 3 main objectives: (1) to
share the experience of member States in terms of strengthening capacities for financial inclusion; (2) to
identify common issues; and (3) to make general recommendations on how to improve financial inclusion.
The first meeting was held in Dakar in February 2015, which led to the publication of a report in early 2016.
This initiative aimed at improving financial inclusion in the Franc Zone by promoting both demand (decrease
cost of opening an account and account maintenance costs, improve consumer protection) and supply
(support the development of mobile financial services).

   African member states of the AFI include: Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central Africa Republic, Chad, Congo (Republic), Côte
d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal,
Sierra Leone, South Africa, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia.
22
   Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea Bissau, Togo, Mali, Niger.
23
   The Franc Zone regroups 14 Sub-Saharan African countries (from Western Africa: Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte D’Ivoire, Guinea Bissau,
Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo; and from Central Africa: Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea and
Chad), Comoros and France.

                                                                 18
At the regional level, a regional financial inclusion strategy is almost final and has been presented to
the various donors and development partners. The strategy strongly emphasizes the need for national
strategies strictly in synergy with the regional one. Additionally, several tools to promote financial inclusion
and stability have already been implemented: (i) a credit bureau is being set up with the assistance of the
WBG under the aegis of the regional central bank (BCEAO); (ii) the microfinance regulatory and supervisory
framework has been strengthened; (iii) a new framework for mobile money operators was established; (iv) a
regional deposit guarantee fund is being set up; (v) several fees and charges for banking services have been
forbidden in order to increase access; (vi) and there is a project currently underway designed to promote
increased standardization of fees and charges to encourage competition.
The following analysis of the financial inclusion module serves to strengthen the understanding of
the state of financial inclusion in the Senegal and provide valuable context for interpreting the results
on financial capabilities. Collecting survey data from individuals – that is, from the demand side - can
provide valuable insight into the usage, value and limitations of existing financial services. Demand-side
survey data also facilitates analysis of how patterns of financial inclusion vary across different population
segments, and the degree to which different financial behaviors – such as saving, borrowing, and making
payments – overlap. The data and analysis presented below can be used to identify priority populations, set
national financial inclusion targets, and design reforms and interventions to advance financial inclusion in
Senegal. Finally, the data can provide a baseline survey against which to measure progress of reforms and
initiatives. Future rounds of surveys will shed light on the degree to which the financial inclusion landscape is
shifting in Senegal, and to what extent progress is evenly distributed across different population segments
and regions.


      1.2 Headline Measures of Financial Inclusion
According to this 2015 Financial Capability Survey, 17.4 percent of the surveyed adults in Senegal
report owning an account at a formal financial institution, a commonly used metric for international
comparison. As compared to other lower-middle income economies from Western Africa, Senegal is in the
                                                  24
middle of the pack in terms of financial inclusion , although it does lag behind the average level among Sub-
Saharan African economies. This pattern is generally in line with the other financial sector indicators for
Senegal as compared to its country peers (see Table 2). Global Findex and WBG Financial Capability surveys
show that Senegal financial inclusion level has grown between 2011 and 2014 - 2015, from close to 6 percent
in 2011 to reach 15.4 percent in 2014 and its current level in 2015. When investments, private pensions, and
insurance products are included as formal financial products, the survey finds that 19.9 percent of Senegalese
adults use some formal financial product. In addition, Table 3 synthesizes the progress achieved in terms of
financial inclusion between 2011 and 2015. 2015 results will be analyzed in detail the following sections.

   Formal account ownership (“financially included”) is defined in this Senegal financial capability study as the percentage of respondents
who report having an account (by themselves or together with someone else) at a bank or another type of financial institution (formal
credit, mortgage, credit from microfinance organizations or from the decentralized financial system, debit or credit card, formal savings,
current or savings accounts), or personally using a mobile money service in the past 12 months.

Yet there are meaningful variations across socioeconomic and demographic categories – gender and
urban/rural residence – in this broad measure of financial inclusion. As shown in Figure 1, men are 8.5
percentage points more likely than women to be financially included, a difference that remains statistically
significant even after controlling for income, education, and a range of other individual characteristics (see
           25
Table 10) . One of the main reasons of women’s lower financial inclusion, is the fact that they generally
participate less in financial and budgetary decisions of the household. Only 23 percent of women declared
being in charge of their household’s everyday expenditures, compared to 36 percent of men. Furthermore,
43 percent of women said they were not responsible of their household’s everyday expenditures. The
remaining 34 percent of women declared sharing this responsibility with their husbands or another member
of the household. Furthermore, close to 32 percent of the interviewed women declared not being the main
persons responsible of planning and foreseeing important expenses, expected or not, compared to 25 percent
of men. A possible reason explaining the lower inclusion of women rests in their prevalent use of tontines (a
rotating savings group in which members contribute regular amounts and are lent each one on their turn the
total amounts collected) as a means for them to access otherwise unavailable credit and as a means to save
money outside of conventional vehicles.

  The multivariate regression model includes the following control variables: age, gender, education, urban/rural, income, household
head status, employment, whether saved as a child, and media consumption.

                                                                  20

Senegalese living in urban areas are significantly more likely to be financially included: 22 percent of
adults living in urban areas report using a formal financial product compared to 13 percent of their
rural counterparts. As Map 1 presents, inequality in access to financial services is also evident by region.
While Senegalese adults from the extended region of Thies, Diourbel and Dakar show a financial inclusion
level that is around four points higher than the average national rate, respondents from Ziguinchor, Louga,
Tambacounda and Kedougou present the lowest financial inclusion rate, close to half of the average national
level.

A strong correlation exists between income and financial inclusion. The gap between the poor and the
rich is larger still, according to regression analysis (see Table 10). While 24 percent of those in the top quartile
of the income distribution use a formal account, only 7 percent of those in the bottom quartile report the same.

                                                          21
As section 1.2 details, the rich seem to prioritize mortgages, given the percentage of the rich that use them
is equal to twice the average. About 4 percent of them benefit exclusively from formal credit products that is
1 percent more than the overall average. More than 3 percent of the rich benefit from microfinance products,
that is 1 percent more than the average. Around 3 percent of the rich use credit cards, compared to an
average of 2 percent, and 6 percent use debit cards compared to an average of 3 percent. Close to 14 percent
of the population belonging to the richest quartile use savings and checking accounts from commercial or
postal banks, that is 4 percent more than the average. Close to 9 percent of the rich use formal savings
products exclusively, compared to 6 percent on average.

Income instability seems to encourage the recourse to savings / credit products, and hence increases
financial inclusion. 16 percent of those with an unstable source of income are financially included, compared
                                             26
to 18 percent of those with stable incomes , a difference that is statistically significant (see Table 10). In
addition, those with unstable incomes use more other formal financial products (as insurance, pensions and
investments), perhaps as precautionary savings to compensate for fluctuating revenues. Not surprisingly, the
average level of monthly income (156,000 FCFA) for those that have unstable income is 1.6 times that of
those with stable income (98,000 FCFA).

There seems to be a correlation between the participation to the workforce and financial inclusion.
The segment of the population that is excluded from the work force, the unemployed and those who have
retired, are generally slightly less included than those who belong to the workforce. Those employed in the
formal and informal sector make greater use of financial products and services.

Self-employed or those informally employed are more financially included (21 percent), than those
employed in the formal sector (15 percent). This is not surprising when one considers that the household
monthly income in the former (151,150 FCFA) is 8.5 percent higher on average than the monthly household
income of those employed in the formal sector (139,200 FCFA). The higher revenues of those self-employed
or informally employed, relatively to those employed in the formal sector, also explain why they use in higher
proportion formal financial institutions and products. In addition, there are more than eight times as many
persons self-employed or employed in the informal sector than there are employees in the formal sector, this
sheer size creates a natural market incentive for all financial service providers to cater to their needs.

     Stable income is defined as income that doesn’t vary from season to season (or in different times of the year).

                                                                      22
A strong inverse relation exists between financial inclusion and household size. In fact, the larger
households are not necessarily the poorest, but they are the least financially included. Financial inclusion
seems to fall as household size increases, going from 19.4 percent of inclusion for households of one to three
persons, to 17.1 percent for households of 10 to 12 persons. This holds true in spite of the fact that household
income increases with the number of income earners, and hence with household size. Large households
typically mean more adults, which translates into more informal help among its members as the overall
household revenue increases. Family solidarity seems to play a critical role as a basic safety net in Senegal.
This characteristic is reassuring in light of the fact that the majority of the surveyed population (more than 70
percent) is composed of households with more than seven persons, and almost 22 percent belong to a
household of more than 12 persons.




      1.3 Usage of Financial Products
The next sections dig deeper into the types of institutions and specific products used by Senegalese
adults, both within and outside the formal financial system. The analysis is organized by type of financial
institution. Each section documents overall awareness of a given institution among respondents, explores
patterns of historical usage, i.e. whether a respondent has ever used that institution, and the current usage.


      1.3.1 Commercial and Postal Banks
The strength of Senegal’s banking sector is not matched by high usage of banking institutions among
Senegalese adults. The banking sector dominates Senegal’s financial system. The last decade has seen an
improvement and diversification in the supply of financial products and services in Senegal. At the end of
2014 the banking sector consisted of 22 banks (19 banks and three branches of foreign banks) and two
                                                                                          27
specialized financial institutions with total assets reaching 4,622,751 million Francs CFA . Despite being the
second largest financial sector in the WAEMU zone, Senegal’s “market share” has been slowly decreasing
(from 21 percent in 2012 to 19.5 percent in 2014). In fact, even though the market grew 12.1 percent from
2013 to 2014, its growth was lower than that of other countries in the West African Economic and Monetary
Union (WAEMU) zone. In 2014, domestic credits to the private sector and domestic bank deposits
                                                                   28
represented respectively 33.5 percent and 36.5 percent of GDP . Although this compares well with countries
in the sub-region, such as Côte d’Ivoire, domestic bank deposits are lower than the median level (which is
39.2 percent), and both indicators are behind those of countries such as Morocco, which thanks to the major
financial sector reforms undertaken, are performing better. In the latter case, domestic credit to the private
                                                                                                          29
sector and domestic bank deposits represented 68.6 percent and 90 percent of the GDP respectively . In
terms of access to banking services, the sector accounted for 1,335,989 accounts through 381 points of
services and 409 ATMs, in 2014. This access has slightly improved in the last few years. The number of
ATMs (per 100,000 adults) was 3.92 in 2010 and it increased to 4.82 in 2013. Commercial bank branches
(per 100,000 adults) rose 0.42 percent during this same period (4.16 vs 4.58 percent). This remains a fairly
low level of penetration compared to lower-middle income economies (see Table 2 and Table 4) which
explains in part the low level of utilization of bank products in Senegal. As Figure 3 indicates, while almost
seven in ten adults report “being aware of banks,” the usage of banks presents a different trend: only 29
percent of Senegalese adults report ever having an account in a commercial or postal bank, a percentage
which varies widely across different segments of the population.

Senegalese in urban areas are more likely to know and use banks products. The urban/rural gap is
wide. Only 21 percent of rural dwellers either have or had an account, compared to 38 percent of urban
dwellers. The multivariate regression model by social and demographic factors, presented in Table 11 and
Table 12, shows that living in an urban area is strongly correlated with the usage of bank services. The
analysis by village factors suggests people are more likely to use bank services in wealthy areas with shorter
distances to banks and high standards of living. A possible reason explaining this gap is the lack of
information, given that close to 37 percent of those living in rural areas have declared not knowing the
products and services offered by banks, compared to only 26 percent of those living in urban settings. In fact,
regression results in Table 24 show financial product awareness is strongly positively correlated with bank
services usage. Regressions in Table 13 particularly highlights the increased probability of knowing bank
services or products for urban populations compared to rural areas. The urban / rural divide is also prevalent
when analyzing the data by gender. Men are more likely to know and access financial bank services (see
Table 11 and Table 13).

Income is a key characteristic that strongly predicts who uses bank services. Regression analysis
(Table 11) suggests bank customers are more likely to have a high or medium income. As presented in Figure
3, the widest gap, however, is the one separating the lowest and highest income quartiles. The richest
population (41 percent) “has or had an account at commercial or postal bank” compared to only 12 percent
of the poorest, representing a 29 percent difference. Where about 24 percent of the richest population has

                                                          24
declared being unfamiliar with the services offered by banks, 44 percent of those belonging to the lowest
quartile have said the same. This difference of awareness remains significant according to regression
analysis presented in Table 13.

An exploration into the type of bank services that Senegalese currently use reveals that the most
common product are bank accounts, followed by credit cards, loans and then mortgages.
Approximately 10 percent of Senegalese adults report currently using a deposit or checking account.
Regression analysis again reveals meaningful disparities in the usage of bank accounts across individual and
socio demographic characteristics (see Table 14). Men are 4 percent more likely than women to use a bank
account (12 percent vs. 8 percent), a difference that holds even after controlling for other socioeconomic and
demographic characteristics. Income is another important determinant of bank account usage: the rich are
more than seven times as likely as the poor to have an account at a bank. Where adults live is also significantly
associated with their likelihood to have an account. Those living in urban areas are more likely to use a bank
account: 13 percent of urban residents have an account compared to just 6 percent of adults living in rural
areas.

A mere 4 percent of adults report having formal credit from a bank or a credit card, with men, the
wealthy, and urban residents again being particularly likely to report doing so. These results are
coherent with the 2014 Global Findex indicators where 3.5 percent of Senegalese adults report having
borrowed from a formal financial institution in the past year. The Global Findex survey particularly indicates
that credit card usage is around 1 percent. Financial capability survey results indicate that credit card usage
is close to 2 percent showing a slight increase. In Senegal, the rich are almost three times as likely as the
poor to report using a credit card: around 3 percent of the richest quartile of adults report using credit cards,
as compared to less than 1 percent among the poorest quartile. The richest are also two times more likely to
have formal credit against the poorest (close to 2 percent vs. less than 1 percent). Approximately 3 percent
of men report currently having formal credit or a credit card, compared to 1 percent of women. One possible
reason that could explain these low formal credit rates is that access to finance in general is limited. The
informal nature of an important part of the economy, combined with the lack of an independent judicial branch,
has caused banks to adopt a very cautious approach to credit granting.

Housing finance remains a relatively underdeveloped sector in Senegal with only 1.5 percent of adults
currently having a mortgage product. One possible factor that may influence the mortgage index is the low
Senegalese urbanization rate (3.6 percent) compared to other Sub-Saharan African economies such as
                                                                        30
Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger which have an index of 5.2 percent on average. On the other hand,
                                      31
Senegalese housing affordability level (31 percent) is also far behind other low-middle income economies
                                                                                32
as Burkina Faso (42 percent), Cote d’Ivore (59 percent) and Mali (39 percent) . Similarly, private pension
products are reported by almost 2 percent of the population, and investments (such as stocks, bonds, shares,
etc.) are only used by less than 1 percent of Senegalese adults. In particular, 9 percent of Senegalese are
aware of the existence of investment opportunities in the regional stock market. In spite of the fact that
Senegal is among the eight countries that are members of the Bourse Régionale des Valeurs Mobilières
                                      33
(BRVM), the regional Stock Exchange, banks, investments products, and brokerage houses in Senegal are
not commonly sought out for several reasons, though mainly due to the poverty level among the average
person residing in this nation. The relatively high costs of the financial services associated with stock

     1.3.2 Payment Providers
     Money Transfer
Approximately 39 percent of Senegalese adults report using a money transfer service, a category that
includes bank and non-bank services. As Figure 4 shows, the current and historical usage rate (54 percent)
of these services place them as the most used financial services by the Senegalese population. The highest
usage level is matched by an also high awareness level: almost 83 percent of Senegalese adults report being
aware of them. These services are mostly used by men, by urban dwellers, and by those belonging to the
richest revenue quartile. These socio demographic gaps are significant according to regressions analysis in
Table 12. While commercial and postal banks provide these kinds of services, non-banks institutions such as
Western Union, Money Gram, Joni Joni, and Wari are the main suppliers. This market composition and high
usage rates are associated to the usage of remittances in Senegal. Capturing in part this phenomenon, the
survey found that 23 percent of Senegalese adults receive help from family or friends living abroad as part of
their household income source. In fact, as Box 1 details, Senegal is now among the top remittance receiving
countries in the world. Within the African continent, Senegal is the third highest recipient in terms of amount
among other African nations. As a consequence, money transfer services dominate the formal Senegalese
                                           35
market of remittances recipient channels.

   According to “Etude sur les Transfers de Fonds des Migrants Sénégalais, Direction de la Monnaie et du Crédit, 2013”, only 6 percent
of remittances in Senegal pass through informal channels.

Box 1. Remittances and Money Transfer Services in Senegal

 Remittances in Senegal have become the most important source of external financing over the past two
 decades, far surpassing the importance of Foreign Direct Investment and Official Development
 Assistancer1. This change is extremely significant because while Senegal is a middle-income country, it is also
 among the least developed. Senegal is now among the top remittance receiving countries in the World. Within the
 African continent, Senegal is the third highest recipient in terms of amount among other African nations r2. By 2015,
 remittances represented 10.3 per cent of GDP r2. According to The Migrant Remittance Inflows reported by the
 World Bank, there was a boom in remittances from $US 147 million in 1998 to $US1.4 billion in 2008. Since 2008,
 however, there has been no significant increase or decrease reported and in fact, remittances between 2011 and
 2015 remained consistently around $US1.6 billionr3. This relative stability in the amount of remittances received
 in Senegal has potentially reached a plateau.

 Observing the trend of Senegalese migrants can suggest an explanation to the plateau of remittance flows
 in Senegal. In 2010, the ILO reported that conservative figures indicate that there are nearly half a million
 Senegalese migrants (or nearly 4 per cent of the population) r4. While it remains difficult to determine an exact
 figure, it is estimated that the net migration rate in Senegal has remained consistent since 2000, at - 1.9 per 1000
 between 2005 and 2010. Furthermore, approximately two-thirds of Senegalese migrants who return home spend
 15 years or more abroadr5. Europe and the United States stand out as the highest sources of remittances, in part
 due to more rigorous reporting standards r4. It is estimated that nearly 52 per cent of all remittance transfers to
 Senegal come from Italy, Spain and France, while 7.7 per cent arrive from the United States.

 The high volume of informal money transfer methods of remittances creates an undeniable difficulty in
 calculating the exact amount of remittance flows in Senegal r1. According to a report published by the African
 Development Bank in 2009, despite the heavy decline, 45 per cent of remittances were still received by informal
 channels r1. The ILO estimates that there are nearly 400,000 money transfers received by Senegalese households
 each month. There are 4 different methods of receiving remittances in Senegal: (1) “nonbank financial
 intermediaries (NBFI) [including money transfer services]; (2) banks and credit unions that provide remittance
 sending services; (3) post offices; (4) and informal intermediaries such as non-formal couriers or even friends who
 take or facilitate the sending of money from sender to recipient”r4. The lack of competitiveness from banks mixed
 with the high costs attached to money transfer services can largely explain why many Senegalese continue to opt
 for informal methods of remittance transfers. Currently among formal channels, money transfer services such as
 Western Union or MoneyGram are still among the dominating nonbank financial intermediaries through which
 over half of all formal remittances are receivedr4. Money transfer services dominate the market in Senegal,
 receiving nearly half of all transfers, because they are fast, reliable and physically accessible comparatively to
 banks that receive only about 10 per cent of remittance transfers because their services are slower and branches
 are physically far less accessibler1.

 Formal channels of money transfers are beginning to experience a new wave of transformation with the
 introduction of mobile money. Mobile money still faces several obstacles (including cross-border provisions
 among many), however, given the high market potential, the Western African region (which includes Senegal) has
 been proactive in making efforts to expand this innovative product. As mobile money expands, it is likely to
 decrease the costs of remittance transfers due to the increase in competition with other services and potentially
 encourage a greater percentage of senders to use formal money transfer methods.

       E-money Agents

        Electronic money (e-money)-based instruments: In general terms, these instruments involve
        the payer maintaining a pre-funded transaction account with a PSP [Payment Service Provider],
        often a non-bank. Specific products include online money when the payment instruction is initiated
        via the internet, and mobile money when initiated via mobile phones and prepaid cards.




Senegal’s institutional framework as well as its developed wireless telecommunication infrastructure
                                                       36
fueled the recent development of electronic money. The MEF is a member of the Better than Cash
Alliance, a partnership of governments, companies, and international organizations working to facilitate the
transition from cash to digital payments, under the premise that digital payments will advance financial
inclusion, reduce poverty, and generate growth.

While more than seven in ten Senegalese adults report being aware of e-money agent services, data
on the usage of e-money products indicates that only 9 percent of the Senegalese population report
ever having used the services of these providers. The high levels of awareness likely reflect government
efforts to develop innovative financial products for individuals previously excluded from financial markets. As
Figure 5 shows, women are as likely to know about mobile financial services than men. However, men and
urban population are more likely to use these services than women and rural dwellers. Regression analysis
presented in Table 11 reveals that these socio-demographic factors are strong predictors of mobile financial
product usage.

There is room for potential growth for mobile financial services. Only 5 percent of the Senegalese
population currently use mobile financial services. As compared to other West African economies (see Table
5), Senegal is far behind Cote D’Ivoire and Ghana but slightly ahead of Cameroon and Guinea. This low
mobile money-penetration rate is also evident when Senegal is compared to the Sub-Saharan countries in
general. As Figure 6 depicts, Senegal has a mobile money account penetration (measured as the number of
mobile money accounts per 1,000 adults) between 17 and 27 times less than Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania
who together lead mobile money usage in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, Senegal has important elements
that may help to increase mobile financial services in the immediate future. In addition to restructured
regulatory framework and government commitment to develop mobile financial services, Senegal has a high
percentage of households with at least one mobile phone (see also Table 5). Furthermore, digital delivery of
financial services in Senegal encompass several players which come often together as banks, mobile money
operators, specialists in money transfer, MFIs, and electronic money issuers that allow the market to offer
diversified and competitive services. In particular, numerous partnerships between banks and mobile network
                                              37
operators have emerged in the recent past.

On the other hand, Senegal fares relatively well as far as the level of taxes associated to mobile
                                                                                                     38
services is concerned, which can be an important barrier to increasing digital inclusion. Senegal
fares relatively well on this front. As Figure 7 illustrates, while mobile-users in Tanzania and Uganda have to
pay consumer taxes of about 36 percent and 27 percent of total cost of mobile ownership, Senegalese mobile-
users pay 22 percent which is only slightly above the Sub-Saharan average level (20 percent).

      1.3.3 Microfinance Institutions
Commercial banks continue to represent the largest portion of the financial sector in terms of
absolute value, MFIs have been on the rise for over a decade and have increased access to finance
                                                        39
by 20 percent within the population of Senegal . In fact, MFIs and financial cooperatives (SFD), in
particular in terms of access, represent a large part of the sector: as of September 2015, they accounted for
2,376,998 clients with a credit portfolio of 281.01 billion Francs CFA and deposits for 248.04 billion Francs
     40
CFA . According to the Government of Senegal however, while there was an increase in outstanding loans
                                                                 41
in 2015, the number of active borrowers slightly decreased . The majority of MFIs offer basic financial
                                                                                                  42
services (including saving accounts and microcredit) that primarily target low-income households .
MFIs are mostly concentrated in highly dense, urban areas. Nevertheless, they are present in nearly
every region of Senegal, providing access to finance to Senegalese in even the most remote areas.
There is room for a great amount of progress as low population density, absence (or low levels) of income,
job insecurity and lack of basic infrastructure (such as electricity) hamper the growth of MFIs in remote
      43                                                                    44
areas . While 90 per cent of the MFI sector is represented by 18 MFIs , the Government of Senegal
                                                           45
recognized back in 2005 the existence of over 800 MFIs . An important regulatory law passed in 2008,
increased transparency of MFIs. While this lead to the shutdown of 118 entities, credits and deposits of MFIs
continued to increase. Between 2002 and 2011, both the rate of credits and deposits in MFIs increased nearly
        46
4 times . Most often, credit from MFIs is “allocated to microbusinesses in trade, services such as catering,
                                47
agriculture, and transportation” . Most MFI loans have a term of less than two years.
Despite the reforms and government priorities in order to professionalize and consolidate the MFI
sector, knowledge of microfinance products remains low: slightly more than two in ten adults report
being familiar with these services. Knowledge of the microfinance sector is relatively well-dispersed among
demographic groups. Rural adults are slightly more likely than their urban counterparts to be aware of or use
microfinance services, likely related to the government’s emphasis on agricultural development in recent
years. Women and poor adults are only slightly less likely than male and wealthy adults to know about or use
microfinance services (see Figure 8).

Differences in microfinance service use are less related to income disparities than differences in bank
usage. As Figure 9 presents, the difference in MFI use between Senegal’s poorest and wealthiest adults is
negligible, especially when compared to bank use. The richest Senegalese population are slightly more likely
to use MFIs. Bank use, on the other hand, demonstrates a monotonic upward relationship with income. In
general, overall use of MFIs remains quite small, limiting the abilities to make inferences about the population
targeted by MFIs.

       1.3.4 Insurance Companies
The insurance sector accounts for a small part of the Senegalese’s financial system even if it represents
the second largest segment of the formal financial sector after banks. The insurance market in Senegal is
the fourth largest market for CIMA after Côte D’Ivoire, Cameroon and Gabon. In 2015, the turnover generated
by 27 insurance companies (17 damage and 9 life insurance companies) stood at 119 billion CFA francs against
101 billion CFA francs in 2014, an increase of 17.82%. The penetration rate laid at 1.46% in 2015 against 1.30%
          48
in 2014.
Figure 10. Knowledge and Usage of Insurance Companies by Individual Characteristics




Source: WBG Financial Capability Survey, Senegal 2015.

Knowledge of insurance products is quite low in Senegal, as less than two adults in ten report to be
familiar with these services and overall usage is close to 2 percent. Men are more likely to know about or
have used insurance products than women. However, regression analysis reveals that income is the only strong
predictor of insurance product usage (see Table 16). A mere 0.4 percent of poorest Senegalese use insurance
and 3 percent of richest Senegalese currently has insurance. The following insurance plans are compulsory:
third-party automobile insurance, insurance on imported goods, vessels flying the Senegalese flag, and
                                                                                                49
construction insurance for which certain application provisions still remain to be defined. Nonetheless,
automobile insurance remains the most widely known, which explains the general awareness of most
Senegalese when they are asked if they recognize this particular type of financial product / service.

      1.3.5 Islamic Finance
Senegal is at the forefront of Islamic finance in West Africa. With a population that is 95 percent Muslim,
the country is well-suited to lead the development of Islamic finance in the region. Senegal was the first West
African country to issue an Islamic bond when it issued a $208 million bond in June 2014, used to invest in
the MEF’s administrative building. Senegal has since served as a model for Nigeria and Cote d’Ivoire, both
countries which are trying to move into the market for Islamic finance.
There is very low use of Islamic products and services. While around 12 percent of adults report being
aware of Sharia-compliant financial products, less than 1 percent of Senegalese adults report actually using
             50
a murabaha product. The reason given by 93 percent of respondents for not using Islamic financial products,
is that they simply neither knew what the product offering was, nor did they know which institutions offered
them. Close to 80 percent of respondents declared not needing Islamic financial products (see Figure 11). In
addition, almost 65 percent of adults indicated that these products were not available where they lived.
Use of Islamic banking is expected to grow in the near- to medium-term future. The government is
working to create a regulatory framework that will allow for increased supply of more Sharia-compliant
products. The country’s recent political stability has generated confidence in Arab investors, which are now
one of the country’s main lending groups. In fact, La Banque Islamique du Sénégal in partnership with the
                                                                                       51
Islamic Development bank are leading the development of Islamic finance in Senegal.
Figure 11. Reasons for not using Islamic Products

Senegalese adults seem to prefer conventional banks instead of Islamic banks. Financial capability
survey proposed to the respondent three hypothetical and neutral questions, where they had to choose
between Islamic banks and conventional banks. As Figure 12 shows, half of Senegalese adults expressed a
systematic preference for conventional banks. The proportion of adults who selected Islamic banks decreased
dramatically when the premium for Islamic products increased.




50
    A murabaha product is a partnership asset financing arrangement wherein the financial institution purchases the desired good for the
client and then sells it to the client in monthly installments at the original price plus an agreed mark-up. In contrast to a conventional
interest payment, the monthly installments remain fixed at the initial amount even in the case of delayed payment.

 Situation 1   Let’s say you applied for a loan at two different institutions – an Islamic bank and a conventional bank. Both banks
               approve a one-year, 50,000 FCFA loan. The monthly installment/payment of the loan from the Islamic bank is 5,000
               FCFA, and the monthly installment/payment on the loan from the conventional bank is 4,750 FCFA. Which bank would
               you choose to take a loan from?
 Situation 2   Now suppose the monthly installment/payment of the loan from the Islamic bank is 5,500 FCFA, and the monthly
               installment/payment on the loan from the conventional bank is 4,750 FCFA. Which bank would you choose to take a loan
               from?
 Situation 3   The monthly installment/payment of the loan from the Islamic bank is 6,750FCFA, and the monthly installment/payment
               on the loan from the conventional bank is 4,750 FCFA. Which bank would you choose to take a loan from?

     1.3.6 Patterns of Formality and Informality in Saving and
          Credit
When they save, Senegalese adults frequently use informal systems instead of the formal financial
system. 19 percent of adults report using informal and semi-informal saving mechanisms as Tontine system,
and self-help groups. In addition to this group of adults, 3 percent of Senegalese population also choose an
informal method but also mixed with formal mechanisms. However, a vast majority of adults report not saving
at all, suggesting that low use of formal products may depend not only on supply, but also demand factors (see
Figure 13).
Figure 13. Formal and Informal Savings




Source: WBG Financial Capability Survey, Senegal 2015.

Borrowing patterns are similar to those seen in savings, with very few adults using taking loans
exclusively from formal providers. As Figure 14 shows, almost two thirds of Senegalese adults do not
borrow at all and 28 percent borrow only informally through money lenders, family or friends. In addition, only
about 3 percent of adults borrow exclusively from formal providers, suggesting that informal sources of credit
are more accessible and/or more desirable to the majority of borrowers.

Note: “Formal only” includes adults that report currently using a mortgage product, formal loan from a
bank/SGBS/CBAO/Cooperative/MFI or credit card, but do not borrow from money lenders or family/friends. “Informal only”
includes adults that report borrowing from money lenders or family/friends but do not use a mortgage product, formal loan
from a bank/SGBS/CBAO/Cooperative/MFI or credit card.

There is also a credit pattern differentiation across regions in Senegal. As Map 2 and Map 3 presents,
the use of formal and informal credits have an opposite trend with each other in more than a half of the
country. It appears that in the regions of Tambacounda, Kedougou, Sedhiou, Kolda and Fatick where
Senegalese adults report the lowest rates of formal credit, the usage proportions of informal credit are the
highest. Thies and Diourbel presents and opposite trend, where the use of formal credit is relatively high and
the use of informal credit is low.

     1.4 The Unbanked and Barriers to Owning a Formal Account
The approximately 6 million financially excluded adults – those who use no formal financial products
or services - in Senegal are disproportionately female, poor, and living in rural areas. 87 percent of
Senegalese women do not currently use a formal financial product or service. Nor do 93 percent of the poorest
quartile of Senegalese adults or 87 percent of adults living in rural areas. Yet, as stated in the Global Financial
Development Report 2014 (World Bank, 2013a), lack of usage of financial products does not necessarily
mean lack of access. While some people may have access to financial services at affordable prices and may
decide not to use them, others may lack access because of constraints such as excessively high costs or
unavailability of the services due to regulatory barriers or other factors. The Financial Capability Survey asked
respondents who do not have a formal account to report why.

Figure 15. Reasons for Not having a Formal Account (% of Unbanked Senegalese Without an Account)




Source: WBG Financial Capability Survey, Senegal 2015.

The most commonly reported obstacle to formal account ownership is lack of enough money to use
one. While this answer could suggest voluntary exclusion from the formal financial sector, it does not
necessarily imply that these adults are unbankable. Instead, it may reflect a cost-benefit analysis on the part
of these adults and demonstrates that many adults perceive banking services to be of little value, not in
absolute terms, but for current levels of income and the quality of banking products. This could be because
of the nontrivial costs associated with owning a formal account, from explicit costs like minimum balance
requirements and withdrawal charges to implicit costs such as transportation costs, but it suggests that, for
many adults, formal institutions do not offer sufficiently valuable services for day-to-day transactions or
savings, particularly those involving small amounts. Another subset of unbanked adults explicitly cites the
costs associated with a formal account: 8 percent of the unbanked report not having an account because it
is too expensive (see Figure 15).

Many adults, however, do give a clearer indication that they are not interested in the basic savings
and payment services offered by the formal financial sector. Demonstrating that lack of usage does not
necessarily imply lack of access, 19 percent of those who lack accounts state that they prefer to use cash
and also 14 of them indicate that they do not need these products. While lack of trust is not a widely reported
reason for not having an account among the general unbanked population, those who have used commercial
and postal bank services in the past but currently do not have a formal account are more likely to cite this
reason: 5 percent of these adults report trust as a reason for not having a formal account, as compared to 3
percent among those with no previous banking relationship.

    2 Financial Capability
  Financial Capability is the internal capacity to act in one’s best financial interest, given socioeconomic
  environmental conditions. It therefore encompasses the knowledge, attitudes, skills, and behaviors of
  consumers with regard to managing their resources and understanding, selecting, and make use of
  financial services that fit their needs.


    2.1 Knowledge of Financial Concepts
There is substantial evidence that lack of financial knowledge and skills contributed to the recent
global financial crisis. It is a well-accepted hypothesis that limitations in consumers’ ability to fully
understand the financial products and risks they had taken contributed significantly to the worst financial
crises since the great depression (Geradi et al. 2010; Klapper et al. 2012).
Financial knowledge and skills are a key element for Senegal financial inclusion goals. MEF would like
to promote a more effective and efficient process to achieve significant improvements in financial inclusion
and access to credit for SMEs, as mentioned in Chapter 1. In order to fully achieve this objective, the
authorities recognize the importance of financial literacy to take informed financial decisions and to enjoy the
full benefits of financial products and services.
To assess respondent’s financial knowledge and their basic numeracy skills, seven questions were
added to the 2015 Senegal Financial Capability Survey, covering basic computation and financial
concepts such as interest rates, inflation, compound interest, risk diversification, and the main purpose of
insurance products. These questions have been asked because they capture financial concepts and skills
which are widely considered as being crucial for informed savings and borrowing decisions as well as for
being able to manage risks more effectively and or to take advantage of investment opportunities. A financial
literacy index is obtained based on the number of correct responses provided by each survey participant to
the seven financial literacy questions. This index ranges from 0 to 7, whereby 0 indicates respondents who
incorrectly answer all of these questions, while a score of 7 indicates survey participants with a good
understanding of fundamental financial concepts and the ability to perform simple mathematical calculations.

  Question 1 Imagine that five brothers are given a gift of 100,000 XOF. If the brothers have to divide
  the money equally, how much does each one get?
  Question 2 Now, imagine that the five brothers have to wait for one year to get their part of the
  100,000XOF and inflation stays at 10%. In one year’s time will they be able to buy:
  •   More with their share of money than they could today
  •   The same amount
  •   Less than they could buy today
  •   It depends on the types of things that they want to buy (do not read out this option)
  Question 3 Suppose you put 100,000 XOF into a savings account with a guaranteed interest rate of
  2% per year. You don’t make any further payments into this account and you don’t withdraw any
  money. How much would be in the account at the end of the first year, once the interest payment is
  made?
  Question 4 How much would be in the account at the end of five years? Would it be:
  •   More than 110,000 XOF
  •   Exactly 110,000 XOF
  •   Less than 110,000 XOF
  •   It is impossible to tell from the information given
  Question 5 Let’s assume that you saw a TV-set of the same model on sales in two different shops.
  The initial retail price of it was 100,000 XOF. One shop offered a discount of 15,000 XOF, while the
  other one offered a 10% discount. Which one is a better bargain, a discount of 15,000 XOF or 10%?
  •   A discount of 15,000 XOF
  •   They are the same
  •   A 10% discount
  Question 6 Which of the following statements best describes the primary purpose of insurance
  products?
  •   To accumulate savings
  •   To protect against risks
  •   To make payments or send money
  •   Other
  Question 7 Suppose you have money to invest. Is it safer to buy stocks of just one company or to buy
  stocks of many companies?
  •   Buy stocks of one company
  •   Buy stocks of many companies

The survey results suggest that on average respondents were able to correctly answer 3.5 out of 7
questions on financial literacy. Figure 16 reveals that the majority of Senegalese adults (60 percent) were
able to provide between three and four correct answers. 16 percent of the sample was able to answer five
questions correctly. Giving correct responses to six or more questions seemed to be a difficult task which was
only achieved by 4 percent, while only 0.60 percent was able to provide correct responses to all 7 financial
literacy questions. Around 19 percent of adults were able to only give one or two correct answers.

A deeper exploration into the type of basic financial concepts knowledge reveals that Senegalese
adults are most comfortable with performing simple financial calculations, yet may lack the numeracy
skills needed to identify better bargains as well as the specific knowledge required to calculate
compound interest. As Figure 17 shows, almost all respondents were able to perform simple divisions (92
percent). More than 50 percent of Senegalese adults are familiar with the purpose of insurance and the
concept of risk diversification. They understand that holding stocks from different companies can usually be
associated with less risky returns than holding stocks from a single company. By contrast, half or larger parts
of the sample struggle to understand fundamental financial concepts and to solve slightly more difficult
numeracy tasks. In particular, only around 45 percent of the sample demonstrates understanding of simple
interests and inflation concept. One of the most notable knowledge gaps which deserve most policy attention
is that only less than a third of the survey participants seem to be comfortable in solving simple numeracy
tasks in order to identify better bargains and to estimate compound interest. Senegalese adults are already
challenged in terms of basic financial concepts as survey results suggest. More complex concepts as annual
percentage rate of interest (APR) increase this challenge.

Higher levels of financial knowledge relate to enabling environmental factors. Regression analysis
reveals (see Table 19) that location matters and that those who live in inner city areas achieve significantly
higher financial literacy quiz scores as compared to those who live in urban, peri-urban or rural areas.
Similarly, indicators which are used to characterize the level of socio-economic development of the location,
such as ‘low unemployment rates’, ‘life in location is better’ and ‘wealthy area’, seem to matter for better
understanding of financial concepts. Residents who live in wealthy areas respond better to financial literacy
questions than those who live in areas with lower standards of living.
Those belonging to the highest revenue quartile are more likely to answer more than 5 quiz questions
correctly while those that only have high school or vocational education are more likely to belong to vulnerable
groups of the population, meaning they answered less than 2 quiz questions correctly.

     Box 3. Debt level and financial knowledge


The survey results further suggest that adults with high levels of debt lack specific financial knowledge. The
average financial literacy score for Senegalese adults with a debt higher than their yearly income is lower than adults
with low level of indebtedness (less than one month of income) or not having debt at all, a difference that remains
statistically significant even after controlling for other demographic and socioeconomic factors. As Figure 19 shows,
Senegalese adults with relatively high indebtedness are much less likely to have basic understanding of simple and
compound interest rates. In particular, the proportion of simple interest right answers is between 15 and 19 percent
lower for high indebted adults. This difference is between 6 and 2 percent with regard to compound interest. This
knowledge gap makes high indebted populations more vulnerable to economic shocks, such as interest rate
increases or inflation periods, and ultimately adversely affects their ability to repay their outstanding debts.
A finding about debt behavior is that 43 percent of the Senegalese population borrow money to buy food or
other necessary items. In fact, twenty percent of the Senegalese population borrows money to buy food on a regular
base and twenty percent do the same sometimes. More than three-quarters of those who declare borrowing in order
to buy necessary items present high levels of debt (22 percent of them have a debt higher than their yearly income
and 55 percent of this group has a debt between two and twelve months of income). On the other hand, a closer look
at the significant characteristics of those who borrow money to buy necessary items reveals that rural dwellers,
women, high income earners, self-employed and Senegalese adults who are out of labor force are more likely to
have this behavior. Specifically, fifty-six percent of those who borrow money to buy necessary items live in rural
areas. In terms of income, while 29 percent of those who borrow money to buy food are high income earners, about
19 percent of them are low income earners. In terms of work status, those who declare borrowing money for
necessary items were mostly either self-employed Senegalese (37 percent) or out of labor force (23 percent).
Another result about debt behavior is that 19 percent of Senegalese adults have borrowed to their limit or
even more. While ten percent of Senegalese adults have to repay money and they couldn’t afford to borrow more,
nine percent of the population has already exceeded its own limit. Among this group of Senegalese adults, fifty-two
percent has a debt between two and twelve months of income and the rest of them (48 percent) has a debt higher
than then yearly income. In particular, adults living in rural areas, men, high income earners and Senegalese adults
with primary or intermediate level of education are significant more likely to borrow to their limit or more (see Figure
19).

An international comparison of respondents in 21 countries on key financial knowledge measures
confirms that financial knowledge and awareness levels are a significant challenge in Senegal, as it
is in similar other countries. Table 6 shows the proportion of adults in 21 countries with a good grasp of
basic concepts such as inflation, simple and compound interest as well as those who are comfortable with
performing simple divisions. As can be seen, respondents in Senegal perform well in terms of their
understanding of simple division. Senegalese adults are in the middle of the pack in terms of their
understanding of compound interest, while their understanding of the effect inflation has on their savings is
lower than in most other countries in the developed and developing world for which comparable indicators
are available.

Self-assessment of financial knowledge doesn’t necessary reflect quiz proficiency. In order to compare
the objective findings of the financial literacy quiz into the context of subjective education needs, respondents
were also asked to self-assess their awareness and understanding of financial terms and concepts such as
interest rates, insurance products, exchange rates, and inflation. As seen in Figure 20 and Figure 21, when
comparing interest, inflation, and insurance, there is an important discrepancy (for 48 percent of respondents
on average) between self-reported financial literacy and actual proficiency as measured by the quiz. An
awareness campaign would likely be useful.

Though close to 90 percent of respondents declared having never heard of or not knowing what
inflation meant, 46 percent correctly answered the financial quiz question pertaining to inflation. Close
to 60 percent of respondents have correctly answered the quiz question about the role of insurance, even
though 72 percent have said they didn’t understand its purpose or even having never heard of them. Data
also suggests that 84 percent of respondents know of interest rates and more than 56 percent claim to
understand its meaning. Results of the quiz, however, seem to paint a different picture: 45 percent of
respondents were able to correctly calculate simple interest rates and less than 31 percent were able to
correctly calculate compound interest rates.

    Box 4. Media Consumption Overview


Almost every adult in Senegal uses a mobile phone on a regular basis and the second most used media
source is the radio. Only about a third of the adult population watches TV regularly. The Internet is used
more (68 percent) in urban areas. As shown in Figure 22, the usage of mobile phones is nearly universal, even
among those at the bottom of the pyramid. Internet usage is not significantly affected by income levels (a gap of
about 14 percent between the richest and the poorest), however rural dwellers reported a much lower usage rate
(24 percent) than urban dwellers (68 percent); suggesting that a lack of proper internet coverage is the main
impediment for people who want to go online. Among other media sources, it appears that local newspapers are
preferred among the least educated while national newspapers are preferred among those with higher education

    2.2 Knowledge of Financial Products
In order to assess survey participants’ awareness levels of financial products the financial capability
survey captured peoples’ familiarity with financial products offered by different types of formal and
informal providers. In particular, survey participants were asked if they were familiar with products offered
by commercial banks, postal banks, Islamic banks, MFIs, insurance companies, money changers, MTOs,
brokerage houses, and e-money agents. A financial products awareness index was constructed based on
the number of financial products known to survey participants. This index ranges from 0 to 9, whereby 0
indicates respondents who are not familiar with any of the products offered in the marketplace. Respondents
with a score of 9 on the other hand stated familiarity with products offered by the nine types of providers that
the survey asked about.
As far as the average number of financial products known is concerned, respondents were familiar
with products provided by 3.6 different types of providers. As can be seen in Figure 23, more than two
thirds of the sample indicated to be familiar with between three to five products, while 8 percent were familiar
with financial products provided by six, seven, and nine different providers. None were familiar with all nine
products. Only 1 percent of the sample did not know any of the nine financial product types.

Figure 23. Distribution of Financial Product Awareness Scores

A deeper exploration into the type of financial products known reveals that survey participants are
mainly familiar with money transfer services (82 percent), followed by products offered by E-money
agents (72 percent), commercial and postal banks (69 percent) and money changers (60 percent).
MFIs and their products are known by slightly less than a fourth of the sample (24 percent), whereas insurance
products are known by less than a sixth of the sample (12 percent). Much less, only 9 percent indicate to be
familiar with the products offered by brokerage houses, which is most likely due to the fact that the capital
market in Senegal is currently in a nascent stage.

Respondents who are the least familiar with financial products offered by financial providers tend to
live in rural neighborhoods and to have a low income. As Figure 25 and Figure 26 show and regression
analysis suggests that even after controlling for other socioeconomic and demographic factors, level of
income and “type of area” are strong predictors for familiarity of products from a variety of financial services
providers (see Table 18 and Table 19).

    2.3 Financial Behavior and Attitudes
Even if people possess knowledge of basic financial concepts and products they may struggle to
translate it into action. To identify the role that attitudes play in shaping individuals' financial decisions and
to see if and how attitudes translate into financial behavior, the survey contains questions on different aspects
(components) of financial capability that include attitudes/motivations and behaviors. This chapter gives an
overview of strengths and areas for improvements surveyed Senegalese show regarding relevant financial
behaviors and attitudes.
In the Senegal data set, 11 main components of financial capability can be identified, some of which
refer to behaviors and others to attitudes or motivations. The Financial Capability and Inclusion Survey
in Senegal recorded different financial attitudes, motivations, and behaviors through diverse qualitative
questions with various measurement levels (nominal and ordinal). To identify the main components of
financial capability in Senegal, a statistical procedure was applied to simultaneously quantify categorical
variables while reducing the dimensionality of the data. This procedure known as Principal Components
Analysis (PCA) reduces the original set of variables to a smaller uncorrelated set of variables (principal
components) which aim to account for as much of the variance in the data as possible. The PCA method gets
a single indicator (or score) for each component. The scores range between 0 (lowest score) and 100 (highest
score).
The PCA analysis performed in Senegal has focused on 11 main components (or dimensions) that account
for 69 percent of the total variance. Other dimensions were ignored because of their lower contribution to total
variance. Principal components having eigenvalues greater than one were also prioritized. Table 7 presents
the relevant attitudes that define each dimension.

Compared to other aspects of financial capability, survey participants show strengths in areas related
to ‘living within one’s means’, ‘monitoring expenses’, ‘learning and improving one’s financial
situation’ and ‘thinking about the future’. According to PCA analysis, Senegalese adults are most capable
in the area of living within one’s means where they achieve the highest score (73) of all aspects of financial
capability being measured. This high score reflects the fact that around three quarters of the surveyed
Senegalese adults do not borrow money to repay debts. More than a half of respondents do not use credit or
borrow money to buy food or pay for other necessary items. Although only one third of Senegalese adults do
not run short of money, the majority of respondents (59 percent) run short of money but overspending or
buying unnecessary items isn’t a reason for this situation. Listing all scores for different aspects of financial
capability in decreasing order, Figure 27 indicates that the second, third, and fourth highest scores are
obtained for monitoring expenses (72), willingness to learn from the environment and improve financial
situation (71), and planning for old age expenses (70).

Financial attitudes and behaviors on the other hand, which relate to discipline, caution, and planning
seem to be a challenge in Senegal. Figure 27 further reveals that compared to their four main areas of
strengths, respondents score on average much lower in areas related to financial prudence, such as
farsightedness (53), non-impulsiveness (50), and achievement orientation (38). The variables used to create
the dimension score reveal that more than half of the sample (53 percent) reported that they buy unaffordable
items. Almost 60 percent of surveyed Senegalese adults considered that the future will take care of itself and
around half percent of the sample perceived themselves as impulsive people.
The lowest scores are found for behaviors that relate to selection of financial products and saving.
The score in the area of saving for the unexpected, is based on the facts that two third of the sample aren’t
able to set money aside once necessary items are acquired. In fact, over half of Senegalese adults can’t
cover unexpected expenses and they don’t have a contingency plan. Almost 77 percent of respondents do
not try to save regularly. The saving inclination score matches the low saving rates detailed in section 1.3.6.
The lowest score is obtained when choosing financial products. This is not surprising, since as presented in
section 1.3, 41 percent of the sample doesn’t use any financial products (formal or informal) and 14 percent
of adults only use informal products. In addition, given that respondents had trouble discerning between the
better of two bargains in the quiz section of the interview, it is not so surprising to see a lower score when
choosing financial products. It would be important to focus on educating the population to ensure the better
economic decision-making.
A comparison to survey participants in twelve countries confirms that Senegalese adults tend to
monitor expenses and plan for old age expenses, but they are among the most challenged with
respect to choosing financial products. Table 8 compares the average financial capability scores
Senegalese adults achieved in five different areas to the ones of respondents in various countries in which a
similar survey has been conducted. As can be seen, survey participants in Senegal outperform respondents
from ten other countries in terms of monitoring expenses and six other nations when making provisions for
their old age expenses. However, the cross-country comparison confirms that Senegalese respondents
display the weakest performance in choosing financial products.

An important personal characteristic which is found to be strongly associated with higher scores in
different financial capability areas is higher income. Faced with small income streams, low income
populations would normally have a lower ability to save and more difficulties in farsightedness. This is
confirmed with a notable difference of 25 points in their inclination to save for the unexpected scores and a
deviation of 11 points in their farsightedness (see Figure 28). As compared to affluent segments of the
population, those living on the lowest incomes are also less inclined to monitor their expenses, resulting in a
difference of 5 points in this capability. Regression analysis by social and demographic factor suggests, high
income populations are more inclined to choose products, plan for old age expenses, save, live within one’s
means, possess farsightedness and impulsiveness as compared to low income populations (see Table 20,
Table 21 and Table 22).
Figure 28. Average Financial Capability Scores by Area and Income Level

Other patterns which emerge show that living in a rural environment and age are related with lower
financial capability scores. Figure 28 reveals a gap between rural and urban populations in their propensity
to live within one’s means, save and farsightedness. The highest gaps between urban and rural dwellers are
related to these last capabilities (9 and 8 points respectively). Another significant social characteristic
associated to financial capabilities is the age (see Figure 29, Table 20, Table 21 and Table 22). The capacity
to accurately budget is much lower for respondents younger than 35. Those that mostly monitor their
expenses are in fact between 35 and 54 years old and, not surprisingly, planning for old age expenses
increases with age.

Starting to save at an early age has value. As shown in Figure 30, respondents who already saved as a
child score on average higher than their counterpart group who did not save during their childhood with
respect to saving dimensions in financial behaviors. The gap between these subcategories of respondents is
18 points. Regression analysis confirms this observed difference (see Table 21).

    Box 5. Planning for Old Age Expenses
Close to 80 percent have declared having strategies to cover expenses in their old age. Almost a quarter said
they could cover their expenses in old age in full, especially those that are financially excluded, those that use
informal products, those that cannot count on financial aid from their family and those aged 54 and over (see Figure
31). The most implemented strategies for old age are pension from the government (35 percent), inheritance (15
percent) and 14 percent of people having strategies will consider working all the time (see Figure 32).

    Box 6. Household Size and Planning for Old Age

The survey shows that household size functions as an efficient social net in Senegal. This is captured by both
behavior and attitude towards the future, which impacts both spending and savings. In effect, as Figure 33 illustrates,
the larger the household the higher the probability of adding income from numerous household members (even if
relatively low incomes are added, they still provide the means to meet daily expenses), as well as the likelier it is to
eventually benefit from retirement income flowing from one of the older members once they retire.
This is captured by the fact that almost half of the population of Senegal is composed of households with at least
one member who is 50 years old or more, while 30 percent of Senegalese live in households with at least one
member who is 65 years or more. Considering that roughly 18 percent of all 65 years and over benefit from pension
payments, and that almost as many benefit from pensions as pensioners’ survivors (spouses or orphans),
maintaining older members in the household adds to the security of all younger members.

    3 Relationship between Financial Inclusion and
      Financial Capability
There is little doubt that financial capability and financial inclusion influence each other. While lack of
knowledge about financial products may hinder their use, it may also be the case that as people begin using
financial services, they become more familiarized with and knowledgeable about them, in a “learning by
doing” fashion. While disentangling a causal link between financial inclusion and financial capability is beyond
the scope of this report, this chapter presents an overview of who are the financially excluded in Senegal and
how their financial knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors compare to financially included segments of the
population.


    3.1 Financial Literacy and Financial Inclusion
Financial illiteracy is usually cited as an explanation of the limited demand for financial services in
developing countries. If people do not understand financial concepts and lack basic numeracy skills, they
may not feel comfortable in choosing financial products and hence will not demand them, or perhaps even
more alarming, they will choose products that do not fit their needs best or use them in the wrong way. For
instance, in a study in India and Indonesia, Cole and others (2009) found financial literacy to be an important
factor in determining the demand for financial products, especially among uneducated and financially illiterate
segments of the population.

Data from the Financial Capability Survey indicates that in Senegal, differences in financial literacy
levels among users and non-users of formal financial products and services are not substantial. Using
the financial literacy index discussed in section 2.1 and categorizing respondents into five groups according
to the number of financial literacy questions they answered correctly, it can be seen in Figure 35 that those
who currently use formal financial products perform slightly better than those who have no financial products
at all. Regression analysis does not find any conclusive link the financial literacy score and the financial
inclusion (see Table 23).




                                                        57

Senegalese whether they use or not formal savings or borrowing instruments appear to have low
understanding of fundamental financial concepts. Figure 36 presents the financial literacy index of
Senegalese who save and borrow by tapping into formal, informal sources, or both sources, and those who
do not save or borrow at all. As seen from the figure, 46 percent of the Senegalese who save formally are not
able to answer more than three out of the seven quiz-like questions correctly. Senegalese who do not save,
or who save in informal sources, perform slightly worse (around 50 percent). A similar pattern is found among
borrowers. Respondents who hold formal credit score marginally higher in their financial literacy assessment
than respondents without or with informal credit. Almost half of these last respondents answered more than
half of the financial literacy questions incorrectly.




                                                         58

These low levels of understanding of basic financial concepts may be of concern, particularly among
the active users of financial products. In order for financial products to provide maximum benefits, their
                                                                    52
users need to know and understand how to use them. Experience has shown that using financial products
                                                                  53
without fully understanding them could do more harm than good . As with the case of financial awareness,
there seems to be room for policies aimed at enhancing financial literacy levels and numeracy skills among
Senegalese, both for users of formal financial products as well as for Senegalese who are currently excluded
from the formal financial system but might eventually become more integrated.

   Most evidence on the effects of financial literacy on debt comes from studies in developed countries. In the U.S., Lusardi and others
(2009) found that debt literacy (measured by questions evaluating debt related concepts) is on average low, and is positively associated with
higher debt loads, fees and borrowing costs. Perry (2008) found that in the U.S. a substantial fraction of people (32 percent) tend to
overestimate their credit ratings, being also less financially literate, less likely to plan their expenses and to save or invest.

    3.2 Knowledge about Financial Products and Financial
        Inclusion
Studies in various settings have also found that enhanced financial awareness may in turn lead to
higher product up-take. In the U.S., for instance, information about a retirement plan was randomly provided
to a group of university employees. Workers who received the information were substantially more likely to
enroll in the retirement plan than those who did not obtain the information, suggesting that individuals are
more likely to use a financial product once they learn about it and its benefits (Duflo and Saez, 2003). In a
similar vein, Giné and others (2011) found that in rural India lack of understanding of insurance products is
the second most stated reason for households not to use purchase rainfall insurance. Overall, evidence of
these studies suggests that lack of usage of products may be reflecting a lack of awareness about them.

Lack of awareness can prevent people from using financial products that could potentially benefit
them. As discussed in section 1.4, most financially excluded Senegalese state they do not have formal
accounts because they lack the money to maintain the accounts, because they prefer to use cash or because
they do not need them. Only a small fraction of Senegalese report that they do not trust them (4 percent),
suggesting at first view that in Senegal, barriers related to lack of knowledge about financial products are not
substantial. However, when analyzing how informed Senegalese without formal accounts are about services
of various financial providers, their awareness level appears to be low. Using financial product awareness
index discussed in section 2.2, and categorizing respondents into five groups according to the number of
financial services they know, Figure 37 and Figure 39 suggest low awareness levels even among non-formal
account users who state reasons not related to financial awareness barriers. More than a half of non-formal
account users only know between 1 and 3 financial services, while this proportion is 16 percent for their
counterpart group. Regression analysis suggests that even after controlling for socioeconomic and
demographic characteristics of Senegalese, awareness of financial products and the likelihood of owning a
formal account are strongly linked (see Table 24 and Table 25)

Senegalese who use formal savings or borrowing instruments appear to have high awareness of
financial products. As Figure 39 indicates, Senegalese who save and borrow from formal sources are more
aware of various financial institutions and their products than those who tap into only informal sources or
those who do not save or borrow at all. If formal financial providers offer services of higher quality, this pattern
may suggest that Senegalese with more information of the financial sector select better products and
institutions than those with less information.

Financially excluded Senegalese are more familiar with services from less regulated providers and
they are less aware of products offered by formal financial institutions. Financially excluded
respondents are familiar with products offered by a few financial institutions compared to survey participants
who have a formal account. As Figure 40 shows, the financial providers that Senegalese without a formal
account were less familiar with are formal ones, such as commercial and postal banks, microfinance
institutions, insurance companies, brokerage houses and Islamic banks, in decreasing order of knowledge.
On the other hand, their knowledge about financial products offered by MTOs (80 percent), money changers
(76 percent), and e-money agents (70 percent) is comparatively higher.

    3.3 Financial Attitudes/Behavior and Financial Inclusion
Attitudes and behaviors are another relevant dimension when analyzing financial inclusion. In
developed and developing countries, households and firms are frequently excluded from accessing financial
products because of inadequate credit history, irresponsible financial behavior, poor business, and
accounting records, to name a few.

There are no substantial differences in the financial behaviors and attitudes of respondents
financially included and excluded, as well as Senegalese who use formal savings or borrowing
instruments. Using the same financial capability scores which have been described in section 2.3, Figure
41 and Figure 42 show that slightly differences arise between Senegalese with a formal account and those
without in terms of their financial attitudes and behaviors. The most evident differences are in terms of saving
for the unexpected and choosing products (6 points behind financially included adults in each case). A similar
pattern is found among borrowers or respondents who declare saving.

    4 Financial Consumer Protection
In addition to peoples’ ability to take sound financial decisions, the latest global financial crisis has
highlighted the importance of financial consumer protection to protect consumers from abusive sale
practices and to level the playing field between providers and consumers of financial services.
Financial consumer protection is about ensuring a fair interaction between providers and consumers of
financial services. An effective financial consumer protection regime is essential in counterbalancing the
inherent disadvantage of financial service consumers vis-à-vis the power, information, and resources of their
providers. Without basic protective measures, consumers may find it difficult or costly to obtain sufficient
information or adequately understand the financial products that they use.
Financial consumer protection is necessary to ensure stable financial markets in Senegal while
ensuring that expanded access benefits consumers and the overall economy. As outlined in section
1.1, given the low level of financial inclusion in Senegal, a number of initiatives are planned or already
underway to increase financial sector outreach to formally excluded populations. Increased access to finance
can result in substantial positive effects, both on the macro level as well as on the level of individuals.
However, it can be harmful if inexperienced consumers are not protected against fraud or unfair business
practices.
Effective financial consumer protection frameworks are also critical for instilling trust in the formal
financial system and for ensuring that expanded financial sector outreach. A high incidence of conflicts
with financial service providers or low levels of satisfaction with financial products used could undermine the
trust in the formal financial system. Despite making existing consumers worse off, it can also discourage
potential new consumers to enter the market.
This chapter assesses the effectiveness of the current financial consumer protection regime from a
demand-side perspective, with a focus on consumers’ satisfaction with financial products and service
and consumer redress and dispute resolution. In order to measure whether products that financially
included Senegalese adults use are effectively meeting their needs, the financial capability survey sought to
capture the overall satisfaction of consumers with the nine most common types of providers and their products
and services. To examine the effectiveness of existing consumer redress mechanisms, this survey also asked
users of financial services to share their experiences with current internal and external redress mechanisms,
and identified segments of the population that are more likely to have encountered a conflict with a financial
service provider in the past three years.

    4.1 Consumers’ Satisfaction with Financial Products
In general, users of financial services have expressed satisfaction with the services offered by
financial service providers. Banks fare less favorably that most other types of financial institutions, with
MFIs and MTOs earning the highest praise from consumers (see Figure 43). The survey didn’t ask about
dissatisfaction reasons. Future surveys could probe respondents on the specific reasons for their
dissatisfaction.

Among those who ever used commercial or postal banks, high income segments and rural dwellers
are less satisfied with their products than their counterpart groups. As Figure 44 presents, while 84
percent of the lowest income earners who ever used bank products reported to be satisfied with them, only
79 percent of the highest income group indicated to be satisfied with the bank products they used. Whereas,
81 percent of urban dwellers indicated that they are satisfied with the products offered by banks, the
corresponding number for rural dwellers is 78 percent.

Notable differences can also be observed in satisfaction levels between regions with services
provided by commercial or postal banks. As Map 4 and Map 5 show, while Dakar, Kaolack and Kaffine
present high level of historical bank usage, satisfaction levels with bank products are among the lowest of the
country. However, Tambacounda, Kedougou and Thies show low – middle levels of historical bank usage but
their bank satisfaction levels are high. On the other hand, Ziguinchor is characterized for having the lowest
rates of historical usage and satisfaction.

    4.2 Consumers’ Approaches to Deal with Provider Conflicts
Another important finding is that 11 percent of the surveyed respondents experienced financial
service provider conflicts, the majority of whom did not try to solve the conflicts they encountered.
As shown in Figure 45, slightly over than one of ten Senegalese adults stated, that they experienced a conflict
with a financial service provider in the past three years. This incidence rate of reported financial service
provider conflicts is a medium index compared to other countries for which a comparable indicator is available.
For instance, this same proportion is 25 percent in Morocco, 17 percent in Philippines, 15 percent in
Mozambique, 12 percent in Azerbaijan, 5 percent in Mongolia, and only 1 percent in Tajikistan. On the other
hand, as shown in Figure 45, twenty one percent of those Senegalese adults who encountered a dispute took
actions to try to solve it. Only 38 percent of those who did not experience a conflict stated that if they faced a
conflict they would try to solve it.
Figure 45. Approaches to Deal with Financial Services Provider Conflicts

A closer look at the characteristics of those who encountered a dispute reveals that urban dwellers,
high income earners and Senegalese adults who are out of labor force were more likely to have faced
a financial service provider conflict. As Figure 46 presents, while 14 percent of urban dwellers who used
a financial product in the past three years reported to have faced a financial service provider conflict, the
corresponding number for rural dwellers is 8 percent. This difference is more substantial when high income
earners are compared to lowest income group (9 percent) and also when Senegalese adults who are out of
labor force are set side by side to employed adults (8 percent). Regression analysis in Table 26 shows that
these differences are significant. Other relevant characteristic is regional location (see also Table 26). In
particular, Senegalese adults living in Dakar or Fatick experienced on average 4 percent more of conflicts
with financial providers compared to national level.

In terms of actions taken in the event of a dispute, social circles and legal courts were barely sought
by those who experienced a conflict with their financial service provider. As Figure 47 shows, the most
common actions taken to try to resolve disputes were to stop using the services before the contract expired
(93 percent), to submit a grievance to company which sold the product (50 percent) and to submit a claim to
the appropriate government authority (28 percent). While 12 percent approached legal courts to redress
conflicts, only one out of ten reportedly approached the service provider through friends, family or community
elders. The former finding can most likely be explained by perceived high costs and lengthy time of
proceedings.

The main causes for inertia are either related to perceived power imbalances between financial
providers and their clients or they relate to lack of trust in or lack of awareness of respective
government authorities which can be approached in the event of a dispute. As Figure 48 presents, less
than three-quarters of those who did not take any actions to solve a dispute reported as main reason for their
inertia that they perceived financial institutions as being too powerful. Two thirds indicated that they think the
government authorities do not work properly, followed by 52 percent who were not aware of any government
agencies they can approach for help. Almost one quarter of those who did not try to solve a conflict mentioned
that they did not take any actions because they think the law does not adequately protect consumers.
Between five and six percent of those who did not take any actions to solve a dispute declared that they are
too shy to redress the dispute or they don’t have time to go through the process.

Further investigation of those who encountered a conflict but didn’t take any actions to solve it
reveals that urban dwellers, women, high income earners and Senegalese adults who are out of the
labor force were more likely to remain passive when facing a conflict with a financial service provider.
As Figure 49 presents, two-thirds of those who didn’t try to solve the conflict with the financial service provider
live in urban areas. In terms of gender, the group of Senegalese adults who didn’t react when facing conflicts
is mainly composed of women (60 percent) and less predominately of men (40 percent). On the other hand,
while 39 percent of those who didn’t take any actions to solve a dispute are high income earners, only 3
percent of them are low income earners. Finally, in terms of work status, those who did not try to resolve the
conflicts were mostly either out of the labor force (34 percent) or self-employed Senegalese (29 percent).
These characteristics are statistically significant.

   Formal account ownership (“financially included”) is defined in this Senegal financial capability study as the percentage of respondents
who report having an account (by themselves or together with someone else) at a bank or another type of financial institution (formal
