The project at a glance
The Trade and Competitiveness advisory program to Develop a National Competition Policy
for Increased Competitiveness and Growth (P161438) for the Philippines aims at supporting
the Government of Philippines, especially the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC), to
encourage competition in key sectors in order to enhance the impact of private sector
participation on consumer welfare, productivity, competitiveness and shared prosperity, while
facilitating investment in sectors previously constrained by anticompetitive practices and
regulations.
The key components under this projects include:

   Identifying existing regulatory restraints to competition in key sectors of the economy as
    well as economy-wide on the basis of as Product Market Regulation (PMR) indicators and
    the WBG Markets and Competition Policy Assessment Tool (MCPAT).
   Supporting the competition enforcement and advocacy mandate of the PCC through quick-
    response analytical inputs on selected topics. To this end, the WBG team produced two
    brief notes on merger remedies in the telecommunication sector as well as on quantitative
    methodologies to identify the effects of lack of competition in the construction sector.
   Providing capacity building for PCC officials to analyze markets and conduct effective
    investigations against anticompetitive practices.
This project is part of the broader engagement of the World Bank Group to foster more dynamic
and open markets in the Philippines that started in 2012 by focusing on the competition
conditions in inter-island shipping sector, included support to the passing of a Competition law
in 2015 and the setup of a Competition Authority in 2016-2017 and will continue in FY18
under the framework Game Changers Program.
Forthcoming activities will focus on complementing each of the three pillars of an effective
competition policy framework according to the World Bank Group (WBG) approach:1

   Pillar I: Fostering pro-competition regulations and government interventions in order to
    open market and remove anticompetitive sectoral regulations:
         Development of templates for the PCC to further their competition advocacy
            mandate. This activity includes the application of key components of the WBG
            MCPAT to Philippine markets including the selection of priority sectors for deeper
            competition policy assessments as well as snapshots of two markets within these
            sectors to map high level competition-related restraints as guidance for additional
            work of the PCC.
   Pillar II: Promoting competitive neutrality and non- distortive public aid:
         A note on the implementation of the Competitive Neutrality principle in the
            Philippines.
   Pillar III: Enabling effective competition law and antitrust enforcement
         Design and implementation of a comprehensive leniency program in order to
            support the detection of cartels, deter cartel formation and foster compliance with
            the Philippine competition law.

Executive summary
The objective of this report is to identify existing regulatory restraints to competition in
key sectors as well as economy-wide as an input to design an effective competition policy
for the Philippines.
The report builds mainly upon Product Market Regulation (PMR) indicators and the
WBG Markets and Competition Policy Assessment Tool (MCPAT) applied to the
Philippine markets in order to (i) develop the main aspects of the advocacy role of the
Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) against current market features; (ii) map regulatory
restrictions to competition and classify them according to their effects; (iv) contextualize
competition restraints within each sector to offer a set of policy recommendations; and (v)
quantify potential impact of a more procompetitive regulatory environment for the Philippines’
economy.
Absent a competition law until 2015, the recently created PCC faces a challenging
environment for the implementation of its mandate. The 2-year delay to start enforcement
as well as the potential to grant broad exemptions from the scope of application of the law
under the forbearance clause have hindered the ability of the PCC to prevent anticompetitive
conduct of market players, either public or private.
In this context, the advocacy role of the PCC offers a critical mechanism to address those
regulatory conditions that may be enabling anticompetitive behavior in the first place.
Limited market competition can stem from restrictive regulations or discretionary application
of the regulatory framework that render entry and operation of new firms difficult. Ensuring
that government policies and regulations do not generate unnecessary barriers to entry or distort
the playing field is necessary to enhance private sector participation and unlock investment
opportunities.

Developing an effective competition policy framework in the Philippines will be critical to
unleash the country’s growth potential

Although the Philippines’ economic outlook appears strong, limited competition in key
economic sectors has been consistently identified as a key constraint for inclusive
structural transformation and therefore a necessary area for implementing reforms in
order to generate inclusive growth and encourage job creation. Notwithstanding the overall
positive impact of impressive GDP growth rates of around 6%,2 the fact that better economic
performance has not translated into job creation and better services can be partially linked to
limited competition in key markets for economic development and inclusive growth.3
Indicators suggest that Philippine markets are relatively concentrated – although a more
granular assessment of charactertistics of specific markets is required to understand the
implications of this for competition. The average four-firm concentration ratio across all
subsectors rose from 71 percent in 1988 to 81 percent in 1998 where the most concentrated
subsectors involve the production of intermediate and capital goods such as machinery and

transport eqipment.4 In manufacturing, a sector where the contribution to GDP has decreased
in recent decades,5 Philippine markets appear to be more concentrated than those of regional
peers6 with a higher proportion of monopoly, duopoly or oligopoly markets (Figure i), typically
more prone to collusion and abuse of market power, and a recent increase in the number of
monopolies and duopolies (Figure ii). Novel statistics developed for this note7 confirm that a
notable proportion of markets8 would be classified as highly concentrated when examined in a
static setting - over 40 percent in manufacturing, close to 50 percent in wholesale/retail, over
70 percent in agriculture and over 95 percent in transport/storage9 according to standard
Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI) thresholds used by competition agencies.10

While the concentration measures provided here give a snapshot of market structure,
such analysis of concentration is typically only a first step in assessing the level of market
competition and contestability. In some cases, inherent market characteristics, such as
economies of scale, naturally result in relatively more concentrated market structures,
regardless of the level of competition. Transport markets are an example of those that tend to
have relatively high concentrations due to inherent market features. Applying standard HHI
thresholds across sectors may thus naturally show a relatively larger proportion of highly
concentrated markets in the transport/storage sector, without this automatically having
implications for the level of competition. These considerations raise the importance of
understanding specifically which product markets are concentrated, and augmenting this with
other an examination of inherent market characteristics, as well as market outcomes such as
price cost margins.

and at the Barangay level for wholesale/retail markets). It should be noted however, that where geographic
markets are defined at a subnational level there may be cross-substitution across Barangays or municipalities.

  While high concentration levels tend to be common in transport and storage markets given their market
characteristics (and accordingly these markets are often subject to regulation), concentration levels in the
Philippines appear to be relatively high even in transport and storage markets where competition should be
viable such as local bus, cargo handling, and freight forwarding services.
10
   The US Department of Justice & Fair Trading Commission generally consider markets in which the HHI is
between 1,500 and 2,500 points to be moderately concentrated, and consider markets in which the HHI is in
excess of 2,500 points to be highly concentrated.

Price cost margins (PCMs) provide another measure of competition as a proxy of the
ability of firms to raise prices above marginal costs. According to statistics generated from
the 2012 CPBI, over 70 percent of agriculture markets, 60 percent of manufacturing markets,
80 percent of wholesale/retail, and 90 percent of transport/storage markets have an average
price cost margin11 of over 40 percent. For the manufacturing and wholesale/retail sectors, the
data shows a significant positive correlation between market concentration, as measured by the
HHI, and price cost margins.12 The ability to charge prices above marginal costs is a potential
indicator of the exercise of market power by firms. In some cases, such outcomes can be
facilitated by market rules and regulations such as price controls, as this note explores in section
II.1.2.

The fact that the markets highlighted in this analysis as having high concentrations and

New available data on the status of market regulations suggests that significant regulatory
restrictions might be limiting competition in key sectors of the Philippines economy

According to PMR indicators, Philippine markets are characterized by higher levels of
restrictiveness than comparator countries. While the Philippines’ PMR score indicates a
less restrictive regulatory environment than some regional peers, including India, China or
Indonesia, its score indicates a more restrictive environment than the average across all
countries (with a score of 2.36 out of 6) and is more restrictive than other regional peers such
as Korea, Japan or Russia. (Figure i). Thanks to their hierarchical construction, PMR indicators
allow for the identification and ranking of the contribution of specific areas to the measured
score. A decomposition of the economy-wide PMR score of the Philippines shows a similar
influence from all three PMR sub-indicators (state control, barriers to entrepreneurship, and
barriers to investment and trade) with a slightly heavier weight on state control restrictions.
While state control (37%) in the Philippines contributes to restrictiveness more than barriers to
entrepreneurship (32%) and barriers to trade and investment (31%), it still remains
proportionately lower than regional comparators as well as the average of PMR countries. On
the other hand, regional comparators show much lower weight of the barriers to trade and
investments. Overall, the three areas where product market regulation in the Philippines seems
to create the most significant restrictions to competition are public ownership, administrative
burdens to start up and barriers to trade and investment. (Figure viii).

However, the PMR indicators constitute only a preliminary diagnostic tool as further
analytical work within each specific pillar and sector would be necessary to design and
prioritize interventions according to their expected effects and feasibility. Building on the
WBG MCPAT, PMR-based restrictions can be divided among three typologies according
to their effects on the ability and incentives of firms to compete: (i) rules that reinforce
dominance or limit entry, which include entry barriers to monopolized markets, barriers that
hinder market expansion, and legal barrier related to licenses and permits; (ii) rules that are
conducive to collusive outcomes or increase costs to compete in the market, which includes
existing restrictions that may facilitate agreements, price controls and measures that restrict
type of goods/services or location; and (iii) rules that discriminate and protect vested interests,
which includes rules or interventions that distort the playing level field, and provide undue
advantages to certain firms.

State involvement in business operations and public ownership is significant which may stifle
private sector participation
Although the Government of the Philippines has adopted key reforms to rationalize state
participation in the economy, SOEs are still present in a number of non-infrastructure
sectors where private participation is typically possible and economically viable. Of 27
sectors reviewed by the PMR, 18 have SOE presence,14 while the average for PMR countries
is 14. Although the presence of SOEs in infrastructure sectors is not unusual across countries,
especially in sectors that require capital intensive investments (such as electricity transmission
and road infrastructure), the government of the Philippines controls at least one firm in 11 out
of the 17 non-infrastructure sectors surveyed. These include, among others, insurance, financial

14
  According to the PMR, an SOE is defined as a company in which state or provincial governments (not
including local governments or municipalities) hold, either directly or indirectly through a government-
controlled company, the largest single share of the firm’s equity capital. Public owner ship is measured by the
extent to which the government participates and intervenes in markets through the scope and scale of its SOEs.
Publicly controlled firms also include government entities that are not organized as companies, but operate in
business or market activities.

                                                                                                                             14
services, construction, fabricated metal products, wholesale and retail trade, human health
activities, as well as restaurants and hotels. In addition, restrictions to FDI in most sectors with
SOE presence further exacerbate the competition effects of the state participation.

In this context, the effective implementation of the competitive neutrality principle to
ensure a level playing field for public and private operators becomes particularly
relevant. Competitive neutrality means that state-owned and private businesses can compete
on a level playing field. This is an important element of the broad competition policy
framework of a country and essential to use resources effectively within the economy and thus
achieve growth and development. While the Competition Law calls for an equal treatment of
SOEs and private firms,15 privileges and immunities in terms of corporate governance16 or
access to finance17 may distort competition in the market and even risk crowding out the private
sector.

In addition, the lack of a regulatory framework to control state support measures may
result in market distortions both favoring SOEs vis a vis private competitors as well
specific private firms. Statistics generated from the 2012 CPBI show that 56 product markets
across sectors, including manufacturing, agriculture, wholesale/retail, and transport/ storage,
reported at least one firm receiving a subsidy (equivalent to 9 percent of all markets in those
sectors). However, in many cases subsidies do not appear to have been granted equally to all
firms within the market. Indeed, in 22 of those industries only one firm received a subsidy
while more than one firm operated in the market.

Moreover, the existence of undue price controls for certain products may distort the
incentives of market operators and affect their ability to compete and provide better
quality goods and services.18 Building upon the 1991 Price Act, the government of Philippines
has enacted broad price controls across sectors. This law enables the Department of Trade and
Industry (DTI) to issue guidelines for suggested retail prices covering 22 products.19
Moreover, recommended prices exist for some regulated professional services such as
architects and engineers and domestic airfares can be fixed by the Civil Aviation Board (CAB)..

At the same time, important price mechanisms to foster competition through ex ante price
regulation are not being applied in network industries. For instance, in telecommunications,
15
   Section 3 of Republic Act 10667 establishes that “This Act shall be enforceable against any person or entity
engaged in any trade, industry and commerce in the Republic of the Philippines. It shall likewise be applicable
to international trade having direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effects in trade, industry, or
commerce in the Republic of the Philippines, including those that result from acts done outside the Republic of
the Philippines. This Act shall not apply to the combinations or activities of workers or employees nor to
agreements or arrangements with their employers when such combinations, activities, agreements, or
arrangements are designed solely to facilitate collective bargaining in respect of conditions of employment.”

   For instance, not all SOEs are incorporated as joint stock companies or subject to private company law. See
the Guidelines for the Creation of GOCCs and Related Corporations, GCG MC No. 2015-01, section 1.2 (b) that
establish that “a Non-Stock GOCC is any GOCC created at the behest of the National Grains Authority (NGA)
or Local Government Units (LGU)) to undertake governmental functions and controlled by the government
through its members.” Available at http://gcg.gov.ph/site/public_files/gcg1440394073.pdf
17
   SOEs have access to loans guaranteed by the state. See the Philippines government is the main guarantor of
GOCC loans. As an example, the document of the Bureau of the Treasury of the Philippines explicitly
establishes that “The National Government has a net lending program for GOCCs which extends advances for
the debt servicing of the guaranteed GOCCs’ obligations to avoid defaulting on guaranteed commitments”.

the power of the National Telecommunication Commission (NTC) to issue efficiency-based
pricing mechanisms in segments where price regulation is typically desirable for competition
has been challenged, resulting in lack of regulation of 20 or international wholesale/retail
roaming rates.21

Barriers to market entry and rivalry in services and network sectors and excessive burdens to
start-up businesses hinder private sector development
High administrative burdens on start-ups make it costly for firms to enter the market.22
In 2017, the Philippines ranked 171th out of 190 economies in Starting a Business, falling 7
places in relation to 2016 (ranked 164th). According the PMR indicators, the absence of key
simplifying tools in the system of licenses and permits, such as the “silence is consent rule,”
raises the complexity of regulatory procedures.23 Barriers in service sectors also contribute to
the high administrative burden on firms to operate in the Philippines. These include entry and
behavioral restrictions on regulated services (accountants, lawyers, architects and engineers),24
road freight transport25 and retail distribution. The forthcoming implementation of the
Philippine Business Registry26 (PBR) one-stop shop will be key to ease doing business in the
Philippines by reducing incidental expenses and increasing cost savings by cutting red tape.

Moreover, incumbent firms are protected by high barriers in network sectors at the
expense of new entrants. For instance, in telecommunications unbundling of the local loop is
not required although it is relevant for broadband access;27 in railways, entry is franchised to a
single firm and there is no vertical separation between operation of railroad infrastructure and
the provision of railway services;28 and in electricity, there is no vertical separation in
generation, distribution and supply.29 Moreover, legal barriers restricting the number of

   Although retail prices of international roaming are required to be approved by the NTC (section 17 of
Republic Act No 7925, year 1995), in practice the regulator does not impose price ceiling on retail and
wholesale access charges.

competitors allowed in the market are pervasive across transport sub-sectors including road
freight,30 maritime transport,31 operation of air transport infrastructure32 and railways.

While the Competition Act applies to all firms across sectors, including SOEs, the
potential to grant broad exclusions may be used to favor market incumbents. Following
international experience, the competition law should apply to all sectors and firms engaged in
an economic activity. The absence of exemptions in the Competition Act of the Philippines is
a key element to avoid the regulatory insulation of incumbents.33 However, the existence of a
forbearance clause that enables the PCC to exempt specific practices or even sectors from the
scope of application of the law for a given period of time may pose a risk in this respect.34
Substantial exclusions from the scope of the law may increase the risk of anticompetitive
behavior and economic distortions.35

Broad limitations to foreign participation in key sectors of the economy, including utilities
and regulated services thwart trade and investment

Barriers to FDI due to constitutional and legislative limitations for foreign participation
in key sectors and economic activities, limit competition and could raise input costs for
Philippine firms. For entry to all 4 regulated professions reviewed by the PMR -accountants,
architects, engineers and lawyers - is restricted for non-Filipino nationals. The Philippines
Foreign Investment Act also limits foreign investment in a number of industries typically open
to FDI including all utilities as well as retail, restaurants and hotels.36 These restrictions, based
on the Constitution itself,37 have affected the capacity of key sectors to attract necessary

entity or group of entities, if in its determination:
(a) Enforcement is not necessary to the attainment of the policy objectives of this Act;
(b) Forbearance will neither impede competition in the market where the entity or group of entities
seeking exemption operates nor in related markets; and
(c) Forbearance is consistent with public interest and the benefit and welfare of the consumers.
A public hearing shall be held to assist the Commission in making this determination.
The Commission’s order exempting the relevant entity or group of entities under this section shall be made
public. Conditions may be attached to the forbearance if the Commission deems it appropriate to ensure the
long-term interest of consumers. In the event that the basis for the issuance of the exemption order ceases to be
valid, the order may be withdrawn by the Commission.”

   See Section 1 of Article XII of the Constitution establishing that “the State shall protect Filipino enterprises
against unfair foreign competition and trade practices.” This restriction informs the prohibition for non-Filipino
companies to participate in certain sectors or provide regulated professional services. The latter is developed by
Section 14 of Article XII of the Constitution of the Philippines stating that “The practice of all professions in the
Philippines shall be limited to Filipino citizens, save in cases prescribed by law.”

capital, especially for large infrastructure projects, and triggered SOE presence in many of
these sectors, thus making their development dependent on the government’s resources.

Differential treatment of foreign suppliers in public tenders results also from
constitutional provisions.38 Allowing national and foreign firms to compete only on the
merits—without favoring one over the other—typically has a positive impact on public
expenses. Therefore, a number of countries have implemented reforms that reduce explicit
access discrimination in favor of local firms. However, in the Philippines, the public
procurement regulatory framework39 not only restricts tenders in public utilities to Philippine
companies with at least 60 percent of national capital but, in those markets where foreign
companies are allowed to participate, it favors local bidders with a bidding price up to a bidding
price 15 percent higher.40

Removing key regulatory restrains to competition may have a significant impact for the
overall economy

An effect based analysis following the MCPAT categorization shows that almost half of
the restrictions identified by the PMR are related to regulations that discriminate and
protect vested interests. More specifically, 49% of the restrictions belong to the category rules
that discriminate and protect vested interests, 29% are related to the rules that are conducive to
collusive outcomes or increase costs to compete in the market, and 21%, to the rules that
reinforce dominance or limit entry. However, this long list of restrictions needs to be
contextualized within the market dynamics of each industry in order to map potential pro-
competition reforms according to their impact as well as their feasibility.

While the electricity sector has undergone significant changes in recent years following
the entry into force of a new regulatory framework, the implementation of key reforms
is still pending. The Electric Power Industry Reform Act (EPIRA) of 2001 fully restructured
the legal and institutional framework of the electricity sector. However, there are concerns
regarding the speed of implementation for the reforms mandated by EPIRA, notably regarding
the need of compliance of the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) with the implementation
of open access provisions and competition in retail as well as the separation between different
market segments has not been fully achieved yet. The Energy Regulatory Commission recently
ordered the separation between operators in the distribution and supply markets in order to
foster competition in retail 41 but this decision has been appealed before the Supreme Court.

development of much needed electricity infrastructure has resulted in limited capacity and high
prices as compared with regional peers.

In the telecommunications sector, lack of regulatory powers of the National
Telecommunications Commission to foster competitive market conditions have resulted
in suboptimal market outcomes. In the Philippines, the price of mobile phone services is
among the highest in the region and four times higher than average OECD countries. Limited
regulatory capacity of the (non-independent) NTC have prevented important pro-competition
reforms such as number portability and unbundling of the local loop.42 Ownership is highly
concentrated between two players largely due to FDI restrictions. Such FDI restrictions have
not only insulated Philippine telecoms from foreign competition but also restricted investment
in infrastructure, which is likely to have perpetuated market concentration.

Restrictions in transport sectors appear to impair logistics in the Philippines compared
to peers, a key bottleneck in an archipelagic country.

      Road transport accounts for 58 per cent of cargo traffic in the Philippines.43 While
       road cargo is characterized by a large number of small firms providing basic
       transportation services, PMR data indicates a number of regulatory restrictions
       mainly due to entry barriers. Trucks require a license to operate in the market which
       requires interaction with eight government agencies.44 Philippine citizenship and
       hauling contracts are also required to establish a business in national road freight
       services.45 Moreover, participation of foreign firms in tenders for government
       transport is restricted to cases where (1) a treaty or executive agreement allows them;
       (2) reciprocity rights exist; and (3) goods are not available locally.46

      In air transport, while there are regional agreements in place (e.g., ASEAN
       Multilateral Agreement on Air Services 2009), there are a few areas that could
       foster more competitive market outcomes. While the Philippines does not have an
       open skies agreement with the United States (US)47 regional agreements such as the
       one signed with ASEAN have been critical to limit government interference in the
       commercial decisions of air carriers about routes, capacity, and pricing, freeing them
       to provide more affordable, convenient, and efficient air service for consumers.48
       However, cabotage rights for foreign carriers are not included in these regional

         agreements and price regulation in the sector persists as the Civil Aeronautics Board
         (CAB) can regulate domestic airfares.49

      In maritime transport infrastructure, lack of separation between commercial
       interests and regulatory functions of the port regulator, the Philippine Ports
       Authority’s (PPA), may result in a discriminatory application of rules. The
       multiple roles of the PPA as the main developer, operator, and regulator of ports, which
       develops, owns, maintains, and regulates its own ports while being responsible for
       awarding contracts to private terminal and cargo handling operators have limited
       competition in port operations.

      Domestic shipping in the country is generally more expensive than in Malaysia
       or Indonesia and exhibits concentrated market structures. The average port-to-
       port cost per nautical mile in the Philippines is $1.47, higher than Indonesia’s $0.77
       and Malaysia’s $1.36. Among the causes of the poor state of the domestic shipping
       industry appeared to be the constraints on market competition. Few operators served
       most shipping routes, with over 40 percent of routes served by a single operator. While
       some market concentration is likely due to market factors such as economies of scale
       in shipping operations, the threat of potential entry of competitors is often the major
       force driving the market behavior in the industry. Moreover, prior to 2015, incumbents
       had to give their consent for new entry in the routes they were serving. 50

      In railways, the presence of a monopolistic SOE, paired with lack of separation
       between the operation of infrastructure and the provision of railway services
       (actual transport of passengers or freight in inter-urban rail) remain a key
       constraint for further development in the sector.

Finally, professional services providers in the Philippines face some restrictions that may
limit their incentives to offer the highest quality at competitive prices. Burdensome
accreditation requirements apply across regulated professions. Advertising is restricted for
accountants, architects and engineers, even though the ability of firms to advertise can help
promote improvements in the quality of professional services, and overcome the information
asymmetries inherent in these industries. Finally, pricing guidelines exist for lawyers,
engineers and architects. Since the market effects of these practices are similar to cartel
agreements, competition policy reforms in the professional service sectors across countries
have been consistently identified to yield large economic benefits by boosting productivity
while not affecting quality or professional standards.

Reducing regulatory restrictiveness in key markets would be key to require a number of
reforms aimed at:

 tackling unclear or restrictive regulation in the infrastructure sectors and
  professional services to create more competitive conditions, with positive effects for
  downstream markets.
 eliminating restrictions on foreign investors vis-à-vis the domestic ones as well as
  among domestic investors in sectors where such regulatory restrictions create an
  uneven level playing field.

Empirical evidence confirms a significant relationship between the degree of regulation
in the service sector and growth in productivity and value added. A study of OECD
countries based on PMR data (Barone and Cingano, 2011) shows that lowering the
restrictiveness of service sector regulation has significant positive effects on value added,
productivity and export growth rates of service-intensive downstream sectors. A significant
reduction52 in the restrictiveness of regulation across professional services, energy, transport
and telecommunications sectors leads to an increase of 0.75 percentage points in annual value
added growth in service-intensive sectors.

In the case of the Philippines, the removal of restrictive product market regulations in
the professional services, energy, transport and telecommunications sectors would lead to
an additional growth of US$ 0.6 billion in sectors that use those services intensively, equivalent
to an increase the annual GDP growth rate of 0.2 percentage points, as compared to a situation
with no reforms.53




52
   A significant decrease in relative regulatory restrictiveness is defined as an improvement of at least two
quartiles in the distribution of countries according to their restrictiveness (i.e. a country that moves from the
75th percentile to the 25th percentile in the respective sectoral or lower level indicators).
53
   Further details of the quantification of these estimates are provided in Section IV, and a summary of results is
presented in Table 11.

     I.   Developing an effective competition policy framework in the
          Philippines
 1.     After more than fifteen years in the making, in June 2015, the Competition Act
 was adopted by the Philippine Congress. This piece of legislation provides the country with
 a great opportunity to internalize the lessons learnt on successful implementation from
 regional and international peers. The Competition Act 54 - which took into account a
 significant number of WBG recommendations such as the limitation of exclusions from the
 scope of the law, the per se illegality of hard core cartels, the establishment of objective merger
 notification thresholds and the obligation to publish decisions - called for the setup of an
 enforcing body, the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC).

 2.    Since their appointment in early 2016, the Board of the PCC has defined and
 started to implement an ambitious agenda that has already yielded interesting results.
 The Chairman and four Commissioners of the PCC have designed and approved
 Implementing Regulations for the Competition Act, started the hiring process of the PCC
 personnel with the goal of recruiting 200 officials before the end of 2016, made a filing with
 the Solicitor General to comment on a foreign investment restriction in the construction
 industry, and challenged a major economic concentration in the telecom sector.

 3.     However, as the prohibition of anticompetitive practices, i.e. cartels and abuses of
 dominance, is relatively new and enforcement was delayed until June 2017, the potential
 for pervasive anticompetitive practices across the economy remains high. The 2-year
 moratorium on the implementation of antitrust enforcement constitutes a key concern of the
 Competition Act that no only enables market players to keep acting anti-competitively and
 remain unpunished but also misaligns their incentives to provide cost/efficient goods and
 services. Moreover, even after the end of this moratorium, the existence of ample grounds to
 exclude given practices and even sectors from the scope of application of the law might
 nonetheless hinder implementation and therefore lower consumer welfare through higher
 prices and less output/choice.55

 4.     In this context, an analysis of whether the current regulatory conditions may
 inhibit market competition can offer critical and timely inputs for the PCC to develop
 priorities vis-a-vis de design of a National Competition Policy for the Philippines,
 identify priorities for competition advocacy and ultimately improve market dynamics.
 Limited market competition can stem from restrictive regulations or discretionary application
 of the regulatory framework that render entry and operation of new firms difficult, as well as
 from ineffective competition policy enforcement. Addressing government regulations and
 practices that restrict market competition or weaken the enforcement of competition policies
 is necessary to generate an enabling business environment. The mandate included in the
 Competition Act to develop a National Competition Policy56 constitutes a unique feature of
 the Philippine regulatory framework and offers a great opportunity for the PCC to design an
 instrument applicable to all economic operators -public or private- across sectors, institutions
 and administrative layers-national and subnational- to introduce a competition lens in

 and competitiveness.

Limited competition in the Philippines may affect the country’s ability to maximize its growth
potential

 5.     Although the Philippines’ economic outlook appears strong, it still lags behind
 regional peers regarding key dimensions for development. According to the Global
 Competitiveness Report 2016-2017 by the World Economic Forum (WEF),57 The Philippines
 is in the transition from first stage to second stage of development, that is in the transition
 between the factor-driven stage to the efficiency-driven stage.58 Two criteria are used to
 allocate countries into stages of development: (i) GDP per capita at market exchange rate; and
 (ii) share of exports of mineral good in total exports. Countries that export more than 70
 percent mineral products (measured using five-year average) are considered factor-driven.
 The intersection of both dimensions for the Philippines results in a score of 4.36 points (out
 of 7) in the Global Competitiveness Index, ranking 57th among the 138 countries surveyed.
 However, some regional peers such as China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand have already
 achieved the second stage of development. Malaysia, in particular, is in the transition from the
 second to third (innovation-driven) stage. In addition to the Philippines, only Vietnam remains
 in the second stage of development.

countries to efficiency-driven countries: Algeria, Azerbaijan, Bhutan, Botswana, Brunei Darussalam, Gabon,
Honduras, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Mongolia, Nigeria, Philippines, Russian Federation, Ukraine, Venezuela, and

 faces a central policy challenge in making its growth inclusive. In other words, to create more
 and better jobs while reducing poverty more rapidly. In 2012, it was calculated that 14.6
 million good jobs — meaning jobs that raise real wages and lift people out of poverty —
 needed to be provided to around 10 million Filipinos who were either unemployed (three
 million) or underemployed (seven million), and to around 1.15 million potential entrants to
 the labor force every year from 2013 to 2016. In addition, better jobs were required for another
 21 million Filipinos who were informally employed.60

 7.     Limited competition in key economic sectors has been consistently identified as a
 key development challenge for the Philippines economy and a constraint to the creation
 of better jobs. The fact that better economic performance has not translated into job creation
 and better services can be connected to limited competition in key markets for economic
 development and inclusive growth. For instance, relatively slow growth in two key labor-
 intensive sectors: manufacturing and agriculture, has led to a slow pace of job creation and
 poverty reduction. In both the 2013 Philippines Development Report and the Philippine
 Country Strategy, the World Bank Group (WBG) identified lack of market competition as a
 key constraint for inclusive structural transformation and therefore a necessary area for
 implementing reforms in order to generate inclusive growth and encourage job creation.

 8.    Indicators suggest that Philippine markets are relatively concentrated, although
 there is variation across markets. The average four-firm concentration ratio across all
 subsectors rose from 71 percent in 1988 to 81 percent in 1998 where the most concentrated
 subsectors involve the production of intermediate and capital goods such as machinery and

 transport eqipment.61 In manufacturing, a sector where the contribution to GDP has decreased
 in recent decades,62 Philippine markets appear to be more concentrated than those of regional
 peers63 with a higher proportion of monopoly, duopoly or oligopoly markets (Figure 2),
 typically more prone to collusion and abuse of market power, and a recent increase in the
 number of monopolies and duopolies (Figure 3). Novel statistics developed for this note using
 the 2012 Census of Philippine Business and Industry (CPBI) confirm that a notable proportion
 of markets64 would be classified as highly concentrated when examined in a static setting:
 over 40 percent in manufacturing, close to 50 percent in wholesale/retail, over 70 percent in
 agriculture and over 95 percent in transport/storage65 according to standard Herfindahl–
 Hirschman Index (HHI) thresholds used by competition agencies (Figure 4 to Figure 7).66

   Philippine manufacturing declined from 30% of GDP in the 1970s to 20% of GDP in 2015.

   Regional peers were selected among those countries with available information from the World Bank’s
Enterprise Survey.

   Relevant markets have been defined at i) product level using the 5-digit Philippine Standard Industry
Classification (PSIC) code (aggregated in cases where there is a high degree of substitutability between markets)
and ii) geographic level (national for manufacturing and agriculture; at the municipal level for transport/storage;
and at the Barangay level for wholesale/retail markets). It should be noted however, that where geographic
markets are defined at a subnational level there may be cross-substitution across Barangays or municipalities.
65
   While high concentration levels tend to be common in transport and storage markets given their market
characteristics (and accordingly these markets are often subject to regulation), concentration levels in the
Philippines appear to be relatively high even in transport and storage markets where competition should be
viable such as local bus, cargo handling, and freight forwarding services.

   The US Department of Justice & Fair Trading Commission generally consider markets in which the HHI is
between 1,500 and 2,500 points to be moderately concentrated, and consider markets in which the HHI is in
excess of 2,500 points to be highly concentrated.

                               9.     In this context, dominance in Philippine markets is perceived to be particularly
                               high as compared to to regional peers. Perceptions of competition in the Philippines appear
                               to be weak, particularly with regard to the extent of market dominance (114 out of 138
                               countries) where, according to the Global Competitiveness Report (2016-2017),67 the
                               Philippines ranks below the average of the countries in the sample and the lowest as compared
                               to regional peers. (see Figure 8, Figure 9 and Figure 10). In turn, limited competition affects
                               business risks, especially related to vested interests and unfair competitive practices, as shown
                               in Figure 11 below.

 10. Interpreting concentration measures as an indicator of competition and the extent
 of dominance demands a complementary analysis of market characteristics, including
 economies of scale and barriers to entry and rivalry. While the concentration measures
 provided here give a snapshot of market structure, such analysis of concentration is typically
 only a first step in assessing the level of market competition and contestability. In particular,
 it is important to highlight some considerations to bear in mind when interpreting the
 indicators used in this analysis:
   i. Typically, more weight is given to market concentration measures in inferring levels of
        competition when market shares have been stable over time.68 High concentration with
        significant changes in market shares over time could be considered less problematic
        since this implies that markets are relatively contestable.
  ii. If a firm raises its prices over time relative to its rivals and still retains its market share,
        this is typically an indication of a lack of competitive pressure faced by the firm.
 iii. Different measures of concentration (such as different specifications of concentration
        ratios, or the HHI) can yield different results. It must, however, be noted that the 4-firm
        concentration ratio is less precise than the HHI of market concentration.
 iv.    In some cases, inherent market characteristics, such as market demand, high capital
        requirements, and economies of scale naturally result in relatively fewer firms in certain
        sectors (e.g. cement, mobile telecommunications, rail transport). Such markets by their
        nature will tend to have higher concentrations, regardless of the level of competition.
        For example, transport markets are an example of those that tend to have relatively high
        concentrations, due to natural features such as high capital costs. Applying standard
        HHI thresholds across sectors may thus naturally show a relatively larger proportion of
        highly concentrated markets in the transport/storage sector (Table 6), without this
        automatically having implications for competition.
 These considerations raise the importance of understanding specifically which product
 markets are concentrated, and augmenting this with other an examination of inherent market
 characteristics, as well as market outcomes such as price cost margins.

 11. Price cost margins provide another measure of competition as a proxy of the
 ability of firms to raise prices above marginal costs. According to statistics generated from
 the 2012 CPBI, over 70 percent of agriculture markets, 60 percent of manufacturing markets,
 80 percent of wholesale/retail, and 90 percent of transport/storage markets have an average
 price cost margin69 of over 40 percent (Figure 12 to Figure 15). For the manufacturing and
 wholesale/retail sectors, the data shows a significant positive correlation between market
 concentration, as measured by the HHI, and price cost margins.70 The ability to charge prices
 above marginal costs is a potential indicator of the exercise of market power by firms. In some
 cases, such outcomes can be facilitated by market rules and regulations such as price controls,
 as this note explores in section 1.2. High price cost margins can be particularly detrimental to
 growth and job creation when they occur in input markets by raising costs and stifling
 productivity in domestic industries that use them as inputs. For example, in manufacturing,
 markets in the top decile of the price cost margin distribution include key inputs, such as
 manufacture of sugar, engine parts, concrete and cement items, and asphalt parts among
 others. In agriculture, markets in the top decile of the price cost margin distribution include
 fertilizer applications and weed, disease and pest control services - services that are important

   This positive correlation does not appear for agriculture and transport/storage sectors.

for productivity in the agriculture sector overall. In transport/storage sector, freight truck
operations, logistics services, cargo handling and cold storage are the markets which appear
most frequently in the top decile of the price cost margin distribution across geographic
markets.

          High static concentrations would provide a more prominent red flag in markets which
       have low natural barriers to entry. For example, there are a number of monopolies present in
          the Philippines in markets where competition would usually be considered to be viable.
 12. Table 2 summarizes markets where there is only one firm operating and their associated
 price cost margin (PCM).71 In agriculture there are 15 markets that have only one firm operating,
 manufacturing has 16, wholesale/retail has 5, and transport/storage has 15. It is striking that, with
 the exception of a small number of transport markets where monopolies are relatively more
 common (such as railway transport and postal activities), in the majority of these markets,
 competition would typically be considered viable.72

           Even among those markets that have only one firm in operation, there is a high degree
                                      of variation in the PCMs (
 13. Table 2). This further illustrates the need to take into account a range of indicators beyond
 market structure to fully understand market dynamics. Figure 16 to Figure 19 show HHIs and
 PCMs those markets which are in the top decile of both HHI and PCM distributions. Once again
 it can be seen that, even in the transport/storage sector that tends to be more naturally prone to
 concentration, the markets captured here are in fact markets which would usually be considered
 to be contestable – including road freight transport, grain warehousing, inland freight water
 transport.

14. The fact that the markets highlighted in this analysis as having high concentrations
and PCMs would usually be considered contestable may be a first indication that market
rules and regulations are set in a way that may hinder competition. Government
interventions, such as the product market regulations and policies that will be outlined in this
note, can lower market contestability and restrict competition. Table 3 outlines where specific
restrictions have been identified by the product market regulation methodology in sectors which
lie in the top 20% of the HHI and/or PCM distribution for the sector. For example, there are two
markets in the air transport sub-sector that lie in the top 20% of the HHI distribution and four that
lie in the top 20% of the PCM distribution. It is possible that these factors are perpetuated by
restrictions that restrict entry, such as the fact that the Philippines' open-sky agreements do not
include cabotage rights on the national territory to foreign carriers of the signatory countries or
that the Philippines has not engaged in Mutual Recognition Agreements with any other country
in air transport. The regulation of domestic airfares may affect the strategic behavior of firms in
terms of their pricing or could reduce incentives for entry.

15. Within this framework, developing an effective competition policy and law in the
Philippines could be essential to foster private sector development, efficient allocation of
resources and welfare economy gains. Carlin, Schaffer, and Seabright (2004), focusing on 24
transition economies, showed that firms facing between one and three competitors saw real sales
grow by almost 11% on average over three years while monopolists saw real sales decline by 1%.
Sekkat (2009) suggested that higher markups have had a significant negative effect on
productivity growth in Jordan and Morocco. Analyzing data for more than 40 African countries,
Gebreab (2002) found that the entry of an additional operator increased mobile subscriptions by
an average of 57%. Conversely, an OECD study (2012) showed that weak market competition in

telecommunications alone cost the Mexican economy around USD129.2 billion in 2005–09, or
1.8% of GDP a year. Also for Mexico, Urzúa (2009) estimated that market power exerted by
companies on key goods imposed welfare losses on poor households 20% higher than those on
the highest-income households.

Key elements to foster an effective competition policy framework in the Philippines
16. From the World Bank Group’s perspective, an effective competition policy
framework is based upon three complementary pillars: fostering pro-competition
regulations and government interventions; measures to guarantee competitive neutrality in
markets and effective economy wide enforcement of competition law. Competition policy
usually involves the enforcement of antitrust law (Pillar 3 i.e. rules against abuse of dominance,
anticompetitive agreements, and merger control) and the promotion of measures to enable firm
entry and rivalry while removing distortions to the level playing field (Pillars 1 and 2). The latter
activities are typically referred to as competition advocacy. These pillars, summarized by Figure
20, rely on an effective institutional set up that is able to foster and guarantee healthy market
conduct.

 frameworks in place for years. Since the mid-90s, competition bills have been approved in
 Singapore (1994);73 Thailand (1999);74 Indonesia (1999);75 Taiwan (2002);76 Vietnam (2004);77
 China (2008);78 and Malaysia (2010);79 Australia and New Zealand passed their competition laws
 earlier, in 197480 and 1986,81 respectively. Until 2015, the Philippines constituted an exception
 as the country lacked a unified competition law and instead relied in a number of disperse
 regulations to deal with competition-related issues.82

 allowed; and (iii) the prohibition of
 abuse of dominance.84 On the other
 hand, restricted application of the competition law to SOEs in China,85 and Thailand,86 among
 others, places the Philippines in a stronger position to level the playing field between private and
 public operators through antitrust enforcement.

 19. However, potential exclusions from the scope of application of the Competition Act
 together with suboptimal redress mechanisms for anticompetitive behavior might threaten
 effective enforcement. Although, best practice recommends applying the law across all
 economic agents and sectors, Section 4 of the Act offers a general provision for any undertaking
 to request the forbearance of the law for a specific conduct.87 Moreover Section 8 enables the

   The Term Hard-core cartel refers to “anticompetitive agreements by competitors to fix prices, restrict output, submit
collusive tenders, or divide or share markets” as defined by the OECD, 1998, “Recommendation of the Council
concerning Effective Action against Hard Core Cartels”.

   In the Philippines, this prohibition applies only to the oil industry.

   In the case of China, article 7 of the Anti-monopoly Law of the People’s Republic of China establishes in article 7
that: “With respect to the industries controlled by the State-owned economy and concerning the lifeline of national
economy and national security or the industries implementing exclusive operation and sales according to law, the
state protects the lawful business operations conducted by the business operators therein. The state also lawfully
regulates and controls their business operations and the prices of their commodities and services so as to safeguard
the interests of consumers and promote technical progresses.”

Finally, fines are not based upon turnover but fixed amounts. Since the gravity of the sanction
shall always reflect the gains generated by the infringement in order to offset them with the
amount of the fine, it is preferable to calibrate the maximum fine to the economic potential of the
defendant rather than to set an arbitrary statutory cap. The amount of the penalty necessary to
deter anticompetitive behavior depends on the profitability of the behavior in question.

                                     Box 1: The Philippine Competition Act

The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC or the Commission) was established on January 2016, after the
Republic Act No. 10667 (Competition Act) was passed on July 2015. The law’s provisions apply to all sectors and
any person or economic entity including State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) (Section 3). The objectives of the
Competition Act are established in Section 2 of the Competition Act and include: enhancing economic efficiency
and promoting free and fair competition (Section 2.a), preventing economic concentration that unduly stifles
competition (Section 2.b), and penalizing all forms of anti-competitive practices with the objective of protecting
consumer welfare and advancing domestic and international trade and economic development. (Section 2.c).

The Competition Commission shall be an attached agency to the Office of the President (Section 5) and the
Commissioners of the Competition Authority are appointed by the Philippines ’ President (Section 6). The budget of
the Competition Authority is also established by the President (Section 51).

The law prohibits cartels and other anticompetitive agreements (Section14) and abuses of dominance (Section 15).
The law establishes the possibility to determine a 50% threshold for the presumption of market dominant position
(Section 37 of Competition Act and Rule 8, Section 3 of Rules and Regulations to Implement the Provisions of
Republic Act No. 10667).

The PCC has powers to review mergers. Firms have to notify mergers when the aggregate annual gross revenues of
the party exceed one billion pesos (Sections 3 and 17), or if the value of the transaction exceed one billion pesos
(Rule 4, Section 3 of Rules and Regulations to Implement the Provisions of Republic Act No. 10667). The merger
review is a two-phase procedure, with the first phase extending to 30 days and the second phase up to 60 days. The
Commission has power to block mergers and to impose behavioral and structural remedies (Section 12).

The Commission has power to conduct investigations, market studies, and, upon a court order, to undertake
inspections of businesses (Section 12). On those sectors where specific regulators exist, the PCC must consult the
sectoral regulator before issuing an opinion (Section 32). Finally, the law empowers the PCC to develop a leniency
policy (Section 35).

However, effective enforcement remains threatened by a general provision where any undertaking can request the
forbearance of the law for a specific conduct (Chapter V, Section 4: “Any entity may request to be exempted from
the enforcement of this Act by submitting a written request for forbearance to the Commission”). Additionally, the
law provides a two year transitional period (until July 2017) with respect to liability for administrative, civil and
criminal penalties.

Finally, unlike recommended international practices, fines are not based upon turnover but are subject to maximum
fines set in Philippines Pesos (PHP). Section 29 of the Competition Act establishes that the first offence to the
competition law shall be penalized with a fine of up to one hundred million PHP, while the second offense shall be
punished with fines no less than one hundred million PHP, but no more than two hundred and fifty million PHP.

 20. Moreover, effective implementation of competition law and policy depends on several
 elements beyond the law itself. Effective competition law enforcement can prevent overcharges
 (of as much as 46 percent) that may result from anticompetitive conduct, such as cartel behavior.88
 However, for the law to be implemented effectively, a number of factors beyond the primary legal
 and policy framework must be in place (figure 23): It is important to have an adequate institutional
 structure and resources; More specific rules and skills are needed to enforce the law and use its
 powers and mechanisms to investigate, stop, and prevent anticompetitive practices and mergers;
 Finally, to encourage competition across the economy, authorities should collaborate with other
 government bodies and inform government interventions based on fact-based market studies and
 advisory opinions.

in the range 31–49 percent.

21. An equally important component of a successful competition policy is ensuring that
government policies and regulations do not generate unnecessary barriers to entry or
distort the playing field by favoring specific firms. Regulations are those rules, generally
overseen by the government, that aim at affecting the behavior of players within the business
environment and eventually, the economy. This definition includes regulations enacted by
governments, standards set by sector regulators, and limitations imposed by professional
organizations.

22. Regulations can often be justified on social or economic grounds and are important
to achieve relevant policy objectives. Such rules are usually driven by legitimate social and
economic objectives. Government intervention may be justified by equity goals, such as poverty
reduction, or by economic considerations, such as efficiency. The latter kind of intervention may
be required when market forces alone cannot deliver the socially optimal outcome, for example
in the case of market failures such as natural monopolies, or the presence of externalities.

                                                                                                              43
 23. There are circumstances where policy interventions may have the unintended
 consequence of distorting competition and in turn harm welfare. In some cases, existing
 regulations (or a lack of regulation) may be the result of historical processes which have not taken
 into account distortive effects on markets. In other circumstances, the main market participants
 may exercise their lobbying power to influence rule setters (a phenomenon that the literature calls
 regulatory capture).89 One of their goals usually is to obtain rules that reduce the degree of
 competitive pressure they face. However, reducing the level of competition is a very important
 cost that affects the private sector, consumers and the whole economy. It is thus fundamental for
 policy-makers to evaluate that the costs of regulatory interventions will not outweigh the benefits,
 and to seek for the alternative that among the options that achieve the ultimate policy objective,
 minimizes the distortions to market functioning. In this way, policy-makers can maximize the
 positive impact of regulations on the economy.

 24. The risk that regulation may hinder the development of well-functioning markets
 may be mitigated by considering competition principles when designing regulations and
 state interventions. One of the most important components of a successful competition policy is
 ensuring that government policies and regulations do not unnecessarily restrict entry or distort,
 facilitate collusion or increase the cost of competing, or distort the level playing field by providing
 an undue advantage to specific firms. The World Bank Markets and Competition Policy
 Assessment Toolkit, described in 0 and applied within this assessment provides a structured
 framework to analyze the effect of government interventions on market competition.

 25. By embedding competition principles in policy-making, potential distortions from
 direct state intervention, state aid and investment incentives may be minimized. State
 support can take various forms, including among others tax exemptions, loan guarantees,
 provision of resources at below market prices, subsidies, capital injections. While offering
 government support to private or state-owned enterprises (SOEs) may help achieving specific
 goals, it may have a negative impact on competition. If not properly designed, state aid may
 provide an undue advantage to specific firms, reinforce a dominant position, thus facilitating
 anticompetitive behaviors or reduce a firm’s incentive to make investments, thus generating
 market inefficiencies.

 26. Price controls are another type of policy intervention where the negative effects
 should be carefully assessed. Governments may seek different objectives by controlling prices.
 They may want to protect consumers from increasing prices or to protect the incomes of small
 producers. Price controls may be necessary in the regulation of natural monopolies, yet they can
 have distortive effects in markets with more players, including facilitating collusion or dampening
 incentives to invest. To guard against this, regulations that require consultation with the
 competition authority before introducing price controls could be implemented. The authority
 could assess the impact of the competitive restrictions in the concerned market and check whether
 the pursued objective could be achieved using a less distortive intervention.

 27. Building on its advocacy mandate, the PCC, in cooperation with sector regulators,
 can play a key role in integrating competition principles in policy-making. In order to achieve

89
  Chicago School pioneered the notion and theory of ‘regulatory capture’ (see (Stigler, 1971), which was further
developed by the Toulouse School (see Laffont and Tirole, 1991).

                                                                                                                   44
 an effective competition policy, collaboration between the Competition Authority and sector
 regulators is necessary to prevent conflicts and to ensure a stable environment for the regulated
 firms. In the Philippines, the position granted to the PCC within the regulatory ecosystem can be
 critical to achieve these objectives: In addition to the enforcement of the Competition Act, the
 PCC has the power to assist the National Economic and Development Authority, in consultation
 with relevant agencies and sectors, to formulate competition policies in the Philippines.90 This
 power complements PCC role as pro-competition advocate (Section 12(r) of the law) as well as
 its ability to intervene in administrative and regulatory proceedings initiated by government
 agencies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Energy Regulatory
 Commission (ERC) and the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC, Section 12(n) of
 the law). The contribution of the Competition Authority in formulating pro-competitive
 regulations can have a substantial impact particularly on regulated sectors, state involvement in
 commercial activities and price controls. To this end, mapping existing regulatory restrictions that
 may inhibit market competition constitutes a critical tool to inform the advocacy agenda of the
 PCC and shape its overall institutional strategy.


 II.    Identifying regulatory obstacles to competition in the Philippines’
        markets
 28. New available data on the status of market regulations in the Philippines suggest that
 regulatory restrictions might be limiting competition in key sectors of the economy thus
 affecting the country’s ability to maximize its growth potential. Product Market Regulation
 (PMR) indicators assess the extent to which public policies promote or inhibit market forces in
 several areas of product markets.91 Each of the areas addressed within the PMR methodology
 sheds light on specific restrictions of the regulatory framework both economy-wide and in key
 sectors of the economy on twelve topics: electricity; gas; telecom; post; transport; water; retail
 distribution; professional services; other sectors; administrative requirements for business start-
 ups; treatment of foreign parties; and others, such as governance of public-controlled enterprises
 or antitrust exclusions and exemptions. The information for the Philippines was first collected in
 2013 as part of International Finance Corporation (IFC) advisory services and later revised in
 2016-2017 to build PMR indicators. The methodology of economy-wide PMR (see Box 2) is a
 useful instrument for pinpointing rules that are likely to exercise restrictive pressure on
 competition. It should be kept in mind that PMR analysis is not an end in itself: once scores are
 calculated, these must be used as a screening device to identify the aspects of the regulatory
 framework that are more likely to have a negative impact on competition.

Product Market Regulation (PMR) indicators form a comprehensive and internationally-comparable set of indicators
that measure the degree to which policies promote or inhibit competition in areas of the product market where
competition is viable. PMR indicators are useful to monitor the regulatory achievements of monitored countries and
to evaluate the effectiveness of policies introduced throughout the years. Moreover, PMR indicators have been widely
used to help policy-makers to draw a clear picture of regulations in different countries, with the objective of
identifying gaps in regulations and/or room for improvements.
The PMR indicators rely on information collected through the OECD regulatory indicators questionnaires. Figure 24
here under summarizes how the economy-wide score is calculated (number in parentheses represent weights). First,
the answers of the questionnaire are coded into objective information (scores range from 0 to 6, 6 = worst). Second,
scores of individual regulations are aggregated into subsequently broader regulatory areas starting with “Lower -level
indicators” (18 areas), then “Intermediate indicators” (7 areas), then the three “Sub -indicator”. Finally, the three sub-
indicators are averaged to calculate the overall PMR score.

Initially built by the OECD for their members and the OECD plus countries (47 countries total), in partnership with
the WBG, the dataset has been extended to 20 additional countries, including the Philippines.
The PMR indicators are designed to reflect regulations that have the potential to restrict competition in areas where
competition is viable. By construction, they have a number of features which make them useful not only for analysis,
but, more importantly, for policy advice, since they allow to pinpoint specific policies that hamper competition in
product markets. The PMR indicators are focused on enacted policies and not on outcomes, implying that they are
‘objective’, in that they are not based on opinion surveys. Finally, PMR indicators focus on regulatory measures that
affect the economy at large and can therefore be considered as comprehensive measures of regulatory restrictiveness.
Their advantages notwithstanding, PMR indicators are not designed to capture informal regulatory practices nor the
effective enforcement of regulations, since they are only concerned with formal compliance with a number of criteria.

 29. According to the PMR indicators, Philippine markets are characterized by higher
 levels of restrictiveness than comparator countries, such as Chile, Poland, and Romania.92
 While the Philippines’ PMR score indicates a less restrictive regulatory environment than some
 regional peers, including India, China or Indonesia, it remains above the PMR average (with a
 score of 2.36 out of 6) and is higher than other regional peers such as Korea, Japan or Russia.
 Moreover, the region also features top PMR performers such as Australia and New Zealand.

 30. A decomposition of the economy-wide PMR score of the Philippines shows a similar
 influence by all three PMR sub-indicators with a slightly heavier weight of state control
 restrictions. While State control (37%) in the Philippines is heavier than barriers to
 entrepreneurship (32%) and barriers to trade and investment (31%), it still remains
 proportionately lower than regional comparators as well as the average of PMR countries. In turn,
 regional comparators show much lower weight of the barriers to trade and investments (Figure
 26).

31. The three areas where product market regulation in the Philippines seems to create
the most significant restrictions to competition are public ownership, administrative
burdens to start up and barriers to trade and investment. Thanks to their hierarchical
construction, PMR indicators allow for the identification and ranking of the contribution of
specific areas to the measured score (Figure 27). Therefore, the PMR can be used as a diagnostic
tool to identify those regulations that are more likely to be restricting competition in the
Philippines. It is worth noting that all the components measured by the PMR indicators are often
interlinked. This means, for instance, that without regulatory reforms to reduce state control and
barriers to entrepreneurship, benefits from relatively lower barriers to trade and investments may
not reach their full potential. Meanwhile, where high barriers to trade and investment arise due to
restrictions to foreign direct investment (FDI) and high tariffs, this may result in larger restrictions
related to state control due to the lack of potential local investors in public utilities or the need to
impose price controls due to the lack of foreign competition.

  32. However, the PMR indicators constitute only a preliminary diagnostic tool as
  further analytical work within each specific pillar and sector would be necessary to design
  and prioritize interventions according to their expected effects and feasibility. Regulations
  can be necessary to address market failures or to pursue relevant policy objectives; however, in
  certain instances, regulations may restrict competition. The PMR indicators are useful
  instruments for identifying regulations that are likely to negatively affect competition and
  undermine growth in the Philippine markets but they offer a broad menu of potential reforms
  that need to be further assessed in terms of actual impact on the overall market dynamics.

  33. Along these lines, the classification of restrictions according to their markets effects
  may provide an insightful overview of the market failures (or induced failures due to
  government unnecessary interventions). Identifying restrictions contained in rules and
  regulations is by itself a first step towards reforms, however lifting restrictions in an ad hoc
  isolated manner, without taking into account market specificities, is unlikely to have significant
  sustained impacts on market conditions. For that reason, a more comprehensive evaluation of
  the effects of government interventions on firm incentives in specific markets, balanced with
  overall social welfare objectives, within a market competition framework is required.

  34. Building on the WBG Competition Policy Assessment Tool (MCPAT), PMR-based
  restrictions can be divided among three typologies according to their effects on the ability
  and incentives of firms to compete: (i) rules that reinforce dominance or limit entry, which
  include entry barriers to monopolized markets, barriers that hinder market expansion, and legal
  barrier related to licenses and permits; (ii) rules that are conducive to collusive outcomes or
  increase costs to compete in the market, which includes existing restrictions that may facilitate

                                                                                                                                 49
agreements, price controls and measures that restrict type of goods/services or location; and
(iii) rules that discriminate and protect vested interests, which includes rules or interventions
that distort the playing level field, and provide undue advantages to certain firms.



       Box 3: The World Bank Market and Competition Policy Assessment Tool (MCPAT)

 The MCPAT is a methodological instrument of analysis developed by the WBG Competition Policy Cluster
 to identify specific problems at the market level and prioritize competition tools accordingly —markets to be
 prioritized as well as the tools vary by country – and in some cases, complement each other. Having a practical
 nature and a focus on implementation, this methodology has been developed based primarily on the experience
 of the WBG Competition Policy Cluster implementing pro-competitive reforms in more than 45 developing
 countries. Therefore, The MCPAT provides a standardized and comprehensive tool with which to understand
 i) competition dynamics created by market feature (including supply-side characteristics and buyer
 characteristics) and ii) identify and assess the potential anticompetitive effects of Government intervention in
 markets. The interaction between these two elements can then be analyzed to determine the risk of
 anticompetitive behavior, both in terms of collusion and exclusionary abuse of dominance.

 This assessment can then inform the development and prioritization of effective strategies to promote
 competition through changes in policies, regulations, and rules.

 As described in Figure 28, the MCPAT builds on the identification of those rules and regulations that may have
 anticompetitive effects on the basis of the following typology:
 (1) Rules that reinforce dominance or limit entry;
 (2) Rules that are conducive to collusive outcomes or increase costs to compete in the market;
 (3) Rules that discriminate and protect vested interests.


                                                                                                                       50
   Within each of these categories, specific sub-typologies of rules have been identified and illustrated with
   specific examples. This typology feeds into a holistic step-by-step methodology to promote competition
   reforms as described in Figure 29.

1. State participation and control of economic activities

35. While the Philippines remains close to the PMR average in terms of the state control
sub-indicator, some of its components point towards the existence of critical restrictions to
competition (Figure 30). The score of state control is mainly driven by the extent of public
ownership which becomes particularly concerning given that the key contributors to
restrictiveness in this area are the terms of corporate governance and the scope of SOEs. Both
dimensions are closely connected: where the scope of SOEs is higher, i.e. SOEs are present in
more sectors, having sound corporate governance provisions in place will have a stronger impact
to minimize potential market distortions. To a lesser extent, price controls and suboptimal use of
command and control regulation are behind the restrictions related to the involvement of the state
in business operations.

1.1 Public Ownership

 36. Governments justify their direct participation in the economy through a mixture of
 social and economic goals. Governments generally invoke the control of strategic resources and
 the improvement of distribution of wealth and power as justifications to participate in economic
 activities through SOEs.93 Employment and industrial policies may also be major drivers for
 developing a large presence of SOEs in the market.94 In times of crisis, state ownership is often
 used to rescue private businesses affected by systemic economic and financial problems.95 Such
 government bailouts for private firms in critical conditions are carried out for a variety of reasons,
 including the protection of employment, industrial policy considerations, and other strategic and
 political motivations.96

 37. The Government of the Philippines first adopted key reforms to rationalize state
 participation in the economy in the late 80s.97 Structural reforms in the public sector began in
 1986 under Proclamation No. 50 of December 8, 1986.98 This program, which was implemented
 by the Asset Privatization Trust (APT) and under the guidance of the Committee on Privatization
 (COP), was directed at substantially reducing the size of the government’s corporate sector. Later,
 these institutions were replaced by the Privatization Council (PC) and the Privatization and
 Management Office (PMO) created by Order No. 322 of December 6, 2000.99 The PC is now the
 central agency of the government responsible for overseeing the government’s privatization
 program. Its main responsibilities include formulating policies and general guidelines on
 privatization issues, identifying disposable assets, monitoring the progress of privatization

93
   According to the PMR, an SOE is defined as a company where state or provincial governments (not including
local governments or municipalities) hold, either directly or indirectly through a government-controlled company,
the largest single share of the firm’s equity capital. Public ownership is measured by the extent to which the
government participates and intervenes in markets through the scope and scale of its SOEs. Publicly-controlled
firms include also government entities not organized as companies, but operating in business or market activities.

 The PMO, on the other hand, acts as the marketing agent for those assets.

 38. This process was further complemented by transparent Public-Private Partnerships
 (PPP) regulatory frameworks to foster private entry in infrastructure sectors. Private
 engagement in infrastructure was first based upon the year 1990 Build-Own-Transfer (BOT) Law
 (Republic Act No. 6957), later replaced with Republic Act 7718 100 and complemented by
 Administrative Order No. 67 of 1999. 101 By establishing a transparent and competitive process
 for BOT schemes,102 this instrument greatly increased private investment in infrastructure,
 especially in sectors other than power. Key features of this regulatory framework included (i)
 relaxing the requirement for 60 percent of Filipino ownership for operating infrastructure projects
 not classified as public utilities;103 (ii) limiting to 50 percent the amount of project costs that
 government financial institutions could cover; (iii) delegating Congress’ approval to the executive
 branch; and (iv) allowing implementing agencies to consider unsolicited project proposals and to
 negotiate proposals directly with the private sector under certain conditions.104 Finally, on
 September 9, 2010 Executive Order No. 8105 was signed reorganizing and renaming the BOT
 Center to the Public-Private Partnership Center. The PPP Center’s mandate is to facilitate and
 coordinate the PPP program. It manages a revolving fund called the Project Development and
 Monitoring Facility, provides implementing agencies technical advisory support and monitors the
 implementation of PPP priority projects.106 In 2016, it was estimated that PPP projects would
 contribute some 0.8 percent of GDP in additional investment spending.

                                       Box 4: SOEs in the Philippines
  State Owned Enterprises (SOE) are known in the Philippines as Government-Owned and Controlled Corporations
  (GOCC). According to Table 2 below there are SOE in several markets. The list of GOCC included 193 firms in
  2016 (http://gcg.gov.ph/site/public_files/gcg1461826721.pdf). GOCC are regulated by the 2011 GOCC
  Governance Act (GGA) that was enacted to address governance problems in Philippines ’ SOEs. Section 2 of the
  GCA explicitly establishes that GOCCs are government tools for economic development: “the State recognizes the
  potential of government-owned or -controlled corporations (GOCCs) as significant tools for economic
  development” and “is thus the policy of the State to actively exercise its ownership rights in GOCCs and to promote
  growth by ensuring that operations are consistent with national development policies and programs.”
  Section 3 of GCA defines GOOCs as “any agency organized as a stock or nonstock corporation, vested with
  functions relating to public needs whether governmental or proprietary in nature, and owned by the Government
  of the Republic of the Philippines directly or through its instrumentalities either wholly or, where applicable as in
  the case of stock corporations, to the extent of at least a majority of its outstanding capital stock.” GOCC could
  have related corporations:
                Subsidiaries: are those corporations where at least a majority of the outstanding capital stock is
                 owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, by the GOCC.
                Affiliates: a corporation fifty percent (50%) or less of the outstanding capital stock of which is
                 owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by the GOCC.
  GOCC policies are formulated and implemented by the GOCC Commission on Governance (GCG), and office
  attached to the Office of the President (Section 5). The mandate of the GCG includes, among others, to:
               Evaluate the performance and determine the relevance of the GOCC, to ascertain whether such
                GOCC should be reorganized, merged, streamlined, abolished or privatized, in consultation with the
                department or agency to which a GOCC is attached (Section 5.a)
               Classify GOCCs into (1) Developmental/Social Corporations; (2) Proprietary Commercial
                Corporations; (3) Government Financial, Investment and Trust Institutions; (4) Corporations with
                Regulatory Functions; and (5) Others as may be classified by the GCG (Section 5.b).
               Adopt ownership and operations manuals as well as the government corporate standards governing
                GOCCs (Section 5.c)
  New GOCCs could be established under “The Corporation Code of the Philippines” by submitting a proposal to
  the GCG for review and recommendation to the President for approval (Section 27). The same procedure is required
  for any government agency seeking to purchase a corporation or to acquire controlling interest (Section 28).

 39. In the Philippines, SOEs are present in a number of non-infrastructure sectors where
 private participation is typically possible and economically viable. Of 27 sectors reviewed by
 the PMR, 18 have SOE presence107 (Figure 32), while the average for PMR countries is 14.
 Although the presence of SOEs in infrastructure sectors is not unusual across countries, especially
 in sectors that require capital intensive investments (such as electricity transmission and road
 infrastructure), the government of the Philippines controls at least one firm in 11 out of the 17
 non-infrastructure sectors surveyed. These include, among others, insurance, financial services,

107
   According to the PMR, an SOE is defined as a company in which state or provincial governments (not including
local governments or municipalities) hold, either directly or indirectly through a government-controlled company,
the largest single share of the firm’s equity capital. Public ownership is measured by the extent to which the
government participates and intervenes in markets through the scope and scale of its SOEs. Publicly controlled firms
also include government entities that are not organized as companies, but operate in business or market activities.

                                                                                                                     55
 construction, fabricated metal products, wholesale and retail trade, human health activities, as
 well as restaurants and hotels. Many of these sectors are typically served by the private sector
 only. While these SOEs may be relatively small in terms of market share, their presence questions
 the subsidiary role of the state, i.e. as provider of those goods and services that the private sector
 cannot provide by itself. In addition, restrictions to FDI in most sectors with SOE presence further
 exacerbate the competition effects of the state participation by connecting it to the PMR sub-
 indicator on barriers to trade and investment.

 competitive environment across countries, the Philippine government maintains a dominant
 role in some of these industries. In several of the network sectors – electricity, postal services,
 and railways – the state is the majority shareholder in the largest firm (see Table 6), often holding
 market shares larger than 90 percent. State monopolies are mainly in the electricity distribution
 sector126 and railways that is also characterized by full vertical integration.127

 to private company law.128 Additionally, some strategic choices of SOEs, including mergers,
 equity decisions and restructuring plans must be reviewed and/or cleared in advance by the
 government through the Governance Commission of GOCC.129 On the other hand, key positive
 features counterbalance such restrictions: first, the Philippines’ government does not hold special
 voting rights, such as golden shares, in any SOE. Moreover, the Governance Commission, in
 charge of monitoring and managing the SOEs in the country, 130 is an independent public
 holding.131 Direct governmental influence in the management and business decisions of SOEs is
 often a sub-optimal mean of pursuing policy objectives and tends to negatively affect efficiency,
 due to issues such as conflict of interest or weak incentives. Entrusting management of state equity
 holdings to independent bodies typically results in superior market outcomes.

 42. In addition, a number of SOEs in the Philippines appear to enjoy benefits related to
 access to credit. SOEs sometimes enjoy certain advantages in terms of regulatory enforcement
 (for instance, regarding licenses, regulatory fees, and taxes) or access to financial resources and
 subsidies that make it difficult for the private sector to compete with and may end up crowding
 out efficient private investment.132 This is the case of the Philippines, where SOEs have access to
 loans guaranteed by the state.133

 43. In this context, the effective implementation of the competitive neutrality principle to
 ensure a level playing field for public and private operators becomes particularly relevant.
 Competitive neutrality means that state-owned and private businesses can compete on a level
 playing field. This is an important element of the broad competition policy framework of a
 country and essential to use resources effectively within the economy and thus achieve growth
 and development. While the Competition Law calls for an equal treatment of SOEs and private

              Box 5: Elements for an effective Competitive Neutrality Framework in the Philippines

      Competitive neutrality (CN) can be defined as a principle according to which all enterprises, public or private,
      domestic or foreign, face the same set of rules, and where government’s contact, ownership or involvement in the
      marketplace, in fact or in law, does not confer an undue competitive advantage on any actual or potential market
      participant.135 While there is no universal definition of this concept, there are accepted interpretations of this
      principle. For instance, according to the European Union, CN should be “broadly defined and cover all forms of
      direct and indirect public interventions of whatever nature, which may provide public or private undertakings with
      undue advantages over their actual or potential competitors, thereby distorting the competitive process.” 136

      Competitive neutrality policy initiatives directly foster mechanisms to guarantee no undue market advantage is
      granted to direct government participation in markets. CN policy recognizes that government business activities that
      are in competition with the private sector should not have a competitive advantage merely by virtue of government
      ownership and control. Market advantages in this context manifest in a number of ways. 137

      In practice, CN policy is a regulatory framework (i) within which public and private enterprises face the same set of
      rules and (ii) where contact with the state does not bring competitive advantage to any market participant. 138 CN
      policy is based on the assumption that markets which are competitively neutral foster a level playing field, which
      allows resources to flow to efficient producers, regardless of whether they are privately owned or government
      owned.139 Key analytical elements sustain the implementation, in practice, of an effective CN policy. The CN
      building blocks include, first, the subsidiary role of the State as to that of the private sector, in other words, the state
      should focus on providing those goods and services that the private sector cannot provide by itself; second, the
      control of state support measures to SOE in order to minimize anti-competitive market distortions; and third, the
      specific measures to level the playing field between public and private operators such as the implementation of
      regulatory neutrality or the need for SOEs to achieve a commercial rate of return. (Figure 33)

      In the Philippines, while a general strategy to promote a level playing field between government controlled and
      private enterprises exist, a number of crucial elements to implement such policy are still lacking. These include,
      among others, the need to define commercial and non-commercial services conducted by the government owned
      enterprises in order to be able to differentiate them from an accounting and operational perspective and adjudicate
      costs/revenues accordingly; as well as other issues such as the existence of an overlapping mandate of certain SOEs
      that also act as regulators in key sectors where they compete with private operators (e.g. in maritime ports).
      Moreover, significant differences exist among sectors in terms of regulation/implementation of competitive
      neutrality elements with positive experiences in some of them (notably electricity and banking) that could be
      potentially be leveraged across other sectors. Finally, the lack of a framework to control subsidies/other state support
      measures in order to minimize competition distortions, creates a significant potential for disruption of the level
      playing field between public and private operators.

 44. Although controlling state support measures to SOEs is critical to minimize
 competition distortions, the Philippines lacks a predetermined framework to allocate state
 aid. Beneficiaries that receive state support measure, either public or private, enjoy a comparative
 advantage over their competitors that is not necessarily associated with their efficiency. Control
 of state support measures/subsidies is a necessary safeguard for effective competition, free trade,
 and efficient management of fiscal resources. In particular, state support measures can be used to
 privilege SOEs, damaging long term private sector development.

 45. In this context, an increase in the amount of subsidies that seem to benefit selected
 firms may unlevel the playing field and threaten private sector development. While still
 limited as a share of overall government expenditures, the amount of subsidies received by
 GOCCs has consistently increased in recent years. Subsidies to GOCCs from the government are
 divided in two types: operating subsidies, that are funds released to the GOCC to cover
 operational expenses; and program or project subsidies, that are funds released to GOCCs to
 implement specific policies.140 Operating subsidies amounted to 2 billion PHP in 2014, while the
 main source of subsidies were program funds that amounted to 77 billion PHP.141 The total
 amount of subsidies increased in 2016 to 103 billion PHP, or 4 percent of Philippines’ national
 government expenditures.142 Moreover, statistics generated from the 2012 CPBI show that 56
 product markets across sectors, including manufacturing, agriculture, wholesale/retail, and
 transport/ storage, reported at least one firm receiving a subsidy (equivalent to 9 percent of all
 markets in those sectors). However, in many cases subsidies do not appear to have been granted
 equally to all firms within the market (Box 6, Figure 34). Indeed, in 22 of those industries only
 one firm received a subsidy while more than one firm operated in the market.

                             Box 6: Subsidies granted by the state in the Philippines

      Beyond subsidies granted to SOEs, the discriminatory granting of subsidies by the government to firms more
      generally, including to private players, can lead to an unlevel playing field between competitors and distortions to

      market outcomes including productivity and growth. This includes where such support is granted to selected
      players within a market, especially in a way that does not rely on competitive principles. For example, Aghion et
      al (2015), found that in China the ability of industrial policies (including subsidies, grants and tax holidays) to
      boost productivity growth positively depended on whether the support was allocated to competitive sectors or
      whether the support was designed to foster competition in a sector.

1.2 State involvement in business operations

 46. While the government aims at reducing direct participation in markets, state
 involvement in business operations remains significant. This intermediate indicator is
 calculated as a weighted average of command and control regulations (use of coercive, as
 opposed to incentive-based regulations) and price controls, which are both lower level indicators
 of the PMR index. State involvement may dampen the ability of market players to compete,
 restraining the range of market strategies available to participants. Examples include: entry
 regulations, mandatory standards, quality regulations and prior approvals.143 From a competition
 policy perspective, market-based or incentive-based regulation are preferable to command and
 control regulation. Incentive-based regulations are those that attempt to modify the incentives to
 select specific behaviors. These regulations allow market players to adjust their behavior to
 market circumstances and are less detrimental to market signals.144


143
    Examples captured by the PMR questionnaire include provisions concerning opening hours of shops, maximum
number of hours, minimum number of shut-down days per year, restrictions on inter-professional co-operation (e.g.
partnerships, associations, joint ventures), restrictions on advertising and marketing by professionals.
144
    Examples include allocation of rights and liabilities, competitive public franchising, co-regulation, information
disclosure.


                                                                                                                       63
 47. In the Philippines, coercive regulations are more common than incentive-based
 regulations, particularly in regulated services. Filipino regulators are not required to assess
 alternative regulatory approaches (regulatory and non-regulatory) before adopting new
 regulations.145 In the same line, the government has not issued guidance on the use of alternative
 instruments to traditional regulation. In practical terms, for example, all regulated services
 surveyed by the PMR, i.e. accountants, lawyers, architects and engineers, are restricted in their
 ability to enter into inter-professional cooperation146 as well as to advertise.147 Meanwhile,
 accountants148 and engineers149 have specific limitations in their legal form of business.150

 48. Moreover, the existence of undue price controls for certain products paired with the
 absence of necessary pricing mechanisms in regulated sectors may distort the incentives of
 market operators and affect their ability to compete and provide better quality goods and
 services.151 Price control rules are among the regulatory tools instituted by governments, often
 with the aim of protecting consumers from excessively high prices or protecting the incomes of
 small producers. While regulating prices in natural monopolies might be necessary, in other
 markets price controls tend to have negative effects. Economic theory suggests, however, that
 restrictions to competition and innovation resulting from such policies outweigh their benefits.
 There are a therefore a number of considerations that could be taken by governments when
 assessing whether and how to implement price controls that may help to reduce negative effects
 (Table 7).

    See, Llanto, Gilberto (2015), “Towards an Effective Regulatory Management System: Philippines”, Philippine
Institute for Development Studies, Discussion Paper Series No. 2015-32 at p. 25: “The most common tools used in
assessing the effect of regulatory changes are the usual descriptive analysis and standard cost-benefit analysis.
Regulators will typically undertake a cost-benefit exercise to determine the efficiency and perhaps, distributional
effects of regulatory changes. However, the results of such exercises are neither published nor made available to the
wider public and not even to academics or policy analysts, for scrutiny. The public and affected parties could only
assume that such an exercise has been done prior to issuance of a regulation."

 has enacted broad price controls across sectors in order to target policy goals that might be
 better addressed through less invasive regulatory tools. The Price Act was approved to (i)
 ensure the “availability of basic necessities152 and prime commodities153 at reasonable prices at
 all times, without denying legitimate business a fair return on investment”154 and, to (ii) “to
 provide effective and sufficient protection to consumers against hoarding, profiteering and price

 mandated price ceiling.157 However, economic incentives and less restrictive regulations may be
 better suited than price controls to achieve the policy objectives of the Price Act. For instance, in
 agriculture, measures aimed at attracting long term investment, private investment, capacity
 building and sector specific incentives (such as price and income support, investment support,
 input subsidies, risk management, environmental and agriculture-specific trade measures,
 agricultural innovation policies etc.) typically yield better results to foster productivity, growth
 and sustainability.158 As per the Price Act and other sector-specific regulations, price controls
 exist in a number of markets:

a. Staples: While price controls are mandated only in exceptional circumstances, the Philippines’
   Department of Trade and Industry, regularly enforces the Suggested Retail Prices on Basic
   Necessities and Prime Commodities based on the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the
   Price Act stating that “whenever necessary,” the implementing agency may “issue suggested
   retail Prices”159 and that “The implementing agency may (...) determine, recommend and
   enforce price ceilings.

b. Domestic airfares: The civil Aeronautics Act enables the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) to
   regulate domestic airfares.160 The Board can “fix and determine reasonable individual, joint or
   special rates, charges or fares, which an air carrier may demand, collect or receive for any
   service in connection with air commerce.”

c. Regulated professions: price controls are self-imposed by several professional bodies, thus
   hindering competition in services since the market effects of these practices are similar to cartel
   agreements. 161 This is the case of architects and engineers that set non-binding recommended
   prices.162

157
    Section 7, R.A. No. 7581 (The Price Act), a price ceiling on any basic necessity or prime commodity may be
imposed if any of the following conditions so warrants:
(1) The impendency, existence, or effects of a calamity;
(2) The threat, existence, or effects of an emergency;
(3) The prevalence or widespread acts of illegal price manipulation;
(4) The impendency, existence, or effect of any event that causes artificial and unreasonable increase in the price of
the basic necessity or prime commodity; and
(5) Whenever the prevailing price of any basic necessity or prime commodity has risen to unreasonable levels.”

 50. On the other hand, network sectors with natural monopoly market segments, such as
 telecommunications, lack critical price mechanisms to foster competition through ex ante
 regulation. The ability of the telecommunications regulator, the National Telecommunication
 Commission (NTC) to fix rates has been challenged by the industry operators, in the framework
 of NTC’s attempt to regulate SMS prices 163, the argument being that the Telecommunications
 Act precludes NTC from intervening if a service has “sufficient competition to ensure fair and
 reasonable rates or tariffs.” 164 An over-inclusive interpretation of such provision has resulted in
 the limitation for the NTC to provide much needed efficiency-based pricing mechanisms in
 segments where price regulation is typically desirable for competition, including the regulation
 of local loop unbundling prices165 and international wholesale/retail roaming rates.166

                                  Box 7: Price controls in the Philippines
  Among the possible regulatory tools instituted by governments, price control rules are often adopted in traditional
  monopoly sectors such as utilities (e.g., water and electricity distribution), with the aim of protecting consumers
  from excessively high prices. Nevertheless, government also establishes price controls in other sectors of the
  economy, which are potentially competitive. Economic theory suggests, however, that in most cases the negative
  effects of such policies outweigh the benefits. In general terms, there will be an inefficient allocation of resources
  and high costs for governments to sustain the policy and to tackle the economic consequences. The sections below
  will shed some light on the two types of price control: price ceilings and price floors.
  Price ceilings
  In the Philippines, the Price Act (Republic Act No. 7581, year 1991) lays down the following in Section 7:
  The President, upon the recommendation of the implementation agency, or the price Coordinating Council, may
  impose a price ceiling on any basic necessity or prime commodity if any of the following conditions so warrants:
      1) the impendency, existence, or effects of a calamity;
      2) the threat, existence, or effects of an emergency;
      3) the prevalence or widespread acts of illegal price manipulation;
      4) the impendency, existence, or effect of any event that causes artificial and unreasonable increase in the
          price of the basic necessity or prime commodity; and
      5) whenever the prevailing price of any basic necessity or prime commodity has risen to unreasonable levels.


163
    See, NTC Memorandum Circular no. 02-10-2011 ordering telecommunications firms to reduce Short Messaging
Services (SMS) interconnection charges to P0.15 from P0.35
164
    Section 17, Republic Act No. 7925, otherwise known as the "Public Telecommunications Policy Act of the
Philippines," provides:
          “The Commission shall establish rates and tariffs which are fair and reasonable and which
          provide for the economic viability of telecommunications entities and a fair return on their
          investments considering the prevailing cost of capital in the domestic and international markets.
          The Commission shall exempt any specific telecommunications service from its rate or tariff
          regulations if the service has sufficient competition to ensure fair and reasonable rates or tariffs.
          The Commission shall, however, retain its residual powers to regulate rates or tariffs when
          ruinous competition results or when a monopoly or a cartel or combination in restraint of free
          competition exists and the rates or tariffs are distorted or unable to function freely and the public
          is adversely affected. In such cases, the Commission shall either establish a floor or ceiling on the
          rates or tariffs.”
165
   The NTC does not set prices for local loop unbundling.
166
   Although retail prices of international roaming are required to be approved by the NTC (section 17 of Republic
Act No 7925, year 1995), in practice the regulator does not impose price ceiling on retail and wholesale access
charges.

                                                                                                                      67
This provision entails what economic theory calls price ceilings. The government may be willing to set price
ceilings, which prevent prices from exceeding a certain maximum, for those goods and services that are believed
to be sold at a price that is excessive. However, the policy might generate counterproductive effects. Indeed, when
the ceiling is placed below the price that would otherwise arise in the market under normal competitive conditions,
then there would be a lack of supply or excess demand. That is, producers will not produce as much at the lower
price, while consumers will demand more because the goods are cheaper. Therefore, this type of price policy, very
common in the agriculture sector as well as in the utilities, might lead to reduced production that would harm
consumers rather than be beneficial to them. Moreover, those producers who are willing to differentiate their
products, offering higher quality or more innovative goods, are discouraged to do so as they will not be able to
charge higher prices to cover for the higher costs. In addition, price ceilings present a further drawback: The price
set as price ceiling by the government is likely to become the focal price. Therefore, low-cost producers that would
be willing to charge a lower price and serve the most price sensitive part of the demand will nevertheless charge
the price at the ceiling level, thereby harming consumers as well as competition in the market.
In the Philippines, although the price ceiling provision specifies some emergency situations when the Act should
be applied (for instance, crisis situations, major imbalance between demand and supply, and obvious market
malfunctioning), it also allows discretion to the government to apply price ceilings, such as when the prevailing
price of any basic necessity or prime commodity has risen to unreasonable levels. Also, the law does not state a
maximum period for the applications and re-evaluation of the need for price controls. In practice, the Philippines’
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) regularly enforces the Suggested Retail Prices on Basic Necessities and
Prime Commodities that set the price across a variety of products. Furthermore, the decision on the prices to be
regulated does not entail any opinion of the Competition Authority regarding market conditions that could merit
temporary price controls. In other countries, such as Romania, the competition law requires the government to seek
the competition authority’s advisory opinion before instituting price -control measures. This requirement ensures
that government interventions do not run counter to the competition policy objectives, and that the policy option
selected is the 'least restrictive' for competition in the market. Nevertheless, the PCC has started to review suggested
retail prices in coordination with the DTI.
It is also important to highlight that the participation of the industry in determining maximum prices by the
government creates platforms that encourage price and cost information exchange among competitors, facilitating
the creation of instruments that can later facilitate cartels.
Price floors
Price floors are the lowest legal price at which goods or services can be sold. The reasoning behind governments
imposing price floors is to prevent prices from being too low. For example, in the agriculture sector, price floors
could be justified on the ground of protecting farmers from unfavorable harvesting conditions in special situations.
Another sector where minimum prices are introduced is professional services. In this case, minimum price
limitations are often justified by professional associations due to the intention of maintaining certain quality
standards in the provision of the services that would be impaired with extremely vigorous price competition. In the
Philippines, architects and engineers set non-binding recommended prices.
Price floors have drawbacks and the impact of such price regulations should be carefully evaluated. In fact,
imposing minimum prices above the market-equilibrium price is likely to translate into higher prices for consumers
and to generate unserved demand that could have been cleared at the market-equilibrium price. Moreover,
minimum prices restrain competition as producers are unable to compete over the price dimension.

Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to eliminate guidelines for suggested retail prices.

 As in Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam,167 in the Philippines there are laws that allow the
 government to establishes price controls in markets. So-called suggested retail prices are
 proposed for 22 products by the National Price Coordinating Council of the DTI.168 The
 Philippine Competition Act does not have explicitly require mandatory consultations from the
 DTI to the PCC when setting price controls. However, building on its advocacy mandate, the PCC
 expressed concerns regarding the current practice of approving guidelines on suggested retail
 prices as they may facilitate price coordination among sellers to the detriment of consumers thus
 enabling anti-competitive conduct under the Competition Act. To address such concerns, the PCC
 is in the process of drafting a Memorandum of Understanding with the DTI in order to partner for
 the promotion of an effective competition policy in the Philippines.169

 52. An effect-based classification of the regulatory restrictions identified under the state
 control sub-indicator of the PMR show a prevalence of rules that discriminate or protect
 vested interest followed by a number of rules that are conducive to collusive outcomes. Table
 8 builds on the WBG MCPAT to offer a non-exhaustive list of regulatory restrictions related to
 state control in product markets and explores the connection between the potential lifting each
 restriction and other factors to be considered beyond PMR.

2. Barriers to market entry and rivalry

 53.     Barriers to market entry and rivalry are a leading contributor to the restrictiveness
 of the economy-wide PMR score for the Philippines. Restrictions captured by this sub-indicator
 include (i) regulations that are likely to make entry costlier, forcing potential market participants
 to stay out of the market, with a special focus on start-ups and (ii) regulations that distort the level
 playing field in the market.170 While the Philippines’s score is slightly higher the PMR country
 average in the Barriers to Entrepreneurship sub-indicator (indicating slightly more restrictive
 regulations), it remains well-above the level of comparator countries such as Romania, Chile, and
 Poland (see Figure 35). This is mainly due to the existing administrative barriers on corporations
 and FDI as well as the barriers in network and services sectors. Figure 36 decomposes the
 indicator on barriers to market entry and rivalry, i.e. barriers to entrepreneurship as per the PMR
 methodology, into intermediate and low-level components.

   Following the PMR methodology, barriers to entrepreneurship include aspects such as license and permit system,
communication and simplification of rules and procedures, administrative burdens for corporations, administrative
burdens for sole proprietor firms, barriers in services sectors, legal barriers to entry, antitrust exemptions, and
barriers in network services.

2.1 Administrative burdens on startups

 54. High administrative burden on start-ups makes it costly for firms to enter the market.
 While sole proprietor firms are required to contact only four different bodies (public or private)
 to register, corporations require to contact a total of 10 bodies, three in the pre-registration phase
 and seven for registration and at least 35 days to complete their registration, as compared to an
 average in EAP countries of seven procedures and 23.9 days.171 These include, among others,
 the registration of the company name,172 obtaining a permit from the local government to
 operate,173 and opening a bank account to pay the relevant fees and deposit the minimum capital
 requirement.174

 55. Although relevant steps are being undertaken to implement a one-stop shop for
 business registration, the difficulty of starting a business is confirmed by the WBG Doing

    The Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires the submission of a Treasurer’s Affidavit stating that "at
least twenty-five (25%) percent of the authorized capital stock of the corporation has been subscribed, and at least
twenty-five (25%) of the total subscription has been fully paid to him in actual cash and/or in property the fair
valuation of which is equal to at least twenty-five (25%) percent of the said subscription" (Section 14, The

 Business indicator. In 2017 the Philippines ranked 171th out of 190 economies in Starting a
 Business, falling 7 places in relation to 2016 (ranked 164th). The forthcoming implementation of
 the Philippine Business Registry175 (PBR) will be key to integrate the business registration
 processes of five (5) national government line agencies, namely the Department of Trade and
 Industry (DTI), the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), the Home Development Mutual Fund
 (Pag-IBIG), the Philippine Health Insurance Corp (Philhealth), and the Social Security System
 (SSS). The PBR program is expected to ease doing business in the Philippines as applicants will
 no longer need to register their businesses in all 5 agencies, thereby reducing incidental expenses
 and increasing cost savings by cutting red tape.

2.2 Complexity of regulatory procedures

 restrictions related to the complexity of regulatory procedures. For instance, the “silence is

 consent rule,” a key element to foster administrative efficiency does not exist in the Philippines.181
 This mechanism is crucial to speed up resolutions for the benefit of firms and citizens. For firms,
 mainly those intending to enter the market, having a silence is consent rule allows for a reduction
 in uncertainty on the delays of the administration to issue licenses and permits. In turn, this rule
 reduces the protection of incumbents as they will be exposed to more competition.

2.3 Regulatory protection of incumbents

 58. Lack of a regulatory framework to enable access in network sectors appear to be
 insulating incumbents from competition. For instance, in telecommunications unbundling of
 the local loop is not required although it is relevant for broadband access;182 in railways, entry is
 franchised to a single firm and there is no vertical separation between operation of railroad
 infrastructure and the provision of railway services;183 and in electricity, there is no vertical
 separation in generation, distribution and supply. 184 Moreover, legal barriers restricting the
 number of competitors allowed in the market are pervasive across transport sub-sectors including
 road freight,185 maritime transport,186 operation of air transport infrastructure187 and railways.188

 59. While the Competition Act applies to all firms across sectors, including SOEs, the
 potential to grant broad exclusions may be used to favor market incumbents. Following
 international experience, the competition law should apply to all sectors and firms engaged in an
 economic activity. The absence of exemptions in the Competition Act of the Philippines is a key
 element to avoid the regulatory insulation of incumbents.189 However, the existence of a
 forbearance clause that enables the PCC to exempt specific practices or even sectors from the

    The general rule is that a written approval/license must be issued. There is no specific law allowing implicit
consent by the administration in case of legal deadlines expire.

from applying the provisions of this Act, for a limited time, in whole or in part, in all or specific cases, on an entity
or group of entities, if in its determination:
(a) Enforcement is not necessary to the attainment of the policy objectives of this Act;
(b) Forbearance will neither impede competition in the market where the entity or group of entities
seeking exemption operates nor in related markets; and
(c) Forbearance is consistent with public interest and the benefit and welfare of the consumers.
A public hearing shall be held to assist the Commission in making this determination.
The Commission’s order exempting the relevant entity or group of entities und er this section shall be made public.
Conditions may be attached to the forbearance if the Commission deems it appropriate to ensure the long-term
interest of consumers. In the event that the basis for the issuance of the exemption order ceases to be valid, the order
may be withdrawn by the Commission.”

3. Barriers to trade and investment
61. Barriers to trade and investment limit foreign participation in key sectors of the
economy, including utilities and regulated services. Although barriers to trade and investment
have the smallest weight in the overall PMR score for the Philippines, this value is still twice as
high as the average of the PMR countries, and larger than comparator countries such as Chile,
Poland, and Romania. This score is mainly driven by the existence of significant barriers to FDI
and differential treatment of foreign suppliers. In contrast, other restrictions captured by this sub-
indicator such as tariff barriers and barriers to trade facilitation appear to be relatively low.

 Investment Act194 and several Executive Orders195 limited foreign investment in a number of
 industries typically open to FDI including all utilities as well as retail, restaurants and hotels
 (Table 11). These restrictions have affected the capacity of key sectors to attract the necessary
 capital, especially for large infrastructure projects, and triggered SOE presence in most of these
 sectors, thus making their development dependent on the financial strength to the government.

                            Box 8: Patterns of foreign capitalization in the Philippines

 According to statistics generated from the CPBI 2012, across manufacturing, agriculture, wholesale/retail, and
 transport/storage sectors, the average proportion of firms with some foreign capitalization is 13 percent. The
 proportion of markets with at least one firm with foreign capitalisation is 51 percent overall, although this differs
 amongst sectors with transport/storage, and agriculture being the lowest at 15 percent and 43 percent repectively
 (Box Figure 40). The average aggregate market share of firms with some foreign capitalizaiton is lowest in
 agriculture and wholesale/retail (with 29 percent and 24 percent respectively)196. The average firm-level foreign
 capitalization across markets is lowest in agriculture and transport/storage (with 50 percent and 45 percent
 respectively).197

 63. Moreover, these statutory limits on foreign investment have unduly influenced
 secondary legislation in sectors not strictly reserved for Filipino companies, such as
 construction. Republic Act 4566 (Contractor’s License Law) from 1965 establishes that all
 contractors, including sub-contractors and specialty contractors are required by law to secure a
 license from the Philippine Contractors Accreditation Board (PCAB) before engaging in
 construction contracting in the Philippines. Section 3.1 of the Implementing Rules and
 Regulations of RA 4566, indicate that the regular licenses are reserved only to constructor-firms
 of Filipino sole proprietorship, or corporations with at least 60% Filipino equity participation.
 Foreign firms may obtain “special licenses” but only for a single specific project. Despite the fact
 that the Court of Appeals suspended the regulations, the PCAB has not made any changes in their
 own interpretation and they act as if the restriction would remain in place. In 2013, the PCAB
 created a special AAAA category that requires a PHP 1 billion (USD 20 million) equity to set up
 a 100% foreign owned construction company. However, as of December 2016, the PCAB
 contractor listing does not include any firms under this category.

 64. These types of restrictions to FDI in construction markets have crippled potential
 growth in the sector. As compared to its ASEAN neighbors the Philippines attracts the lowest
 amount of FDI in the construction sector at US$ 6.1 million in 2014, compared to US$ 457.3
 million in Vietnam, US$ 265.2 million in Malaysia and US$ 140.2 million in Lao PDR.
 Construction services constitutes only 1.5% of total FDI into the country, compared with 15.4%
 in Lao PDR and 5% in Vietnam.198 Moreover, construction costs in Manila tend to be higher than
 those of other ASEAN countries, except for much wealthier Singapore.199 In this context,
 conservative estimations point towards a loss of at least US$ 108 million on potential additional
 FDI in the construction sector due to these regulatory restrictions. Absent these regulatory
 barriers, services carried out by foreign contractors in the commercial, industrial and residential

Scenario 1 is based on the following assumptions:
     Benchmark Special Economic Zones: Coefficient (2%) taken from 2014 and 2015 share of construction
        FDI among total FDI in the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) (2 - 6%)
     This scenario offers a conservative estimation as this is a lower bound of the share over the past few
        years and more importantly, only 2 % of requested special licenses for foreign firms were granted in the
        first half of 2016 suggesting that potential participation of foreign firms could be much higher were
        other regulatory restrictions not in place.
     Caveat: the figure does not reflect how far domestic investment would be crowded out, versus additional
        total investment generated through FDI. However, given that the restriction is likely to imply a certain
        degree of market power and leave some demand unmet, there seems to be scope to increase the total size
        of the market through FDI.

Scenario 2:
     Benchmark APEC: Coefficient (3.64%) taken from average shares of construction in FDI among ASEAN
        countries (Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam)
     This scenario offers a conservative estimate as some of the other ASEAN countries also have a restrictive
        regulatory framework towards foreign firms in place. The percentage of construction in FDI in ASEAN
        countries that exhibit a liberal regulatory stance (Lao, Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia, Cambodia) lies at
        4.68%.

The methodology:
     Benchmark of PPP contracts: Coefficient (17.5%) is taken from the 2015 share total value of PPP contracts
        exclusively executed by foreign contractors (33%) multiplied by the share of the construction segment
        where foreign entry is most likely (namely the commercial, industrial and residential condominium
        construction segment, based on construction permits (53%) with the latest available data (2011)).
     It is a conservative estimate since the chosen coefficient does not reflect the additional share of PPP
        contracts in which both, foreign and domestic contractors participated: 64% nor the rest of the private
        construction sector, where foreign entry could also be possible: 47%

          Caveat: This figure does not reflect how far domestic sales (contract value) would be crowded out, versus
           additional total sales generated by foreign contractors. See arguments above on why the market size may
           expand.

 The methodology:
      Benchmark ASEAN: Controlling for income per capital in each country, the average prices (in USD per
         sqm) are 128% percent higher than in comparator countries in ASEAN despite having lower labor costs.
         If prices were to adjust to similar levels as in comparator countries, this would imply a 44% reduction of
         current price levels. This coefficient is multiplied by the potential value of foreign contractor sales in the
         relevant segment as estimated above.
      It is a conservative estimate since it is most likely that the cost savings to the private sector would not only
         occur on those projects executed by foreign firms, but that prices charged by domestic firms may also
         adjust.
      Caveat: more intense competition does not only have an effect on prices, but moreover on the price/quality
         ratio. Thus, foreign firms may opt to compete with domestic firms on quality rather than price. However,
         the increased welfare accruing to consumers/customers will be of similar nature

 65. One of the most remarkable achievements of the PCC throughout the past 2 years has
 been the comprehensive advocacy campaign undertaken to emphasize the competition
 impact of regulatory restrictions in the construction sector. The PCC issued an opinion
 through the policy note “Anti-Competitive Effects of Regulatory Restrictions: The Case of the
 Construction Sector” to raise public awareness on the losses due to lack of competition in the
 sector. In parallel, the PCC participated as amicus curiae in the Supreme Court case assessing the
 legitimacy of these restrictions as competition policy champion. This advocacy strategy has
 yielded significant results towards the lifting of existing restrictions in the sector as well as
 developing a competition culture in the Philippines.200

 local firms on the basis of Section 12 of Article XII of the Constitution.201 Allowing national and
 foreign firms to compete only on the merits—without favoring one over the other—typically has
 a positive impact on public expenses. Therefore, a number of countries have implemented reforms
 that reduce explicit access discrimination in favor of local firms. However, in the Philippines, the
 public procurement regulatory framework202 not only restricts tenders in public utilities to
 Filipino companies with at least 60 percent of national capital but, in those markets where foreign
 companies are allowed to participate, it favors local bidders with a bidding price up to a bidding
 price 15 percent higher.203 According to PMR results, this benefits are the exception rather than
 the rule, as Figure 41 below shows.

 67. As per the restrictions associated with trade facilitation, while the lack of Mutual
 Recognition Agreements (MRAs) create barriers to trade facilitation, the Philippines have
 made an effort to adopt internationally harmonized standards and certification procedures
 in most sectors. MRAs are bilateral agreements that aim to benefit industry by providing easier
 access to conformity assessment. When present, they promote trade in goods between the
 countries and facilitate market access. Out of 17 sectors surveyed by the PMR, MRAs exist only
 in 6 of them (manufacturing, road transport, accounting, engineering and architecture), as
 compared to an average of 8 for countries in the PMR sample and 13 in the case of OECD
 members.204 Conversely, in 15 of these sectors internationally harmonized standards and
 certification procedures have been adopted with the only exceptions pertaining to legal and
 architecture business services.205

Recognition of Domestic Driving Licenses issued by ASEAN countries (1985); in accountancy the ASEAN Mutual

III.    Designing a road map for pro-competition reform for the
        Philippines
 69. The regulatory
                                   Figure 42: Distribution of specific restrictions by MCPAT
 restrictions identified in                 category and PMR pillar classification
 the previous section
 offer a critical input to
 understand the negative
 effects     of     existing
 regulations      in     the
 Philippine markets. An
 effect based analysis
 following the MCPAT
 categorization shows that
 almost half of the
 restrictions identified by
 the PMR are related to
 regulations            that
 discriminate and protect
 vested     interests.    As
 shown in Figure 42, 49%
 of the restrictions belong
 to the category rules that
 discriminate and protect
 vested interests, 29% are
 related to the rules that are conducive to collusive outcomes or increase costs to compete in the
 market, and 21%, to the rules that reinforce dominance or limit entry. Out of these, the two sub-
 typologies more common are restrictions related to the lack of competitive neutrality vis a vis
 government entities and restrictions on the type of products and services/format and location.
 Finally, the MCPAT effect-based classification shows that “rules that are conducive to collusive
 outcomes or increase costs to compete in the market” and “rules that discriminate and protect
 vested interests” are mostly comprised by restriction that lie in the state control pillar and barriers
 to trade and investment. In particular, 54% of the restrictions that can be identified as favorable
 to collusive behavior and costs of competition are related to the state control pillar.

 70. However, this long list of restrictions needs to be contextualized within the market
 dynamics of each industry in order to map potential pro-competition reforms according to
 their impact as well as their feasibility. This sequenced methodology is embodied in the
 different stages of the MCPAT developed by the World Bank Group building upon competition
 policy work carried out in more than 60 countries, across regions, as well as international
 experience and best practices. The MCPAT is a tool that goes beyond a diagnostic stage providing
 an overall strategy for practitioners on how to help market perform better by using competition
 instruments (Figure 43).

 71. While a full-blown analysis according to the MCPAT methodology is beyond the
 scope of this note, the remaining of this section contains snap shots of key sectors covered
 by the PMR to give a sense of priorities for regulatory reform both sector-specific as well as
 economy wide. A more detailed analysis on the basis of the MCPAT applied to the Philippine
 markets will be developed by the World Bank Group team as part of the engagement with the
 PCC.


1. Sector-specific competition snap shots

1.1 Electricity

 72. While the electricity sector has undergone significant changes in recent years
 following the entry into force of a new regulatory framework, the implementation of key
 reforms is still pending. The Electric Power Industry Reform Act (EPIRA) of 2001 fully
 restructured the legal and institutional framework of the electricity sector. Specifically, the law
 provided for:

     the privatization of the state-owned generation and transmission entity, the National
      Power Corporation (NPC);

                                                    88
Report for comments, not for circulation


     the creation of the transmission company TransCo to assume the transmission assets and
       functions of NPC;
     the creation of the Power Sector Asset and Liabilities Management Corporation to own
       TransCo and other NPC assets;
     the creation of a Wholesale Electricity Spot Market;
     the establishment of Open Access for competitive consumers.
 However, concerns remain regarding the speed of implementation for the reforms mandated by
 EPIRA, notably on the need of compliance of the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) with
 the implementation of open access provisions and competition in retail.

 73. Following the reforms promoted by the EPIRA, the structure of the different market
 segments evolved under the supervision of an independent sector regulator. The electricity
 sector of the Philippines is comprised by three separate sub-sectors, each with its own industry
 structure. First, the opening of the generation sector to competition resulted in 116 power
 generation plants that sell to distributors through the main national transmission grid. In
 generation, the EPIRA limits the market shares of a single entity to a maximum of 30 percent of
 each of the island grids, and/or a 25 percent market share of the national grid.206 The Energy
 Regulatory Commission has actively monitored the implementation of these limitations.207
 Second, the transmission sector is run by the National Transmission Corporation, whose
 management has been awarded to a private firm, the National Grid Corporation of the
 Philippines.208 Finally, the distribution segment is comprised by a hybrid of different corporations
 that have each been awarded monopoly licenses to distribute electricity to a specific franchise
 area. Currently, the distribution sector includes a large private utility operator (Manila Electric
 Company), 16 smaller privately owned utilities, 7 municipal systems and 119 member-owned
 electric cooperatives.209

 74. The separation between different market segments has not been fully achieved yet.
 The EPIRA forbids cross-ownership between the segments of transmission and generation as well
 as transmission and distribution. However, implementation remains unclear.210 While the
 operation of transmission network was granted through a concession to the National Grid
 Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP), some complaints have been raised regarding third party

Generating Capacity” of Republic Act No. 9136 (EPIRA).

1.2 Telecommunications

 76. In general, the telecommunications industry has maintained a high level of market
 concentration around two prominent operators: PLTD and Globe Telecom. These two
 companies operate in all segments, i.e. fixed-line, mobile telecommunications and broadband
 services provision. Given the ownership structure, each market is actually duopolistic. In the fixed
 line market, Globe Telecom operates through its company Innove; and in the mobile market,
 PDLT operates under the name of Smart. Between 2000 and 2015, telecommunication penetration
 shows different trends depending on the service. A low and slightly decreasing trend is shown in
 the case of fixed-line services, but a rapid and steady increase is observed in the case of mobile
 services (see Figure 46). The popularity and teledensity of mobile services can be attributed to
 cheaper mobile phone sets and increased use of smartphones, which also would explain the sharp
 increase in the share of individuals using the Internet since 2009. Moreover, Figure 46 also shows
 two important events that influenced the market trends: the market disruption provoked by Sun
 Cellular, a company from Digitel that entered the market in 2003 offerings highly competitive
 plans; and its acquisition by PLDT in 2011. The number of subscription lines grew as much as
 318 percent between 2003 and 2011, showing an average yearly growth rate of 23.1 percent;
 between 2011 and 2015, the average yearly growth rate was only 5.8 percent.

From Figure 49, between 2005 and 2015, Myanmar, Timor-Leste and Mongolia show a significant improvement in terms
of market concentration, Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI index); those countries that performed worse than the EAP
average in 2005 allowed for further competition that led to lower concentration indexes than the region average,
particularly in the case of Mongolia, in 2015. On the other hand, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia and Philippines
increased their market concentration between those years. Philippines remains the only country in the region where market
concentration rose from a relatively low HHI level to over the 5000 HHI level, mainly due to several mergers and
acquisitions among telecommunications companies.

 78. Lack of regulatory powers of the National Telecommunications Commission to
 foster competitive market conditions have resulted in suboptimal market outcomes. In
 the Philippines, the price of mobile phone services is among the highest in the region and four
 times higher than average OECD countries (Figure 53 right). mobile internet prices are three
 times higher than average OECD countries.215 Based on information of the International
 Telecommunications Union (ITU) price baskets for 2014, mobile phone services in
 Philippines cost around 3.8% of the GNI per capita, larger than the 3.12% in Vietnam (that
 has almost half GNI pc), the 1.69% in Indonesia (that has similar GNI pc), and the 1.2% as
 EAP average. In fixed broadband, market penetration is half of average OECD country and
 among the lowest in the region, and prices are nearly seven times higher than the average
 OECD country and the third most expensive in the region (Figure 53 left). Philippines also
 show a lower broadband and mobile quality in terms of speed connection “its average speed
 is 16% that of the highest average speed, South Korea, and 21% that of the highest peak speed,
 Singapore.”216 Limited regulatory capacity of the NTC has prevented important pro-
 competition reforms such as number portability, unbundling of the local loop, or the
 development of mechanisms for the efficient allocation of spectrum.217

 79. In this setup, addressing those restrictions that increase inefficiencies of service
 provision and/or reinforce market power would be key to embed competition in the
 sector:
          a. Unregulated local-loop unbundled access prices, i.e. discretional access prices
             for broadband service provision, not only increase the provision costs of

             b. High switching costs related to lack of number portability reduce consumer
                welfare. Companies currently compete to attract customers through discounts
                or different service bundles at the expense of higher provision cost that later
                result in higher prices once consumers are locked-in.219

 80. Given general concerns in the sector, the PCC has adopted a proactive role to
 embed competition principles through advocacy. The sale of San Miguel Corporation
 assets, largely due to FDI restrictions that prevented the group from raising the necessary
 capital to expand their network nationwide,220 offered the PCC an opportunity to raise
 awareness on the importance of competition conditions in access to essential facilities. The
 main asset to be acquired as a result of San Miguel transaction was spectrum in the 700MHZ
 band.221 The 700 MHz is one of the most efficient bands as its excellent propagation
 characteristics make it an ideal technology for broadband (particular to rural and remote areas)
 in terms of both reach and cost of rollout. Therefore, the allocation of this band is typically
 considered a highly valued resource that is commonly granted by the Government under
 specific regulatory conditions, one of which is precisely to require prior authorization for
 transfer it to third parties. The PCC has engaged with the government as well as the telecom
 regulator to explore the use of auctions in order to promote competition for the market and the
 efficient allocation of scarce resources.

1.3 Transport

 81. Restrictions in transport sectors appear to impair logistics in the Philippines .
 Given the archipelagic nature of the country, the transport infrastructure, especially maritime,
 is key for firms to efficiently move goods across locations, and for consumers to get goods at
 adequate prices. However, restrictions on cabotage in road freight and air transport paired with
 FDI limitations to invest in infrastructure appear to have stifled competition in logistics. Along
 these lines, the WBG Logistics Performance Index places the Philippines below the average
 of countries in the PMR sample in terms of customs, tracking and tracing and logistics quality
 and competence and specially infrastructure, the lowest scoring dimesntion for the
 Philippines.

    In the postpaid services, the two main companies (PLDT and Globe) have been using strategies such as
subsidized mobile devices, additional free minutes and SMS as services’ rewards (also for prepaid consumers),
reward points that once accumulated can be exchanged by other products, bundled voice-data-cable services,
among others (Patalinghug et. al., 2017).

 82. In air transport, regional agreements (e.g., ASEAN Multilateral Agreement on Air
 Services 2009) have not fully eliminated regulatory restraints. In the mid-90s, the
 liberalization of the sector started with Executive Order No. 219. 222 This instrument allowed
 for new entrants to challenge the monopolistic position of Philippine Airlines, the national
 flag carrier and sole airline for domestic and international routes under the one-airline
 policy.223 Executive Order No. 29 issued on 14 March 2011 unilaterally provided a pocket
 Open Skies policy to all airports outside the capital, Manila.224 In addition, the Philippines has
 bilateral air transport agreements with at least 36 countries and territories225 and the
 government continues to negotiate bilateral air transport agreements with other countries to
 increase the allowed capacities for foreign airlines to offer flights into Philippine airports, as
 well as to promote greater access by Filipino carriers into foreign airports. While the
 Philippines does not have an open skies agreement with the United States (US) 226 regional
 agreements such as the one signed with ASEAN have been critical to limit government
 interference in the commercial decisions of air carriers about routes, capacity, and pricing,
 freeing them to provide more affordable, convenient, and efficient air service for

    Philippine Airlines became a monopoly in domestic air travel in 1974 under the Marcos administration.

    It provides that: “the Philippine Air Panels may offer and promote third, fourth, and fifth freedom rights to
the country's airports other than the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) without restriction as to
frequency, capacity and type of aircraft, and other arrangements that will serve the national interest as may be
determined by the CAB.”
225
    The Philippines has agreements with the following countries: Australia, Ethiopia, India, Oman, Russia, South
Korea, Turkey, and US. It also has agreements with the EU (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech
Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania,
Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and the UK)
and ASEAN countries (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore,
Thailand, and Vietnam).
226
    The PMR methodology uses the existence of an open skies agreement with the US as a benchmark indicator.
Open skies agreements with other countries are not included in this methodology. This does not imply that a
country should have open skies agreements only with the US.

 consumers.227 However, cabotage rights for foreign carriers are not included in these regional
 agreements and price regulation in the sector persists as the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB)
 can regulate domestic airfares.228

 83. In maritime transport infrastructure, lack of separation between commercial
 interests and regulatory functions of the port regulator, the Philippine Ports Authority’s
 (PPA), may result in a discriminatory application of rules that puts private operators at
 disadvantage. Cumulative roles of the PPA as the main developer, operator, and regulator of
 ports, which develops, owns, maintains, and regulates its own ports while being responsible
 for awarding contracts to private terminal and cargo handling operators have limited
 competition in port operations.

 84. Domestic shipping in the country is generally more expensive than in Malaysia or
 Indonesia and exhibits concentrated market structures. The average port-to-port cost per
 nautical mile in the Philippines is $1.47, higher than Indonesia’s $0.77 and Malaysia’s $1.36.
 Among the causes of the poor state of the domestic shipping industry appeared to be the
 constraints on market competition. Few operators served most shipping routes, with over 40
 percent of routes served by a single operator. While some market concentration is likely due
 to market factors such as economies of scale in shipping operations, the threat of potential
 entry of competitors is often the major force driving the market behavior in the industry.
 Moreover, prior to 2015, incumbents had to give their consent for new entry in the routes they
 were serving. 229

 85. In railways, the presence of a monopolistic SOE, paired with lack of separation
 between the operation of infrastructure and the provision of railway services (actual
 transport of passengers or freight in inter-urban rail) remain a key constraint for further
 development in the sector. The state-owned Philippine National Railways (PNR) is the sole
 operator of the most extensive intra-island railway on Luzon, the largest island in the country.
 PNR used to operate over 797 km (495 miles) of route, however, various problems continue
 to plague the operation of PNR due to neglect and damage from natural disasters which
 reduced PNR's efficiency and railroad coverage, and the persistent problems with informal
 settlers contributed further to PNR's decline and consequently PNR’s very poor revenue
 collection. Whereas legal separation exists in this sector in the majority of countries in the
 PMR data set, in the Philippines, there is no separation between railway services and
 infrastructure, and the regulator cannot issue or revoke operating licenses. Legal separation
 typically encourages new entrants to operate rolling stock and provide services (e.g., under
 concession agreements) on the basis of regulatory frameworks that clearly define access and
 access charges.

 86. In road transport, the most significant transport mode in the Philippines, key
 regulatory restrictions remain in place. Road transport accounts for 58 per cent of cargo
 traffic in a country in which though water transport plays an important role due to the

 archipelagic nature of the country.230 While road cargo is characterized by a large number of
 small firms providing basic transportation services, PMR data indicates a number of
 regulatory restrictions mainly due to entry barriers. Trucks require a license to operate in the
 market which requires interaction with eight government agencies.231 Filipino citizenship and
 hauling contracts are also required to establish a business in national road freight services. 232
 Moreover, participation of foreign firms in tenders for government transport is restricted.
 Foreign bidders are only eligible to participate in order to prevent a restraints of trade when:
 (a) a treaty or executive agreement allows them; (2) reciprocity rights exist; and (3) goods are
 not available locally.233

1.4 Professional services

 87. Entry and perforce restrictions affect competition conditions in professional
 services, thus raising the costs of a key input across sectors.

      cases prescribed by law (e.g., reciprocity and qualification procedures). 234All four
      professional services surveyed by the PMR require licensing by the state or a public
      authority to access the profession235 following a compulsory professional examination.236
      Furthermore, membership in professional associations is required for lawyers, accountants
      and architects.237

 b) Advertising is restricted for accountants, architects and engineers. The ability of firms to
    advertise can help promote improvements in the quality of professional services, and
    overcome the information asymmetries inherent in these industries. Regulatory bans
    prohibiting the conduct of certain activities, such as the ban on advertising of professional
    services, may restrict competitive options of new firms and make it more difficult for firms
    to challenge incumbent firms. The regulations pertaining to the marketing of professional
    services in the Philippines are overseen by the respective boards of each profession;
    therefore, the prohibitions are different for each profession. While Philippines-based
    accountants and engineers are only forbidden from placing ads that make exaggerated
    claims about themselves or remarks that are disparaging to the profession, lawyers and
    architects are faced with more stringent bans on the use of paid advertisements to solicit
    clients.238 In contrast, the majority of countries in the PMR database do not regulate
    advertising in the engineering and architecture professions and only regulate (but not
    prohibit) advertising in the accounting profession.

 c) Lawyers and accountants are granted a number of exclusive or shared exclusive rights
    above the average of the PMR data set. (Figure 57)

 d) Pricing guidelines exist for lawyers, engineers and architects. The legal profession has
    regulated minimum prices, while non-binding pricing guidelines are provided to engineers
    and architects.239 Since the market effects of these practices are similar to cartel
    agreements, competition policy reforms in the professional service sector across countries
    have been consistently identified to yield large economic benefits by boosting productivity
    while not affecting quality or professional standards. Wider use of professional services
    implies higher productivity across sectors, where average labor productivity of firms that
    use accounting and legal professional services is 10 to 45 percent higher than that of firms
    that do not.240

2. Making markets work more efficiently
 88. Reducing regulatory restrictiveness in key markets would require a number of
 reforms aimed at:

 tackling unclear or restrictive regulation in the infrastructure sectors and
  professional services to create more competitive conditions, with positive effects for
  downstream markets.
 eliminating restrictions on foreign investors vis-à-vis the domestic ones as well as
  among domestic investors in sectors where such regulatory restrictions create an
  uneven level playing field.
 minimizing the scope of controlled prices to create the right incentives for firms to
  compete.
 reducing the involvement of the state through SOEs and other operations particularly
  in typically competitive markets and ensuring competitive neutrality among public

 streamlining burdensome administrative procedures for businesses to facilitate easy

IV.      Quantifying potential benefits of increased competition
 90. Pro-competition reforms in services sectors is critical for GDP growth as it is
 generally large in size and is an input in the supply chain of various other industries.
 Reducing competitive restrictions in services (telecommunications, energy, transport, and
 professional services) not only improves the performance within each sector, but also has
 positive spillovers on the entire economy. In contrast, restrictive regulation may affect
 economic performance by protecting inefficient incumbents (network industries) or sustaining
 high prices (professional services). Low quality and high prices in services are likely to have
 a negative impact on productivity in downstream sectors, especially when they strongly rely
 on these services as inputs.

 91. Empirical evidence confirms a significant relationship between the degree of
 regulation in the service sector and growth in productivity and value added. A study of
 OECD countries based on PMR data (Barone and Cingano, 2011) shows that lower service
 regulation has significant positive effects on the value added, productivity and export growth
 rates of service-intensive sectors. Additionally, they find that a significant reduction 241 in the
 restrictiveness of regulation leads to an increase between 0.7 and 1.0 percentage points in
 annual value added growth in service-intensive sectors. Pro-competition reforms in
 professional services have also been found to increase within sector productivity. For instance,
 removal of price floors and advertising restrictions is associated with an increase in
 productivity and a higher likelihood for high-productivity lawyers to stay in the legal
 profession (Pellizzari et al., 2011).

 92. Just by concentrating on key reforms in service sectors, the Philippines could move
 from the fourth to the second quartile in terms of PMR restrictiveness among the
 countries in the data set. A simulation based on enhancing the regulatory environment in the
 service sector would imply lifting 86 restrictions mapped by the PMR indicators. In network
 industries, these would include limiting SOE presence (electricity generation, parcel and
 courier postal services, railways and water transport of freight and passengers and operation
 of road, railways and maritime infrastructure) and reducing barriers to entry (implementing
 vertical separation and regulating third party access in electricity, and requiring unbundling
 of the local loop in telecom); eliminating price regulation for domestic air transport;
 developing efficient pricing mechanisms in the telecom sector (regulating local loop
 unbundling prices and international wholesale/retail roaming rates); and eliminating FDI
 restrictions in utilities. In professional services, these would focus on enabling a more dynamic
 environment by allowing inter-professional cooperation as well as advertising; facilitating
 entry for domestic and foreign providers, reducing the number of exclusive tasks and
 eliminating price regulation.




241
   A significant decrease in relative regulatory restrictiveness is defined as an improvement of at least two
quartiles in the distribution of countries according to their restrictiveness (i.e. a country that moves from the
75th percentile to the 25th percentile in the respective sectoral or lower level indicators).

 93. In this scenario, a significant share of the restrictions to be lifted constitute rules
 that discriminate and protect vested interests as per the MCPAT effect-based
 categorization followed by rules that reinforce dominance or limit entry. From the 86
 restrictions identified, 42% belong to the state control pillar, 29% to the barriers to
 entrepreneurship and the other 29% to the barriers of trade and investment. Taking into
 account the MCPAT classification, 42% of the lifted restrictions belong to the rules that
 discriminate and protect vested interest, 35%, to the rules that reinforce dominance or limit
 entry and 23%, to the rules that are conducive to collusive outcomes or increase costs to
 compete in the market.

 95. Lowering the PMR indicator along the lines of the above simulation could have a
 positive impact in the growth of the overall economy. The literature suggests that a drop of
 10% in the sector-wide PMR would imply an increase in total factor productivity by at least
 1.3 percentage points (IMF et al., 2014). For maximum effectiveness of the reform process, it
 is important to address competitive restrictions in the economy as a whole as proposed in the
 above simulations. Concentrating on some specific areas (e.g. addressing trade barriers
 without tackling the level of direct state participation in the economy) would prevent the
 Philippines from obtaining the full benefits of the envisaged measures.

 96. The effect of reforms across key service sectors (energy, professional services,
 transportation and telecommunications) could lead to additional annual GDP growth of
 0.2%. Reforms in these sectors could add US$ 0.6 billion to the annual GDP by boosting
 competitiveness in downstream industries that use these services. Table 15 provides a
 summary.

Impact calculations are the additional value added as percentage of the GDP at current local prices of 2006,
generated by improvements in a specific sector.
2/ We assume the structure of the economy remain constant, meaning that the estimated impact of changes in
selected sectors on GDP 2006 were the same in 2015. The official exchange rate of 45.5 PHP/USD is used.
3/ Following the results of Barone and Cingano (2011), the estimate assumes a multiplier effect of 0.75pp in
downstream sectors which have above average intensity across all named service sectors due to reforms across
these selected sectors.
