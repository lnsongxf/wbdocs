    Introduction

            Legislation based on international standards and harmonized between trade partners fa-
            cilitates trade and enables products from developing countries to be competitive in the
            international market. Countries looking to export to the EU should aim to harmonize leg-
            islation with EU rules. If exporting to EU markets is not a priority, countries should follow
            requirements of the WTO SPS agreement and thus ensure that their products can access
            markets of all WTO member states.

            Both the EU and WTO legislative models for food safety require a risk-based approach to
            food safety controls, prioritizing funds and activity on the most risky areas.

            Reforms in this area should be primarily focused on ensuring food safety, although en-
            suring that consumers are receiving the quality of food that they expect is also a consid-
            eration. When planning legislative reform, the burden on business should be carefully
            considered, and consultation with the business community is strongly recommended to
            obtain a good understanding of the business perspective. The benefits to private sector
            development discussed in Module 2 should also form part of this discussion.

            Public awareness on the need for reforms can be important and it is essential to outline
            the benefits of improved food safety legislation to consumers and their representative
            bodies as they can help to support reforms and sustain their results.
