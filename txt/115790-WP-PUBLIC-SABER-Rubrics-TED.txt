Introduction

This document sets out the scoring methodology of the SABER-Tertiary Education instrument. The goal of this
exercise is to offer a conceptual framework and benchmarking tools to help policy makers and other stakeholders
make informed decisions to achieve system-wide goals for tertiary education. SABER-TE collects, synthesizes, and
disseminates comprehensive information on tertiary education to enable policy makers, WBG staff, and
development partners to learn how countries address similar policy challenges. At the same time, it helps the
system target distinctive challenges and opportunities within particular regional, national, and local contexts.

The scoring is based on the data collected through the questionnaire. The qualitative information on the state of
policies and institutions collected in the SABER- TE data collection instrument are rated from on a 4-point scale,
from Latent (1) to Advanced (4) through the application of scoring rules for each of the 65 topics included in SABER
TE. While the understanding of each rating for each topic is described in the evaluation rubric, in essence and across
topics, each of the rating has the interpretation below:

1.       Latent: there has been little attention to the topic;

2.       Emergent: some instances of good practice for the topic;

3.       Established: systemic good practice;

4.       Advanced: consistent and systematic good practice with evidence of institutionalized procedures for review
         and reform.

The rules used to determine the level of development for each Topic are specific to that Topic and are based on
available evidence on international good practices, a review of relevant literature on tertiary education systems and
extensive consultation with experts. To minimize potential bias in data collection, the scoring rules are made
available upon request to researchers who have completed the DCI.

Once data collection is complete, at least two members of the SABER TE technical team score the DCI
independently. Scoring takes into account each of the elements below:

        Answer options selected for each question;
        Required supporting justification
        References for supporting justification and selected answers

The breadth of information provided along with the specificity of the scoring rules means that in each instance
scorers should arrive at the same score. Topics where initial scoring yields conflicting scores are flagged and
examined by the team. In cases where the discrepancy is a result of an incomplete answer or differences in scorers’
interpretation of the information, a request for clarification is sent to the researcher who filled in the DCI and, once
the clarification is received, the Topic is rescored. If no discrepancies exist, the scores are ready for validation by
knowledgeable system stakeholders.

Following a data validation process, adjusted areas of the DCI are reviewed and rescored by the World Bank
Education Department.
