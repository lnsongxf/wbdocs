                         FOREWORD

This Post-Flood and -Landslides Needs Assessment (PFLNA) is dedicated to the millions of
our fellow Myanmar citizens who, despite devastating floods and landslides, continue to
demonstrate the most cherished value in our society, Para-Hita, the spirit of helping others
and sharing their own resources in times of suffering. We acknowledge the selfless efforts and
sacrifices of the affected communities, civil society organizations and national defense forces,
and their rapid action in initial relief and early recovery efforts.

Since July 2015, extensive floods and landslides have had a direct impact on nearly two
million women, men and children, while millions more have suffered from livelihood losses and
economic disruptions. The impact of these disasters continues to affect many communities and
regions, even as this assessment is going to press. Striking Myanmar at a time when we are
trying to keep the country on a path of high and sustained economic growth and insulate it
from external shocks, the floods and landslides have dealt our economy an excruciating blow.

The National Natural Disaster Management Committee (NNDMC) is truly privileged to have
received outstanding support from our Advisory Group, other national institutions, neighboring
governments and our international development partners. All these partners have a wealth
of experience and best practices, which have now been employed to estimate the damages,
losses and recovery needs of the affected populations. The NNDMC, on its part, has organized
several public forums to enable it to improve and help ongoing relief and recovery efforts
and community-driven initiatives. With all these inputs from key stakeholders, we believe
that this assessment will form sound basis for evidence-based planning, implementation and
management of the government’s recovery programs.

The assessment and recovery planning process is paying special attention to reinforcing
ongoing reforms and laying the foundation for resilient recovery. Given the uncertainties of
global climate change and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, we must expect
more disasters in future. We must ensure that we increase our capacity for recovery, resilience,
disaster preparedness and risk management. In the wake of this tragedy comes an opportunity
for us to work with regional partners in producing the new ASEAN Disaster Recovery Reference
Guide. Myanmar now co-chairs the ASEAN Committee on Disaster Management Working
Group on Recovery, the goal being to “establish a common vision of good recovery” and a
commitment to “continuous improvement of ASEAN Member States’ recovery practices.”

This disaster transcends the boundaries of state and society, and spans the entire spectrum
of ethnic and political diversity in the country. We must continue to uphold a spirit of
national unity to build a better future together. The report makes key recommendations,
including but not limited to improving coordination and governance, developing early warning
and management information systems, strengthening emergency operations, prioritizing more
immediate measures, ensuring transparent and accountable resource management, and building
regulatory institutional frameworks. To implement these ambitious but necessary programs, we
seek to enhance national and international partnerships for our resilient recovery program in
Myanmar, which will pave the way for national renewal.

PREFACE

The floods and landslides this year devastated many parts of Myanmar. Given the magnitude
of these disaster events, the task of identifying and responding to the needs of the affected
populations lie well beyond the national capacity to cope. We would therefore like to
acknowledge the prompt and early assistance from our immediate neighbors and from the
development partners. We also value the opportunity of collaborating, learning and sharing
experience with colleagues from the World Bank, the United Nations, the European Union, the
Japan International Cooperation Agency and other experts.

This Post-Flood and -Landslides Needs Assessment (PFLNA) uses a methodology agreed upon
and standardized by the international community. Under the mandate given by the National
Natural Disaster Management Committee (NNDMC), more than 50 national and foreign experts
worked round the clock to produce this assessment, covering 15 sectors in less than a month.
The Advisory Group with support from development partners took on the challenging task of
analyzing, validating and interpreting vast amount of data on damage, loss and needs within
a short time. We also organized several rounds of consultations and discussions with diverse
stakeholders to bring collective understanding of disaster risks and to better operationalize
the concept of “building back better” in recovery. This participatory process was further
strengthened by the guidance from the NNDMC on the ongoing efforts of communities and on
collaboration with the private sector and civil society, with a view to developing a realistic and
credible recovery plan. Using all these inputs and the comprehensive PFLNA, we will be able
to develop a long-term plan for resilient recovery, a plan that takes fully into consideration
the aspirations of the people, as well as the constraints and limits set by institutions and
resources.

We see the PFLNA as a starting point for forging public policies to plan and prepare for post-
disaster recovery and reconstruction. We hope the PFLNA and our recovery plan will be able
to provide reference points for essential national dialogue on the resilience, recovery and long-
term economic renewal of the country. We recognize that the recovery strategies outlined in
the PFLNA stand to improve in the light of new insights, better data and fresh vision.

Myanmar has always attempted to regain her strength after natural disasters, and we have
faith in the unity of our people to build back better. We also believe in strong commitment
from the leadership and in the perseverance of our communities. We hope that all these
will provide an opportunity for national unity in our recovery efforts. We hope that this
comprehensive assessment will receive the immediate attention it deserves from within and
outside the country, together with support for making the recovery successful.

Our sincere thanks are due to the officials of the Emergency Operations Center, the Recovery
Coordination Center, line ministries, national institutions and to the members of our own
Advisory Group to the NNDMC. We could not have conducted the entire PFLNA exercise
successfully were it not for the hard work and professionalism of these colleagues. We look
forward to working with all stakeholders in the implementation of the recovery initiatives
identified in this PFLNA report.

                      EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
                      Torrential rains and the onset of Cyclone Komen triggered severe and widespread floods
                      and landslides in July and August 2015 across 12 out of 14 states and regions in Myanmar.
                      An estimated 1.6 million individuals were recorded as having been temporarily displaced from their
                      homes by the disaster, and 132 lost their lives.1 Up to 5.2 million people were exposed to the floods
                      and landslides in the 40 most heavily affected townships.2 Within the 40 most-affected townships,
                      775,810 individuals have been displaced, or approximately half of the total displaced population.

                      Summary of Damages and Losses3
                      The total economic value of the effects of the floods and landslides was estimated to be
                      approximately K 1.942 trillion (US$1.51 billion).4 Of this, K 792,493 million (US$615.58 million)
                      was attributed to damages and K 1,149,522 million (US$892.90 million) to losses.  The total effects
                      would be the equivalent of 3.1 percent of Myanmar’s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2014/2015.    

                      Productive sectors and housing have been the hardest hit sectors accounting for about 90
                      percent of the total disaster effects. Table 1 summarizes the disaster effects within the different
                      sectors. Figure 1 shows the disaster effects by sectors; the agriculture, livestock and fisheries sector
                      was the most severely affected, followed by housing and then commerce and industry amounting
                      to 37, 28 and 25 percent of the total damage and loss, respectively. All other sectors combined
                      account for about 11 percent of the total damage and loss. In the agriculture sector, the disaster
                      has damaged 20.4 percent of the cultivated area— 2,952,753 hectares—in the impacted regions.
                      The social sectors of education and health have sustained lower amounts in damage and losses,
                      but the harm to these sectors significantly harms the population’s quality of life and living conditions.
                      Across the sectors, the value of production losses is much higher (59 percent of the total effects)
                      than that of damages to physical assets (41 percent of the total effects), which is typical of a disaster
                      caused by a hydrometeorological event. Landslides had a major impact on road connectivity and
                      communications.

MYANMAR POST-DISASTER NEEDS ASSESSMENT
OF FLOODS AND LANDSLIDES JULY–SEPTEMBER 2015



                     An examination of the ownership of disaster effects reveals an uneven distribution between
                     the public and private sectors. Analysis shows that disaster effects in the public sector are
                     a small fraction of those in the private domain, including households and communities, which
                     sustained most of the total effects (Figure 2). Private enterprises, individual homeowners and
                     farmers bear a large part of the disaster effects, and this burden needs to be considered by
                     the responsible authorities during recovery and reconstruction. Since small to medium-size
                     enterprises, individual farmers, and smallholders with limited financial capacity and nearly no
                     insurance coverage have been affected, the role of the government will have to be expanded in
                     dealing with recovery and reconstruction, and the government will also have to play a catalytic
                     role in mobilizing private banking resources to assist the poorer strata of the population.

                     Geographically, disaster effects were felt throughout the entire country, with an uneven
                     distribution among states and regions. In terms of damage and production losses, the most-
                     affected states and regions were Ayeyarwady, Sagaing and Bago (see Table 2 and Figure 3).
                     In terms of per capita effects (see Table 3 and Figure 4), Chin residents sustained the highest
                     value of damages and losses (K 132,560 per person), closely followed by Rakhine (K 105,665
                     per person). Ayeyarwady, Sagaing and Bago residents sustained damage and losses of between
                     K 83,000 and K 63,800 per person, which are also significant. It should also be noted that
                     the inhabitants of Chin faced high values of destroyed assets (K 113,350), caused mostly by
                     landslides, while residents of Ayeyarwady and Bago sustained the highest value of production
                     losses, which translate into high decline of personal income. The disaster effects in terms of
                     production losses and per casita are depicted on maps in Figure 5 and Figure 6 respectively.

Summary of Macroeconomic Impact Assessment
From a macroeconomic perspective, the floods and landslides are estimated to have
caused K 1,080,573 million5 of production losses to the economy for 2015/2016, or about 1.7
percent of last year’s GDP (see Figure 7). In value-added terms, the economic loss is estimated
at K 609,265 million, equivalent to around 1 percent of 2014/2015 GDP (Figure 7). GDP growth
could drop by 0.8 percentage points in 2015/2016 if recovery efforts are not undertaken. In addi-
tion, the current account deficit is expected to increase to above 8 percent of GDP, and the fiscal
deficit is projected at just under 5 percent of GDP. In the medium term, the economy is expected
to bounce back, with strong recovery in the agriculture sector. The large impact is driven by the
effect of the floods on crop and fisheries production. Crops alone account for over 20 percent of
GDP in Myanmar, and are therefore a strategic sector of the economy.

  Note that under the damage and loss assessment methodology (see Introduction), increased relief and emergency
expenditures are counted as a loss; but they are counted as an increase in the macroeconomic analysis (see Figure 7).

                    The overall impact is not insignificant when compared to other floods in the early 2000s.6
                    Recent floods in Bosnia and Herzegovina (2014) were estimated to have caused damages worth
                    15 percent of GDP, and losses close to 5.6 percent of GDP. The 2011 floods in Thailand caused
                    around 11 percent of GDP in damage and losses. However, there are a number of factors to
                    be considered regarding the 2015 floods and landslides in Myanmar. The impact of the disaster
                    (i.e., the consequences of the effects of the disaster) is greater whenever production losses are
                    high and the size of the affected economy is small. In the case of Myanmar, whose economy is
                    relatively small, the macro impact is relatively high. In addition, in the case of Myanmar, most of
                    the damage and losses occurred in states and regions where the population has lower values of
                    personal income; thus their quality of life would be more affected than that of populations in other
                    countries, and require more recovery assistance.

                    Disasters impact affected populations’ quality of life or well-being at the personal or
                    household level, especially for more vulnerable population groups, including women, chil-
                    dren, and the elderly. A gap analysis of the quality-of-life indicators reveals that the impact of
                    the floods and landslides has triggered a geographically widespread decline in the quality of life
                    of the disaster-affected population, particularly in Ayeyarwady, Bago and Chin, which sustained
                    the highest decline in the quality-of-life index (see Figure 8).7 There seems to be a correlation
                    between a low quality of life and vulnerability to external shocks: high exposure to a disaster
                    was found to coincide with a significant decline in post-disaster quality of life in Chin, Bago,
                    Ayeyarwady, Kachin, Rakhine and Magway. In particular, Chin’s dramatic decline in quality of life
                    combined with its pre-existing development deficits clearly call for a prioritization of assistance
                    during the recovery phase.

Summary of Recovery and Reconstruction Needs
Preliminary estimates highlight recovery and reconstruction needs in the order of K 2.035
trillion (Table 4). The assessment recommends principles for the recovery based on international
good practice and identifies key issues to be taken into account, such as institutional capacity,
financing, regional concerns, and harmonization of national and development partner priorities.
The next steps are to finalize a recovery strategy, mobilize internal and external resources to fi-
nance reconstruction, and accelerate the preparation and implementation of recovery activities.

                    a.	 The proposed medium and long-term needs cash for work flood recovery programs will help provide temporary local
                        employment to affected households for the repair and reconstruction of local infrastructure (schools, health clinics, housing,
                        fish ponds, water and sanitation, wells and other water sources etc.). The bulk of the equipment and material costs are
                        already covered by reallocations to sectoral reconstruction budgets. A part of this reconstruction budget needs to be
                        reallocated for labor costs under the cash for work program.




                    Way Forward
                    The “build back better” principle serves as the guiding framework in the development and
                    implementation of rehabilitation and recovery interventions. The principle focuses on long-
                    term, sustainable efforts to reduce vulnerabilities and strengthen capacities to cope with future
                    hazard events. This approach takes into consideration the need for urgency while ensuring safety
                    in implementing programs and projects. Within the given time lines, the government’s priorities
                    and needs pose budgetary, institutional, administrative, and logistical challenges that will condi-
                    tion and frame the development partners’ post-flood interventions. It is recommended that the
                    results and data from the Post-Flood and -Landslide Needs Assessment (PFLNA) be integrated
                    in preparing the Comprehensive Recovery Plan and Strategy. This will create a good baseline
                    that ministries, regions, states, and unions can use in preparing their respective recovery plans.

                    Going forward, there is a need to prioritize activities for recovery and reconstruction based
                    on the findings of this assessment and the available finances. In the process, there are a
                    number of issues, priorities, and guiding principles to consider:

Key issues:
	 •	 Existing government institutional capacity
	 •	 Limitation of local implementation
	 •	 Need for strong inter-sector and inter-institutional coordination for recovery
	 •	 Financial constraints and prioritization of interventions
	 •	 Harmonization of national priorities and those of international development partners
	 •	 Additionality versus more efficient use of available resources
	 •	 Need to ensure recovery fits with longer-term development plans
	 •	 Region-specific attention to socioeconomic, geographical, and physical contexts

Priorities:
	 •	 Use recovery as opportunity to reinforce ongoing reforms.
	 •	 Focus on specific needs among states and regions, townships, and village tracts.
	 •	 Respond quickly to agricultural replanting and winter crops, beans, pulses, summer rice,
       and other cash crops.
	 •	 Restore livelihoods by expanding microcredit, restructuring loans and/or provision of debt
       relief for the affected small and medium-sized enterprises and farmers.
	 •	 Support self-reconstruction of housing through provision of materials and cash grants tied
       to work.
	 •	 Implement integrated environmental and water resource management as a resilience-en-
       hancing, risk- reducing strategy.
	 •	 Apply disaster risk–sensitive land use/urban planning
	 •	 Implement specific measures to address increased vulnerabilities.
	 •	 Strengthen institutional capacity of relevant institutions to lead and manage recovery.
	 •	 Use and strengthen local capacities, indigenous knowledge, and diverse cultural richness.

Guiding principles:
	 •	 Recovery must be sustainable and equitable and must increase resilience.
	 •	 Recovery should strengthen local communities and livelihoods.
	 •	 The socioeconomic focus of recovery should be on poverty and risk reduction, social in-
      clusion, gender equity, and compensation to vulnerable disadvantaged social groups.
	 •	 The recovery should strengthen the provision of basic social services (education, health)
      with specific attention to gender and vulnerable groups.
	 •	 The strategy and response should be inclusive, nondiscriminatory, and conflict-sensitive.
	 •	 Recovery should support a seamless transition from short- to medium-term goals.
	 •	 A sound monitoring and evaluation mechanism with clear performance indicators must be
      part of the post-floods and -landslides recovery framework and plan.

                   Country Context
                   Disaster Risk Profile

                   Myanmar is exposed to a range of natural hazards, including floods, cyclones, earthquakes,
                   landslides, and tsunamis. Myanmar rests on a major earthquake belt and is subject to small
                   earthquakes on a regular basis. Mountainous areas are prone to landslides. Predictions indicate that
                   water-related disasters will be exacerbated by climate change and environmental degradation (see
                   Box 1). Floods and droughts are expected to become more frequent and intense. Temperatures,
                   rainfall, and runoff are likely to increase; extreme rainfall will become more frequent; and dry periods
                   during the monsoon season may occur. All these changes will lead to augmented economic losses,
                   particularly in the agricultural sector.

                   Natural hazards in Myanmar are accompanied by high economic costs and social
                   consequences. The annual expected losses linked to natural hazards are approximately US$184.8
                   million, equivalent to 0.9 percent of the country’s 2008 GDP; these were the highest annual expected
                   losses relative to GDP in all Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries.8 Impacts from
                   disasters are felt across all sectors, and they present a challenge for Myanmar’s quest for continued
                   growth. In 2008, Cyclone Nargis killed over 130,000 people;9 2.4 million others lost homes and
                   livelihoods.10 The 2015 Global Assessment Report puts Myanmar first in terms of annual average loss
                   in relation to social expenditure.11

                   Physical exposure to geological and hydrometeorological hazards is only one aspect of
                   understanding and calculating disaster and climate risks. Location and exposure of the built
                   environment—is important, but vulnerability—linked to people’s ability to prepare for, respond to,
                   or recover from a disaster—is equally important. Disasters disproportionately impact the poor and
                   vulnerable, particularly women, children, the elderly, and people with disabilities. Due to the high degree
                   of poverty in the rural areas in Myanmar, even low-intensity disasters have a big impact on households.
                   In the rural communities, the poor often live in remote areas in low-quality housing, and lack access to
                   basic services and local infrastructure, all of which affect their ability to deal with disaster events.


  Box 1.               In 2012 the government of Myanmar published a National Adaptation Program for Action
  Impact of
                       (NAPA) aimed at analyzing past and expected impacts of climate change in Myanmar and at
  climate change
  in Myanmar           identifying priority actions for adaptation. According to NAPA, the observed climate variabil-
                       ity and change in Myanmar over roughly the last six decades include the following:

                   2010 because the longer EM-DAT time series for the number of people affected suggests that the 2008 Cyclone Nargis was a
                   relatively severe event that seems unlikely to reoccur once every fifteen years. Due to data limitations the probable losses the

SOCIOECONOMIC CONTEXT

Beginning in 2011, Myanmar launched major political and economic reforms aimed at
increasing openness, empowerment, and inclusion.12 Since then, significant progress has
been made in reforming the economy, with an estimated growth rate increasing from 5.3 percent
in 2010/2011 to 7.3 percent in 2012/2013. The removal of trade and foreign exchange restrictions,
coupled with rapidly rising domestic demand, have contributed to widening trade and current account
deficits. Growth is expected to remain relatively strong over the medium term.13 In the past two years,
the government has increased spending on the social sectors.

Despite progress, Myanmar remains one of the poorest countries in Southeast Asia.14 With
a population of 51.4 million, the country has a per capita GDP of US$1,105.15 In 2010, the rate of
poverty was estimated to be between 25.6 and 37.5 percent,16 concentrated particularly in conflict-
affected areas. In Chin State, the poverty rate stands at 71 percent; in Rakhine it is 78 percent. At least
70 percent of Myanmar’s poor live in rural areas, and agriculture plays a critical role for both inclusive
growth and poverty reduction.17 However, urban poverty (34.6 percent) must also be addressed.18

The past years have seen a dramatic increase in political and civil liberties and a significant
reduction in armed conflict, although conflict continues in Kachin State and northern Shan
State. At the same time, new tensions and challenges have emerged, including outbreaks of unrest
affecting the country’s Muslim minorities and particularly those who identify themselves as Rohingya
in Rakhine State. The government is pursuing efforts to bring an end to the multiple conflicts in ethnic
areas.

                    2015 Floods and Landslides
                    In July and August 2015, widespread floods and landslides affecting 12 out of 14 states in
                    Myanmar displaced 1,676,086 people and caused 132 fatalities.19 The floods and landslides
                    destroyed public and private infrastructure, including houses, railways, roads, bridges, schools,
                    health facilities, and monasteries, and had extensive impacts on the agriculture sector. The worst-hit
                    areas are in the central and western part of the country. The inundated areas are shown in Figure 9.

                    Myanmar’s climate is largely tropical with three seasons: the monsoon/rainy season (May–October),
                    cool season (November–February), and hot season (March–April). Rainfall during the monsoon
                    season totals more than 500 cm in upper Myanmar and over 250 cm in lower Myanmar and Yangon,
                    while Central Myanmar and Mandalay receive about 76 cm each. Torrential rains started on July
                    16, 2015, saturating the ground. On July 30, Cyclone Komen made landfall in Bangladesh, causing
                    strong winds and additional torrential rains in Chin and Rakhine States and Sagaing, Magway, and
                    Bago Regions.20 The rains were exceptionally heavy; in the mountains of the country’s central and
                    northern regions, rainfall levels and river discharge rates reached unprecedented levels. In Magway
                    Region, for instance, water levels in the Mone Dam reservoir reached 1 m below the crest.

Results from a rapid post-event analysis21 indicate that overall, the 2015 floods can be
characterized as a rare event, one with an estimated return period of 20–50 years,
depending on the location within the Ayeyarwady subcatchments. More extreme floods
might have occurred in some of the smaller tributaries due to localized heavy rainfall, as anecdotal
evidence and dam peak-outflow levels suggests. As a rule, rainfall intensities vary greatly throughout
the Ayeyarwady basin. An estimation of rainfall return periods at the subcatchment level based on
10-day maximum rainfall sums shows very large differences throughout the basin, with mean return
periods ranging from less than 1 in 10 years at Aunglan, Chauk, Myitkyina, and Pyay, to 1 in 30 years
in Nyaung U, 1 in 40 years at Monywa, to more extreme 1-in-90-year rainfalls in the upstream areas
of Katha and Sagaing subbasins (Figure 10 and Figure 11).

The floods also caused morphological changes. River banks eroded, damaging and threatening
the stability of roads and other infrastructure. In several locations, newly eroded river channels cut
through existing agricultural areas. Rivers in Myanmar are naturally dynamic due to highly variable
monsoon climate and the high sediment levels. During the floods, increased sedimentation occurred.
The Ayeyarwady delta experienced a floodplain type of flooding, with relatively low flood levels but
over a large area. This especially affected unprotected villages and settlements in flood-prone areas.
The combination of heavy rainfall, strong winds, high soil saturation, and unstable soils in hilly areas
caused landslides that destroyed houses, roads, bridges and other infrastructure.

Unprecedented extreme rainfalls caused landslides in the Chin State. Within the last seven
days of July, over 30 percent more rain fell than in any other month over the past 25 years. The
monthly rainfall of July measured at the weather station in Hakha would be equal to a 1-in-1,000-year
rainfall (see Figure 12 and Figure 13). This explains the widespread and devastating landslides within
Chin State and in particular the reactivation of a large, old, and deep-seated landslide on which—as
a detailed geologic and geo-engineering study revealed (Win Myint, Kyaw Htun et al. 2015) —parts
of Hakha had been built. The landslides caused extensive destruction to roads and homes. Many
affected areas are remote and were difficult to access, particularly in Chin State. Due to the massive
damage and persisting landslide risks, geologists and engineers were assessing the feasibility of
relocating the capital, Hakha, to a safer location.

                  Response from the Government, Development Partners,
                  and Communities22
                  On July 31, 2015, Myanmar’s president declared a state of emergency in Sagaing Region,
                  Magway Region, Chin State, and Rakhine State, designating them as disaster-affected
                  zones, in accordance with Article 11 of the Natural Disaster Management Law. On August
                  10, 2015, the Recovery Coordination Committee (RCC) was formed to lead recovery, including
                  developing a recovery strategy and establishing a Recovery Coordination Center to provide
                  operational and information management support to the National Natural Disaster Management
                  Committee (NNDMC) and the RCC. Chaired by the minister of the Ministry of Construction (MOC),
                  the RCC consists of 28 members from respective line ministries. The UN with development partners
                  has been providing support to the establishment of the Recovery Coordination Center, which became
                  operational October 1, 2015. On August 14, the vice president outlined a broad national recovery
                  coordination structure, coordination mechanisms, and guiding principles for building back better. The
                  government has also adopted guiding recovery principles that take into account the particular needs
                  of the most vulnerable, including women, youth, people with disabilities, and the elderly. To assess
                  the impact on key sectors, understand of the scale of economic impact, and support the process of
                  recovery and reconstruction planning, on September 16 2015, the NNDMC requested support from
                  the World Bank in conducting a Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA).

                  As of October 4, K 28.8 billion has been spent for flood response activities by the
                  government.23 Over K 187 billion has been committed to response activities, according to the
                  government of Myanmar and the UN Financial Tracking Service. The government has allocated the
                  following: K 42.2 billion from the President’s Reserve Fund, K 6.5 billion from the national government,
                  and K 22.3 billion from state and region governments, and there have also been contributions from
                  the private sector and civil society.24

                  On August 4, Myanmar called for international humanitarian assistance to aid in effective
                  flood response. Through the AHA Centre, ASEAN member states deployed the ASEAN Emergency
                  Response and Assessment Team (ASEAN ERAT) and mobilized the Disaster Emergency Logistic
                  System for ASEAN (DELSA) to support the government of Myanmar during the crisis.25 As of October
                  6, the government of Myanmar had received US$18.2 million in cash and in-kind contributions from
                  ASEAN, Australia, Bangladesh, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Canada, China, India, Indonesia,
                  Israel, Italy, Japan, Mongolia, Nepal, New Zealand, Norway, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Sri Lanka,
                  Thailand, Vietnam, and the private sector. According to the Financial Tracking Service, as of October
                  5, US$35.6 million had been contributed or pledged for projects in the Myanmar flood response
                  plan, including contributions from ASEAN member states, the United Nations’ Central Emergency
                  Response Fund, multilateral institutions, private companies, and individuals.26

                  Response to the floods and landslides has demonstrated the resilience of civil society,
                  human solidarity, and people’s ability to help themselves. Community groups quickly
                  mobilized to facilitate access to immediate food and nonfood aid and to ensure equal distribution
                  of that assistance. In addition to drawing on traditional avenues such as seeking donations through
                  monasteries and establishing collection points, affected people also used mobile phones and social
                  media to collectively mobilize assistance. There were examples of village youths setting up Facebook
                  groups to communicate needs with networks in less-affected areas. Community structures played
                  a pivotal role in the immediate aftermath of the floods in helping communities to cope. Acting on
                  warnings issued by township authorities through village leaders, communities largely self-mobilized to
                  move to safer locations as water levels rose. Even after the initial phase, those affected by the floods
                  have continued to rely on community coping mechanisms for dealing with needs.

Assessment Methodology
POST-DISASTER NEEDS ASSESSMENT

The PDNA is an internationally recognized methodology used in large disasters worldwide
to analyze disaster effects and disaster impact and to identify recovery needs, understood
from human, socio-cultural, economic, and environmental perspectives. The PDNA is a
government-led exercise, supported by a multidisciplinary, multiagency team. The current assessment
was supported by experts from the European Union, the World Bank/Global Facility for Disaster
Reduction and Recovery, the United Nations, and other relevant stakeholders. The assessment
methodology is based on PDNA guidelines27 with three main elements: assessment of disaster
effects, assessment of disaster impact, and recovery strategy and needs.

The assessment of the disaster effects is based on the quantification of damage and
losses. Damage to infrastructure and physical assets is the quantification of public and private sector
infrastructure and assets destroyed in the disaster. Damage includes either total or partial destruction
of the assets. The assessment assumes that a certain level of damage will occur to flooded buildings,
given that the exposure of wood or other traditional materials to floodwaters will require the building’s
repairs or replacement. The PDNA estimates include damages to building content. Losses due to
disruption of access to goods and services are defined as changes in economic flows and higher costs
in production arising from the disaster. They occur until full economic recovery and reconstruction
is achieved, in some cases lasting for several years. Typical losses include the decline in output in
productive sectors. Disaster effects also include a qualitative assessment of the increased risks and
vulnerabilities resulting from the event.

The assessment of the impact of a disaster encompasses the impact on the macroeconomy,
employment, livelihoods, and households. Economic impact at the macro level includes the
estimation of the disaster’s likely effects on economic performance and the temporary macroeconomic
imbalances that may arise from the disaster. Social and household impact includes the impacts of the
disaster on household and community livelihoods, employment, and gender.

The assessments of disaster effects and disaster impacts assist in determining recovery
needs, taking into account “build back better” (BBB) principles. BBB is an approach to
reconstruction that seeks to reduce vulnerability and improve living conditions, while promoting
more effective and sustainable reconstruction. BBB uses the opportunity of having to rebuild to
examine the suitability and sustainability of reconstruction activities. The identified recovery needs
inform short-, medium-, and long-term recovery and reconstruction interventions through a recovery
strategy. Accordingly, the principal goal of a PDNA is to help governments assess the full extent
of a disaster’s impact on the country and, on the basis of these findings, produce an actionable
and sustainable recovery strategy for mobilizing financial and technical resources. The assessment
provides a sound basis for strategic recovery planning by national and subnational authorities, helping
them to prioritize, sequence, and mobilize resources, and direct resources to the needs of the most-
affected populations.

QUALITY OF LIFE INDEX

The 2015 Myanmar floods and landslides have not only had significant negative impact on the national
economy, but—most importantly—have also caused an immediate and high decline in the quality
of life and well-being of affected households and communities. During the 2015 Myanmar Post-
Flood and -Landslide Needs Assessment (PFLNA), existing sectoral baseline information and the
estimated value of the main disaster effects (as observed during field surveys) were used to estimate
the sectoral indicators that define quality of life. The quality-of-life index is a composite index that has
been conceived to do the following:

                  The quality-of-life index is composed of several equally-weighted indicators that are assessed prior
                  to the disaster, immediately after the disaster, and periodically re-evaluated during the recovery and
                  reconstruction process (see Figure 15).

                  The composite quality-of-life index derived for the case of the Myanmar disaster focuses priorities for
                  recovery in several ways. It provides a measure of negative disaster impact on the affected population’s
                  living conditions; it shows the impact’s geographical distribution; and it provides a quantitative means
                  to measure progress in achieving recovery over time. The quality-of-life index may be reevaluated
                  periodically to determine the advance or progress in achieving recovery and reconstruction.

SPECIFICS AND LIMITATIONS OF THE POST-FLOOD AND LANDSLIDE
NEEDS ASSESSMENT

The PFLNA was carried out based on data and information gathered between September 24
and October 12, 2015. The assessment adopted a multi-sectoral and multidisciplinary approach for
assessing disaster impacts and prioritizing recovery and reconstruction needs. The assessment was
undertaken in coordination with the different ministries, unions, states, regions, affected communities,
and development partners. Based on the recovery priorities of the affected population, the assessment
synthesizes information to conduct informed analysis on damages, losses, and related needs and
produces a single consolidated report. That report serves as a basis for creation of a comprehensive
recovery framework that guides the design and implementation of early and longer-term recovery
plans. The sectoral teams assessed the impacts of the disaster in the existing systems, along the
value chains and across sectors; engaged in proper costing of economic and social recovery needs;
focused on prioritizing and sequencing public interventions by geographical areas and sectors; and
identified opportunities for reinforcing ongoing reforms and linking national goals.

The assessment team was constrained by the limited time frame available for the assessment
and the availability of data. The assessment was carried out over a very condensed time period,
from September 24 to October 12, 2015. Quality and accessibility of data posed challenges to the
sectoral assessment teams. The government’s management information processes are weak and
not well-coordinated. In response to that problem and to the limited time frame, the Advisory Group
to the Recovery (composed of experienced sector specialists to guide the recovery planning process)
assisted sectoral teams with the interpretation and analysis of the available data. Data provided by
the ministries were translated and shared with the sectoral teams. Specific constraints are described
in the sectoral chapters.

Damages in Myanmar in the 2015 disaster were not homogenous because the damages
had different characteristics (depending on whether they were caused by floods, heavy
rains, mud or rockslides, etc.). Landslides caused major destruction in infrastructure, including
transportation and communications, in the mountainous areas. The floods hit major agricultural
areas, including regions in Sagaing, Magway, Ayeyarwady, and Bago, which jointly account for
around 89 percent of the national production of crops. Across the sectors, the value of production
losses was higher than that of damages to physical assets, which is typical of a disaster caused by
a hydrometeorological event.

OF FLOODS AND LANDSLIDES JULY–SEPTEMBER 2015




                  Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries
                  SUMMARY

                  The disaster in Myanmar has damaged 20.4 percent of the cultivated area—2,952,753
                  hectares (ha)—in the impacted regions.29 Out this damaged area, 32.7 percent is estimated to
                  be totally lost for production in the 2015 monsoon season. The rest of the affected area is damaged
                  but still able to produce crops. 11.8 percent of the crop production quantity during a regular monsoon
                  season is projected to be lost. The affected cultivated area is only a fraction of total cultivated area
                  in the impacted regions. Total cultivated area of the 12 affected states and regions is 2,952,753 ha,
                  implying that the floods have totally destroyed only 6.6 percent of total cultivated area. Areas planted
                  with paddy for the monsoon season were the most affected, but fields with unharvested off-season
                  paddy crops also suffered. Other areas growing other crops—such as pulses, groundnuts, sesame,
                  sugarcane, and maize—were marginally affected, with very small areas fully lost.    

                  Total damages and losses to crop production are estimated at K 389,462.7 million. Of this amount,
                  K 54,252.6 million represents total crop damage, and K 335,210.1 million represents total crop
                  loss. These high losses are the result of the cyclone’s trajectory and timing; the flooding affected the
                  main crop-growing regions in Myanmar during the peak monsoon production season. Destruction to
                  plantations of perennial crops was more limited and was concentrated in tea- and rubber-producing
                  areas in Chin and Shan States.

                  Total livestock damages and losses are estimated at K 17,777.9 million. Damages were estimated
                  at K 7,627.4 million; they account for the relatively large share of total impacts because of the larger
                  effects of floods on farmers’ infrastructure (such as farm buildings and animal shelters). The losses
                  were K 10,150.5 million. These losses include the losses in draught power for farmers, and the loss
                  in meat and egg production.

                  In the commercial and artisanal fisheries subsector, the reported impact has been largely on the
                  aquaculture ponds and the inland fisheries ponds, mostly leasable fisheries. Damages include
                  impacts on buildings, hatchery farms, fishing gear, and equipment, including engines, boats and
                  vehicles. Total fishery-related damages and losses were K 329,959.1 million, of which K 299.4 million
                  was damages and K 329,659.7 million was losses.

                  In aggregate, the estimated damages and losses in the agricultural sector come to K
                  737,199.6 million. This amount represents 1.1 percent of national GDP and 4.2 percent of agricultural
                  GDP. The priority now is to restore production levels in crops, livestock, and fisheries, in part by
                  providing seeds and other material for replanting, restocking dead animals, and providing seeds to
                  reactivate the aquaculture and inland fisheries ponds.


                  PRE-DISASTER CONTEXT

                  The agriculture sector, consisting of crops, livestock, and fisheries, contributes 26.6 percent
                  of the national GDP to the Myanmar economy; it employs around 52 percent of the national
                  labor force and provides livelihoods for over 70 percent of the population. In 2014–2015,
                  the crops subsector alone accounted for 18.8 percent of GDP. The active agricultural population in
                  2010 was 22.3 million persons, or 86.81 percent of total agricultural population. According to the
                  2014 Population Census, 76 percent of poor live in rural areas, and internal rural-urban migration
                  movements are starting to drive urbanization.




                  29
                     Affected states and regions in this sector are Ayeyarwady, Bago, Chin, Kachin, Kayah, Kayin, Magway, Mandalay, Mon,
                  Rakhine, Sagaing, Shan, and Yangon.

Agricultural land represents 17.5 percent of Myanmar’s total land area of 68 million ha. The country’s
location, a tropic monsoon climate, and an extensive coastline favor crop production and fishing.
Rainfall is highly seasonal and concentrated in the hot, humid months of the southwest monsoon
(May to October). In contrast, the northwest monsoon (December to March) is relatively cool and
almost entirely dry. This climatology favors rice growing during almost all year.

Land ownership is the main source of social and economic disparities in rural areas. Around 41.6
percent of rural households are landless.30 Size of holdings and regional cultures also influence
the extent of the disparities. Regarding sources of income, the household size is the main factor
determining whether household heads work in their agriculture holdings as much as they engage in
nonagriculture activities.31 Differences in time spent in farming by men and women depend on the
traditional roles in agricultural work.32

Crops. Most farms in Myanmar are small in scale, with an average size of 2–3 acres (0.8–1.2 ha). The
main cultivated crops are (i) rice, which covers around two-thirds of the total area under cultivation,
but which has the lowest average yield among Eastern Asian countries (2.5–3.0 tons/ha); (ii) beans
and pulses, which are becoming a major export crop and are farmed on around 4.2 million ha; (iii)
oilseeds, grown on 3.3 million ha, with production levels insufficient for national demand; and (iv)
vegetables and chilies, grown on around 0.8 million ha, principally in the highland areas. Most of
the paddy in Myanmar is planted and grown during the monsoon season, starting in May. Other
important crops produced during the monsoon season are sesame, groundnuts, and pigeon peas.
Most beans, pulses, and oilseeds in the country are produced later, during the cool and dry seasons,
when only a small number of farmers grow paddy because there is insufficient water for the crop.

Most of the rice varieties in Myanmar have long durations of growth. Around 70 percent of paddy
production occurs during the last quarter of the year, between November and December, contributing
to a higher volatility in rice prices. Paddy yields vary significantly across the country, but they are
usually low because good-quality seeds are not widely available and because farmers lack knowledge
of good farming practices. Official estimates report a paddy yield of 3.94 tons/ha in 2014–2015.
Other sources report yields for dry paddy equivalent to be lower; the U.S. Department of Agriculture
reports a yield of 2.7 tons/ha in dry paddy equivalent, and a 2013–2014 survey by the World Bank
and Livelihoods and Food Security Trust (LIFT) reports 2.6 tons/ha in dry paddy equivalent, or 3.4
tons/ha in wet paddy equivalent. Farmers are not fully benefitting from established markets for inputs
(fertilizers, seeds, pesticides). Training in and knowledge about use of fertilizers are still lacking.
Informal exchanges and own savings play a significant role in Myanmar’s seed sector. Around 95
percent of all rice seed planted in Myanmar, and even a higher percentage in other crops, are traded
through informal systems.

Livestock. Livestock plays a critical role in the smallholder mixed crop-livestock systems that prevail
in Myanmar. Livestock production accounts for around 7.5 percent of the overall GDP. Livestock-
raising patterns differ substantially across Myanmar, depending on the agro-ecological zone and
the cropping system; the role of livestock—cattle, sheep, and goats—is most important in the dry
zone. According to the 2014 Population Census, 8.2 million smallholder households are engaged in
keeping and/or breeding livestock and/or poultry. Available evidence suggests that these households




30
   Per ecoregion, landless rural households were found to be 20.9 percent of the total rural households in the hills zone,
38 percent in the dry zone, 56.2 percent in the delta, and 51.7 percent in the coastal zone, according to the World Bank’s
Systematic Country Diagnostic (World Bank 2014b).
31
   Men, usually the landless poor, engage more frequently than women in paid hard menial labor in agriculture (17.4 percent
of male household heads versus 14.2 percent of female household heads), in fishing (3.6 percent versus 0.3 percent), and
in forestry-related activities (24.9 percent versus 14.2 percent). Women may attend young children or earn additional income
through other means, such as caring for poultry or transplanting nursery paddy (Win 2012).
32
   Men plough the land with oxen, and women traditionally transplant paddy. Available evidence shows that during the monsoon
season, males in agricultural activities devote on average 29.1 hours per acre to the preparation of the land, versus 19.9 hours
per acre spent by female. In turn, females devote slightly more time to management (caring for the crops) than men (37.8
versus 35.6 hours per acre) (Win 2012).

                                                                                                                                                17

                  have in aggregate around 15 million head of cattle, 3.3 million buffalos, 5 million goats, 1 million
                  goats, 127 million chickens, and 7.7 million of ducks. All livestock species have increased in number
                  over the last two decades, though the chicken population has increased the most (because of an
                  increase in commercial layer and broiler chickens). Pig, duck, goat, and sheep populations have also
                  increased significantly. Livestock contributes significantly to households’ access to animal proteins
                  and supports the farm economy through draught power and byproducts (hides and leather). Although
                  commercial production has developed near the main cities in the country, most of the livestock
                  production depends on family-based systems. The shortage of livestock for draught power is one of
                  the constraints on agricultural production in Myanmar.

                  Fisheries. Associated with Myanmar’s water resources are substantial fisheries in the major rivers,
                  along the 1,900 km of coastline, and in the 500,000 ha of mangrove swamps. By developing the
                  potential for aquaculture in its delta region, Myanmar has doubled the fisheries production in the
                  last decade. Fish and shrimp are now major export industries. In 2014–2015, fishery production in
                  Myanmar amounted to 5.3 million metric tons. Of this amount, marine capture fisheries contributed
                  2.8 million tons (54 percent), inland fisheries 1.4 million tons (26 percent), and aquaculture 0.99 tons
                  (20 percent). Available estimates suggest that in 2014 the landed value of fish from inland fisheries
                  accounted for K 3.46 trillion, from leasable fisheries for K 0.54 trillion, and from aquaculture for K
                  2.16 trillion. Among all agricultural households, almost 5.08 percent were reported to be engaged
                  in fishing. In 2013–2014, the sector provided employment to nearly 1.27 million fishermen and 0.22
                  million fish farmers, excluding employments in trading, transportation, and processing industries. Out
                  of the households engaged in fishing, more than 80 percent did it mostly for home consumption while
                  the rest mostly sold their caught aquatic products. In terms of boats and equipment, a total of 28,401
                  vessels operated in Myanmar in 2014–2015, of which 90 percent were small fishing boats and the
                  rest offshore vessels. In the last decade the number of small fishing boats has decreased, and the
                  nonpowered boats have decreased more rapidly than boats with small engines. In 2014–2015 a total
                  of 2,718 sets of fishing gear were registered in the country, an increase of 23 percent over the last
                  decade.


                  POST-DISASTER SITUATION

                  The three crops hit hardest by the floods and landslides were paddy, groundnut, and sesame. All
                  three suffered extensive damage.  

                  Crops. As of September 16, 2015, the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation (MOAI) reported 601,116.3
                  ha of farmland (1,485,391 acres) had been flooded. This area represents around 20.4 percent of the
                  total cultivated area in the affected areas (2.95 million ha, or 7.30 million acres). Of this flooded area,
                  196,277.8 ha (485,013 acres) were totally destroyed and are not expected to yield any crop.

                  	   •	 In terms of absolute impacted area, the main crop affected was paddy. Cyclone Komen
                         hit Myanmar in the middle of the monsoon season, when most paddy had already been
                         transplanted. It is estimated that 537,442.7 ha of monsoon paddy area were flooded (1,328,050
                         acres, 27.4 percent of the area cultivated). Out of that area, paddy production in 376,644.9 ha
                         (930,710.0 acres) will be at least 5 percent lower than expected for a regular monsoon season.
                         In 160,797.8 ha (397,340 acres, 8.2 percent of the cultivated area) the production is totally lost
                         for this year.
                  	   •	 Most of the lost paddy plantations are in Ayeyarwady (102,058.9 ha, 252,193 acres), Bago
                         (19,823.1 ha, 48,984 acres), Sagaing (16,921.1 ha, 41,813 acres), and Yangon (15,400.3 ha,
                         38,055 acres). Those states/regions contain around 70 percent of the total area cultivated with
                         monsoon paddy this year (1,370,795.2 ha, 3,387,309 acres).
                  	   •	 Floods affected 6,227.3 ha of sesame (15,388 acres, 5.2 percent of the area cultivated); of this
                         area, 5,675.5 ha (13,980 acres, 4.7 percent of the cultivated area) were totally destroyed—
                         5,451.1 ha (13,470 acres) in Sagaing and 206.4 ha (510 acres) in Ayeyarwady.

	      •	 Floods affected 4,264.6 ha of pigeon peas (10,538 acres, 3.4 percent of the cultivated area);
          of this area, 913.8 ha (2,258 acres, 0.7 percent of the cultivated area) are lost for the season.
	      •	 Floods affected 4,041.2 ha of groundnuts (9,986 acres, 5.8 percent of the cultivated area); of
          this area, 774.2 ha (1,913 acres, 1.1 percent of the cultivated area) are completely lost for this
          season.
	      •	 Floods affected 2,848.2 ha of maize (7,038 acres, 9.9 of the cultivated area), of which 1,049.8
          ha (2,594 acres) were in Chin State and 1,758.4 ha (4,345 acres) were in Sagaing. In total,
          around 8 percent of the total maize cultivated area is totally lost.

Damages in the agriculture sector also include the impact of landslides on 2,235.1 ha (5,523 acres)
cultivated with paddy rice, tea, rubber, corn, and other crops in Chin and Shan.

Livestock. First estimates based on data from the Department of Livestock suggest that 274,260
animals were dead following the floods (around 0.6 percent of the herd in the affected areas, and
0.05 percent of the total national herd). Of these, 20,198 were large livestock (0.3 percent of the total
number of cows, buffalos, pigs, and goats in the affected areas), and 254,062 were small livestock
(0.7 percent of chickens and ducks in the affected areas). Some 219,408 animals raised for meat were
killed, along with 9,932 large animals that helped in productive functions. The effects on the livestock
subsector include damages to livestock shelters, beehives, and animal feed in Magway, Rakhine,
Sagaing, and Yangon, for a total value of K 108.2 million. The 325 livestock shelters damaged are
valued at K 48.8 million.

Fisheries. The impact on fisheries has been particularly severe. Data from the Department of
Fisheries indicate that around 13,571.7 ha (33,537 acres) of fish ponds and 21,343.6 ha (52,741
acres) of shrimp ponds have been damaged. This totals 34,915.4 ha (86,278 acres) of aquaculture
ponds damaged, or 18.9 percent of the total aquaculture area in 2014–2015. The most-affected
region is Rakhine, where 21,344 ha (52,741 acres) of shrimp aquaculture area were damaged, equal
to over 60 percent of the total damaged aquaculture area. Other regions affected by damage to fish
ponds are Ayeyarwady (6,473 ha, 15,995 acres), Yangon (4,095 ha, 10,118 acres), and Bago (2,764
ha, 6,830 acres). Forty fish ponds, of which 4 are publicly owned and 36 privately owned, have been
reported as damaged. Damages in fisheries include the impact on buildings, hatchery farms, electricity
rooms, and other facilities, as well as on fishing materials and equipment, including engines, boats,
and vehicles. With respect to inland fisheries, impact has been reported only for leasable fisheries,
of which 37 have been damaged. This impact will likely reduce production by around 78,427 metric
tons, or 24 percent of the expected production for this year (estimated at 326,672 metric tons).



ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE EFFECTS AND THE IMPACT OF THE
DISASTER ON THE SECTOR

The effects of the disaster in the agricultural sector have been substantial. Total effects, including
damages and losses, are estimated at K 737,199.6 million, of which K 62,179.4 million are damages
and K 675,020.3 million are losses (Table 5). Most of the damages have affected farmers, livestock
owners, and fishermen, and include impacts on plantations of perennial crops, warehouses and
storage facilities containing farmers’ saved seeds, animals and livestock, private infrastructure and
shelters, aquaculture facilities and fishery ponds, and fishing equipment, gear, and boats. Losses
include decreases in production from totally destroyed crop-growing areas and areas with lower
yields;33 decreases in production of meat, eggs, and honey; and smaller harvests from aquaculture
facilities and inland fisheries ponds. Losses also include the cost of animal feed and of renting animals
for draught power. In aggregate, total damages and losses represent 1.1 percent of the national GDP
for 2014–2015 and 4.2 percent of agricultural GDP for the same period.

                    The disaster has severely hit some of the main crop-growing regions, including Sagaing, Magway,
                    Ayeyarwady, and Bago (Table 6). These four regions produce around 92.4 percent of crops nationwide.

                    	    •	 In absolute terms, the most affected regions/states are Sagaing (agricultural damages and
                            losses of K 100,761.5 million, or 3.4 percent of agricultural regional GDP), Ayeyarwady (K
                            166,157.3 million, 5.6 percent), Bago (K 185,065.0 million, 9.6 percent), Mandalay (K 100,988.2
                            million, 6.6 percent), and Yangon (K 87,613.8 million, 10.1 percent).
                    	    •	 Even in regions with a smaller agricultural sector, the disaster has had a large impact. In Chin
                            State, the K 9,515.3 million of total damages and losses represents 9.2 percent of agricultural
                            regional GDP (4.1 percent of total regional GDP); in Rakhine State, the K 47,631.7 million of

                    Crops. Early estimates suggest that losses in crop production total K 335,210.1 million. Monsoon
                    paddy is the single most affected crop. The area of monsoon paddy production totally destroyed by
                    floods translates into 1,370.2 thousand metric tons (65.6 million baskets) of lost paddy production,
                    21.3 percent of the expected paddy production for this season. Of that lost production, 560.3 thousand
                    metric tons (26.8 million baskets) correspond to production areas that were totally destroyed, and the
                    rest to areas where production will be lower than expected. The value of the total losses is estimated
                    at almost K 312,324.7 million. The most affected regions are Ayeyarwady, with a loss of around
                    727.2 thousand metric tons (34.8 million baskets, 63.3 percent of the expected production), Sagaing
                    (193.1 thousand metric tons or 9.2 million baskets lost, 50 percent of the expected production),
                    Bago (185.7 thousand metric tons or 8.9 million baskets lost, 8.4 percent), and Yangon (121.72

thousand metric tons or 5.8 million baskets, 15.9 percent). Other crops affected (with a lower value of
production) are groundnuts, with a loss of 5.13 thousand metric tons (0.2 million baskets, 2.8 percent
of the expected production and valued at K 5,648.1 million), maize (14.35 thousand metric tons or
0.6 million baskets, 17.5 percent of the expected production and valued at K 2,730.7 million), and
sesame (5.51 thousand metric tons or 0.2 million baskets, 9.6 percent of the expected production
and valued at K 5,230.6 million).

Livestock. Total damages in the livestock subsector have been estimated at K 7,627.4 million, of
which damages due to dead animals are K 7,470.5 million. Regions most affected by damages due
to dead animals are Rakhine (K 6,099.7 million), Sagaing (K 660.4 million) and Ayeyarwady (K 296.5
million). Damages to private infrastructure have been estimated at K 108.2 million, and damages to
private animal shelters at K 48.8 million. Estimates of losses amount to K 10,150.5 million; the most
significant of these are reductions in revenues from available draught power (K 8,265.3 million), meat
production (K 1,122.2 million), and egg production (K 540.7 million).

Fisheries. Damages in the fisheries subsector have been relatively modest but losses were severe.
Damages are estimated at K 299.4 million. Aquaculture facilities and hatchery farms have been
damaged in Bago, Rakhine, Yangon, and Magway. Damages to fishing gear, equipment, and boats
total K 131.5 million; to aquaculture facilities K 42.1 million; and to fishery ponds K 78.4 million. The
losses in inland fisheries amount to K 303,425.2 million. In the aquaculture ponds, official losses in
the fish ponds are K 20,960.3 million, and in the shrimp ponds they are K 5,274.1 million, totaling
K 26,234.4 million. The most recent estimates, from 2013–2014, indicate that production value for
the leasable fisheries is no less than K 540 billion, and for the aquaculture ponds it is over K 2,159.8
billion. Based on these estimates, the total losses in inland fisheries represent 56.2 percent of the
total production value in the referred year, and the losses in aquaculture ponds represent 1.2 percent.

The loss of income for the 1.1 million people affected by the floods, and the extensive damage to
critical infrastructure linking farms to markets, will have negative multiplier effects on the supply of
agricultural produce. The flooding will negatively affect the main rice crop (harvested in October–
December), currently at an early reproductive stage.

Impact on crops. The disaster will most likely result in a reduced yield in all affected areas, especially
in the paddy fields. Reduced production will lead to a decrease in the demand for seasonal labor, and
this demand is expected to decrease even further during the upcoming monsoon harvesting season
and the following winter season.34 Reduced production will also have a direct impact on the incomes
available to farmers and workers. In addition to the immediate risk posed to food security, lower
household incomes will diminish access to agricultural inputs (mainly seeds and fertilizers) necessary
for the upcoming winter and summer agricultural seasons. Replanting has already been carried out
in some regions/states, but the expected yield in these areas will quite likely be lower due to the
delay in sowing and the impossibility of using good agricultural practices. To cope with the income
losses, people are borrowing food and seeds from local markets, or taking out loans from money
lenders at high interest rates (minimum 10 percent). Agricultural banks do not provide loans to buy
small livestock, which are an important economic asset. The production decrease will a have longer-
term impacts on household income and food consumption which may lead to increased economic
vulnerability and food insecurity.

In addition to the loss of their primary crops and decreases in household incomes, farmers face other
difficulties. Agricultural land is still covered by water as well as mud, sand, and debris. This situation
might hamper winter and summer crop production. After the floodwaters receded, most farmers
cultivated varieties of crops with a shorter growing period, largely by spreading seeds on the land
as opposed to transplanting and sowing. Farmers also lacked the cash to hire laborers for weeding.

34
   The proposed recovery and rehabilitation activities may offer alternative employment opportunities and income sources that
could on a temporary basis offer relief to workers affected by a drop in demand for farm-related seasonal labor. One example
could be setting up cash-for-work programs that paid delta farmers to reclaim and rehabilitate streams, ponds, and creeks in
order to improve water retention for crop irrigation, support aquaculture, and reduce the likelihood of flooding.

                  Impact on livestock. The damage to the livestock subsector—primarily the death of animals but also
                  damage to infrastructure such as animal shelters, beehives, and feed stock—will reduce productive
                  physical assets and have an impact on the food, nutrition, and economic security of the population
                  affected. Significant loss of small livestock will particularly affect women’s livelihoods and household
                  food consumption.

                  Losses of draught power caused by the death of livestock were also considered in monetary terms.
                  Larger animal such as buffalos and cows are often used for land preparation and transportation
                  of goods during the agricultural season. The loss of these animals could also further constrain the
                  capacity of affected households to prepare land for the upcoming agricultural winter season. The
                  farmers who lost animals will need to rely on third-parties rental, imposing additional costs to their
                  household budgets.

                  Impact on fisheries. The damages to fisheries mainly refer to fish and shrimp pond infrastructure that
                  was damaged by the floods. The impacts on boats, fishing gear, nets, and other fishing equipment
                  was also considered as part of the calculation. Most of the impacts of the disaster on open freshwater
                  fishing were due to rising water levels in the rivers, which prevented fishers from continuing their
                  fishing activities. The loss of almost 35,000 ha of fish and shrimp ponds from floods and landslides
                  has resulted in a loss of income and food for fishers, which is likely to lead to a lower nutritional status.
                  Several fish ponds were flooded and most of the farmed fish escaped, resulting in high production
                  losses. In Rakhine alone, more than 20,000 ha of shrimp ponds were affected.

                  The fishery/aquaculture losses were due mainly to a lower catch in inland waters (especially rivers),
                  a result of fishers’ inability to continue their activities in high waters coupled with reduced access
                  to fishing boats and gear after the flood. Losses also included reduced production in fish/shrimp
                  ponds. In fact, the farmed fish and shrimp were lost or died due to the flood and could not be used
                  to generate income (sale) or for consumption. This situation could also lead to an increased level of
                  malnutrition, especially among households relying on fish proteins as part of their diet.


                  RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION STRATEGY

                  The estimated cost of recovery and reconstruction for the agriculture, livestock, and
                  fisheries subsectors is K 395,577.4 million (Table 7). This cost was estimated using the DALA
                  (damage, loss and needs assessment) methodology. The estimation of financial needs to achieve
                  post-disaster recovery and reconstruction is based, respectively, on the value of the production
                  losses35 and the value of damages to physical assets.36

                  These interventions will build on and continue the efforts of the government of Myanmar to delivery
                  an early recovery response. Until September 16, 2015, this early response included distribution of
                  rice seeds for replanting (94 metric tons); assistance of rice food (K 98 million); feed supplement
                  and animal feed (over K 147 million); distribution of small livestock (2,500 ducks, 5,000 chickens) for
                  restocking in Ayeyarwady and Sagaing Regions (over K 10 million); and quick small-scale vocational
                  training on pasture management, animal feeding management, and animal caring.




                  35
                     Economic recovery activities are essentially short- to medium-term interventions designed to mitigate and shorten the
                  sectoral, macroeconomic, and personal or household disaster impact. Recovery activities in the agricultural sector normally
                  include replanting the crops eliminated by the disaster, preventing and controlling animal disease, providing animal food and
                  replanting pasture, restocking fry and fingerlings, and making in-kind donation of tools and gear for the fishermen. The amount
                  of financing or needs for recovery is estimated on the basis of a fraction of the value of production losses (usually 35 to 45
                  percent of the production losses).
                  36
                     Reconstruction refers to the replacement or repair of physical assets destroyed or damaged by disasters. Following a post-
                  disaster “building back better” strategy, those assets are rebuilt with the inclusion of improved, disaster-resilient standards
                  to ensure continued availability after disasters, and to reduce the negative impact of such events in the future. The needs
                  for reconstruction in the agriculture sector are estimated as a function of the value of assessed damage, using a coefficient
                  ranging from 1.25 to 1.45.

OF FLOODS AND LANDSLIDES JULY–SEPTEMBER 2015



                  RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION PLAN

                  In the short term (up to the first four months), the main priorities for each subsector account
                  for K 229,472.9 million. Recovery in the agriculture sector would need to focus on immediate
                  activities aimed at the restoration of production levels.

                  The recovery actions for the crops subsector are estimated to cover the following:
                  	 •	 Distribution of seeds and others planting material, fertilizers, pesticides, machinery for land
                        preparation, and pumps for areas where water resources are available in the post- and pre-
                        monsoon seasons and where supplementary irrigation is feasible. The cost for providing this
                        assistance is estimated at K 13,476.1 million.
                  	 •	 Support for off-monsoon rice and crops diversification in the Ayeyarwady delta (Ayeyarwady
                        Region, Bago Region, and Yangon Region) and other affected areas where feasible. This
                        intervention will provide quick relief in one of the worst-hit areas, which depends heavily on
                        rain-fed rice cropping, and it will also pave the way to diversification of the cropping system.
                        The intervention consists of two components: (i) prepare land using small farm machinery and
                        low-lift pumps (and diesel) for supplementary irrigation (K 31,564.4 million); and (ii) support
                        refinancing and soft-lending needs of affected farmers. The first component primarily aims to
                        improve productivity, so that both post- and pre-monsoon crops can be cultivated in most of
                        the delta regions with access to fresh water.37 The second component will need to address the
                        total refinancing needs in the Ayeyarwady Delta of K 42,204.3 million, and the total soft-lending
                        needs of K 151,809.9 million. The recommendation is that half the soft-lending needs be met
                        in the short term, and the other half in the medium term.38

                  The recovery intervention for the livestock subsector aims to build on and expand the early response
                  delivered by the government, and could include distribution of animal feed, vaccinations, and
                  veterinary services to livestock owners, at a cost of K 3,686.8 million.

                  The recovery intervention for the fisheries subsector could include distribution of seeds, fingerlings,
                  and medicines for aquaculture facilities and inland fisheries ponds, at a cost of K 62,635.3 million.

                  In the medium term (within the first 12 months), the prioritized interventions are estimated
                  to amount to K 166,104.5 million. Reconstruction could include the following: replacement of tools
                  and machinery; restocking of lost animal feed stock; reconstruction/rehabilitation of agriculture and
                  irrigation infrastructure, fish ponds, small farmer-managed irrigation systems, and privately owned
                  small farmers’ embankments; and rehabilitation of agricultural land.

                  The reconstruction needs for the crops subsector include the following:
                  	 •	 Rehabilitating landslide-affected areas with heavy machinery in the Chin and Shan States,
                        estimated at K 8,008.4 million.
                  	 •	 Restoring the stock of saved seeds and planting materials of affected farmers across the
                        country, estimated at K 69,512.4 million.
                  	 •	 Rehabilitating landslide-affected plantations of perennial crops in the Chin and Shan States,
                        estimated at K 1,185.0 million. This intervention focuses on lost area planted with tea and
                        rubber.
                  	 •	 Supporting refinancing and soft-lending needs so affected farmers can grow off-monsoon rice
                        and diversify crops in Ayeyarwady delta, estimated at K 75,904.9 million, corresponding to the
                        other half of the total estimated soft-lending needs in the delta.

                  37
                     For example pre-monsoon jute, rain-fed rice, and post-monsoon oilseeds/pulses were highly successful in the 1970s. In the
                  present time, crops that can be cultivated in this way throughout the year include sesame in the pre-monsoon season, rain-fed
                  rice in the monsoons, and pulses , maize, sunflower, and groundnuts in after the monsoon (cool season).
                  38
                     As explained in the chapter on the banking and finance sector, the estimates of loans needing refinancing and the soft-
                  lending needs do not only relate to Myanmar Agriculture Development Bank operations, and they assume a large proportion of
                  loans from informal lenders, which are outside the usual scope of the financial sector operations. As the scale of doubtful loans
                  is confirmed and the formal lenders build up their capacities, the financial sector could be in a better position to meet partially
                  the refinancing and financing needs estimated for the sector.

The reconstruction needs for the livestock subsector include the following:
	 •	 Rehabilitating and rebuilding private infrastructure of livestock owners, including animal
      shelters, estimated at K 227.5 million.
	 •	 Restocking animal herds and scaling up capacity building in animal management, animal
      health, and pasture management in affected townships. The total cost of these activities is
      estimated in K 10,832.2 million.

The reconstruction needs for the fisheries subsector include the following:
	 •	 Restoring fishing gear, equipment, and boats, estimated at K 190.7 million.
	 •	 Rehabilitating aquaculture facilities and ponds, estimated at K 174.8 million.
	 •	 Rehabilitating and rebuilding buildings and other facilities, estimated at K 68.6 million.


RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION IMPLEMENTATION

Implementation will be carried out under the leadership of MOAI and MLFRD, with support
from development partners. Given the urgency of the situation, a fast-track institutional mechanism
with the required delegation of authority will be applied, and activities under both recovery and
reconstruction will have to start simultaneously. Both ministries can avail themselves of and deploy
the necessary capacity and procedures for setting up such a mechanism, and can implement the
proposed activities.

Nevertheless, delivery within the indicated time frame remains a challenge, given other likely country-
specific constraints (for instance, whether the domestic market can ensure a quick supply of the
required inputs). As explained in the chapter on the banking and finance sector, it is not currently
feasible to reach the full amount of refinancing and lending needs identified for the crops subsector.
These needs are far higher than what the current financial sector in Myanmar can manage, even with
cash injections and capacity growth in the near future. Even assuming an increase in the capacity
of the formal financial system in the near future, a large proportion of the identified needs in the
agriculture sector will remain unmet.

The short-term recovery interventions would aim at enabling farmers to continue with their agricultural
activities for the upcoming winter and summer seasons (distribution of seeds, fertilizers, etc.), as well
as rehabilitating the agricultural land covered by sediment and debris. In this context, direct cash
transfers to the affected households could help them quickly buy inputs and invest in agricultural
production recovery. In addition, extension services are required for production of typical dry season
crops, such as beans and pulses, oil seeds, paddy, maize, and sugarcane. Dry season paddy usually
requires irrigation systems with access to water, which cover only 15 percent of total monsoon paddy
area. Livestock restocking and reconstruction of animal shelters, together with distribution of animal
feed and vaccines, will be given utmost priority; the most vulnerable households—for which livestock
represent a significant source of food, nutrition, an income security—should be targeted. To restore
the fishery and aquaculture subsector, fish/shrimp ponds should be rehabilitated, and new fishing
equipment, together with fingerlings and fish feed, should be provided.

Medium-term interventions should focus on strengthening the food value chains, ensuring the
integration of smallholders, mainstreaming crop diversification, promoting adoption of good
agricultural practices, and implementing trainings, as well as developing climate change adaptation
measures that contribute to the disaster recovery and reconstruction.

Recovery and reconstruction interventions will pay particular attention to existing disparities between
landless poor rural households, smallholder farmers, and large landowners. A robust information
system consisting of data collection, analysis, and monitoring and evaluation will be put in place to
ensure efficient, transparent data that can disaggregated by gender.

                  SECTOR ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY

                  The assessment is based mainly on secondary information and on interviews with high-level
                  government senior advisors and government staff from the MOAI and the MLFRD. Meetings with
                  government officials were held at the beginning and the end of the analysis process to validate the
                  information received and to seek endorsement on the estimates of damages and losses. The team
                  of high-level national senior advisors was convened by the government to assist and provide the
                  assessment team with expert knowledge on the sectoral background, context, and trends.

                  Baseline data were sourced from the Agricultural Census 2010 and the Population Census 2014.
                  Other relevant sources were agriculture country briefings, market-price bulletins elaborated by the
                  MOAI, and reports from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, LIFT, World Bank,
                  and other international organizations working in Myanmar. The post-disaster quantitative data on
                  damages and losses were sourced from the government, and consisted mostly of notes reporting on
                  and assessing post-disaster data from MOAI and MLFRD. Data were collected through reports from
                  the regional offices for each department at the central level in Nay Pyi Taw.

                  Given some limitations in the available and reported data, losses in crop production and artisanal
                  fisheries might not be fully accurate, and will likely be overestimated:
                  	 •	 MOAI-reported regular yields for paddy rice during monsoon season are higher than those
                          of other available sources. Yields are assumed to apply to wet paddy, so a moisture-related
                          correction should be applied.
                  	 •	 Specific information on the damaged irrigation schemes in the affected areas was unavailable.
                          Thus estimates on crop losses factor in lower yields only during the monsoon season, when
                          the floods hit. But that impact on lower yields will likely extend to the following seasons and last
                          until those schemes are fully rehabilitated.
                  	 •	 Disaggregated data on catches in inland fisheries were not available. Production volume and
                          prices for inland fisheries are based on FAO-led surveys in selected areas carried out in 2013–
                          2014. Production volume was corrected assuming the same growth rate of production as
                          reported in the Fishery Statistics 2015 (published by the Department of Fisheries, MLFRD).
                          Prices were assumed to range between US$1.16 and US$3.19 per kg of catching, and were
                          later corrected with a 7.5 percent inflation rate. Both the assumptions and the corrections were
                          discussed with and validated by members of the national senior advisors team.
                  	 •	 Disaggregated data on aquaculture production, both amount and production value of fish and
                          shrimp ponds, were unavailable. Thus the estimates of aquaculture losses were elaborated at
                          a national aggregate level based on the expert knowledge of national senior advisors and on
                          information provided by private stakeholders currently operating in the subsector.

                  Water Resource Management (Irrigation and Flood Control)
                  SUMMARY

                  The mid-2105 floods had a severe impact on water resources and irrigation infrastructure.
                  In higher mountain regions, high discharge rates and debris caused damage to infrastructure such
                  as spillways, weirs, and river embankments. In lower areas, wide spatial flooding damaged irrigation
                  infrastructure and weakened dikes. No major damage to key infrastructure such as dams was
                  reported. The overall cost of damage amounts to K 13,277 million. All damaged assets reported in
                  this chapter were publicly owned, and no losses were identified for this sector (losses in agricultural
                  production are reported in the agriculture sector chapter).

                  Myanmar is endowed with abundant water resources. High annual rainfall is common, and river
                  discharge tends to vary spatially and by season. Water resources thus play a key role in disaster risk
                  and require sound management—though this remains a major challenge in the country. Given that
                  most of the population relies on agriculture, Myanmar has significant opportunities for fully developing
                  its irrigation potential. Overall recovery needs in the short term (four months) and medium term (up to
                  one year) amount to K 20,669 million and should aim to do the following:

                  	   •	 Restore damaged infrastructure, including embankments and sluice gates for the protection of
                         tidal sea water intrusion and embankments protecting urban areas as well as agricultural land
                         from river floods
                  	   •	 Restore secondary/tertiary irrigation infrastructure
                  	   •	 Perform thorough safety check on key infrastructure , including all affected dams and weirs
                  	   •	 Conduct strategic dredging in major drainage systems and in rivers
                  	   •	 Consider key no-regret investments in water infrastructure
                  	   •	 Conduct an initial capacity gap analysis and develop capacity building and training strategies

                  Considering Myanmar’s fragmented institutional setup and reactive way of dealing with water
                  resources, the most important recommendation is to move toward integrated management of
                  water resources. This includes
                  	 •	 Strengthening the ongoing work of the National Water Resources Committee (NRWC) on the
                        development of a sound legal and institutional basis for improved water resources management
                  	 •	 Strengthening technical and managerial capacity and financial resources
                  	 •	 Adopting key approaches for planning, operating, monitoring, and forecasting measures
                  	 •	 Strengthen the consideration of water related no-regret investments


                  PRE-DISASTER CONTEXT

                  Sector background. Myanmar is endowed with rich water resources. Rainfall is abundant—
                  around 2,300 mm per year—though with high variability between regions, from 500 mm in the
                  central dry zone to 6,000 mm in the costal and mountain regions. The levels of the many rivers also
                  vary significantly between monsoon and dry season. Most rivers are entirely on Myanmar national
                  territory, a great advantage for river basin management. Myanmar is affected by tropical cyclones,
                  which cause flooding and droughts; these impacts will likely intensify because of climate change.
                  The mostly undeveloped rivers carry large amounts of sediments, and unrestricted mining and poor
                  sanitation make water quality an increasing concern. Groundwater availability is a significant but yet
                  unquantified resource.

                  Water resources are also the basis for and a key element in many other sectors. Most of Myanmar’s
                  rural poor are located in the dry zone and along the Ayeyarwady delta, and they rely on water
                  resources and agriculture for their livelihood. Out of all the cultivated agricultural area, only 12 percent
                  is irrigated. Seventy percent of Myanmar’s irrigated agriculture production is located in the dry zone,
                  although most of these schemes function below their potential and there is great opportunity for

28
                                                                                                        productive sector




irrigation improvement and expansion. Moreover, Myanmar has yet to realize the full potential of
different water harvesting approaches in different regions. The Ayeyarwady Integrated River Basin
Management Project has started to initiate such approaches.

Myanmar has a large hydropower potential of around 100,000 megawatts (MW), of which only
2,600 MW has been developed. The government is increasingly interested in sustainably developing
hydropower, and wishes to manage controversies over hydropower developments better than in the
past. If not well managed, water resources constitute one of the biggest potential natural hazards in
Myanmar, as this latest disaster proves. Any disaster risk management strategy will have to include a
comprehensive approach to forecasting rainfall events as well as manage river discharge and reduce
the impact of damages water resource management infrastructure on the economy and livelihoods.

Legal and institutional framework. A legal and institutional framework to manage water resources
in Myanmar is being developed. The current fragmented framework includes outdated sectoral laws,
involves over 34 government agencies in water management, and faces daunting capacity and
budgetary challenges. No single institution has the overall mandate to manage water resources,
and there is no river basin organizations authority to manage water at basin level. Although some
river basin organizations have recently emerged and water user associations exist, their functions
and mandate are unclear. The National Water Resources Committee (NWRC) was established in
2013 to promote cooperation between the sector agencies. The National Water Policy includes
considerations for establishing river basin organizations. Myanmar currently has one research-based
river basin organization, namely the Ayeyarwady River Basin Research Organization, a member of
the Network of Asian River Basin Organizations. Other socially active organizations that voice their
concerns on damming the rivers, however, do not function as river basin organizations. Annex 4
provides a more detailed description of the water resources sector in Myanmar.


POST-DISASTER SITUATION

Effects on water resources and irrigation infrastructure and assets. The widespread floods and
landslides that occurred between July and August 2015 had a severe impact on water resources
and irrigation infrastructure. The biggest damages were caused by extreme discharge rates in rivers,
which not only damaged assets but also caused soil erosion and severe flooding of farmland. In the
Ayeyarwady delta, the floods covered a large spatial area; they caused less physical damage than in
mountainous areas but had more impact on the basic structure of dikes and dams.

                     In the mountainous region of central and northern Myanmar, rainfall levels and river discharge rates
                     reached unprecedented levels. Most residents said they had never seen such levels before. The
                     consequence was damage to dam spillways (Figure 16) and river embankments, along with erosion
                     of side slopes and the structure of weirs. Though no breach of dams, weirs, or large irrigation canals
                     occurred, the situation was very serious, with water levels rising dangerously high in some reservoirs. In
                     the Magway Region, for instance, water levels in the Mone Dam reservoir reached 1 m below the crest.

                     The floods also caused morphological changes. River banks eroded, in turn damaging and threatening
                     the stability of roads and other infrastructure. In numerous locations, water overtopped river banks
                     and flooded communities with water levels far above normal. In one location at the Mone River, the
                     team witnessed flood marks of more than 10 m above the current water levels (Figure 17 and Figure
                     18). In several locations, newly eroded river channels cut through existing agricultural areas. Along
                     riverbeds and floodplains, remaining wooden debris indicated the level of sedimentation that occurred
                     during the event. The Dutch Disaster Risk Reduction Team reported up to 3 m of silt deposited in
                     some locations. It should be noted that rivers are naturally dynamic in Myanmar, due to the highly
                     variable monsoon climate and the high sediment levels. River bank erosion is often a natural and
                     healthy process, although the level of risk can be quite high if assets are placed inappropriately.

In the Ayeyarwady delta, inundation occurred in the floodplain, with relatively low flood levels over a
relatively large area. This flooding especially affected unprotected villages and settlements in flood-
prone areas. Further affected were agriculture areas and related flood-protection and irrigation
infrastructure, from larger diversion canals to tertiary irrigation infrastructure such as gates and
embankments. Breaches occurred at several of the small-scale dams, especially those built with
natural materials, but also took place at some of the concrete-reinforced embankment structures.


                                                                                                             Figure 19.

Increased risk and vulnerabilities. As described above, flooding did not cause any major failure
of key infrastructure like dams or dikes. Damage to spillways and weirs reached several million U.S.
dollars in cost, but did not impede the flow of water. Similarly, damages to irrigation canals and
embankments are high in the number, but do not constitute a structural failure of a whole irrigation
system. Initial repairs, including temporary repairs with sandbags to irrigation canals to prevent
inundation of agricultural farm plots and restore the flow of water for irrigation, were done fairly soon
after the event by responsible authorities.

The disaster did expose, however, the overall level of risk and vulnerability that exists in Myanmar. No
coherent and systematic analysis of the underlying causes of this flood event is being undertaken;
there is no comprehensive collection and monitoring of data, modeling and forecasting, or risk
analysis. Flood protection standards are not periodically updated based on new information and
analysis.


ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE EFFECTS AND THE IMPACT OF THE
DISASTER ON THE SECTOR

Most reported damages (about 77 percent) are to dam spillways, river embankments, and main
irrigation networks. More than 90 percent of the damaged water resources and irrigation assets
are located in three regions: Magway Region (52 percent), Rakhine State (24 percent), and Sagaing
Region (15 percent).

                    All assets reported damaged (Table 8) were publicly owned. There may have been damages and
                    losses to privately owned assets, but these were not identified or quantified within this sectoral
                    assessment. Possible damage to private assets was included in the agriculture sector chapter. No
                    losses were reported by the government agencies involved in the Myanmar post-flood and -landslide
                    assessment. Potential losses, such as decreases in revenues due to hydropower station downtime,
                    would be calculated under the electricity sector chapter.

RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION STRATEGY

Long-term vision. Water resources are a fundamental part of Myanmar’s overall development, and
any long-term vision for the sector will need to be based on interactions and linkages with other sectors
like agriculture (through irrigation systems), energy (through hydropower generation), transport (using
rivers for water transport, industry, cultural/ecotourism, water and sanitation (domestic water supply),
and disaster risk management.

The short- and medium-term recovery and reconstruction strategy therefore has to be embedded
in a larger vision of integrated water resources management in Myanmar. This is not only a matter
of policies, investments, and implementation. It further requires a shift in thinking from a reactive to
a proactive approach to managing water resources. In order to provide long-term guidance for the
proposed recovery strategy, we briefly describe key aspects of sound integrated water resources
management and then offer details on the short- and mid-term recovery plans.  

To manage water as a valuable resource as well mitigate disaster risks, Myanmar should
	 •	 Provide a sound legal and institutional basis for improved water resources management
	 •	 Strengthen technical and managerial capacity and financial resources
	 •	 Adopt key approaches for planning, operating, monitoring, and forecasting measures
	 •	 Consider key water-related no-regret investments

Strengthening of the National Water Resources Committee. Considering the fragmentation of
institutions responsible for water resources, we recommend giving the NWRC more operational
responsibility to manage water resources in an integrated way. Lessons should be drawn from these
recent floods to provide the committee with the mandate to convene responsible institutions and work
toward more coordinated approaches for water resources management and flood risk management.

Policy and regulatory development. Following the Myanmar National Water Policy introduced in
2014, the next step is a comprehensive water law. This also includes developing regulations, which
will most likely affect the implementation, enforcement, and ultimate effectiveness of the overall
Myanmar legal framework. In particular, effective coordination of policy across states and regions will
require a legal basis at the union level.

River basin–level planning. Water resources are ideally managed at the river basin level. A river
basin management plan would be the foundation of decision making on water allocation, disaster
risk analysis, and environmental management. Efforts to develop a sound river basin management
plan for the Ayeyarwady River basin are currently ongoing and should be continued; as demand and
capacity increases, this plan could be scaled up to apply to other river basins in Myanmar.

Dam safety. Given the large number of medium-size and large dams and the key role of these dams
in irrigation, flood protection, and hydropower, dam safety strategies must be developed. As a first
step, a comprehensive dam safety assessment should be undertaken. Neighboring countries have
experience with dam safety, from which best practices and lessons can be drawn.

Flood forecasting and risk analysis. To manage the impact of water resources on natural hazards in
Myanmar, flood forecasting needs to be an integral part of disaster risk management. Expanding and
modernizing hydrometeorological observation systems are central to this effort, along with building
capacity to collect, monitor, and analyze data and establishing an early warning system. To minimize
the potential impact of floods and make informed investment decisions, a risk analysis should be
undertaken to identify the potential risk of flooding. Based on this analysis, investment decisions for
infrastructure investments can be made, and settlement and land-use policies can be devised to
minimize damage to the population and losses to economic production.

Stakeholders’ involvement. To reduce the impact of floods, civil society and other stakeholders (such
as farmer associations, authorities responsible for spatial planning, etc.) should be involved in flood

                                                                                                                         33

                  and the approaches to managing them, they can not only reduce the potentially harmful impact of
                  floods, but can also increase acceptance of the decisions taken in connection with managing floods.

                  Overall capacity building. Myanmar capacity-building challenges are daunting. In order to create
                  effective water management institutions, proper staffing and funding are necessary. Capacity needs
                  are wide, from modern project management skills, financial management, and procurement, to more
                  technical skills such as knowledge of hydrology, impact forecasting, and environmental and social
                  management. Meeting these needs requires offering training opportunities as well as cooperation
                  with international organizations, academic institutions, and NGOs.


                  RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION PLAN

                  Table 10 provides an overview of recovery initiatives, the time frames involved, and estimated costs.
                  The principle of build back better has been taken into account.

                  Short-term and medium-term recovery needs. As described above, the short- and medium-
                  term strategy for recovery should not only seek to repair damages, build back better, and improve
                  resilience; the measures taken should be part of a broader vision for developing water resources
                  management in Myanmar. The assessment has identified the following measures as priority initiatives:
                  	 •	 Restore damaged infrastructure such as spillways, weirs, embankments, and irrigation
                          canals.
                  	 •	 Restore secondary and tertiary irrigation infrastructure, including drainage infrastructure,
                          to allow communities to plant crops in time for the dry season and limit economic losses.
                  	 •	 Perform a thorough safety check on key infrastructure, including all dams and weirs.
                          Given the lack of comprehensive dam safety measures and the water levels in the reservoirs,
                          any potential impact of the flood on structures should be investigated. This includes analysis of
                          sedimentation levels in reservoirs and rivers.
                  	 •	 Conduct strategic dredging of sedimentation in reservoirs, rivers, and canals.
                  	 •	 Consider key no-regret investments in water infrastructure, e.g., modernizing and
                          expanding hydrometeorological gauging stations.
                  	 •	 Conduct an initial capacity gap analysis and develop capacity building and training
                          strategies for key managerial and technical staff.

                  Longer-term initiatives
                  Based on the recovery plans discussed with individual government departments, several larger
                  initiatives have been proposed, though no comprehensive feasibility studies have been undertaken
                  on which to base them. The scope and reasons for these initiatives are part of the larger sector
                  development agenda and go beyond the impacts of this assessment; hence the initiatives have not
                  been included in the proposed recovery needs. They should be seen as options within a broader
                  framework of improving river basin management or disaster risk reduction in Myanmar and are
                  subject to further viability analysis. They include the following:

                  	   •	 Improve the flood protection level in the Ayeyarwady, Chindwin, Kaladan, Sittaung, and Thanlwin
                         river basins by increasing the height of the river banks, subject to feasibility. This activity should
                         be guided by spatial planning and flood plain restoration. Estimated cost: around K 47 million;
                         type of activity: disaster risk reduction/build back better.
                  	   •	 Carry out comprehensive and repeated dredging of sedimentation in rivers and reservoirs. This
                         activity should include research studies for stable channel regime in respective rivers with the
                         objective of gradually reducing the cost of dredging in the future. Estimated time horizon: five
                         years; estimated cost: K 56 million; type of activity: disaster risk reduction/build back better.
                  	   •	 Invest in pumps and tube wells to expand irrigation in dry season for higher agricultural
                         productivity and cropping intensity. Investment should be based on studies analyzing economic
                         and environmental viability and combined with implementation of the groundwater law drafted

                  RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION IMPLEMENTATION

                  To implement the recovery plan most effectively and sustainably, it should be aligned with other
                  ongoing sector developments. The National Water Resources Committee should take the lead in
                  coordinating international organizations, donors, and other organizations contributing to this recovery
                  strategy and overall sector vision. This includes the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank, and
                  the governments of Japan, Norway, and the Netherlands, who have active engagement in water
                  resources management.

                  With World Bank support, Myanmar has created a programmatic framework to support the water
                  resources sector in several projects. The first of these is the Ayeyarwady Integrated River Basin
                  Management Project, which provides International Development Association funding of US$100
                  million for (i) water resource management institutions, decision support systems, and capacity
                  building; (ii) hydromet observation and information systems modernization; and (iii) Ayeyarwady River
                  navigation enhancements. Within this programmatic framework, recovery measures outlined above
                  could be considered as future projects, e.g. a dam safety project.


                  SECTOR ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY

                  The methodology for this assessment followed the international standard methodology of the Post-
                  Disaster Needs Assessment framework described in the Introduction to this report. The team prepared
                  the assessment under the assumption that all infrastructure assets reported in this chapter, such as
                  dams, weirs, embankments, canals, irrigation systems etc. were publicly owned. Any privately owned
                  irrigation systems were considered to be on private farmland property and therefore reported under
                  agriculture damages. Similarly, losses that were linked to the water resource management sector
                  (such as shutdown of a hydropower station of a dam) were reported under the electricity sector
                  chapter.

                  The team did not do any primary data collection for this chapter; it collected data from government
                  agencies, as follows:
                  	 •	 Irrigation Department (Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation)
                  	 •	 Department of Water Utilization (Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation)
                  	 •	 Department of Water and River Improvement (Ministry of Transport)
                  	 •	 Department of Inland Water Transport (Ministry of Transport)
                  	 •	 Department of Meteorology and Hydrology (Ministry of Transport)
                  	 •	 General Administration Department (Ministry of Home Affairs)

                  The departments at union level received the data on damages and recovery from the respective
                  state/regional authorities. The team had the opportunity to undertake a two-day field to one township
                  affected by the floods, Phwin Phyu Township in Magway State. The sites visited included two dams
                  (Mone Dam and Kyeeo Kyeewa Dam), the Mezali Weir, and irrigation canals. The damage seen at
                  these sites constitutes some of the largest individual parts of the reported damage.

                  Industry and Commerce
                  SUMMARY

                  Many of the flood-affected areas are within the vicinity of industrial activities and have had
                  an impact on the commercial sector as a result of lost sales. About 26–27 percent of industrial
                  establishments are located in states and region affected by the flooding. Agribusiness and fishery
                  processing industries, particularly rice mills, edible oil mills, and packaging, have been the most
                  heavily affected. The most common form of commercial activity in the affected areas is retail and
                  distribution, which includes individual retailers, larger retail chains, and wholesale distributors. Access
                  to finance is a major constraint to the private sector; limited access makes management of business
                  cycles and unexpected events more challenging.

                  The flooding is likely to cause noticeable losses for businesses trying to recover activities to
                  pre-disaster levels. A rapid survey conducted as part of the assessment found that food processing
                  was the most affected industrial sector, for these reasons: (i) direct impact of flooding, landslides,
                  and heavy rain on assets (building and facilities); (ii) disruption in operations due to insufficient input
                  supplies; and (iii) disruption in operations due to damaged infrastructure. Infrastructure allows access
                  to inputs and delivery of goods to markets and is therefore crucial to industry and commerce. More
                  specifically, agroprocessing activities depend on roads and bridge for timely receipt of inputs (rice,
                  beans/pulses) and for delivery of processed goods to buyers in the next stage of the value chain or
                  to end consumers.


                  PRE-DISASTER CONTEXT

                  Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) dominate the economy of Myanmar. Of the
                  approximately 127,000 registered enterprises in Myanmar, 99 percent are classified as SMEs. An
                  additional 600,000 microenterprises, mostly informal family-run and cottage industries, are estimated
                  to be operating in Myanmar. This is true in the areas affected by the flooding and along the various
                  values chains that have been affected by shortages of raw materials, primarily agricultural products
                  such as rice paddy, beans/pulses, sesame, and wood.

                  As they are in most countries, industrial and commercial firms in Myanmar are clustered
                  in large and dense cities, specifically Yangon and Mandalay. Yangon and Mandalay are key
                  locations for industry and trade agglomeration in Myanmar; 47–50 percent of the country’s business
                  establishments are located in these areas, and they contribute 73–75 percent of total sales of
                  Myanmar’s manufacturing and commerce sectors. In addition to sourcing raw materials from abroad,
                  manufacturing firms in Yangon and Mandalay also source their inputs, primarily agricultural inputs,
                  domestically from other states/regions in Myanmar. The commercial sector in Yangon and Mandalay
                  also facilitates the movement of goods from outer cities through retail and distribution channels and
                  across borders, e.g., goods move through Muse for trade with China and through Thamu for trade
                  with India.

                  About 26–27 percent of industrial establishments are located in states and regions affected
                  by the flooding—for example, Hinthada in Ayeyarwady Region; Monywa in Sagaing Region,
                  and Ponnagyun in Rakhine State. Table 11 presents a list of key industrial and commercial activities
                  located in the affected regions and states. Ayeyarwady Region, located in the fertile river delta, is
                  the largest rice producer and home to 30 percent of the total number of rice millers in Myanmar.
                  Processing of beans and pulses, on the other hand, is typically handled by larger wholesalers in
                  Yangon. Wood processing, textiles manufacture, and mineral processing (copper and gold) take
                  place in Sagaing, Magway, and Kachin State, although food processing is the staple industry in
                  these areas. Fish processing and tourism-related services (hotels, cafes, and restaurants) are
                  important activities in Rakhine State. Meanwhile, small food-processing operations (e.g. bakery,
                  condiments) are common in most states/regions and are typically carried out by small enterprises.

Small manufacturing operations, such as steel crafting, furniture, and auto repair, are also commonly
carried out by small enterprises.

Retail and distribution is the most common form of commercial activity in the flood-affected
areas. This activity includes individual retailers, larger retail chains, and wholesale distributors.
Distribution activities tend to be located in regions/states with larger populations, such as Ayeyarwady,
Magway, Sagaing, and Rakhine. In the areas there are typically aggregators of agriculture products,
which have links to larger distribution/trading hubs such as in Mandalay and Yangon, from which
products are distributed to the entire country and exported.

Access to finance is a major constraint for the private sector; limited access makes managing
business cycles and unexpected events more challenging. The World Bank Group’s Enterprise
Survey carried out in 2014 as part of the Investment Climate Assessment cited access to finance as
the greatest obstacle in doing business in Myanmar. This survey of over 1,000 firms indicated that
the financial sector is not playing a sufficiently large role as a financial intermediary and that, instead,
most financing needs are covered by firms’ own funds. According to the survey, a mere 1 percent of
fixed asset investment is financed by bank borrowing, and 92 percent of firms responding said they
relied on their own funds—a higher level than in comparator countries. Meanwhile, only 30 percent
of firms reported having a bank account—the lowest level among all the comparator countries. Of
the small, medium, and large enterprises sampled in the Enterprise Survey, an average 23 percent of
firms cited access to finance as the main obstacle to doing business when asked to select from a list
of major obstacles. Access to finance is also among the top three obstacles cited by firms across all
firm sizes and the main obstacle for microenterprises (36 percent) and small enterprises (25 percent).
In addition, access to finance is one of the most frequently identified main obstacles in all three broad
industry subsectors, namely manufacturing (23 percent), the retail trade (36 percent), and services
(14 percent).

MYANMAR POST-DISASTER NEEDS ASSESSMENT
OF FLOODS AND LANDSLIDES JULY–SEPTEMBER 2015



                  POST-DISASTER SITUATION

                  The assessment team carried out a rapid survey in the five areas that were most heavily
                  affected directly and indirectly by the flooding. A sample of 212 firms in the industry and
                  commerce sectors was surveyed during October 2–9, 2015, in Kalay and Monywa in Sagaing;
                  Magway; Hinthada in Ayeyarwady; Ponnagyun and Sittwe in Rakhine; and Mandalay (see assessment
                  methodology section for this chapter). Although Chin State was heavily affected, it was excluded from
                  this survey because of time constraints and because there is less industry and commercial activity
                  in this state relative to the other areas. Its omission should not significantly affect the estimates of
                  damage and loss in this assessment. Given the nature and time frame of the rapid survey, the sample
                  certainly cannot fully represent how the disaster affected operations of industry and commerce firms
                  in the area. Nevertheless, the findings from the median responses from the rapid survey are still useful.

                  The survey found that food processing was the most affected industrial sector, and cited several
                  reasons for this:
                  	 •	 Direct impact of flooding, landslides, and heavy rain on assets (building and facilities).
                  	 •	 Disruption in operations due to insufficient input supplies. Crop failure and late delivery
                        of inputs caused disruptions of supply of necessary inputs for rice millers, beans/pulses
                        processors, and furniture makers. Damage suffered in the fishery and aquaculture industries in
                        Ayeyarwady and Rakhine States severely impacted the fish-processing industry.
                  	 •	 Disruption in operations due to damaged infrastructure. Infrastructure allows access
                        inputs and delivery of goods to markets and is therefore crucial to industry and commerce.
                        Agroprocessing activities depend on roads and bridges to ensure timely receipt of inputs (rice,
                        beans/pulses) and for delivery of processed goods to buyers in the next stage of the value
                        chain or to end consumers.

                  The impact of the disaster is also likely to be felt by firms in commerce and industry in
                  other cities. Figure 21 presents density of population and density of industry and commerce (relative
                  to the national average). The figure suggests that the disaster affected areas that had relatively low
                  density of commerce and industry firms (value in vertical axis is lower than 1). But because industry
                  and commerce are associated with downstream activities of the agriculture sector, the impact of the
                  floods is also likely to affect operations of industry and commerce in areas that were not hit by the
                  floods but are dependent on agriculture output from the affected areas (for example, Mandalay and
                  even Yangon).

Results from the rapid survey suggest that there is considerable variation in the degree
of damage to industrial and commercial firms caused by the flooding. Figure 22 presents
estimate of the type of damage sustained by industrial and commercial enterprises by firms affected
by flood in the surveyed areas. All of the firms in the survey sample in Magway Region (Pwint Phyu
Township was selected for the survey and was particularly heavily affected) suffered badly from the
flooding, which either directly damaged their premises or resulted in operational closure. Rakhine
State is the second-most affected area for industry and commerce, followed by the Sagaing Region.
It is worth noting that except for in Magway, firms reported a higher proportion of losses through
output reductions (sales) and were less directly affected by the flooding. This suggests that firms in
Ayeyarwady, Rakhine, and Sagaing are also suffering from a disruption in operations due to delays
or stoppage in the supply of inputs and slowdowns in getting products to markets (end consumers,
who purchase their products).

The flooding is likely to cause noticeable production losses for businesses trying to recover
activities to pre-disaster levels. Table 12 presents the estimated length of business recovery in
the areas with losses resulting from damage to facilities and property. Responding to the survey in
mid-October, most industrial and commercial firms affected by the flooding estimated that they would
need at least another two weeks to one month to recover their business to pre-disaster levels. Due to
extensive damage and the loss of output, industrial and commercial firms surveyed in Magway and
Rakhine reported needing longer times than firms in other states/regions.

                     production losses in the industry and commerce sector arise from lower agriculture and fishery
                     primary production, the geographic distribution of these production losses follows the distribution
                     in the primary sectors. On the other hand, the geographical distribution of damage and losses to
                     industrial and commercial establishments follows the distribution obtained through data from the
                     sample survey of industry and commerce.

RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION STRATEGY

Recovery from the disaster is dependent on repairing damages and recovering from sales losses.
Sales losses are the result of the impact of the damage to inputs, which affects the value chain. For
example, damage to inputs affects rice millers, who have reduced access to paddy for processing,
and beans/pulses traders, who are unable to sell to export markets due to lack of supply. Such
impacts could be fairly long-lasting, because crop that was damaged will take a growing season or
longer to replace. Loss of market share could also result as international buyers purchase from other
locations in the absence of supply from Myanmar (such as Vietnam for rice). It will take time to get this
market share back for Myanmar suppliers once product is available again.

The immediate strategy/vision for the sector involves two cross-cutting initiatives. First is to support
both public and private sector financing of the recovery effort to enable firms to quickly recover to
pre-flood levels of production and sales. Recovery from damages and losses will not be an easy
task without support from the government to enable lenders, both public and private, to actively
provide financing. In the longer term, it will be necessary to develop stronger measures to mitigate
such events in the future through better infrastructure and warehousing facilities, as well as through
the development of financial instruments, such as insurance, so that business are better prepared
in the future. Second is to immediately repair the damaged connectivity and logistics infrastructure
that is preventing surviving firms in the affected areas from connecting to markets or suppliers and
making it more difficult for affected firms to rebuild their businesses. This initiative would also facilitate
development of logistics infrastructures (warehousing) in areas that are less likely to be affected by
flooding. It is also important to develop a robust early warning system for natural disasters to allow
the private sector to diversify the sourcing of its inputs as early as possible.

In the immediate/short term, it is vital to make financing available to industrial and commercial firms
that have suffered damages and output and sales losses. As many of them may face financial
difficulties when repaying existing debt in the near term and may have little financial capacity to
fund their recovery, it is necessary for the government to step in where it can. Government credit
guarantees to private financial institutions for lending to affected enterprises will open up financing
opportunities for enterprises that do not exist now due to excessive lending risk. In addition,
government financial institutions such as credit cooperatives should channel lending to small-scale
industrial and commercial firms.

As for connectivity logistics infrastructure, the key for reviving economic activities is to repair roads,
bridges, and communication networks. In this context, connectivity is about enabling firms and
consumers to access the network of infrastructures that would allow them to link with the nearest
centers of economic activities. At the minimal, public connectivity infrastructures in heavily affected
areas in Magway, Chin, Sagaing, and Rakhine have to be rebuilt immediately to allow industry and
commerce activities in those areas to recover and be connected with the nearest demand growth
poles.

For longer-term and larger loans needed to finance the restoration of buildings and replacement of
machinery and inventories, the government should use guarantees to enable private sector financial
institutions to step in. State-owned commercial banks should also provide lending on a longer-term
basis and at lower interest rates for firms affected by the flooding. The government should make
funding available at longer-term and low rates to both public and private sector financial institutions
to enable them to on-lend to flood-affected firms at favorable terms and rates.

To mitigate risks of similar events in the future, the government should promote the provision of a
wider range of insurance services by enabling broader private sector participation in the sector from
both domestic and international insurers. Efforts should be made at both the local and national level
to improve warehousing facilities to better enable the storage of key commodities such as rice, bean/
pulses, sesame, and other products. A major factor in the output and sales losses to the private
sector was the inability to secure raw materials such as rice paddy due to damages of stock held

                                                                                                                              43

                   by farmers and traders. This problem could be avoided if more effective warehousing was made
                   available. Better warehousing would have additional benefits by enabling farmers and traders to hold
                   stock until more favorable prices prevail—an improvement over the current practice of selling goods
                   at prevailing market prices for lack of storage capacity.

                   Given that supply chains are vital in commerce and industry activities, the sector would benefit from
                   improved early warning systems for natural disaster. An effective system—one that is built on a solid
                   platform of gathering real-time data, mapping hazard risk, and communicating warnings—could help
                   firms in commerce and industry take necessary steps to manage their supply chains, e.g., storing
                   inputs and products in different locations and diversifying suppliers.  


                   RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION PLAN

                   Short term. To support the private sector in recovering from the estimated losses of over K 110
                   billion in output and sales, short-term financing support is needed (Table 15).

RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION IMPLEMENTATION

Financing from public and private sector financial institutions will be needed to support recovery from
losses in the industry and commerce sector and strengthen future risk mitigation measures, such
as development of the insurance sector. To ensure that financial institutions are able to provide the
necessary financing, partnerships and coordination/management arrangements will be needed, and
development partners will have an important role to play in providing capital and technical assistance.
These emergency measures should be seen as part of disaster relief only; if used excessively such
schemes could distort markets, and they should not be mainstreamed into the operations of the
financial sector. Establishing an emergency relief organization could ensure that such funding was
provided only for disaster relief and mitigation.

                  SECTOR ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY

                  Whereas in other sectors—such as agriculture, public services, and transportation—the government
                  has actively collected data related to the damage and losses caused by the flooding, this has not
                  been the case in the industry and commerce sector. It has been more difficult to collect data for this
                  assessment using government sources as the government didn’t collect relevant data.

                  To assess damage and production losses, baseline data sources from the government were used.
                  To obtain additional baseline information as well as typical disaster effects, a special field sample
                  survey was conducted that assessed the affected areas and the indirect effects on the value chain
                  and distribution. The rapid survey in the five most heavily affected states and regions was conducted
                  by Myanmar Survey Research.  A sample of 212 firms in the industry and commerce sectors was
                  surveyed from October 2 to October 9. There were 19 respondents in Kalay, 21 in Monywa, 40 in
                  Sittwe and Ponagyun, 40 in Pwint Phyu, 49 Hinthada, and 40 in Mandalay. The survey included
                  respondents from agribusiness/processing (118), manufacturing and services (36), and distribution
                  and retail (56).

                  This assessment also used information provided by the agriculture sector team on the quantities
                  and value of primary production losses that would not reach the industry and commerce sectors for
                  processing and marketing, respectively, together with unit price–level data at farm-gate, wholesale,
                  and retail levels, to ascertain the value-added losses in industry and commerce. Limited consultations
                  were held with the Ministry of Commerce. Other data sources, including the Myanmar Enterprises
                  Survey carried out by the World Bank Group in 2014 and the United Nations Development Programme

Banking and Finance
SUMMARY

Because Myanmar’s financial sector is in an early stage of development, with limited
outreach in rural areas, the losses caused by this year’s disastrous floods and landslides
were very limited. Damages to financial institutions’ property were negligible, while only one
institution—Myanmar Agricultural Development Bank (MADB)—had losses on a scale that could
negatively affect its national operations.   Even the insurance sector, due to a lack of agricultural
insurance and very limited presence outside cities, avoided significant losses.

The sector must meet very significant needs in order to build back better and to grow
sufficiently in scale and outreach that it can reduce the vulnerability of rural inhabitants to
future natural disasters.  The funding needs related to making the financial sector more accessible
to flood-prone populations amount to K 49,506 million in credit lines to MADB; K 1,181 million in
technical assistance to MADB; and K 7,500 million in credit or equity to two microfinance institutions
(MFIs). Despite needing profound restructuring and capacity building, the MADB remains a crucial
vehicle for agricultural funding, and large-scale investments should be made to strengthen this key
player.  Many important initiatives are under way to strengthen Myanmar’s financial sector, but this
chapter focuses on those designed to increase access to financial services in flood-prone areas.
They should be prioritized and implemented.

Note that the figures in this chapter for financial sector losses are not added to the overall Post-Flood
and -Landslide Needs Assessment loss figures, as this would be double-counting. The vast majority
of these losses reflect loans that farmers cannot repay without further assistance because of their
reduced farming income, and these are already covered in the agricultural sector chapter. These
figures do not include the needs assessed for the recovery of commerce and industry, which are
detailed in the previous chapter. Neither do these figures reflect the overall financing needs estimated
by our colleagues covering agriculture, that figure being far higher than we estimate the current
financial sector being able to manage, even with important cash injections and capacity growth in the
years to come.


PRE-DISASTER CONTEXT

Myanmar’s financial sector is still in its infancy. “Myanmar’s private banking sector is small and
segmented. A number of private banks, mostly connected to private business conglomerates,
emerged from a partial liberalisation of the banking industry in 1988. Entry to the banking market
was further liberalized in 2010 for domestic banks and four new private banks were granted
licenses.”39 Before the 2011 government reforms, banks’ ability to operate as market-driven financial
intermediaries was very limited.

As outlined in the industry and commerce chapter, access to finance is consistently identified as the
main barrier to enterprises’ growth. The latest FINDEX figures suggest that 23 percent of adults have
an account in a formal financial institution, and most of these adults are in cities.  In rural areas, such
as those impacted by this year’s floods and landslides, most of the population has no access to
formal financial services. Farmers have no access to insurance (other than fire plus flood insurance for
their buildings), no mortgages, no long-term loans, no venture capital. A handful of farmers manages
to lease agricultural equipment through “hire purchase”;40 most of this equipment goes to plantations
or large farms close to big towns. Farmers have to rely mainly on MADB and cooperatives, because
while microfinance institutions are growing rapidly, they are doing so from a very small base.

  “Hire purchase” is a term used by financiers in Myanmar. The total portfolio of agricultural equipment hire purchase is
estimated to be under K 200 billion.

MYANMAR POST-DISASTER NEEDS ASSESSMENT
OF FLOODS AND LANDSLIDES JULY–SEPTEMBER 2015



                  The main formal source of credit for farmers is MADB, which has around 2 million borrowers as
                  of September 2015—i.e., 5.5 percent of total rural population, or 24 percent of households.41 Not
                  long before the floods, MADB started to charge only 5.0 percent interest on its seasonal crop loans
                  (the vast majority of its portfolio). The 1 percent margin over MADB’s 4 percent cost of funds from
                  Myanma Economic Bank means that MADB will find it more difficult than to be self-sustaining.

                  Cooperatives report having over 2.9 million members, but there is no breakdown of the proportion
                  of those members who are rural (clearly a majority, but unclear how big). Cooperatives are reportedly
                  present in 307 of Myanmar’s 325 townships, and there are 33,294 cooperatives societies.42 Even if
                  all cooperative members were rural, however, that would represent only 8 percent of the population,
                  or 35 percent of rural households. It should be noted that many cooperative borrowers are also
                  MADB borrowers, so that these two figures do not represent separate and complementary outreach.  
                  Furthermore, cooperatives’ loans are mostly limited to K 100,000 and so have limited impact. A
                  positive aspect of cooperatives is that their staff work directly with the end clients in villages, unlike
                  MADB staff.   A negative aspect of cooperatives is that, as they admit themselves, the quality of
                  information and loan analysis is low. The need to develop the capacity of cooperative staff, at various
                  levels, is great.

The microfinance sector has expanded rapidly with more than 200 institutions entering the market
within the past 3 years and currently reaching around 1 million clients. The regulatory framework for
microfinance has a number of weaknesses including restrictions on both funding and lending side
on rates and amounts which constrains sustainable growth of the sector. The Livelihoods and Food
Security Trust Fund (LIFT) of the United Nations Development Programme has been the main source
of financing for microfinance. LIFT is also a keen observer and coordinator of this sector and has
contributed to important initiatives (such as the upcoming TCX Currency Exchange Fund) and new
products (such as the soon-to-be released loan-consolidation loans).

The rural population’s vulnerability to natural disasters is very high. Only a minority of rural inhabitants
have access to formal credit46 (see Table 17). In particular, “the landless, youth, and female populations
face continued constraints in accessing credit.”47 With no other formal products available, a significant
but unknown proportion of the rural population48 relies on informal loans with very high interest rates
(60–240 percent).

The extent of agricultural input provider credit is impossible to establish with clarity, given that such
credit is entirely unregulated and not centrally recorded. One report cites a single agricultural input
provider as having 1.5 million clients to which it offers an average credit of K 50,000; this would result
in a potential total annual portfolio outstanding of K 75,000 million.49 However, other reports suggest
that the scale of such supplier credits is not very significant. For example, a detailed Fertilizer Policy
report states that “sales to farmers are essentially cash only and the few credit sales incur 2 to 3
percent per month interest charges.”50 The Myanmar Farmers Association stated that agricultural
input providers were a common source of credit for farmers, but banks and cooperatives did not
give the same impression. In the two villages visited by the assessment team, reportedly no farmers
used supplier credit, feeling that it either wasn’t available or was too costly (e.g., required giving back
twice the amount of seeds acquired). For the moment, an approach involving tripartite lending (bank
lends to agricultural input provider, which lends to farmer) is not a realistic large-scale solution, given
commercial banks’ limited rural presence. Nevertheless, partnerships of agricultural input suppliers
with banks and MFIs should be supported, through conferences and perhaps even one-off vouchers,
to get both sides used to working with each other.

   Note that the latest round of Qualitative Social and Economic Monitoring (World Bank and EMR 2015) finds that access to
MADB loans has increased to 70 percent from an initial 13 percent, and also that interest rates had decreased across all forms
of credit. Overall, however, it would appear that it is still a minority of farmers who have access to formal credit.

   According to UNCDF (2014a), about 9.2 million people have loans from an unregulated financial institution, and “the majority
of citizens rely on unregulated providers” (7). On the other hand, LIFT and World Bank (2015) report only 11 percent of farmers
accessing informal loans. LIFT’s forthcoming “loan-consolidation loans” product may help to better understand the true degree
of indebtedness to informal lenders.

                  microfinance, and more in line with the MIX-Market figure of 717,000 (2015). All agree that PACT GMF is massive compared to all other
                  MFIs, and PACT has only around 600,000 borrowers.

                  POST-DISASTER SITUATION

                  For most of the financial sector actors, the post-disaster situation is the same as the pre-disaster
                  situation, i.e., they remain under-invested in farmers and rural communities. This is reflected in the
                  almost nonexistent damages and low levels of losses detailed in the following section. MADB is the
                  one institution that is at considerable risk of incurring losses at a level that may significantly impact
                  its activities and balance sheet, as can be seen below. The environment for insurance is also likely to
                  be impacted, given that foreign reinsurance may be more expensive in the years to come, with the
                  increased perceived risk of more serious floods and landslides. However, there is insufficient data to
                  estimate the increase in cost of reinsurance.

ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE EFFECTS AND THE IMPACT OF THE
DISASTER ON THE SECTOR

Overall, given the very limited presence of the formal financial sector in the regions impacted by this
year’s floods and landslides, infrastructure and physical asset losses to the sector have been negligible
(Table 18). MADB is the only banking institution invested in rural areas to any large degree. Yet MADB
staff have reported that, while one or two branches did have to close for a few days, there were no
significant damages to any buildings or equipment, nor any loss of cash or of financial records. None
of the commercial banks or MFIs the assessment team met with reported any significant damages to
their infrastructure or physical assets, though one or two branches did have to a close for a few days.
Similarly, Myanma Insurance has reported that none of its offices or physical assets were damaged
by the floods.

In terms of hire purchase assets, there were reports of some agricultural equipment dealers having
significant amounts of equipment flooded, but the banks are not responsible for equipment that has
not yet been leased out. Even after it is leased out, most contracts oblige the equipment dealer/
showroom to repay the bank/hire purchase company, regardless of whether the dealer gets paid
on time by the end client. Thus whatever hire purchase equipment was damaged, it should not be
counted as damages to the financial sector.

Overall, the damage figures for the financial sector are negligible. Loan losses caused by the floods,
however, are a more complicated issue to assess, and will be addressed by subsector. The damages
and losses are summarizes in Table 18. This table draws on information gathered in interviews with
the respective organizations and other financial sector players, as well on sources found in the
bibliography.

Note:
a. The only private bank that we have encountered with any flood-related losses (excluding leasing, i.e. hire purchase) is Small and Medium
    Industrial Development Bank (SMIDB). This is not a commercial bank in the usual sense, in that it is overseen by the Ministry of Industry,
    but it was placed here because it is owned by 875 shareholders, none of which are government entities (although some are government
    employees). SMIDB reports that that only a few commercial clients, and one or two SME clients, have been impacted by the floods.
    SMIDB also reports that all its clients who are required to do so take the flooding option on their fire insurance for buildings used as
    collateral (which they all must have), so its flood losses should be minimal. Nevertheless, we await more precise flood-related figures
    from SMIDB.
b. The figure of US$1.8 million was obtained from LIFT, the main source of microfinance funding in Myanmar. However, this figure combines
    microfinance losses with reductions in social funds used to give grants to the neediest beneficiaries. PACT—by far the largest MFI in
    the country, and one of the few with a widespread presence in affected areas—assessed its microfinance losses (including interest
    lost) at US$500,000.
c. Note that only MADB has losses. See the text for an explanation of how the range of potential loss figures for MADB was calculated.
d. See text for a description of how hire purchase losses were calculated.
e. Figures were provided by the Ministry of Co-operatives, reportedly simply based on amounts members said they needed to be able to
    start earning again sufficiently to repay both the original loan and the supplementary loan.
f. There are likely to be no losses on the part of private insurers, as they are very small and focused on cities and towns. See text for the
    calculation of Myanma Insurance’s losses. Note that no losses linked to pricier future policies are included here.
g. These loss figures will not be added to the overall country loss figures. They should already be factored into the agricultural loss
    calculations (as well as a very small amount reflecting real estate and home content losses).

MYANMAR POST-DISASTER NEEDS ASSESSMENT
OF FLOODS AND LANDSLIDES JULY–SEPTEMBER 2015



                  State banks/specialized financial institutions. MADB usually collects data from its branches
                  only once a year, in March, for the compilation of its annual report. As of September 17, 2015,
                  when a meeting was held with the MADB team, it appeared that MADB had not yet sought any
                  information on the extent of potential losses linked to the floods and landslides. The MADB team did
                  manage to provide some information, including figures on 10 branches affected by floods (out of a
                  total of around 50 impacted branches). These figures were said to be “likely loan losses” and were
                  reportedly based on discussions between MADB staff and affected clients.51 MADB later sent a table
                  of estimated losses with figures for 49 affected branches. Compared to the 10 branches for which
                  data had already been supplied, however, the newly provided figures were much lower; on average,
                  the previous estimated loss figures had been 3.88 times higher. Upon further investigation, MADB
                  counterparts revealed that for this table, their approach was reportedly to simply take a 5 percent
                  provisioning figure (on the nationwide portfolio) for flood-related losses—they the manner in which
                  they attributed losses per branch was hard to understand, with numbers that reflected very different
                  ratios from those in branch portfolio volumes.52

                  Given the inconsistent information that supplied by MADB, the best we can do is to evaluate a range
                  of loss values that are likely to hold the actual figure. The optimistic extreme of this range would be
                  the latest figures provided by MADB, which MADB calculated as being a total of K 44,098 million.
                  The pessimistic extreme of the proposed range would involve assuming that all affected branches’
                  likely losses have been undervalued to the same average degree as the 10 initially quoted branches.53
                  Thus keeping initial estimates for the first 10 branches, and multiplying the remaining 39 branches’
                  forecasted losses by 388 percent (average difference for first 10 branches), we reach an estimated
                  loss figure of K 182,191 million.  A compromise figure would take the initial “likely loss figures” for the
                  10 branches, and retain the lower figure for the other 39 branches: this would result in an estimate
                  of K 87,116 million in MADB losses. For the damage and loss table (Table 18), we have used this
                  “compromise” calculation, both because it is within the proposed range and because the pessimistic
                  loss estimate of K 182 billion—representing around 18 percent of total seasonal loans disbursed54—
                  seems very high, given the historical ability of MADB to keep losses low.

                  Private banking and leasing sector. Because no private banks lend to farmers, and because loans
                  to rural areas tend to be few and far between, flood-related damages to private banks’ assets were
                  negligible. Some very minor losses were incurred by one or two private bank branches when they had
                  to close for a few days, but none of the banks put a value on this, as they considered these losses
                  immaterial. Most banks with which the assessment team met stated that they had zero flood-related
                  losses or late loan repayments, and a minority of banks stated that a very small number of clients
                  were late in making payments or had requested grace periods. Once again, these interest losses
                  were statistically negligible. Larger banks have very recently started issuing credit cards, but overall
                  volumes are very small, and this business is focused on urban clients. Thus there are no flood-related
                  losses in the nascent credit card portfolios.
                  	
                  Mortgages. Mortgages are not currently offered in Myanmar, for a host of reasons. One reason that
                  savings for periods of over 12 months are not allowed; thus all banks’ borrowed liquidity is short-
                  term. Some banks do offer real estate hire purchase products, in some cases for terms of up to three
                  years, but these are not common, and such leased property would be only in urban or suburban
                  areas.



                  51
                     Note, however, that in the normal MADB lending process, MADB staff do not visit villages or clients, but rather rely on village
                  counselors to provide information on potential borrowers; indeed, MADB rules preclude staff from visiting villages, according
                  LIFT and World Bank (2014).
                  52
                     The reason for using this new calculation approach was that the general manager “did not want to show a large amount of
                  loss for the flood-affected branches.”
                  53
                     This may offer a particularly pessimistic picture if the initial 10 branches for which figures were received were on average
                  much more badly impacted than the other 39. For the moment, however, our questions about this remain unanswered.
                  54
                     On October 12, 2015, MADB stated that its total loans outstanding were K 1,002,920 million. Compared to the total portfolio
                  outstanding figure of K 568 billion for end of March 2015, the pessimistic scenario would reflect an even less likely 32 percent
                  portfolio loss.

Hire purchase. This is the one area where potential losses might be expected, especially in terms
of lower demand going forward. The vast majority of hire purchase transactions in Myanmar follow
a dealership guarantee model, whereby the dealer takes responsibility for collecting the end client’s
payments, and also commits to paying the bank even if the end client fails to pay on time.

No banking group reported that any dealers were late with their payments, though in a few cases
dealers requested one or two months’ grace period for the due principal payments (there is no
interest due because in this model, all interest is paid at the beginning of the lease period). In all cases,
the banks were confident that the dealers would pay their dues, even the one dealer who reportedly
had a parking lot full of flooded agricultural equipment. The reason given is that these dealers have
been in business a long time and earn lucrative margins (despite the interest rate being limited by law
to 13 percent); thus they have sufficient liquidity to absorb their limited losses, and have too much to
lose by not respecting their contracts.

What banks seem to be ignoring, however, is that the impact—on some dealers and on many
farmers—may be a lower risk appetite and less liquidity. This would mean less demand for hire
purchase of agricultural equipment in the coming year or two. On the other hand, this concern
should be tempered by the fact that the vast majority of dealer networks seem (at least directly)
unaffected by flood damages, and by the fact that the end clients are relatively wealthy, and in most
cases can probably mange to make their payments.

Nevertheless, in order to reflect the likely reduction (at least in some parts of the rural population) in
demand for hire purchase agricultural equipment, we assume that there will be a 10 percent reduction
in the current hire purchase agricultural equipment portfolio55 for the next two years, and thus that the
concerned banking group will lose the margin between the 13 percent interest it charges and the 8
percent it can receive from depositing those funds. This amounts to a potential loss over those two
years of K 402 million in hire purchase gross profit margin for those players.

Cooperatives. The cooperative sector, despite its relatively massive rural outreach, also reported
no damages to its offices, at any level. The Ministry of Co-operatives had already calculated a loss
figure, which is the amount of additional post-flood loans that have been requested by members.
These post-flood loans amount to K 4,807 million. After cooperative societies (which operate at the
village level) request such loans, they reportedly have their case reviewed by a state representative,
and loans are released to all long-standing cooperative members of the given village, if significant
flood damage is confirmed.

This amount of additional loans is currently being disbursed, and recipients do not have to repay the
principal until July 2016; before then only interest needs to be repaid, in six monthly installments.
Although most of these loans are likely to be repaid eventually, they are being considered as a loss
here because the fate of the loans they replace remains unclear—at some stage, significant write-offs
may be unavoidable.

Microfinance institutions, There is only one large MFI in Myanmar, PACT GMF. Especially given
that PACT is one of the few sizeable MFIs that was significantly exposed in areas flooded this year, it
is also the main MFI to suffer flood-related losses. PACT stated that its microfinance-related losses
(due to the floods/landslides) amounted to US$0.5 million, and that much of this amount had already
been restructured or refinanced by the LIFT program.  It is unlikely that other MFIs would have very
significant loss amounts, given their limited scale and their concentration outside this year’s flood-
impacted areas. LIFT itself provided higher loss figures, as it combined “pure” microfinance loss
figures with “social welfare fund” losses, i.e., amounts granted to beneficiaries to help them recover
from flood-related losses. The overall loss figure provided by LIFT was US$1.8 million.

MYANMAR POST-DISASTER NEEDS ASSESSMENT
OF FLOODS AND LANDSLIDES JULY–SEPTEMBER 2015



                  Insurance sector. The insurance sector consists essentially of one entity, Myanma Insurance,
                  which has a very limited branch network and does not engage in agricultural or rural insurance.
                  Unsurprisingly, it suffered no flood-related damages to its branches.

                  Its losses were also negligible. Myanma Insurance reports having received only seven to eight flood-
                  related claims, one of which was around K 400 million (coffee mix distributor); the others were very
                  small. For such property loans, Myanma Insurance is partially reinsured with Munich RE, and its
                  liability would be limited to the initial K 30 million per claim, plus 13 percent of any amount between K
                  30 million and K 500 million, as well as 100 percent of any amount above K 500 million (very rare). If
                  we assume an average value per claim of K 200 million, this brings Myanma Insurance’s losses from
                  these eight flood-related claims to K 417 million (8 * 30 million [first loss]) + (8 * (200 - 30 [average
                  claim minus first loss) * 13 percent). The assessment team has been trying to get a more accurate
                  figure of claims from Myanma Insurance, but this calculation gives a good idea of the tiny scale
                  of these flood-related losses. There was one major international client’s flood-related claim, for an
                  amount of US$397 million, but that claim is reportedly 100 percent covered by a foreign reinsurer, and
                  thus involves no immediate losses to Myanma Insurance.

                  A longer-term loss may be the increased cost of obtaining reinsurance from international reinsurers,
                  but Myanma Insurance has no information on how much this cost will increase, so no assumptions are
                  being made on that front. Myanma Insurance and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) Financial Regulation
                  Department believe that private insurers’ flood-related claims are next to zero, for the reasons stated
                  in the previous section, and this was in line with what the largest private insurance company told the
                  assessment team.

                  However, both Myanma Insurance and the largest private insurance company have shared their
                  concern that, given people’s increased awareness of the risk of floods, demand for insurance could
                  significantly increase. The problem is that current regulation does not allow insurance companies to
                  price their policies according to risk. All fire plus flood policies, for example, must be priced the same,
                  regardless of the actual risk of flooding in the client’s area. Insurance companies also currently do
                  not have the right to refuse clients, meaning that Myanma Insurance or private insurance companies
                  could find themselves with large liabilities and insufficient revenue to cover losses.


                  RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION STRATEGY

                  The only significant flood-related recovery required for the financial sector per se is to ensure that MADB
                  has the necessary support to keep operating at levels similar to (or higher than) past levels. Providing
                  this support will require more detailed analysis of MADB’s doubtful loans, as well as government
                  intervention to ensure that Myanma Economic Bank’s loans to MADB can be restructured; this
                  restructuring is necessary so that MADB can restructure its loans to clients impacted by the disaster.
                  Other segments of the financial sector can continue as before without any additional government or
                  donor intervention.

                  The real question for the financial sector is how it can build back better—that is, how it can increase
                  access to formal financial services in rural areas and thus decrease the rural population’s vulnerability
                  to natural disasters. The focus here is on initiatives and recommendations that will help to expand
                  financial services in flood-prone rural areas. This does not mean that initiatives not included here are
                  unimportant, merely that they could not all be prioritized.

                  Despite its weaknesses, MADB can hardly be avoided as a delivery vehicle for making further
                  financing available to farmers. Most farmers in the country are still without access to formal financial
                  products, so the implementation partner must have a proven ability to reach larger numbers of the
                  rural population—especially given that the alternative, i.e., informal lenders, charge such astronomical

interest rates. Although the cooperatives may have more members,56 MADB is more tested in
terms of delivering relatively large loans rapidly.57 Given the importance of the MADB loans to those
communities that receive them, it is important to ensure not only that MADB can continue serving
existing clients, but also that it have the funding and technical support required to successfully expand
into other geographical areas and other crops. The proviso is that this partnership include steps to
start the restructuring of the MADB, a stated goal of the government.

A World Bank study of MADB has identified many areas that need to be strengthened.58 Channeling
funds released to the MADB specifically for post-flood recovery purposes could offer the perfect
opportunity to start reforms on a small scale (for this operation and the branches through which
these funds will flow) and to test the proposed changes before they are implemented on a bankwide
scale. The technical assistance program will help with the following: transition from paper-based to
computerized transactions, computerized portfolio management, regular management meetings to
assess portfolio quality and extent to which lending and saving targets are being met, streamlined
loan approval processes, and direct credit risk assessment by meeting end clients.

Although MADB will continue, at least in the medium term, to be the main source of funds for rural
areas, it is also important to secure faster outreach growth in the microfinance sector.  Many significant
issues are simply legal and regulatory impediments that need to be addressed, but beyond that, there
is a case for supporting the expansion of two (new or existing) MFIs into flood-prone townships. This
is in part because MADB cannot be everywhere, but in part because MFIs play a very important role in
funding noncore agricultural expenses, allowing households to complement core agricultural income
by engaging in other aspects of farming, trading, or other economic activities.

While there is no expectation that private banks will massively expand into towns and villages in the
foreseeable future, private banking groups have nonetheless already identified hire purchase financing
as a way to do business in rural areas. In order to speed up the development of this product, there
is a need for moveable and real estate collateral registries. Without such registries, loan providers’
willingness to lend is decreased, given that borrowers’ full ownership of collateral cannot be verified
(and the presence of other lenders cannot be detected). In order to be successful, the hire purchase
business needs to be governed by a tailor-made law that includes clear and easy mechanisms by
which financiers can recover their equipment clients default on payments.

In terms of the insurance sector, the reality is that private insurance companies based in Myanmar
will not be able to significantly broaden their liabilities in rural areas, nor will they have an interest
in doing so. For now, disaster risk insurance will remain a state prerogative, as explained in the
disaster risk management chapter. Nevertheless, the current legislative environment potentially puts
both Myanma Insurance and private insurance companies at significant and unreasonable risk. This
problem is addressed below.

One initiative that would significantly help to reduce the vulnerability of rural inhabitants is setting up
the infrastructure for effective mobile banking. This would not only make offering financial services to
rural communities more affordable, but it could also enable the poorest households to have access to
government cash payments more quickly and affordably. Currently, this initiative does not involve any
extra budget, but does require strong government support to rapidly pass pending legislation, and to
minimize bureaucratic hurdles slowing these initiatives down.

   Tables provided by the Ministry of Co-operatives, dated August 2015, state that cooperatives have a total of 2.92 million
members. Meanwhile, MADB reported that they had around 2 million active borrowers (on paper, they have 4 billion borrowers,
but they reported that only around 1 million of those are active, and usually only in order to secure loans).
57
   MADB seasonal loans can be up to K 1,000 million, whereas cooperatives offer a maximum of K 100 million as their standard
loan product.

                  RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION PLAN AND IMPLEMENTATION

                  Short term
                  	 1.	Establish a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for an MADB expansion and
                        restructuring program, and support affected MADB borrowers.
                        •	 With the support of the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation (MOAI) and MOF, MADB
                           should offer loan restructuring (offering an extra 12 months for the principal repayment) to
                           borrowers who are proven to have been negatively impacted by the floods/landslides.
                        •	 MOAI and MOF, along with the chosen international partners and MADB management,
                           should establish an MOU outlining the scope of partnership between the donor and MADB.
                        •	 This consultancy work should include working with MADB to get sound information on
                           doubtful loans caused by the floods, and should determine which townships are most in
                           need of access to MADB and should be prioritized for expansion.
                        Forecasted cost (drawing up MOU only; no loan refinancing yet): K 75 million.

                  Medium term (April 2015–March 2016):
                  	 1.	 Restructure doubtful MADB loans
                        •	 The restructuring is to be supported in the context of a long-term partnership and a
                           restructuring road map.
                        •	 Once the scale of doubtful loans is confirmed, a credit line should be offered to allow
                           MADB to remain at its usual lending levels, despite the flood-impacted loans that were
                           restructured.
                        •	 With the help of technical assistance in the associated MADB program, these funds should
                           be tracked by a parallel, fully computerized accounting system (starting in those branches
                           using the new funds), in part so that this type of approach becomes more familiar to MADB
                           staff.
                        •	 This loan should not go via Myanma Economic Bank or other intermediaries, but directly
                           from MOF.
                        •	 The assumption should be that one-third of MADB’s currently estimated (compromise
                           figure) doubtful loans will remain unpaid and require refinancing.
                        Forecasted size of loan (to be confirmed by Terms of Reference research):  K 28,750 million.  

                  	    2.	 Implement the MADB restructuring and expansion program into flood-prone areas
                           •	 The MADB Partnership should include the following elements:59
                           •	 For loans under this project, move (perhaps progressively) to a new risk management
                              approach, where MADB staff assess clients themselves, and where loan approval
                              procedures are streamlined.
                           •	 Starting with branches where bad loans are being refinanced, as well as in new branches
                              being added in flood-prone areas, ensure computerization and real-time access to loan files
                              and portfolio information (this will start in months 5–17, but will continue in the long term).
                           •	 A separate credit line should be made available, conditional upon expansion of MADB
                              branches in a certain number of flood-prone townships that currently have no MADB
                              branch; a given proportion of the credit line is reserved for lending in those expansion
                              townships.
                           •	 The new credit line should also be linked to nonpaddy crops, both through the addition
                              of crops not previously funded (including fruit and nut trees, which will help prevent soil
                              erosion in future floods), and through an increase in the amount that can be funded per
                              acre of nonpaddy crops (up from 20,000 per acre, to a level to be determined). This will
                              give farmers the option of diversifying away from rice, as recommended in the agricultural
                              chapter.


                  59
                     These include many, but not all of the recommendations from LIFT and World Bank (2014). Note that such restructuring is
                  in line with government priorities—indeed, earlier in 2015, the president’s office reportedly sent a letter to MADB management
                  saying they should start preparing for privatization. While privatization is likely to be a distant prospect, the sort of restructuring
                  being proposed would be vital a precursor.

      •	 In terms of technical assistance, we assume one full-time international rural finance
         expert and one full-time local financial sector expert, with MADB providing office space,
         communications, car when necessary, etc.
      Funding requirements: Credit line—K 12,000 million;60 technical assistance grant (12 months)—
      K 393.8 million.
			
	 3.	 Support efforts to strengthen leasing legislation, and to establish moveable and real
      estate collateral registries
      •	 The hire purchase business needs to be better supported by appropriate legislation and
         accompanying regulations, which should allow hire purchase companies to repossess their
         equipment if clients become delinquent, and simplify the documentation and guarantor
         requirements for lessees.
      •	 Leasing should be included in the upcoming Banking and Financial Institutions Law.
      •	 The collateral registries initiative is very important, not just for the growth of banking in
         general, but particularly to help hire purchase to develop more rapidly and safely.
      •	 There is already a project under way to establish collateral registries, and no other funding
         needs have been identified at this stage
      •	 These initiatives should be among the government’s priority areas, given the importance of
         hire purchase as the only source of funding for equipment, particularly for farmers without
         registered land or buildings.
      Funding requirement: No extra funding required, simply strong government support.

	    4.	 Continue efforts to improve legal and regulatory framework.
         •	 The FRD is currently working to build a sustainable microfinance industry and as such is
            putting reforming its microfinance legal and regulatory framework to enable sustainable
            expansion of microfinance sector. This includes reforming quantitative and price restrictions
            on both funding and lending activities of MFIs. Key measures include, among others.
         •	 Allowing MFIs to accept any level of voluntary savings, as well as long-term loans, essential
            for capital investments.61
         •	 Streamlining or waving the requirement for Central Bank of Myanmar (CBM) approval of
            debt investments in MFIs.
         Forecasted cost: None. Existing donor programs are already working on these important
            issues, they simply need to be strongly and urgently supported by the government of
            Myanmar.

	    5.	 Prioritize issuance of a best-practice mobile financial services regulation, and
         support the rapid establishment of cash-in /cash-out agents	
         •	 This would allow both international and local remittances to reach inhabitants of flood-
            prone areas, without the risks involved in informal transfers.
         •	 It would facilitate government cash transfers to the affected population rapidly, cheaply, and
            transparently.
         •	 Work on this initiative is already ongoing, with a draft mobile payment regulation develop.
         •	 This structure is unlikely to be ready in time to assist with most of the initial payments
            related to this year’s floods, but establishing a strong mobile payment system for future
            natural disasters is important.
         •	 A strong mobile payment system makes expansion into rural areas more appealing and
            affordable for more MFIs, cooperatives, and banks.

   We compared townships (106) where over 1,000 acres of arable land was damaged/destroyed by floods (figures from
Myanmar Information Management Unit), and those townships (in that list) where MADB is reporting likely losses (46). We
assumed that the difference (60) was those townships impacted by floods but not yet adequately served by MADB. We then
assumed that MADB could expand into one-third of those townships (20) in the first year of the program, serving an average
of 1,000 clients per township, with an average loan of K 600,000 (6 acres x 100,000).
61
   Currently, MFIs can accept only 5 percent of their loan portfolio as mandatory savings, and another 5 percent as voluntary
savings.

                             •	 Work on this intervention should be prioritized, but results are not expected before the
                                medium to long term.
                             Funding requirement: No extra funding required, simply strong government support.

                  	      6.	 Upgrade the insurance sector legal and regulatory framework	
                             •	 The insurance sector legal and regulatory framework is outdated and hampering market
                                development in general, as well as to flood prone areas. The FRD is currently working to
                                revise the insurance law and issue implementing regulations more broadly in line with the
                                core principles of the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS). Efforts are
                                also underway to upgrade the supervisory framework. Supervision is part of the foundation
                                of effective insurance markets; without it, markets fail to develop and grow.
                             •	 Insurance companies can only offer a fixed price for policies, regardless of actual risk levels
                                in different geographical areas, the potential for losses is great.  Given that the population’s
                                awareness of flood risks has increased after this year’s disaster, it is all the more likely that
                                there could be a run on flooding insurance options, and that these would be vastly under-
                                priced; Currently, insurance companies are in a situation where, if clients ask for a policy,
                                e.g. fire & flooding building insurance, they cannot refuse;
                             •	 This year, the insurance sector was not significantly affected by the floods, but in future—at
                                least until insurance companies are allowed to price their risk realistically—they should be
                                given the right to refuse clients.
                             Funding requirement: No extra funding required, simply strong government support

                  Long term
                  	 1.	 Continue implementation of the MADB restructuring and expansion program
                        •	 The MADB restructuring and expansion program is likely to need at least three years to
                           achieve restructuring of MADB.
                        •	 The priorities and approaches remain as described above and will gradually spread to all
                           areas of MADB.
                        •	 Funds provided from the medium-term injections should continue revolving and allowing
                           MADB to geographically spread further into flood-prone areas, though at a slower pace.

                  SECTOR ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY

                  The assessment team conducted a desk review of reports and other documents on the financial sector
                  in Myanmar (Annex 2), and then held discussions with private sector financial institutions, government
                  bodies, responsible banks, MFIs, insurance companies, donors, and international financial institution
                  representatives, including the AGD Bank, ARDC (Agricultural and Rural Development Consultants),
                  AYA Bank, CB Bank, Financial Regulatory Department (MOF), GIZ (German Agency for International
                  Cooperation), Global Treasure Bank, I-KBZ, International Finance Corporation, International Monetary

                  Economic Bank (MOF), Myanma Foreign Trade Bank, Myanma Insurance, Myanma Investment
                  and Commercial Bank, Myanmar Banks Association, Myanmar Farmer Association, Myanmar

                  Global Microfinance Fund, SMIDB, YOMA Bank, and YOMA Strategic Holdings. During field visits
                  to two remote villages in Magway State,62 the team met with and interviewed (as a group) large
                  numbers of cooperative members and MADB borrowers. These visits also offered the perspective
                  of a township MADB branch and of a rural agricultural machinery dealer. Data sources have in some
                  cases been verbal numbers given by representatives of financial institutions; in some cases (such
                  as that of MADB) they have been in e-mails and tables sent after our meetings; and in other cases
                  they were from existing reports (both from international financial institutions and from government
                  sources). All calculations are explained in the text or in footnotes.

Note: The total figure reflects the assessment team’s estimation of the capacity for growth of MADB and MFIs—as well as its view that
the private sector banks can best be assisted by legislative and regulatory reform, rather than funding. The overall figure represents only
a small fraction of the financing needs identified by the assessment team within the agriculture sector, as summarized in the agriculture
chapter. Also note that estimations of loans needing refinancing that are used in the agriculture chapter assume a large proportion of loans
from informal lenders, which are outside the usual scope of financial sector interventions. Such lending should be replaced rather than be
encouraged via further funding.

OF FLOODS AND LANDSLIDES JULY–SEPTEMBER 2015




                  Health
                  SUMMARY

                  The floods and landslides had a severe impact on the health system and its capacity to
                  deliver essential services. With over two hundred health facilities destroyed and others needing
                  repair and reconstruct, access to health facilities has been reduced. Effective coordination will be
                  extremely important to ensure that government, United Nations agencies, international donors,
                  national and international NGOs, and the private sector are able to produce effective results for the
                  people of the affected areas.


                  PRE-DISASTER CONTEXT

                  Myanmar suffers from the double burden of infectious diseases and noncommunicable diseases
                  (NCDs). Fifty-nine percent of all deaths in Myanmar are due to NCDs. Communicable, maternal,
                  perinatal, and nutritional conditions account for some 30 percent of deaths.63 Maternal and under-five
                  mortality rates are still high, at 200 per 100,000 live births and 51 per 1,000 live births, respectively.64

                  Access to and utilization of health services is still inadequate. This is due to geographical, financial, and
                  cultural barriers, especially in the disaster-affected states and regions. For example, the proportion
                  of births attended by skilled health personnel was 74.8 percent for the country in 2014, but only
                  53.8 percent in Chin State, 54.3 percent in Rakhine, and 67.4 percent in Ayeyarwady. Immunization
                  coverage (three doses of pentavalent vaccine) in 2014 was 84 percent in Chin State, 93 percent
                  in Magway, 70 percent in Rakhine, and 93 percent in Sagaing. In 2015, immunization coverage
                  (pentavalent vaccine) was 38 percent in Chin State as of June, 63 percent in Magway as of August,
                  35 percent in Rakhine as of June, and 61 percent in Sagaing as of August.65

                  In addition, health awareness and knowledge are inadequate. Community involvement in public health
                  programs, child nutrition, school health, and infectious disease prevention and control programs still
                  needs to be improved. Myanmar women and men have a higher prevalence of raised blood pressure,
                  obesity, and tobacco use than other countries in the region.

                  Health care in Myanmar is offered by public and private providers, and the Ministry of Health (MOH)
                  is the major provider of comprehensive care. Myanmar’s health care system has a pluralistic mix of
                  public and private systems in both financing and provision. MOH provides comprehensive health
                  care services, covering activities for promoting health, preventing diseases, and providing effective
                  treatment and rehabilitation at the grassroots level. Private practitioners, traditional healers, health
                  assistants, midwives, and voluntary health workers, especially axillary midwives, are the main health
                  care providers at the community level. The private for-profit sector provides health care through a
                  large number of clinics and hospitals. The private not-for-profit sector, comprising community-based
                  organizations and religious organizations, provides health care through charity clinics and certain
                  hospitals. Private clinics and hospitals are required to report health statistics to MOH. Health services
                  provided at all levels of government health facilities are generally free of charge.

                  Myanmar’s health services face several challenges. In remote areas, difficulties in access and the
                  attrition of health staff and voluntary health workers, including auxiliary midwives, are significant
                  problems. There is a need to expand health infrastructure in rural areas, strengthen health care delivery
                  systems overall, and deploy and retain qualified health personnel in remote areas. The government
                  has significantly increased the health budget for pharmaceutical and medical supplies throughout the

country as part of health sector reform; but supplying drugs and medical equipment to remote areas
remains a challenge, and out-of-pocket payments for health care continue to be high. Many of the
barriers to achieving effective coverage of health services lie outside the health sector. These include
transportation, mobility of population, insufficient health budgets, lack of modern technology, and
weak local governance.

Collaboration and cooperation between various actors in the health and health-related sectors have
improved at central level over the past five years. At state and region level, however, cooperation and
collaboration still need further improvement. Better information sharing is necessary, especially when
a particular state, region, or part of the country is affected by disaster.

There are three main sources of health sector financing: public, external, and private. In Myanmar,
public funding includes government revenues channeled through the budgets of the Ministry of Health,
other ministries and departments, community-based organizations involved in health services, and
the government social security scheme. External funding mostly consists of official development
assistance provided by foreign governments and funding provided by NGOs and various charities.
Private financing derives largely from out-of-pocket payments and—to a very small extent, given that
the country is still developing a health financing system—payment by private insurance schemes.  

To address the many challenges mentioned above, the government has been undertaking health
reforms since 2011. The aim of these reforms is to achieve universal health coverage: that is, high-
quality, affordable health care for all in Myanmar, in line with Myanmar Health Vision 2030. These
health sector reforms have led to a dramatic increase in health budget and spending, although health
financing continues to be a major challenge. The health budget for the 2015/2016 financial year, at K
753 billion kyats, represents an increase of 8.7 times the 2011/2012 budget.  

The increased allocations to public health have resulted in several tangible improvements. First,
spending on essential supplies and medical equipment has increased 35 times from that in 2011, to
around US$112 million in 2014. As a consequence, the availability of pharmaceuticals and medical
supplies in public health facilities has significantly increased. Second, out-of-pocket payments have
decreased from 80 percent in 2011 to 60 percent in 2014. The financing of an essential health care
package, currently undergoing development, is expected to reduce out-of-pocket payments further.
Third, the increased health budget has led to improved health infrastructure and human resource
capacities. From 2011 to June 2015, the total number of hospitals in Myanmar increased by 15
percent, and the number of doctors and nurses increased overall by 25 percent. In the public sector,
the number of doctors has increased by nearly three times, and the number of nurses by 37 percent.
Nonetheless, the deployment of doctors and nurses is still inequitable.

Achieving universal health coverage will require solutions not only from within the health sector
but also from sectors beyond. These solutions include community development, improvements in
transport and communication, private sector participation, public education and participation, and
public finance and governance, especially at township level.

For disaster risk reduction and response, MOH has a central command system with fully equipped
Emergency Operation Center (EOC) in Nay Pyi Taw, which has a network with the Strategic Health
Operation Centers at state and regional level. The central command system has shown itself to be
effective in damage and loss assessment and in controlling communicable diseases. However, the
capacity of EOC at all levels still needs strengthening.

Regarding communicable disease surveillance and control, based on the 2008 Cyclone Nargis
experience, MOH has activated the Early Warning Alert and Response System (EWARS), an enhanced
surveillance system to detect and respond to outbreaks and unusual events in the post-disaster
period. EWARS is sensitive enough to detect outbreaks early and respond in a timely manner.

     According to MOH, the calculation does not adjust for inflation over the period in question.

                                                                                                                    63
MYANMAR POST-DISASTER NEEDS ASSESSMENT
OF FLOODS AND LANDSLIDES JULY–SEPTEMBER 2015



                  MOH has been running its Field Epidemiology Training Program, which incorporates disaster
                  management. Health staff have found this program useful. Sustainability of the program is important
                  for capacity building. On the other hand, cascade disaster management training is still required to
                  enhance the capacity of the health staff working at all levels.

                  On-the-job training, continuing medical education, and fulfilling of necessary supports are needed at
                  all levels.


                  POST-DISASTER SITUATION

                  The floods and landslides has affected the health sector in three ways. First, the destruction of
                  and damage to health facilities and roads has disrupted access to and provision of health services,
                  including referral services. Second, the disruption of lives and the various losses have directly affected
                  communities’ health-seeking behavior, which in turn has increased health risks. Third, the damage to
                  water and sanitation facilities and the crowding and unsanitary conditions of displaced communities
                  has increased the risk of infectious disease.

                  The longer-term trends and effects of the disruptions and disaster cannot yet be accurately determined.
                  For example, disruptions in treatment of infectious diseases could have a negative impact in the longer
                  term but cannot be gauged at present. In the short term, however, Health Management Information
                  System (HMIS) data show no change in trends of surveillance diseases. EWARS reports show no
                  significant increase in the burden of communicable diseases in disaster-affected areas over the pre-
                  disaster situation, and the Central Epidemiological Unit reported no significant disease outbreaks. On
                  the other hand, the disaster is expected to exacerbate existing disparities in the availability of health
                  services across geographical areas. Those areas with fewer functioning health facilities would be
                  more vulnerable than other areas to health risks in the aftermath of the disaster.

                  After the disaster MOH officials and humanitarian agencies undertook concerted efforts to provide
                  life-saving health interventions and to restore essential health services, such as immunization,
                  maternal and child health care, and continuation of treatment and care, including provision of ART
                  (antiretroviral therapy) for HIV patients, in the affected areas. The Ministry of Health immediately
                  mobilized an emergency budget for the deployment of medical teams and rapid response teams
                  and for procurement of emergency medical supplies. The World Health Organization has also been
                  providing support for emergency operational costs and medical supplies in the disaster-affected
                  areas. Other efforts by government, humanitarian agencies, and private sector donors to mitigate
                  the impact of disasters include the provision of health services through mobile clinics and activities to
                  prevent water-borne diseases. The demand for mobile health services was high in the post-disaster
                  period.

                  Infrastructure and assets and access to services. Twenty-four rural health centers and subcenters
                  have been totally destroyed by the disaster. More than 200 facilities have been partially destroyed, of
                  which 21 are township and station hospitals, and two are public health offices. In addition, access to
                  health services have been disrupted by damages to many roads, bridges, and means of transport;
                  travel to remaining health facilities has thus become difficult and time-consuming. Almost all the
                  destroyed facilities were primary health facilities, including station hospitals and rural health centers
                  and subcenters (which provide essential health care in rural areas). While the value of the damage to
                  these facilities may not be as large as that for hospitals, it has a tremendous impact on the access
                  of the rural population to health services. An overview of the health case status in disaster-affected
                  areas is in Table 20.

                  Sector governance functions and systems. There are significant health impacts at the village level
                  following the disaster. These include (i) a range of health risks that will require the health system to
                  be vigilant about potential disease outbreaks; and (ii) health needs that require treatment and care

through the health service delivery system. As of October 1, 2015, five primary-level health facilities in
Chin State and Sagaing Region, including rural health centers and subcenters, had not yet resumed
delivering health services.

Increased risks and vulnerabilities. As of October 1, 2015, 121 people had died in the affected areas
as a consequence of the floods and landslides. Six disease outbreaks were reported through EWARS
in the disaster and post-disaster phase, but they were controlled by the coordinated efforts of Ministry
of Health, related departments, health partners, and the community. Over 150,000 children under
the age of five and approximately 62,000 pregnant and lactating women are estimated to have been
affected by the floods (based on approximately 1.7 million people affected overall). Damage to crops,
roads, housing, and infrastructure is affecting access of families and children to adequate, nutritious
food and to safe environments where mothers and other caregivers can continue breastfeeding and
feeding their children. There is thus a risk that in the months following the floods, the nutritional status
of children may deteriorate, especially in townships with preexisting high levels of malnutrition and
chronic vulnerabilities, such as in Magway, Chin, and Rakhine. It is estimated that since July, there
has been an increase in the caseload of children suffering from acute malnutrition (wasting). MOH
teams detected 3,172 additional cases of children suffering from acute malnutrition in the 21 priority
flood-affected townships.

In September the government of Myanmar received initial supply and operational cost support for
nutrition-related flood response activities from partners, but the MOH National Nutrition Center has not
yet expended its own funds on nutrition flood response. This is in part because of limited earmarked
funding in the MOH line budget and in part because other partners were able to cover initial needs.
However, a scaling up of nutrition interventions will be required through the health system in upcoming
months, when further deterioration of nutritional status is likely.

                    Over 200 health facilities in the affected areas were damaged due to the disaster, including some
                    that were totally destroyed. The cost of reconstruction is around K 2,500 million. Medicines, medical
                    equipment, and furniture were also destroyed, and their cost is estimated to be over K 3,000 million.
                    Emergency health care through the mobile medical teams, activities to prevent water-borne diseases
                    and vector-borne diseases, replenishment of damaged cold chain equipment for routine immunization,
                    and nutrition interventions—these all pose additional burdens for the already-stretched human and
                    financial resources of the sector.

                    Government health services are provided free of charge and so there is no loss in revenue. However,
                    there is additional cost to government (MOH) due to additional caseload. There will be loss in revenue
                    in privately run general practice clinics, but data on these losses are not available.

RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION STRATEGY

Priorities for early recovery include restoring the functionality of the health systems and building the
capacity for effective service delivery. When restoring the health functions in the disaster-affected
area, opportunities to build back better will be sought, including reconstructing or renovating health
infrastructures for resilience to disaster, improving access to health services (compared to pre-disaster
access), strengthening disaster risk management capacities of government and communities, and
reducing risks and vulnerabilities to future disasters. The reconstruction and restoration of health
facilities will need to be based on careful planning and site selection to reduce exposure to flood
hazard. For example, in towns such as Mogaung and Kalay, only part of the town is prone to flooding.
In addition, care needs to be taken in placement of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies within
facilities so they are safe from flooding; second stories (where available) or secure storage facilities at
a higher elevation are preferred.

To address immediate needs, essential health services will be provided to the affected population
through temporary health service delivery points in relocation sites and mobile clinics; this approach
will ensure response to health needs while facilities are being restored and reequipped. Mobile clinics
and outreach services will be used and mechanisms put in place to improve access to referral centers.

Given the ongoing risks arising from the impact of the disaster, support to health services should
pay particular attention to (i) epidemiological surveillance of the population, (ii) infectious disease
prevention and control (including adequate supplies and mobile response capacity), and (iii) health
promotion through community outreach among vulnerable groups, especially for vector- and water-
borne disease prevention and treatment. To ensure a coordinated approach to the provision of
health services, township-level coordination mechanisms will be developed; these will ensure that
the different health sector partners agree on the key outcomes expected, and that resources from
different institutions are allocated efficiently. Risk insurance needs to be provided for public health
facilities and pharmaceutical supplies.

                                                                                                                       67
MYANMAR POST-DISASTER NEEDS ASSESSMENT
OF FLOODS AND LANDSLIDES JULY–SEPTEMBER 2015



                   Finally, the health program should also establish a system to track the needs and use of pharmaceutical
                   and medical supplies provided through local donors and international resources.


                   RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION PLAN

                   A summary of the recovery and reconstruction needs and initiatives are included in Table 23.

                   The short-term recovery plan of the health sector will target life-saving interventions
                   by curative and preventive approaches. The central command system at all levels will be
                   enhanced to ensure effective and efficient health care response. Emergency response will be carried
                   out in a coordinated way with other government ministries. This will include interventions to treat
                   severe wasting among children under five, prevent micronutrient deficiencies, and prevent acute
                   undernutrition among children and pregnant and lactating women.

                   The medium-term recovery plan will emphasize improving health care access by restoring
                   health facilities, improving manpower, and promoting disaster risk reduction. A disaster risk
                   management department will be established under the Department of Public Health. Emergency
                   operation centers will be established in all states and regions, and EOC at central level will be
                   enhanced.

                   The long-term recovery plan will need to be in line with other development plans at various
                   levels, and should aim to promote ongoing health sector reforms, strengthen health
                   facilities, and strengthen the health information system. MOH will take this opportunity to
                   review and assess the health system’s response to emergencies and disasters, and identify health
                   system–wide and cross-sectoral improvements. Furthermore, national, regional/state, and township
                   disaster risk management and disaster response plans will be developed. Prevention, mitigation, and
                   coping measures will be integrated in this plan. The capacity of the MOH workforce in disaster risk
                   reduction and disaster risk management will be developed.

                  RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION IMPLEMENTATION

                  Short-term, medium-term, and long-term recovery programs will all need to be accompanied by strong
                  mechanisms that track aid, coordinate programs, and monitor progress; and existing monitoring and
                  evaluation systems will need to be enhanced at all MOH levels. Effective progress monitoring and aid
                  tracking will be critical for ensuring that the government, international partners, and private sector
                  achieve the sector objectives, and for ensuring regular reporting on progress toward recovery targets,
                  on challenges faced during recovery, and on the impact of assistance provided. Finally, they allow
                  communities to provide feedback on the support provided and adjust priorities according to their
                  needs.

                  Arrangements for recovery include the following:
                  	 1)		 Reconstruction and renovation of damaged health facilities
                  	 2)		 Replenishment of medicines and equipment in the health facilities
                  	 3)		 Control of communicable diseases
                  	 4)		 Improvement in health of mothers, children, adolescents, and elderly
                  	 5)		 Improvement of hospital response to disasters
                  	 6)		 Strengthening of human resources quantitatively and qualitatively (Field Epidemiology
                  			 Training, disaster risk reduction, disaster preparedness, and disaster response planning)
                  	 7)		 Nutrition promotion and screening

                  SECTOR ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY

                  The scope and depth of the health sector assessment was constrained by the limited time in which
                  it had to be accomplished. The assessment relies on evidence whenever possible; but it also uses
                  the expert judgements of the team to estimate cost. The main source of data for the Post-Flood and
                  -Landslide Needs Assessment (PFLNA) process is secondary data. Reports from MOH are used
                  to develop the baseline or pre-disaster situation. Information from HMIS is used to compare pre-
                  and post-disaster morbidity data. However, it normally takes three months for the HMIS team to
                  produce a comprehensive data set; thus for this PFLNA the team has received and analyzed an
                  incomplete set of HMIS data. As a result, important information—such as gender-disaggregated
                  data and violence-related data—cannot be presented in the assessment report. For post-disaster
                  information on communicable diseases, the EWARS system is sensitive enough to detect outbreaks,
                  and EWARS reports show no increased burden of communicable diseases in the disaster-affected
                  areas, compared with the pre-disaster event-based surveillance system.

                  During the emergency response, mobile health teams recorded patient data, which supplement
                  the HMIS data in analysis of pre- and post-disaster morbidity, and provide evidence of burden on
                  MOH due to increased patient caseload. Information on severe acute malnutrition, micronutrient
                  deficiencies, and the cost of nutrition-related screening, prevention, and treatment was provided by
                  the National Nutrition Center with support from UNICEF and the World Food Programme.

                  Health staffs from township and station hospitals, as well as rural health centers and subcenters,
                  provided information about and photographs of damage to health facilities, including damage to
                  structures, medical equipment, medicine, and furniture. Information on occurrence, surveillance and
                  control, and treatment of outbreaks came from the Department of Public Health. The department also

provided information on the prevention of water-borne diseases, vector-borne diseases, and other
preventive measures, including information campaigns.

Cost of standard health facilities was provided by the construction unit under the Department of
Public Health; this cost was applied for totally destroyed facilities. For partially damaged facilities, the
estimates were made by health staff from facilities that submitted damage reports. Other sources of
cost estimation were Ministry of Construction, United Nations Population Fund (reproductive health
kits), and the procurement department under the Department of Public Health.

SUMMARY

As a result of the floods and landslides, some 4,116 schools were affected in 11 states/
regions.67 Of those, 213 schools were fully destroyed and 430 were structurally damaged.
Affected schools were closed for less than three weeks on average; because the floods and landslides
occurred during the academic year (June–March), these closures affected students’ learning. Almost
all affected schools resumed education after mud and water were cleaned from the building and
immediate repairs were made. Recognition must go to the government of Myanmar for its quick
response and provision of resources directly to affected schools, which allowed classes to resume
quickly. Although most schools with more extensive damage were able to identify other learning
spaces in the community, continued support is required to ensure a minimum-quality educational
environment in flood-affected schools.  

The Ministry of Education (MOE), in partnership with other line ministries, local government, the
community, the private sector, NGOs, and development partners, responded swiftly to the disaster
and provided teaching and learning materials (TLMs), classroom furniture, and small amounts of cash
for cleaning/repairing. The immediate psychosocial needs of children, teachers, and caregivers are
being addressed and supported by the Department of Social Welfare and humanitarian partners,
with a focus on Chin, Rakhine, Sagaing, and Magway. This spirit of collaboration and civic support for
education ensures that losses in the sector were minimized.

Recovery needs were identified and estimated based on build back better (BBB) principles, which
state that all new schools should become more resilient to future disaster and should ensure a better
and more inclusive learning environment under ongoing educational reforms. In collaboration with the
School Construction Sub-Working Group (SC-SWG) under the Education Thematic Work Group, MOE
is developing improved school designs/technical specifications that incorporate BBB principles, and
it will coordinate an extensive school-to-school assessment linked with the Education Management
Information System. The recovery strategies emphasize an opportunity to improve access to higher-
quality education and the importance of mainstreaming disaster risk reduction (DRR) in education
(through curriculum, TLMs, teacher education/training, capacity development of education officers
at union and local levels, and awareness raising/training of parent-teacher associations [PTAs] and
communities). The National Education Sector Plan (NESP) should reflect the recovery strategies and
planned budget.


PRE-DISASTER CONTEXT

In the 2015/2016 school year, the basic education system consists of 45,355 primary and post-
primary schools, 13,334 middle schools, and 3,511 high schools. Total enrollment in those basic
education schools is 9,152,200 (4,549,575 girls and 4,582,621 boys). About 157,762 children attend
monastic schools, which teach the national curriculum and are administered under the Ministry of
Religious Affairs. In Rakhine State, more than 35,000 children are attending primary and post-primary
learning opportunities in temporary learning spaces in internally displaced person (IDP) camps and
host communities. Enrollment in private schools is virtually nonexistent in primary and middle school
in affected areas. The numbers of boys and girls who enroll in school is almost equal at national level,
although gender disparity exists in some areas. Most children who enroll complete primary school
(83 percent of children in recent cohorts), but far fewer (less than half of that 83 percent) complete
middle school (Table 24). Even fewer children progress onward. Only around a third of all children of
school age are enrolled in secondary education. Children in rural, remote areas, or those from poor
families or from minority or vulnerable groups, have less chance of access to good-quality basic

                  education. In addition, children with physical or mental disabilities often face difficulties in accessing
                  school, as many schools and teachers are not prepared to include them in the classroom or support
                  their learning.

                  Since 2011, MOE has undertaken a wide range of education reforms, including the Comprehensive
                  Education Sector Review and formation of the Education Promotion Implementation Committee. As
                  part of these reforms, the National Education Law was approved in 2014 and amended in 2015. The
                  law provides a clear national framework for progressive, integrated teacher- and student-centered
                  reforms that are still continuing. Major reforms include (i) restructuring the education system to include
                  a kindergarten (KG) year and 12 years of subsequent schooling, (ii) developing basic education
                  curriculum to address 21st-century skills, and (iii) raising teacher salaries and recruiting over 60,000
                  daily wage teachers to address gaps in teacher supply. The MOE will develop the NESP for the
                  next five years (2016–2021) to continue addressing major challenges relating to equitable access,
                  inclusion, and quality of learning.


                  POST-DISASTER SITUATION

                  Floods and landslides affected 4,116 schools. Of this number, 213 were destroyed and 430 were
                  damaged; the remaining 3,473 schools had limited damage to infrastructure or facilities but did
                  sustain damage to learning materials and equipment, which disrupted teaching and learning.

                  Damage to the education sector. In this section, a detailed breakdown of (i) fully destroyed, (ii)
                  partially damaged, and (iii) affected/flooded facilities is provided by state/region. Of the 213 MOE
                  schools that were fully destroyed, B13 were high schools, 37 were middle or post-primary schools,
                  and 163 were primary schools. In addition, 7 monastic schools reported fully destroyed (Table 25).
                  The most-affected states were Rakhine (66 schools destroyed) and Chin (47 schools destroyed); in
                  Chin, 4 percent of all schools were destroyed, the highest share of schools destroyed.

                  The 430 partially damaged schools sustained varying degrees of damage to walls, roofing, and
                  other infrastructure and facilities. It was not possible to determine the exact nature of damage in the
                  rapid surveys that were conducted, and more in-depth survey analysis of damaged schools is being
                  planned under the short-term recovery plans. The most-affected states are Ayeyarwady (110) and
                  Rakhine (226). A total of 31 monastic schools were also damaged. In Rakhine State an estimated 126
                  temporary learning spaces in IDP camps and host communities were partially or severely damaged.
                  No major infrastructural damages to central-level education institutions and administration offices
                  occurred, although at subnational level, some damages to local education offices were reported.

Service and productivity losses. Because the floods and landslides occurred during the academic
year (June to March), losses occurred to contact hours, which may have an impact on the school
calendar. The standard number of school days per year is 175, or 35 weeks. Of the 4,116 affected
schools, almost all were closed for less than three weeks (end of July–mid-August), though more
than 150 schools in Sagaing and Magway Regions were temporarily closed again for several days
in September due to high river water level. For those schools that closed, there will be a need to
extend school days to weekends and/or school holidays to accommodate lost teaching hours. This
may have an impact on salaries and remuneration of teachers and school staff—who may need
to extend their teaching time by several weeks to catch up. Although data are not available, it is
probable that parent- teacher associations and school management committees have temporarily
ceased to function due to the impact of the floods and landslides on the livelihoods of many families
across the affected areas. Similarly, losses related to official documentation—test results, registration,
official IDs—may have negative impacts on children’s and teachers’ smooth return to schools and
resumption of education activities.

Most of the affected schools resumed education after cleaning and repairing their buildings and
facilities and replacing damaged books and furniture. Most schools with more extensive damage
were able to identify other temporary learning locations in the community, such as communal or
religious facilities, by the end of August. Where alternative learning spaces cannot be used for long
periods, temporary learning spaces need to be constructed as resources become available in order
to ensure continuity of education.

Even in areas where schools reopened, many affected schools have been using a shift system to
host all children in the remaining classrooms, meaning that children are losing effective learning time.
In addition, there have been some reports that as of September, a number of children from Rakhine
were not back to school—either because they could not adapt to the new schedule or because they
had to support their family. While reports indicate that very few students have dropped out to date,
the impact of floods and landslides on family incomes, along with increased vulnerability during the
coming months, means that the true impact on dropping out has not yet been felt.

The distress caused by the floods and landslides threatens children’s psychosocial well-being across
affected areas of Myanmar, and that of their teachers, caregivers, and families. To alleviate their
suffering and support recovery, it is critical that the education and social protection sectors collaborate
to provide immediate psychosocial support for children in and out of school. Identification of children
at risk of dropping out of school is also important in order to reduce longer-term protection risks of
flood- and landslide-affected children, such as involvement in trafficking, child labor, early marriage,
and gender-based/domestic violence. Children’s vulnerabilities and coping capacities are determined
                                                                                                                          75

                      by many factors, including their age, socioeconomic status, and gender. In many cultural contexts,
                      women and girls are more vulnerable to risks associated with natural hazards, and it is critical that
                      they are equally included in the recovery process and their needs addressed.

                      In the immediate aftermath of the floods and landslides, the government allocated K 200,000 per
                      school through township education offices for head teachers and members of the local community;
                      these funds were used to hire local labor to clean and repair schools and to buy necessary construction
                      materials, but they also provided much-needed revenue to local communities affected by the flood,
                      mitigating further loss. Humanitarian partners supported the government by conducting joint multi-
                      cluster/sector initial rapid assessments, providing essential teaching and learning materials, and
                      supporting the provision of temporary learning spaces and immediate repair of damaged schools,
                      with a focus on Rakhine, Chin, Sagaing, Magway, and Ayeyarwady.

ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE EFFECTS AND THE IMPACT OF THE
DISASTER ON THE SECTOR

The following assumptions were made in estimating the financial costs for the damage incurred.
Due to time limitations and the fact that information provided from field level was not verified through
field surveys, actual costs for damage are estimates only. As a result, damage costs may be over- or
underestimated and can be corrected based upon actual field surveys, which are included under the
medium-term recovery strategy.

	    •	 If a building is destroyed, the current MOE’s school unit cost of K 60 million is applied to
        reconstruct a new school (approximate cost of 9 meter by 27 meter building).
	    •	 If a building is damaged, the cost of damage assumes that 30 percent of the reconstruction
        cost would be required to rehabilitate the building. It should be noted that approximately 40
        percent of damaged schools are assumed to need complete reconstruction/retrofitting under
        a BBB approach, as they were built with locally available materials (e.g., bamboo and mud)
        and are not resilient to future disaster.
	    •	 If a building is affected with flood water, it is assumed that at least 30 percent of the costs of
        partial damage would be required to replace classroom furniture and teaching and learning
        materials.
	    •	 If education offices were reported among damages, they are included in the damage list.
	    •	 The following are included on the list of damaged schools: religious schools providing basic
        education (monastic schools under Ministry of Religious Affairs or Christian schools as
        registered community schools under MOE), training institutions under the Ministry of Border
        Affairs, branch schools recognized by MOE, and temporary learning centers. Private schools
        are not included.


                                                                                                                                                                                         77

                    The total damage and loss for the education sector in Myanmar is estimated to be K 50,493 million.
                    The highest damage is estimated in Rakhine and amounted to K 13,640 million. In Chin and Sagaing
                    Regions, where landslides occurred and/or whole communities were washed away by floodwater,
                    schools need to be relocated to safer places for reconstruction. The government should clearly
                    articulate its strategy and budget for land acquisition for new school sites, as this is not included in the
                    sector estimation. In Rakhine and many other places, original school buildings were of poor quality
                    and vulnerable to any disaster. BBB principles should be applied to all new schools.

                    RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION STRATEGY

                    BBB principles are closely linked to the Comprehensive School Safety framework68 and should
                    guide recovery and reconstruction. All new schools should (i) be resilient to future disasters in line
                    with appropriate standards (resilient buildings with safe and adequately sized staircases, necessary
                    elevation for schools in delta areas, improved water, sanitation, and hygiene [WASH] facilities,
                    separate toilets for boys and girls, etc.); and (ii) ensure a better learning environment under ongoing
                    educational reforms (additional classrooms for KG in primary schools, additional classrooms for post-
                    primary schools to upgrade to middle schools, teachers’ room, teachers’ houses for remote areas,
                    good-quality classroom furniture, libraries with age-appropriate books, laboratories, etc.).




                    68
                       The framework focuses on safe learning facilities, school disaster management, and resilience education. It would ensure
                    that all learners and education workers are protected from death, injury, and harm in schools; and would support educational
                    continuity in the face of all types of hazards and threats. It would also safeguard education sector investments—in both
                    physical and human capital—and contribute to increasing the resilience of children and communities to the negative impacts
                    of climate change and disasters in Myanmar. See Global Alliance for Disaster Risk Reduction and Resilience in the Education
                    Sector and Worldwide Initiative for Safe Schools, “Comprehensive School Safety Guidance Note,” 2014.

RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION PLAN

The sector recovery plan should fit into the ongoing education reforms and provide an opportunity
to improve access to higher-quality education for all children, including marginalized children such
as those with disabilities. As proposed in the BBB principles, the plan should emphasize improved
school design with disaster resilience and a better learning environment. Resilient school buildings
with improved school designs would involve a 15–30 percent increase in unit cost per school. Better
learning environments in the context of the ongoing education reforms would involve a 25–30 percent
increase in the total school construction cost.

The recovery plan needs to go beyond infrastructure alone. It should include the mainstreaming of
disaster education in the ongoing basic education curriculum reform, and should also include teacher
education and trainings; capacity development of education officials at union, regional, and local
levels; capacity development of PTAs; and strengthening of school disaster management planning
and implementation with children’s active participation. It should facilitate the development of a
national DRR framework to be clearly featured in and fully mainstreamed into the NESP. Collaboration
with social protection plans must be strengthened to ensure that students who drop out or are at risk
due to economic hardship or migration (as a result of floods and landslides) are provided incentives,
stipends, or other support to continue their education. The specific short-, medium-, and long-term
needs are proposed as follows. Table 27 summarizes the needs for the education sector.

Short-term needs (four months)
	 •	 Resume education services (temporary learning spaces and/or cleaning of affected schools)
	 •	 Provide textbooks, exercise books, and TLMs
	 •	 Provide classroom furniture, drinking water
	 •	 Revise minimum standard of basic school designs/specification to reflect BBB principles (e.g.,
      disaster resilience, improved WASH facilities, separate toilets for boys and girls, additional
      classrooms for KG in primary schools, upgrading of post-primary school to middle school,
      accessibility for children with disability, teachers’ room, etc.)
	 •	 Establish a mechanism to coordinate with Ministry of Religious Affairs, Ministry of Border
      Affairs, and Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) for future disasters
	 •	 Implement affected-school survey/assessment
	 •	 Provide life-skills and psychosocial support for students and teachers
	 •	 Organize workshop/seminar to raise awareness of DRR and resilience for MOE officials at
      union and local levels.

Mid-term needs (one year)
	 •	 Reconstruct destroyed schools using BBB principles
	 •	 Relocate schools to new/safer locations where required
	 •	 Rehabilitate damaged schools and education offices using BBB principles
	 •	 Engage PTAs/school committees in reconstruction/rehabilitation work to enhance monitoring
	 •	 Incorporate DRR and resilience perspective into ongoing development of the basic education
      curriculum and textbooks
	 •	 Implement teacher trainings on DRR and resilience (including protection issues) and pilot risk
      mapping for disaster preparedness plans
	 •	 Strengthen linkages with Education Management Information System and provide GPS
      coordinates of damaged/destroyed school sites to Myanmar Information Management Unit
      linkages.
	 •	 Support school surveys that can be used as baseline data in case of future emergencies
	 •	 Explore with World Food Programme possibility of providing school feeding with locally cooked
      meals for affected schoolchildren
	 •	 Ensure that NESP reflects medium- and long-term recovery plan strategies and budgets
	 •	 Ensure that NESP incorporates  DRR

                   Long-term needs (beyond one year)
                   	 •	 Reconstruct destroyed schools with BBB principles
                   	 •	 Rehabilitate damaged schools with BBB principles
                   	 •	 Continue to integrate DRR and resilience into the ongoing development of the basic education
                        curriculum and textbooks, including modules to enhance awareness and understanding of
                        global issues such as natural disasters/climate change, which can be integrated into various
                        subjects (e.g., life skills, science, social studies, local curriculum, and others)
                   	 •	 Institutionalize teacher education and training on DRR and resilience (including protection
                        issues)
                   	 •	 Provide school feeding with locally cooked meals to reduce hunger (which affects learning), to
                        enhance awareness of nutrition, and to generate local employment
                   	 •	 Develop school disaster risk map for strengthening disaster preparedness and response at
                        school and community levels with child participation; use Township Education Improvement
                        Plan processes and guidelines to coordinate township preparedness and response plans to
                        township education plans
                   	 •	 Develop capacity of MOE officials at both union and local levels.

                  RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION IMPLEMENTATION

                  The strategies and planned budget as identified in the recovery plan will be reflected in the NESP,
                  which will strengthen the management of partnerships and the coordination mechanisms available
                  for recovery. Estimated costs to mainstream BBB principles into school construction have already
                  been costed. By conducting a detailed affected-school survey as part of the short- and medium-term
                  response, a clearer picture of the resource needs will become available. The data collected on schools
                  will be included in the Education Management Information System, with school geographical data
                  shared with Myanmar Information Management Unit and integrated with ongoing school mapping
                  initiatives.

                  A steering committee for school construction, led by the minister of education, has been proposed
                  for coordination and efficiency purposes. To ensure improved emergency preparedness and mitigate
                  the impact of future natural disasters, the NESP will incorporate DRR and Comprehensive School
                  Safety framework principles; these principles should be mainstreamed into the NESP implementation
                  strategies and into the new MOE departmental structures. A technical committee, headed by the
                  director general of Department of Basic Education, is being proposed to ensure quality and manage
                  day-to-day implementation of the recovery plan.

                  Excellent partnerships have already been established to support the education sector’s response to
                  the floods and landslides. The Myanmar Chamber of Commerce and leading business enterprises
                  have made significant pledges to support school renovation and construction—and have met with
                  MOE to ensure their support is coordinated and follows quality standards. A wide range of civil
                  society, nongovernmental, and faith-based organizations have also been contributing temporary
                  learning spaces, as well as labor, materials, cash, and supplies for their local schools, which are more
                  difficult to quantify and coordinate. The Education Thematic Work Group, which was formed as part
                  of Nargis recovery and comprises civil society and government members, is functioning strongly. The
                  group has expanded its role to include a DRR Working Group, which in turn has established a School
                  Construction Sub-Working Group, co-chaired by Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation
                  (SDC) and World Vision.

                  From the MOE, approximately US$ 3.6 million of additional funds have already been allocated to
                  schools in response to the floods and landslides. Allocation of additional resources from MOE can
                  be expected in the coming fiscal year. The government of Japan has committed US$40 million for
                  the education sector response, while the Quality Basic Education Programme partners (Australia,
                  Denmark, European Union, Norway, United Kingdom, and UNICEF) have agreed to reallocate at
                  least US$2 million of existing resources for the flood response in 2015/2016. NGOs and bilateral
                  partners, including SDC, Save the Children, World Vision, PLAN, Japan Platform, and others, have
                  all committed resources and expertise to the flood response and recovery. The Primary Curriculum
                  Reform project, supported by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), is incorporating DRR
                  and emergency preparedness into primary curriculum, textbooks, and teaching materials.


                  SECTOR ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY

                  Three sets of flood survey data were compiled and analyzed in preparing this report: survey data
                  collected by state/regional governments, survey data managed under the General Administration
                  Department, and survey data collected under state/region and township education offices.

                  The final review process before preparing this report involved an October 1, 2015, validation
                  workshop held by the MOE in Nay Pyi Taw with state/region education officials from 12 affected
                  states/regions. This workshop reviewed the draft, consolidated data, and provided clarification
                  and correction as required. The workshop and review process were able to feed directly into the
                  Post-Flood and -Landslide Needs Assessment report for education. The MOE was consulted for
                  the recovery strategies and plan, including BBB principles with cost estimation, in an October 5

consultation meeting in Nay Pyi Taw. The MOE and key stakeholders from SC-SWG have analyzed
information and discussed proposed recovery strategies with the needs assessment team members
(UNICEF, JICA, and World Bank). Information from UNICEF field offices (particularly from Rakhine,
Sagaing, Magway, and Chin) and findings from a field trip in Sagaing by the JICA team have been
reflected in the report.

                  Housing and Settlements
                  SUMMARY

                  More than 1.6 million people were displaced by the flooding and landslides in July and
                  August 2015. While a small number of households remained in shelters by late September, most
                  had returned to their homes. But many of those who returned found that their houses were flooded,
                  damaged, or destroyed. States and regions reported that nearly 525,000 houses were affected
                  by floods, strong winds, and landslides, including nearly 39,000 houses destroyed and more than
                  485,000 damaged to different degrees. The area with the highest number of affected houses was
                  Ayeyarwady Region, the same region pummeled by Cyclone Nargis in 2008; it had over 19,000
                  destroyed houses and more than 108,000 damaged. Rakhine State, Sagaing Region, Bago State,
                  Chin State, and Yangon Region were also heavily affected. The impact of these events on the housing
                  stock varies among states and regions, not only in the amount of damage and the relative impact on
                  the overall housing sector, but also in the type of damage experienced. Much of Chin State’s damage,
                  for example, was the result of landslides, and not only will relocation be needed, but damage to roads
                  could make reconstruction in this mountainous region expensive for homeowners.

                  According to local authorities, nearly 3,000 households in Chin State and approximately 1,600 in
                  Sagaing Region will need to be relocated to safer locations during the recovery phase. As is always
                  the case with housing, most of the damage and losses are classified as private (given that housing
                  is a private good). The needs in the housing and settlements sector are associated with the cost of
                  relocation, the repair and reconstruction of housing, the restoration of household water and sanitation
                  services, and the rehabilitation and stabilization of housing sites and settlements.

                  The recovery strategy outlined envisions government working in collaboration with partners to build on
                  recent policy advances in housing and social protection and on the new provisional Myanmar National
                  Building Code. The housing recovery program will allow government to partially finance and oversee a
                  homeowner-driven repair and reconstruction program that will promote safe building practices. This
                  “building back better” approach will not only contribute to long-term national development objectives
                  for disaster risk reduction, but will ensure that housing recovery contributes to the president’s goal:
                  that in recovery there is “no one left behind.”

                  housing   include (i) apartment/condominium, (ii) bungalow/brick house, (iii) semi-pacca house, (iv)
                  wooden house, (v) bamboo house, and (vi) hut. Traditional houses of wood and bamboo are found
                  throughout the country, and are predominant in rural areas, where 90 percent of all houses are
                  traditional, i.e., constructed of wood or bamboo or classified as huts. Even in urban areas, these three
                  categories cover 63 percent of all housing units (67 percent without Yangon) (Figure 28 left). Modern
                  masonry buildings and apartments are found mostly in towns and cities in Myanmar. Traditional
                  houses generally have a multipurpose room, a small bedroom for adults, a shrine, an entrance porch
                  or veranda, and an outdoor kitchen. Traditional housing types are more common in the townships
                  affected by the 2015 floods and landslides than in the country overall: in the former, 89 percent of all
                  housing is built of wood or bamboo or classified as huts, whereas the figure for the latter is 81 percent
                  (see Table 28).

Note: a. Huts are considered an improvised housing form with low value at first but increase in value after the first year as owners improve
and expand them.


Housing is an important family asset in Myanmar, with more than 86 percent of all households owning
their own homes (93 percent in rural areas). The largest number and percentage of renters are found
in the urban townships of Yangon (31 percent), but significant shares of renters are found in other
urban townships as well, including Kayin (28 percent), Tanintharyi (23 percent), Chin (21 percent), and
Kachin (16 percent). Less than 4 percent of rural households rent their house in all states and regions
except for Yangon and Tanintharyi (see Figure 28 right).

The 2010 household survey found average housing size varied from 396 ft2 to 688 ft2 (37 m2 to 64
m2), with one of the smallest averages (422 ft2, or 39 m2) found in Chin, the mountainous and relatively
poor state affected by the landslide, and one of the largest (676 ft2, or 63 m2) found in the relatively
prosperous Yangon Region. Yet housing size correlates more to factors such as climate and culture
than income—East Shan, one of the poorest areas of the country, has the largest average floor
size (688 ft2, or 64 m2). These cultural differences in housing size and style must be kept in mind in
planning reconstruction.

OF FLOODS AND LANDSLIDES JULY–SEPTEMBER 2015



                  Construction materials. The most common construction materials for walls are dhani or theke
                  leaves (12 percent), bamboo (56 percent), and wood (21 percent) in rural areas, and bamboo (38
                  percent), wood (22 percent), and tile, brick, or concrete (34 percent) in urban areas.

                  The most common material for roofs in almost all states and regions, and in both urban and rural areas,
                  is corrugated metal sheets. Thatch (dani/theke/in leaf) is the next most common roofing material; it is
                  used on more than 40 percent of all rural houses, and on more than 10 percent of all urban houses.

                  Household water and sanitation. In rural areas nationally, drinking water is accessed principally
                  by means of tube wells or boreholes (33 percent), springs (28 percent), and standing water sources,
                  rivers, or streams (24 percent). In urban areas, the principal sources are bottled water (31 percent),
                  tube wells (28 percent), piped tap water (16 percent), and springs (13 percent). Only 5 percent of
                  urban households and less than 1 percent of rural households report having flush toilets for sanitation.
                  The vast majority of households use improved pit latrines (87 percent in urban areas and 66 percent
                  in rural areas) or traditional pit latrines (4 percent and 9 percent).

                  Land. Land in Myanmar is classified into categories that include freehold (ancestral) land, grant land,
                  reserved forest land, farmland, grazing land, and religious land, among others. The Constitution
                  establishes that with certain historic exceptions, all land belongs to the union. The current land regime
                  is governed by a combination of new and old laws that are sometimes contradictory, and can lead to
                  tenure insecurity. The land registration system is considered by many to be outdated, and is managed
                  by various government ministries whose maps may not reflect current occupancy and land-use
                  patterns. A number of legal reforms are under way. Given Myanmar’s large rural population and the
                  importance of agricultural production to the economy, both the focus of land reforms and the origin
                  of many tenure disputes have been associated with smallholder farmers. Ownership of a house does
                  not necessarily imply ownership of the land on which it is situated or any other land, nor does it ensure
                  security of the family’s land tenure situation. Nationally, the highest rates of landlessness are found
                  in Bago (59 percent landowners), Yangon (41 percent landowners), and Ayeyarwady (67 percent
                  landowners), which were all affected by the floods and landslides. However, only in Yangon do the
                  data on homeowners and landowners correspond closely. The National Housing and Population
                  Census reports that homeownership as a share of all types of housing tenure status by state or region
                  is 92 percent in Bago, 64 percent in Yangon, and 94 percent in Ayeyarwady. These figures are even
                  higher in the rural parts of the three regions, at 95 percent, 81 percent, and 96 percent, respectively.

                  Relocation will be a factor in the post-flood and -landslide recovery in Chin and Sagaing, where
                  government has expressed a commitment to finding new sites for those who will be relocated.
                  Otherwise, most reconstruction will take place in existing sites, which generally gives rise to fewer
                  land tenure issues. Nevertheless, the monitoring system should be designed to detect and flag any
                  land tenure problems that could impede recovery.

                  Building practices and building codes. Rural housing is often built by owners using local
                  craftsmen or is a collaborative effort within the village carried out by several households working
                  together. Construction technology is based on traditional knowledge and skills. In one post-Nargis
                  assessment, concern was expressed that wooden structures, whether traditional or modern, were
                  often not properly secured, and that while both thatched roofs and those made of corrugated
                  galvanized iron and zinc could in principle be built with increased resilience to cyclones, they were in
                  fact often missing proper anticyclone protection, such as bracing and traction-resistant nails. It is safe
                  to assume these deficient practices have continued.

                  The country’s first building code was published in 1947 by the Rangoon Development Trust, which was
                  revised as a national code in 1991 by the Ministry of Border Areas and National Races Development.
                  The destruction caused by Cyclone Nargis in 2008 helped produce a political commitment to
                  developing a national building code.

The country’s new building code, Myanmar National Building Code (MNBC-2012), is provisional. It
was developed in the past few years under the ambitious Myanmar National Building Code Project,
led by the Ministry of Construction.69 The project’s Coordination Committee has overseen working
groups of local engineers, architects, and other experts from both the public and private sectors, with
support from the Myanmar Engineering Society and United Nations Human Settlements Programme
(UN-Habitat).

MNBC-2012 addresses disaster resiliency and environmental sustainability in line with international
standards while also considering the local context. MNBC-2012 is further improved by the Green
Building Code, which focuses on reductions in energy and water consumption, and the effective
use of rainwater. By using these guidelines whenever possible in the reconstruction of damaged
buildings, Myanmar can build back better and offer a vision for a sustainable future. While MNBC-
2012 is provisional, it is an important first step in full implementation of the code, which will include
developing a complete legal and institutional framework, as well as preparing simplified guidelines
on topics such as safe construction and disaster risk reduction that should be made available at the
township level.

Building standards for housing. Like building codes in many countries, the MNBC-2012 applies
in general to nonengineered buildings such as homeowner-built housing, but does not provide the
same detailed specifications for them as it does for engineered buildings. To improve the safety of
structures such as informally built housing, the Ministry of Construction is working through its own
training center to promote safer construction practices among carpenters and masons in the context
of the National Skills Standards Authority (NSSA) program. To date, approximately 200 tradespeople
(mostly carpenters) have been trained under this program.

Even though MNBC-2012 is not fully operational, it should be the standard for the post-flood and
landslide reconstruction. Key stakeholders (the government, Myanmar Engineering Society, and both
formal and informal sectors of the construction industry) must agree on the degree of application
and any limitations, and must widely publicize them. As both the government and the construction
industry are aware of the provisional codes, it should at a minimum be feasible to apply them to
reconstruction of schools, hospitals, and lifeline facilities such as public buildings, bridges, roads,
culvert, etc.

In the case of informal housing, technical assistance will be needed to organize and implement the
“build back better” approached described below. This assistance should include mobilizing the newly
trained carpenters to lead the house-to-house inspections and to provide training and quality control
over homeowner-driven housing reconstruction. The private sector and universities could be enlisted
in the training, and the inspectors should receive special certification afterward and understand that
they will have the opportunity to be mobilized for future post-disaster inspection processes.

Existing policies and tools relevant to recovery. Since late 2014, the government, led by the
Ministry of Construction, has been actively involved in developing legal and policy frameworks for
affordable housing and for social protection, including post-disaster housing assistance. In developing
a new National Housing Policy and Housing Development Law (both in early drafts), the government
seeks to (i) establish a balanced and sustainable process for developing new settlements, and (ii)
provide adequate housing for all citizens. Given the growth pressure in urban areas, the focus to
date is on the system for developing low-cost housing in urban areas. No benchmarks for adequate
housing have yet been defined that would guide reconstruction.

In December 2014, the Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement (MSWRR) issued the
Myanmar National Social Protection Strategic Plan, which identifies a range of disaster risk
management and post-disaster social protection mechanisms, and calls for alignment of post-
disaster assistance with the plan.

                     Neither the draft Housing Policy nor the Social Protection Strategic Plan provides ready-made
                     operational approaches for recovery, but they provide an auspicious platform for articulating a well-
                     considered housing recovery strategy, including recommendations on the application of the MNBC
                     and Green Building Code.

                     Other policy tools that should be incorporated in housing recovery include the MNBC-2012;
                     carpenter training and training guidelines; local planning methodologies being developed and
                     already in use by the Ministry of Construction, Department of Housing and Human Settlements;
                     disaster risk management committees and disaster risk management funds at the state, region, and
                     township levels; and methodologies for community mobilization and project supervision developed
                     in connection with the recently approved Community-Driven Development project. The relevance
                     of these policies and tools will depend on the final design of the housing and settlements recovery
                     strategy (below), which should be developed in a participatory manner.


                     POST-DISASTER SITUATION

                     More than 1.6 million people were displaced by the floods and landslides, but they had largely
                     returned to their homes by September. Many households returned to flooded, damaged, or destroyed
                     houses. States and regions reported that 524,568 houses were affected due to floods, strong winds,
                     and landslides. This includes 38,542 destroyed and 486,026 damaged housing units.70 The worst-
                     affected area is Ayeyarwady Region, with 19,114 destroyed and 108,165 damaged homes. Rakhine
                     State also suffered severe losses, with 13,392 homes destroyed and 114,666 homes damaged.
                     In Sagaing Region, 1,963 houses were destroyed and 104,641 were damaged. Other areas that
                     experienced significant damage include Bago, Chin, and Yangon. According to local authorities,
                     2,987 households in Chin State will need to be relocated to safer locations, and approximately 1,600
                     in Sagaing Region will need to be relocated (see Figure 29).

The states or regions with the largest share of affected houses (relative to the number of housing units
in the affected townships recorded in the 2014 National Housing and Population Census) are Rakhine
State (30 percent of all housing units), Ayeyarwady Region (13 percent), Sagaing Region (12 percent),
and Magway Region (11 percent) (Table 29). A high share of housing damage has the potential to
raise rents along with land and materials costs in the local market.

Minor damage to water sources; loss of sanitation facilities. In addition to damage to housing,
there has been considerable damage to household sanitation facilities. In rural areas the majority of
these are fly-proof latrines, which are simple raised timber or bamboo huts that house a plastic squat
toilet pan with a straight offset pipe going into a subsurface soak pit. The pit is usually unlined, making
it particularly susceptible to damage during flooding. These structures are extremely vulnerable to
flooding, which results not only in physical damage to the asset, but also in the release of fecal sludge
into flood waters.

Following the recent floods and landslides, damage to water sources was minor, although there is
likely to be an increase in the use of untreated water for cooking and drinking, and this, coupled with
poor sanitation conditions, has the potential to increase the spread of vector-borne diseases and
further increase the burden of work for women, who are the primary family caregivers.

Undermining of housing sites and damage to local amenities. In the landslide areas, severe
damage to housing sites is the principal motivation for relocation of households. However, damage
to sites and settlements is also a concern in some flooded areas. Impacts on settlements may also
include damage to community amenities such as local streets, pathways, and common spaces,
including markets, but there may also be damage that undermines the stability of housing plots and
settlements, due to erosion and the effects of waterlogging.

                         Households alone will not be capable of addressing these damages, which are not included in
                         damage estimates. Only the estimated cost of household silt and debris removal was included in
                         housing and settlements loss figures. In some cases, community planning exercises may be needed
                         in order to reconfigure land uses and identify priority investments. It was assumed that states and
                         regions have included some of settlement-related investment needs in their infrastructure damage
                         figures, but the figures could not be confirmed. Alternatively, in the interest of disaster risk reduction,
                         states, regions, and townships could identify and categorize these damages and then budget for
                         them in future local capital budgets.

                         It is strongly recommended that government conduct a house-to-house damage assessment using
                         trained engineers and/or other building professionals who would inspect the houses and complete a
                         form that standardizes the types of housing damage and site damage. Based on the data collected, a
                         matrix of damage types (“damage typology”) in the affected areas could be produced to systematize
                         common failures and identify needed improvements in construction methods. Such an assessment
                         would also produce valuable data for allocating financial assistance to households, for estimating
                         demands for materials and other inputs, and for monitoring the progress of recovery at the household
                         and township levels. The inspectors could also distribute to households basic information on “build
                         back better” techniques and the housing recovery strategy.

                   ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE EFFECTS AND IMPACT OF THE DISASTER ON
                   THE SECTOR

                   Housing and settlements damage. The Post-Flood and -Landslide Needs Assessment (PFLNA)
                   shows housing and settlements to be one of the sectors most affected, with an estimated K 508 billion
                   in damages and K 34 billion in losses. These figures are based on estimates of housing replacement
                   costs by type, with some regional adjustments (Table 30).71 The vast majority of this damage is
                   private, meaning that it is private household assets that have been lost: whole houses, housing
                   value from damages, and household belongings. The damage figure includes damage estimates
                   for both landslides and flooding, acknowledging that the type of damage is different. Damage to
                   private household water and sanitation facilities is also included in this figure. Due to inconsistencies
                   in housing condition data, and to variations in how housing damage was categorized, the damage
                   and needs figures used here are based on a number of conservative but critical assumptions that will
                   need to be validated for planning purposes. Some of the key assumptions are included in the text.

                   Housing and settlements losses. Losses in this sector are the result of lost rental income and
                   extraordinary expenses incurred as the result of the disaster. Because housing is a private good, only
                   K 200 million are public sector effects, largely the cost to government to run shelters and provide
                   other emergency food and supplies to families.

                   Households are still displaced in landslide areas in particular, which has resulted in out-of-pocket
                   costs for government and other providers of short-term shelter facilities. In early September, the
                   MSWRR estimated that 1.6 million individuals were displaced. As of late September, this number was
                   significantly reduced, with only a few thousand individuals estimated to remain in shelters, although
                   there has been no appraisal of the conditions in which previously displaced households are living,
                   which should be an equal concern.

                     Damage is based on replacement cost per square foot by type of housing and average house size by type. The replacement
                   costs that resulted were checked against reported sales values by state/region and housing type reported in the Integrated
                   Household Living Conditions Survey, and reduced by level of damage.

As noted above, approximately 2,900 households require relocation in Chin State as a result of
landslides, and approximately 1,600 households in Sagaing Region require relocation because of
severe flooding. For those displaced by landslides, an urgent process to identify sites for reconstruction
is well under way. Government will either rebuild for the household in the new site or provide an
equivalent subsidy to allow households to reconstruct themselves. A similar process is expected in
Sagaing.

While construction takes place, transitional sheltering options are likely to be required to allow families
to exit camps and live safely.72 These options could include hosting, provision of rental subsidies, or
transitional shelters at new or existing housing sites. Some of the 38,542 households with completely
destroyed housing who can reconstruct on site will also require transitional sheltering arrangements.
These arrangements could continue for at least one year. One advantage of transitional housing
solutions is that they buy time for government and families to develop durable solutions, but those
who receive transitional assistance should not lose any right they may have to relocation and/or
assistance with permanent housing.

Due to a lack of information, the loss estimate currently includes only a moderate amount (K 200 million)
for transitional sheltering, but costs could reach up to K 20 billion if 50 percent of the households
needing to be relocated or with destroyed housing were provided a one-year transitional sheltering
option. Building a physical transitional shelter is the most expensive of various transitional options,
but if it is built from materials that can be later sold or reused in the permanent reconstruction, this
expenditure reduces future reconstruction costs.

Other losses include costs associated with debris and silt removal from housing sites and loss of rental
income for owners of rental properly that was damaged or destroyed. Using 2014 National Population
and Housing Census figures, it is estimated that approximately 4 percent of all damaged housing was
generating rental income that owners will lose temporarily. This lost income was estimated at K 1.2
billion during the first year only, assuming landlords would be quick to rebuild.

The geographic distribution of damage. An estimate of the geographic distribution of damage
and losses is shown Table 31. Ayeyarwady, Rakhine, Bago, Sagaing, Mandalay, and Yangon were the
states and regions with the highest level of damage on an absolute basis.

The nature of the damage in each state is different, as are other factors that will affect the state’s
recovery and the recovery strategy for housing. Chin State’s recovery will be especially challenging.
Due to the mountainous topography and limited roadway network, construction costs in Chin State
are ordinarily around 30 percent higher than in other states, according to government figures. The
landslides blocked and destabilized roads. Although roads are being reopened, major reconstruction
projects will be required for full recovery of the road network. As shown in the transport sector chapter
of this PFLNA, Chin State represents more than 30 percent of all disaster effects in the transport
sector.

The time required to carry out transport sector reconstruction will likely result in even higher cost
increases for Chin State building materials. Furthermore, buildings in Chin State are often constructed
on steep hillsides with timber posts used to support the housing structure on the “downhill” side.
Whether this traditional building method needs to be modified to reduce risk and to give households
the confidence to rebuild, or whether retrofitting of this style of house is advisable, is a question that
will need to be answered during the house-to-house building assessment.

   Transitional sheltering offers a housing option that facilitates the transition from displacement to a durable housing solution,
and provides privacy and (ideally) proximity to the site where reconstruction will occur. It may or may not involve a physical
solution such as construction of a structure. Hosting (temporary residence of the displaced household with friends, family,
or others) and temporary rental are effective transitional approaches that can be supported with modest subsidies. Where
transitional sheltering entails provision of a structure, it should be safe, low cost, and easy to construct rapidly with local labor,
and to the extent possible should use local materials that can be reused in permanent construction. See Shelter Centre (2012).

                   RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION STRATEGY

                   No one left behind. Even though housing is a private good, the negative social and economic
                   impact of a large poorly housed population that cannot rebuild on its own is such that governments
                   often provide some form of housing assistance, at least for the most vulnerable segments of the
                   population. But even where many households will rebuild on their own without government financial
                   assistance, recovery presents an opportunity to improve the quality and safety of housing, as major
                   expenditures are made in the sector over the next two years. To take advantage of this opportunity, the
                   main players in housing recovery—the households—must be engaged immediately and encouraged
                   to build back better.

                   The overarching goal of housing recovery should be to improve and restore housing with a focus
                   on disaster risk reduction (building back better) for all. Building back better in recovery means that
                   housing is repaired and reconstructed in such a way that vulnerability to disaster risks is reduced to
                   acceptable levels.

                   Understandably, government’s current focus is on the most-affected population, including those
                   displaced by the landslides in Chin and those needing to be relocated due to the flooding in Sagaing.
                   Another high-priority group is those throughout the flood zone with fully destroyed housing.

                   The restoration of potable water and sanitation facilities is also an urgent need in order to save lives,
                   prevent the spread of diseases, reduce the burden of work for women and girls, and prevent an
                   increase in gender-based violence. Women have a strong incentive to acquire and maintain improved,
                   conveniently located water facilities, as they and their families benefit most when water quality and
                   quantity improves. Given their long-established and active role in water management, women should
                   play a key role in identifying long-term measures and solutions related to access to and use of water
                   sanitation services.

                   Yet households requiring relocation and with fully destroyed housing represent less than 10 percent
                   of all affected households. The housing recovery strategy must also focus on the other 90 percent of
                   households. Experience worldwide shows that in most cases governments can neither raise sufficient

houses following a large-scale disaster. Households generally raise the funds on their own and take
responsibility for construction and repairs. But government can effectively support the efforts of these
households with targeted subsidies and technical assistance, and can improve recovery outcomes
by defining a broad-based housing recovery strategy.


RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION PLAN

Housing sector recovery will be guided by the following principles:
	 •	 Government support to housing recovery should be cost-effective, built on local capacity, and
      capable of being replicated in future disasters.
	 •	 Owner-driven housing recovery should be utilized, in order to promote and enable building
      back better in housing and settlements.
	 •	 Government (union and state) shall provide financial and technical assistance.
	 •	 Government financial support shall be uniform for a given type of affected household (destroyed,
      damaged).
	 •	 Housing assistance shall be provided on a cost-sharing basis between the homeowner and
      government. Government will help mobilize the match funding for vulnerable households from
      private donors through a solidarity program.
	 •	 A coordination structure should be established at union and state/regional levels for housing
      recovery.
	 •	 Union and state/regional coordinating bodies will be assisted by a lead technical assistance
      provider and civil society organization (CSOs) on the ground. CSOs and households must
      receive training to participate in the program.
	 •	 The financial package shall be paid out on the basis of progress on construction that conforms
      to standard guidelines reflecting “build back better” principles.
	 •	 In urban areas, homeowners will have access to soft loans and be required to purchase
      homeowners insurance.

Outline of recovery framework for housing. The proposed approach to managing housing
recovery requires government (in collaboration with partners) to establish or strengthen communication,
coordination, planning, and quality control capacities aimed specifically at overseeing the large
number of households that will be repairing and reconstructing housing over the next two to three
years on their own. Such a system needs to be put in place relatively quickly.

Experience shows that after a period of about two years, most households will have recovered to a
point where they will neither seek nor take advantage of any support provided by the government.
Opportunities will still exist to assist households with retrofitting and to improve settlement, but the
bulk of the investment in housing recovery will have already taken place after two years, and the
chance to encourage risk reduction in recovery will be largely lost.

A proposed set of activities and associated costs that would allow implementation of a recovery
process oriented toward enabling homeowner self-recovery is given in Table 32. The activities are
divided into three time periods: Short term (and transitional) (2015), medium term (2016), and long
term (2016–2017). See Table 33 for cost assistance assumptions used to calculate the housing
recovery needs.

A critical early activity should be development of the Housing and Settlements Recovery Plan, which
will make explicit overall goals, define roles and responsibilities, establish financing requirements, and
make clear who is eligible for what forms of financial and technical assistance.

The proposed recovery approach includes two subsets of activities, as described briefly below. Each
of the proposed activities is described in Table 32.




                                                                                                                       97

                  	    •	 Housing and settlements recovery coordination. Recovery coordination includes activities
                          that would be carried out at the national, state, and regional levels to ensure the necessary
                          resources and the smooth implementation of the overall housing and settlements recovery
                          program. These activities include planning, monitoring, housing inspection, design and
                          dissemination of guidance on building back better for homeowners, fundraising, community
                          planning, and (in the longer timer) policy design.
                  	    •	 Housing and settlements recovery assistance. Recovery assistance includes activities
                          that would be carried out to provide direct support to homeowners, and to improve settlement
                          and housing sites, including (i) provision of technical support to homeowners through training,
                          on-site supervision, and establishment of information centers; (ii) provision of financial support
                          to homeowners; and (iii) settlement improvements for disaster risk reduction.

                  The cost of fully financing and implementing housing recovery in this manner is estimated to be K 632
                  billion. This figure includes K 6.4 billion for housing and settlements recovery coordination and K 626
                  billion for the cost of housing recovery, which includes K 11.9 billion for technical support to ensure
                  safe reconstruction, K 593 billion for financing, and K 20.8 billion in settlement-related risk reduction
                  investments, as shown in Table 32.

                  The housing recovery cost is based on estimates of household expenditures required to build back
                  better.73 It is not assumed that these costs would be fully subsidized by government. Households
                  generally contribute a significant amount to housing recovery, and government should structure the
                  support it provides to encourage (or require from those who can afford it) a significant household
                  contribution. However, government, donors, or NGOs would finance housing recovery coordination,
                  technical assistance to households, and settlement improvements.

                  For government support, priorities will likely have to be set among different groups and households,
                  with funding provided first to those considered the most deserving and vulnerable. Vulnerable
                  households are best identified at the township level by respected community members. Certain
                  households may belong to more vulnerable classes (such as female-headed households), but in
                  fact have support available for recovery (e.g., remittances) that others do not. Local knowledge is
                  therefore an important input for setting priorities if this is necessary.

                  The Housing and Settlements Recovery Plan that will need to be developed and the National Social
                  Protection Strategic Plan should also be used as a framework for setting priorities if funding is limited.




                  73
                    Base costs for housing recovery include: debris and silt removal; replacement of house contents; and repair and reconstruction
                  of house and household water and sanitation systems. A provision is also included for temporary sheltering arrangements.
                  Housing repair and reconstruction costs were based on validated estimates of replacement value per square foot by type of
                  housing and average house size by type. The resulting replacement costs were checked against reported sales values by
                  State/Region and housing type reported in the Integrated Household Living Conditions Survey in Myanmar (2009–2010). A
                  factor of just under 20% was added for improvement of housing and risk reduction, to ensure a “build back better” approach.

RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION IMPLEMENTATION

Principal responsibility in states and regions. Responsibility for town and housing development,
as well as for local plans, is assigned in Myanmar’s Constitution to the governments of the states and
regions. In the 2015 post-flood and -landslide recovery period, the main responsibility for housing
rehabilitation and reconstruction will rest with the state and regional governments, while in the Chin
State, notably Hakha, the capital, the Ministry of Environmental Conservation and Forestry has been
given the mandate to work in cooperation with the Chin State government to coordinate recovery.

State and regional governments, led by the General Administration Departments (the Secretariats of
each state/region) and supported by the townships, will plan, coordinate, and oversee implementation
of housing construction. The state and region recovery coordination centers will also play a key role.

For government- or other agency-built housing, the roles of states and regions will include coordinating
with agencies, issuing and managing construction contracts, and ensuring provision of basic services,
including electricity, water, sanitation, etc., as appropriate.

For homeowner-managed repair and reconstruction, states and regions will oversee the delivery of
training along with technical and financial assistance, supported by township engineers, township
administrators, local CSOs, and international NGOs. States and regions will also work with private
suppliers, if the local situation requires, to ensure that appropriate and adequate quantities of
construction materials are available for households, and they may subsidize transport or materials if
necessary.

Union ministries support for states and regions. Various ministries and government agencies,
particularly the Ministry of Construction, will provide targeted support to the states and regions with
housing sector construction and reconstruction. The Ministry of Construction, working through the
Recovery Coordination Committee (RCC) and its own departments, including the Department of
Planning and Department of Housing, is expected carry out a number of the functions listed under
“Housing and settlements recovery coordination” (Table 32) in support of states and regions.

Once the Housing and Settlements Recovery Plan is developed, and roles and responsibilities are
clearly defined, the RCC will develop a plan of activities and procedures, and design an operational
strategy that will allow assistance to be delivered to the field in a timely manner. It may also need

                                                                                                                                                   101
MYANMAR POST-DISASTER NEEDS ASSESSMENT
OF FLOODS AND LANDSLIDES JULY–SEPTEMBER 2015



                  to assist the most heavily affected states and regions to develop their own operational plans and
                  strategies. These arrangements should be in place within 60 to 90 days from finalization of the plan.

                  Protecting vulnerable individuals. Displacement causes a range of social and economic effects on
                  displaced families, including loss of income, loss of privacy, and exposure to a range of risks such as
                  communicable diseases, domestic violence, and gender-based harassment and violence, particularly
                  for young girls. The elderly, handicapped, and those less able to recover on their own or advocate for
                  their own interests typically suffer economically and slip into a state of increased vulnerability. Whether
                  special measures to assist these individuals are necessary depends on the cultural practices and level
                  of community solidarity. Where there is any doubt, committees should be established or designated
                  at the local level to follow and advocate for the most vulnerable of the displaced population to ensure
                  they are properly cared for and rehoused.

                  As discussed in the gender sector chapter of this report, households headed by females are
                  overrepresented the affected states and regions at 25 percent of all households. These households
                  have lower incomes and inferior-quality housing, suggesting that they may have sustained more
                  extensive damage than male-headed households. These households will need targeted support to
                  recovery their housing. The house-to-house assessment should investigate carefully the needs and
                  preferences for assistance of this subset of owners of damaged houses.

                  Key partners to government in carrying out the housing reconstruction strategy will include the private
                  sector, which is already contributing generous amounts of cash and in-kind support to the housing
                  recovery process; CSOs and religious institutions; and local and international NGOs.

                  With respect to international organizations, UN-Habitat has worked closely with the Ministry of
                  Construction in developing carpenter training, construction guidelines and standards, and the building
                  codes, all of which should be deployed in organizing the program. UN-Habitat, in collaboration with
                  the Myanmar Engineering Society, should support the Ministry of Construction to fully equip and
                  prepare the lead housing agency and establish the coordination body (the Key Stakeholders group
                  mentioned earlier).

                  Developing local CSO capacity to assist states, regions, and townships in overseeing owner-driven,
                  community-based housing recovery is an explicit objective of this approach. This CSO capacity, built
                  over time, will form the basis for a national capacity to promote better building practices and will
                  support similar housing construction efforts in future disasters.

                  Government should ensure that international NGOs, bilateral institutions, and other agencies that
                  wish to contribute to the recovery process align their efforts with the objectives and priorities of the
                  Housing and Settlements Recovery Plan. Much of this coordination will take place at the local level,
                  but it is also recommended the coordination body support the lead agency in mobilizing, directing,
                  and aligning these outside contributions.


                  SECTOR ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY

                  This assessment and proposal was developed following consultations with the Ministry of Construction;
                  General Administration Department; Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement; Ministry of
                  Livestock, Fisheries and Rural Development; Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation; and advisors to
                  government. Also consulted, among others, were the Shelter Cluster, the Early Recovery Working
                  Group, UNHCR, UN-Habitat, and UNICEF. Financial calculations are based on data collected by
                  the Central Statistical Organization and MSWRR from states and regions and other government
                  data; the 2014 Myanmar National Population and Housing Census; the Integrated Household Living
                  Conditions Survey in Myanmar (2009–2010); and research from various sources regarding housing
                  construction costs, including various assessments conducted following Cyclone Nargis. Other
                  information was gathered from interviews with key government officials and other local experts, and
                  review of publications related to the issues covered in this section.

                  Electricity
                  SUMMARY

                  Damages to the electricity sector, which occurred in six states/regions, are relatively
                  small compared with damages to other economic sectors. Total damages are estimated to
                  be K 6,282.3 million, and losses are estimated to be K 623.7 million. Damages and losses in the
                  distribution subsector were mainly caused by faults, collapsed poles in distribution lines, and power
                  cutoffs in the flooded areas. Damages in the transmission subsector were caused by the collapse
                  of electric towers and poles as a result of erosion of their foundations. In the generation subsector,
                  damages and losses were caused by damage to small and “mini” hydropower stations. According to
                  the Chin Committee for Emergency Relief and Rehabilitation, Chin State incurred damage to 15 mini-
                  hydropower stations, ranging in size from 5 to 30 kilowatts (kW) and having a total capacity of 150
                  kW. A further—and indirect—impact on the sector is the delay of the National Electrification Program,
                  since the resources that would have been used to connect villages to the electricity grid will now likely
                  be spent on recovery to housing and other more crucial assets.

                  The electricity sector acted very quickly to restore systems and reconnect consumers to the grid.
                  Many households were reconnected within the same day, and the longest service interruption was
                  one month. The damages were relatively small, and were distributed among three utilities: Electricity
                  Supply Enterprise (ESE), responsible for distribution in the impacted areas; Hydropower Generation
                  Enterprise (HPGE), responsible for generation; and Myanmar Electric Power Enterprise (MEPE),
                  responsible for transmission. Most of the recovery works for the short term—up to four months—have
                  been completed, and the sector has restored the damaged facilities to basic operating conditions.
                  The medium-term recovery—up to three years—will fully restore the damaged systems and facilities
                  and make them more resilient. Total funds required for the repair of damaged equipment and facilities
                  are estimated to be K 6,864.244 million. This includes about K 1,875 million for reconstructing the Line
                  Bon small hydropower station, which was totally washed away and which will need to be relocated.

                  The Myanmar Ministry of Electric Power (MOEP) has compiled a damage inventory and prepared a
                  recovery plan. We present below analyses of damage and losses in the electricity sector, along with
                  a recovery plan. From the total of K 6,864.244 million, about K 1,019.5 million will come from utilities’
                  own sources and will be used for the short-term recovery; the remaining of K 5,844.744 million will be
                  used for the medium- and long-term recovery. It is suggested that the funds for medium- and long-
                  term recovery can come from component 4 of the National Electrification Project, financed by IDA.
                  Since Myanmar is endowed with large hydropower potential, and due to the climate changes, dams,
                  particularly dame for hydropower station of small and medium scale, are more and more vulnerable
                  to the natural risks. Therefor it is strongly suggested to conduct a dam safety program, as mentioned
                  in the Recommendation for resilient and recovery and reconstruction part.


                  PRE-DISASTER CONTEXT

                  Despite fast growth in recent years, Myanmar’s electricity sector remains weak in
                  comparison with that of other Asian countries. It is characterized by low electricity consumption
                  per capita, a low rate of access to electricity, and a shortage of capacity during the dry season (due
                  to the high share of hydropower in the generation mix). Myanmar’s per capita electricity consumption
                  is among the lowest in the world. Its average annual consumption per capita of around 160 kilowatt-
                  hours (kWh) is 20 times lower than the world average. About 70 percent of the population, and 84
                  percent of rural households, lacked access to the electricity grid in 2014. The electricity access rate
                  by Myanmar state and region of Myanmar is given in Table 82 in Annex 3.

                                                                                                              infrastructure sector




Electricity consumption has grown rapidly in recent years—an average of 14 percent per year over
the past five years74—and peak load demand reached 2,100 megawatts (MW) in 2014. During the
period from 2010 to 2015, electricity sales grew about 17.6 percent per year, from 4,993 terawatt-
hours (TWh) in FY2010 to 11,255 TWh in FY2015. Energy balance for the last five years is given in
Table 83 in Annex 3.

As a share of total installed capacity (4,600 MW) on the grid, hydropower in Myanmar currently
accounts for around 67.3 percent (3,151 MW),75 natural gas generation accounts for 30.1 percent
(1,411 MW), and a small coal-fired power plant accounts for the remaining 2.6 percent (120 MW).
Small off-grid diesel and mini-hydropower units dispersed across the country have an estimated
total installed capacity of about 114 MW.76 Because the country relies heavily on extremely seasonal
hydropower with low firm capacity, the existing power generation system cannot meet the peak
demand during the dry season. Fuel-wise generation position of Myanmar as of 2015 is given in Table
84 in Annex 3.

In 2014, the country’s transmission system comprised 1,907.18 miles of 230 kilovolt (kV) transmission
lines, 1,350.35 miles of 132 kV transmission lines, and 1,866.49 miles of 66 kV transmission lines. The
power distribution network in Myanmar comprised about 15,500 miles of medium-voltage (33/11/6
kV) lines, 14,000 miles of low-voltage (0.4 kV) lines, and 30,308 distribution transformers with a
combined capacity of 7,452 mega-volt-amperes (MVA).

Accumulated delays in investments in power infrastructure, overreliance on seasonal hydropower,
and a rapid increase in electricity demand (which tripled over the last decade) have resulted in large
electricity shortages; these peaked at about 30 percent of power demand in 2012–2013. There has
been a significant recent increase in gas-fired power generation (about 400 MW was commissioned
in 2014), but load shedding and blackouts are common, and in general the reliability of the power
supply is low.

Myanmar’s electricity sector is under MOEP. The generation subsector comprises HPGE and
independent power producers. The transmission subsector is managed by MEPE, which also acts
as the single buyer. The distribution subsector is managed by three distribution companies: Yangon
Electricity Supply Corporation (YESC), Mandalay Electricity Supply Corporation (MESC), and ESE
(which covers the states/regions other than Yangon and Mandalay).

As the single buyer, MEPE buys energy from HPGE at the price of K 20/kWh, from independent
power producers at K 70/kWh, and from a Joint Venture Company (JV) at Y 0.189/kWh. MEPE sells
electricity to YESC at K 40/kWh and to ESE at K 37/kWh.  In their turn, ESE, YESC, and MESC sell
electricity to final users at a national uniform tariff. The tariff structure for end users effective from
April 2014 provides three tariff blocks for residential use, which range from K 35/kWh to K 50/kWh);
tariffs for industrial and large commercial use range from K 75/kWh to K 150/kWh. The details of the
tariff are given in Table 85 in Annex 3. During FY2013/2014, the selling tariff of YESC averaged K 57/
kWh, while total expenses averaged K 54/kWh, resulting in a net profit margin of 3.8 percent. During
FY2014, the selling tariff of ESE averaged K 49.8/kWh, while total expenses averaged K 49.4/kWh,
resulting in a net profit margin of 2 percent.




74
   Peak load demand is estimated at about 2,400 MW, but due to load shedding the realized peak is 2,100 MW.
75
   This figure includes joint venture hydropower projects that exported about 2 TWh to China in 2013–2014.

                    POST-DISASTER SITUATION

                    According to MOEP, floods and landslides caused damages to the electricity sector in
                    the four worst-damaged states and regions—Chin, Rakhine, Magway, and Sagaing—and
                    disrupted the power supply in Ayeyarwady and Bago. Heavy rains, landslides, and high water
                    caused damages to small hydropower stations; there were reports of landslides on dams’ slopes,
                    blocked waterways at hydropower stations, and washed-away earth dams, water canals, and weir
                    penstocks. Some transmission towers (both 230 kV and 66 kV) collapsed, and poles (both 11kV
                    and 0.4 kV) were broken. Some substations, including control rooms, were deeply submerged. High
                    water speed washed away roads and fences, and caused damages to the staff houses as well as the
                    engine buildings. A summary of the damage types and values, as well as estimates of the recovery
                    costs, is given for each state and region in Table 34.

ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE EFFECTS AND THE IMPACT OF THE
DISASTER ON THE SECTOR

Damages. MOEP reported that the recent flood damaged eight small hydropower stations owned
by ESE, with total capacity of 4 MW, all in Chin State. Some 230 kV and 66 kV transmission lines
were collapsed, concrete poles of distribution lines were broken, and transformers were damaged.
The Chin Committee for Emergency Relief and Rehabilitation reported damage to 15 private sector
mini-hydropower stations with capacity ranging from 5 kW to 30 kW. The value of these damaged
mini-hydropower stations was not clearly stated, so the assessment assumes that the value is equal
to the recovery value for a mini-hydropower station in Myanmar, which is US$3,000 per kW installed.
This assumption seems reasonable because in practice, all mini-stations of capacity less than 50 kW
will be totally washed away when such a disaster occurs. The most significant damage happened to
the Line Bon small hydropower station, with the installed capacity of 500 kW; it was totally washed
away and will not be repaired. The list of the damaged equipment and properties in four states and
regions is given in Table 35 below.

MYANMAR POST-DISASTER NEEDS ASSESSMENT
OF FLOODS AND LANDSLIDES JULY–SEPTEMBER 2015



                  Losses. Losses are defined as the changes in the economic flow arising from the disaster. In this
                  case the losses derive from both suppliers and customers of the electricity sector. Suppliers’ losses
                  are due to discontinuation of generation, reduction of sales, higher cost of production, or increase in
                  the system losses. Customers’ losses are calculated as losses of income from productive activities
                  due to interruption of the electricity or use of a higher-cost substitute. Losses for residential (i.e.,
                  nonproductive) customers are due to their use of higher-cost fuels for the domestic purposes (such
                  as lighting, cooking, or water pumping).

                  The most direct loss for suppliers is interruption of ESE’s eight small hydropower stations (total
                  installed capacity of 4.0 MW) and the 15 private sector mini-hydropower stations (150 kW), all in
                  Chin State. Five of ESE’s eight stations, with total capacity of 2.5 MW, have already been repaired and
                  are in operation; the other two are being repaired and will likely be operational by the end of 2016.
                  Restoration of the 15 mini-hydropower stations is expected to take one year. Total losses associated
                  with these power stations are estimated to be K 24.2 million. Line Bon Station totally washed away
                  and will not be restored. The total generation loss for all stations is estimated to be about 8,518
                  MWh. The calculation shows that if ESE buys the power from MEPE for K 52/kWh, then ESE may
                  lose about K 249.9 million.

                  The second type of loss is the reduction in sales. Given the larger number of impacted households
                  and public buildings, it is worth examining the loss of sales due to interruption of power supply to
                  these customers. Based on MOEP’s list of customers disconnected from the grid and the duration of
                  the disconnection (see Annex 3), the total reduced sales are estimated at 2.18 million kWh. All of the
                  damaged households are in ESE’s service area, and given that ESE’s FY2014 net profit margin was
                  K 0.4/kWh, the total losses due to reduction of sales to ESE are calculated to be K 0.871 million—in
                  other words, marginal.

                  Transmission and distribution damages are small, about K 1,716 million, and confined to some
                  collapsed transmission towers and distribution poles, distribution lines, and transformers. Most of
                  them were quickly repaired after the disaster, so the losses due to higher production costs and higher
                  system losses are minimal, and for the sake of simplicity will not be calculated in this assessment.
                  	
                  Because the number of houses disconnected was huge, the assessment does look at losses to
                  residential consumers. Data limitations allow estimating only those losses due to using candles for
                  lighting. This estimation is based on information about how many customers were disconnected and
                  for how long, and it makes the following assumptions: (i) each connected household uses 15 kWh/
                  month for lighting at the tariff of K 35/kWh, so one household would spend K 525 a month for lighting
                  by electricity, and (ii) a household disconnected from grid would use candles for lighting at an average
                  monthly cost of K 13,400 per household. This means one connected household would lose about
                  K 12,875 per month. This is a conservative estimate as other types of losses might have occurred,
                  such lost income of the productive users, or possible elevated system losses, which are not included
                  in this analysis. Thus consumers’ losses are estimated to be about K 348.9 million. Total losses are
                  estimated to be K 612.326 million, as shown in Table 36.

RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION STRATEGY

As the scope of works is relatively small for each utility, an implementation strategy does need not
be developed. For the private sector, we recommend that the local banks provide the owners of
the damaged mini-hydropower units access to borrowings. We also note here that the electricity
sector started the inventory and recovery works immediately after the disaster, thanks in part to the
experiences gained from Cyclone Nargis in May 2008. To prepare for future events, it is suggested
to focus on building resilience through measures indicated under long-term actions. For the private
sector, the most serious constraint in recovery and reconstruction are the needed financial resources.

OF FLOODS AND LANDSLIDES JULY–SEPTEMBER 2015



                  RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION PLAN

                  Total funds required for recovering damaged equipment and facilities are estimated at K 6,864.244
                  million. This includes replacement cost of the Line Bon small hydropower station, estimated at K
                  1,875 million. The recovery costs for ESE, MEPE, HPE, and the private sector are given in Table 38.
                  Most of the short-term works (taking up to four months) have been finished. Almost all electricity
                  facilities and equipment will be repaired and put back in operation in the medium term (within one year
                  after the disaster). The works will be continued beyond one year to make the system more resilient.
                  As for the private sector, the damaged facilities are of very small capacity and can be reconstructed
                  quickly, assuming the owners have the financial capacity themselves or they can borrow from local
                  banks.

                  Short term
                    •	 Restore the distribution networks as fast as possible to enable customers to resume their
                        business and to provide energy for residential uses. Timely restoration helps reduce losses for
                        both utilities and customers.
                    •	 Inspect the submerged distribution systems, lines, and substations to determine any safety
                        issues, and fix them.
                    •	 Replace the submerged meters, and place the new ones in a safe place, above the level of the
                        recent flood.
                    •	 Ensure that effective cooking stoves and lighting solutions are provided in the relief package.
                    •	 Provide solar lighting solutions in shelters, schools, and WASH (water, sanitation, and hygiene)
                        facilities to help reduce security-related risks.

                  Medium term
                    •	 Ensure all the impacted customers are reconnected, and check all impacted in-house
                       connection and in-house wiring.
                    •	 Ensure all the affected facilities are completely restored with better disaster resilience capacity.
                    •	 Develop a guideline/manual for the electricity sector that (i) accounts for risks from geophysical,
                       metrological, hydrological, and climatological hazards to different types of generation,
                       transmission lines, substations, and ancillary equipment; (ii) includes countermeasures for
                       each type of disaster for each subsector; and (iii) includes a plan and resources for recovery.
                    •	 Conduct a dam safety program.
                    •	 For residential uses, promote the use of one-phase transformers, which could be placed on
                       the top of the poles to minimize the possibility of submerging.
                    •	 Strengthen women’s participation in the village electricity committees. This will ensure that
                       women have access to information, will involve them in making decisions, and allow them to
                       monitor the implementation of recovery plans at the village level. Consult with women’s groups
                       for restoration of energy services.
                    •	 Coordinate with international and domestic NGOs in the areas to support village renewable
                       energy programs for affordable solar energy and clean stoves.

                  Long term
                    •	 Relocate the existing substations to, and construct new substation in, places where ground
                        level is higher than the design flood level.
                     •	 Develop electric systems, including all type of generations, transmission lines, substations,
                        and ancillary equipment, with specifications of higher standard for disaster resilience.

RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION IMPLEMENTATION

Implementation arrangements: Recovery and reconstruction of the damages will be implemented by
three entities of the electricity sector, namely the ESE, HPGE, and MEPE. Based on the nature of the
damages and the speed of reconnection of the customers, it seems that these three entities have the
technical and institutional capacity to recover the damages. Financial capacity of these entities may
cause delays in the reconstruction process.

Gender considerations. Without access to electricity, the majority of vulnerable households
especially women-headed households are still dependent on solid fuels for cooking, and on diesel,
candle and kerosene for heating and lighting. The health of women and girls, who are responsible
for food preparation, suffers when households without electricity rely on firewood and traditional
stoves for cooking. Floods have imposed a heavy burden on women and girls who have less time for

                                                                                                                       111

                  productive activities such as employment, study, and participation in village management because
                  they are responsible for collecting needed firewood and for recharging home solar batteries (which
                  some rural communities have begun to make use of). Woman and girls in camps and shelters may also
                  be at increased risk of gender-based violence if limited electricity results in poor lighting. Affordable
                  renewable energy would not only provide a more sustainable source of fuel and help preserve the
                  environment, it would benefit women and girls by guarding against gender-based violence and allowing
                  women and girls to spend more time on productive activities. But renewable energy sources can be
                  introduced only through village development committees—from which women are often excluded.


                  SECTOR ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY

                  Assessment of the damages is based on the actual inventory of damages. The losses are estimated
                  based on actual data, along with certain assumptions.

                  Water and Sanitation
                  SUMMARY

                  The disaster affected 12 of the 14 states and regions and impacted water, sanitation, and
                  hygiene (WASH) infrastructure, both public and private households. WASH infrastructure in
                  education and health facilities were also affected. Total disaster effects, including both damages and
                  changes in economic flows, have been estimated at K 58,268 million. The total damage to public
                  water supply infrastructure was K 15,742 million, and damage to vulnerable household sanitation was
                  estimated at K 35,976 million. Damage to WASH in education facilities was estimated at approximately
                  K 6,000 million, and damage to WASH in health facilities was estimated at approximately K 550
                  million.

                  For the public water infrastructure, the total needs for recovery and reconstruction incorporating
                  the principles of “build back better” (BBB) and disaster risk management (DRM) are estimated at
                  only K 25,653 million. Although there was considerable loss to public infrastructure, there was more
                  damage to private household water and sanitation infrastructure, and the analysis shows that access
                  to safe water supply and sanitation has been reduced. In order to respond appropriately, the recovery
                  and reconstruction plan will consider the following: improved coordination; information management
                  and enterprise resource planning systems; robust finance mechanisms; best practices in the
                  planning, delivery, and maintenance of infrastructure and services; additional government operational
                  resources; opportunities for South-South learning on subsector implementation and approaches;
                  gender sensitivity and social equitability of service delivery (i.e., a human rights-based approach to
                  ensure all are served).

                  The WASH sector has recently been restructured and is also in urgent need of comprehensive
                  policies, standards, and regulations. Although recovery activities should be undertaken as soon as
                  practical, this program of work will need to be undertaken over a number of years. The government
                  will need to prioritize acute measures in order to meet interim recovery needs while also developing
                  long-term policies, standards and regulations.


                  PRE-DISASTER CONTEXT

                  Myanmar is administratively divided into seven states, seven regions, and the union territory of Nay
                  Pyi Taw. States and regions are constitutionally equal and are composed of districts, which in turn are
                  composed of townships. Townships comprise urban wards and village tracts (clusters of villages) and
                  play an increasingly important role in public administration, including the coordination and delivery of
                  basic services such as water supply, sanitation, and hygiene promotion.

                  There are many stakeholders involved in the delivery of rural and urban water, sanitation, and solid
                  waste management services in Myanmar. The Township Municipal Committee under the District
                  Municipal Authority (DMA) has a wide range of tasks, duties, powers, and authorities. It oversees
                  and carries out a range of urban infrastructure projects (planning, water, sanitation, drainage, solid
                  waste management, power supply, roads and bridges, etc.). The Department of Rural Development
                  (DRD) under the Ministry of Livestock, Fisheries and Rural Development is the union-level department
                  responsible for rural water supply. The department was newly structured as part of the government of
                  Myanmar’s decentralization reform. In the short term, staffing remains a concern for newly established
                  DRD offices in townships, where a large number of vacancies exist.77 The Department of Public
                  Health (DPH) under the Ministry of Health is responsible for sanitation and hygiene promotion in both
                  rural and urban areas, although in urban areas the extent of efforts is unclear. Staffing within the DPH
                  is generally increasing in all states and regions. The Department of Basic Education (DBE) and the
                  DPH are responsible for WASH at education facilities and health facilities respectively. The Relief and

Resettlement Department (RRD) under the Ministry of Social Welfare is also relevant to the WASH
sector, and although it does not provide direct services, it oversees emergency and humanitarian
response activities and NGO coordination.

Baseline development indicators. According to the Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) of UNICEF/
WHO, Myanmar has met the Millennium Development Goal targets for both water supply and
sanitation (see Figure 33). The launch of the United Nation Global Goals for Sustainable Development
in September 2015 has introduced new targets, notably Goal 6, which is to “ensure availability and
sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.” The focus shifts from ensuring basic access
to providing increasing levels of service through climbing the drinking water and sanitation ladders.
Currently there is little information on the functionality of water or sanitation systems throughout
the country. Discussions with government counterparts suggested, however, that functionality of
systems was low, and that continuity of supply was an issue during the dry season for some shallow
well aquifers in the dry zone and some surface water ponds in Rakhine.

Diarrhea and dysentery are among the six leading causes of mortality and morbidity in Myanmar.78 The
diarrhea morbidity rate in 2011 was 668 per 100,000 population, with mortality of 0.51 per 100,000
population (total deaths 244). In most villages and townships visited during the WASH sector review
in 2014, diarrhea was listed as the top one or two causes of morbidity, after acute respiratory infection
or snake bite.79 The Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey found that overall, 6.7 percent of children under
five had diarrhea in the two weeks preceding the survey, with the highest prevalence—13.1 percent—
in Chin State.

                   Myanmar currently has no national policy specific to water supply or sanitation. However, the country
                   does have an overarching National Water Policy approved by the Cabinet and the National Water
                   Resources Committee (NWRC) chaired by Vice President. In addition there have been a number of
                   recent initiatives in the WASH sector at the policy level. For example, water was included among
                   the high-priority subjects to be addressed by the Framework for Economic and Social Reform and
                   National Comprehensive Development Plan80 and a national rural WASH strategy and investment
                   plan is now being developed for completion in March 2016. The Myanmar National Water Framework
                   Directive has been drafted with public consultations held between 2014 and 2015 to pave the way
                   for the National Water Law, which is being drafted by the Advisory Group of NWRC with the support
                   of the World Bank and the IFC.

                   Chronic underinvestment in urban and rural infrastructure for water storage, supply, sanitation,
                   drainage, wastewater, pollution control, and solid waste management has resulted in seriously
                   deficient services throughout Myanmar. This problem has been identified by a number of recent
                   reports, including Myanmar: Urban Development and Water Sector Assessment, Strategy and
                   Road Map,81 Myanmar Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Sector Situation Analysis Final Report,82
                   and the Myanmar Integrated Water Resources Management Strategy. The Ayeyarwady Integrated
                   River Basin Development Project will identify the immediate-, medium-, and long-term investment
                   opportunities. The national rural WASH strategy and investment plan will aim to identify what capital
                   and recurrent investment is required to meet development targets.


                   POST-DISASTER SITUATION

                   Infrastructure and assets. The cyclone, flood, and landslide disaster has had a range of impacts
                   across the 12 affected states and regions. A number of factors, such as different types of infrastructure
                   found in the states and regions and the preexisting levels of access (shown in Table 39), account for
                   the differing impacts. Ayeyarwady and Rakhine mainly rely on surface water ponds, Chin State uses
                   gravity piped water systems, and the drier regions (Magway, Mandalay, Sagaing, and Bago) have
                   a higher percentage of tube wells. Other differences include the various topographic and geologic
                   catchment characteristics, and the duration and intensity of rainfall.

                   Gravity piped water supplies in Chin State experienced localized destruction from substantial
                   landslides. In Rakhine and Ayeyarwady, open surface water collection ponds were contaminated by
                   turbid and pathogen-loaded flood waters. In Rakhine State, storm surges caused saline inundation.
                   The remaining states and regions saw a range of impacts depending on the flood severity. In some
                   high-flow areas, headworks of tube wells were completely destroyed, and unprotected wells were
                   inundated and filled with sediment and debris. Other locations saw steadier floodwater rise and less

physical damage, although poorly sealed tube wells, some protected wells, many unprotected wells,
and both protected and unprotected ponds suffered inundation, resulting in both contamination and
sedimentation.

Over 500,000 sanitation facilities were severely affected across the states and regions. Most facilities
in rural areas are fly-proof latrines, which are simple raised timber or bamboo huts that have a plastic
squat-toilet pan with a straight offset pipe draining into a subsurface soak pit. The pit is usually
unlined, making it particularly susceptible to damage during flooding. These latrines are extremely
vulnerable to flooding, which not only causes physical damage to the asset but also releases fecal
sludge into floodwaters.  

Effects on production/delivery of goods and services and access to services. The emergency
response saw DRD and DPH mobilize quickly and carry out additional operational works, such as
dewatering ponds, cleaning and sanitizing wells, and distributing chlorination tablets. These additional
activities required an increase in operational expenditure and also caused a few projects to be put
on hold. The Township Municipal Committee collects revenue in urban areas through licensing from
buildings, street vendors, and slaughterhouses, and from taxes on (for example) water supply, waste
and sanitation, and public sanitation tax. In Magway Region, total revenue per capita was estimated
in 2015–2016 to be K 12,000 (US$12).83 Discussions with the General Administration Department
(GAD) at the union level suggested that reduced revenue would be insignificant. It was not possible to
collect all the information on lost revenue within the time frame of the assessment, and the government
chose to focus on rural WASH.

Effects on government’s functions and systems. Although the disaster did not have a significant
direct impact on government offices and equipment, it did substantially impact government resources.
Staff had to leave their daily operations and focus fully on humanitarian response and relief. Both DRD
and DPH have invested significant time in coordination meetings with local civil society organizations
and the international community to help minimize overlaps and ensure common response activities.
This activity is expected to taper off and then end around the start of November 2015.

Increased risks and vulnerabilities. Traditionally, women are the main users, and managers of
water in households, as well as the guardians of household hygiene. Thus they are the most affected
when water systems break down. Compared with urban communities, rural communities are less
likely to have convenient access to water supply, so that men and women may spend several hours
per day collecting water on foot or with a bullock cart. Water collection comes at the expense of
productive activities and contributes to poverty. Poor rural women are least likely to have a convenient
toilet facility to use. Note that while women are primarily the water collectors (67 percent), men are
nearly universally responsible for latrine maintenance (92 percent).84

The combination of flood-affected latrines and increase in open defecation aggravates the risk of
diarrheal diseases. Given the destruction of so many sanitation facilities across the 12 affected states
and regions, the number of people using the few remaining sanitation facilities has risen. So has
the number of those without access to facilities. Inadequate access to safe, hygienic, and private
sanitation facilities is a source of shame, physical discomfort, and insecurity for women and girls,
particularly those menstruating, pregnant, or lactating. Defunct sanitation systems mean that women
and girls have to walk further distances for ablution privacy, thereby putting themselves at increased
risk of sexual and gender-based violence. The use of untreated water for cooking and drinking has
also increased, and given the poor sanitation conditions, this practice has the potential to increase
the spread of vector-borne diseases and further increase the burden of work for women, who are the
primary family caregivers.85

                   The restoration of potable water and sanitation facilities is urgently needed to save lives, prevent
                   the spread of diseases, reduce the burden of work for communities, and lower the risk of gender-
                   based violence. Women have a strong incentive to acquire and maintain improved, conveniently
                   located water facilities, as they and their families benefit most when water quality and quantity
                   improves. Given their long-established and active role in water management, women should play a
                   key role in identifying long-term measures and solutions related to access and use of water sanitation
                   services. Women currently are strongly represented on local water committees, and support for this
                   participation should continue alongside training for women in maintenance and operation of water
                   and sanitation infrastructure.

                   Pond rehabilitation practices carried out in the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis involved initial pumping out
                   ponds to remove saline water and other contamination. This practice was used following the current
                   disaster but may have resulted in the pumping of water ponds that were not saline or contaminated.
                   With little time left in the wet season to refill ponds, there may be significant delayed effects in February
                   or March due to El Niño–exacerbated drought conditions. Rakhine State has a high percentage of
                   affected ponds and will be particularly vulnerable to these effects.



                   ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE EFFECTS AND THE IMPACT OF THE
                   DISASTER ON THE SECTOR

                   Summary of damages and losses. The assessment separates damage to public community water
                   systems, such as tube wells, protected wells, and ponds, from damage to private latrines and
                   household hand-dug wells. The higher number of sanitation facility damaged is partly due to their
                   higher prevalence (when compared to water sourced as listed above) but also to their increased
                   vulnerability. There was also damage to WASH facilities at over 4,000 education facilities, including
                   severe damage at 213. WASH facilities at 24 medical facilities were also severely damaged (see
                   report chapters on education and health). The total public damages and losses are estimated at K
                   14,805 million, and K 937 million respective, totaling K 15,742 million (Table 40).

                   There was significant damage in the Ayeyarwady Region, due predominantly to the large population
                   (see Figure 34) and the vulnerability of communities living on the floodplain delta. Rakhine was
                   also hard hit; given its low baseline of water and sanitation coverage, it accounts for a significant
                   percentage of damage and reduction in access to water and sanitation services. The geographic
                   breakdown of damages and losses is included in Table 41.

Impact on sector development goals. Estimates based on the GAD damage assessments show
a significant decrease in access to improved water and sanitation in a number of states and regions
(Table 42). It is important to understand the context of the percentage decrease in pre and post-
access levels to water and sanitation infrastructure. For example, even though Rakhine registered only
8 percent reduction in access to safe sanitation, the low pre-disaster access level (34 percent) means
this state is potentially more vulnerable than another region, such as Bago region, which saw a higher
damage but within a relatively high levels of access post flood. At the same time, Ayeyarwady shows
similar damage percentage to Bago but higher actual sanitation facility damage. Overall, Rakhine
suffered significantly with low baseline access before the disaster, and its internally displaced persons
(IDPs) are the most vulnerable segment of the population. Temporary water supply, sanitation and
hygiene facilities within IDP camps have been significantly damaged by cyclonic winds, increasing
vulnerability and exposing the population to further risks.

                     RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION STRATEGY

                     The current WASH sector is relatively new; DRD was formed in late 2013, and DPH and DBE were
                     formed in 2015 after considerable restructuring of their respected ministries. Currently, the roles,
                     responsibilities, and accountabilities in the WASH sector are poorly understood. There is evidence of
                     duplication of activities in some areas, and gaps in others. This need for improved coordination,
                     which existed before the disaster, can be addressed by using recovery and reconstruction efforts as
                     a catalyst to change. RRD is the focal lead for emergencies, although in practice there has yet to be
                     coordination between the ministries. We advise that the current WASH sector reform being undertaken
                     by the government consider emergency response alongside broader reform objectives. RRD’s lead
                     role in emergency response should be reinforced and appropriate mechanisms established so that

RRD can operationalize its new responsibilities under the disaster management law (in effect as of
July 2015).

In an emergency, the quality and availability of information are very important for decision making and
coordinated response. Existing information management and enterprise resource planning
systems need to be modernized so they can collect, manage, and analyze WASH sector data.
There are many reliable software packages available that can provide this functionality in one unified
system. Improving information management will not only increase institutional capacity for emergency
response and recovery but will also support the planning, delivery, and evaluation of the WASH
program.

A key observation during the disaster response concerns the inadequacy of the financial system to
quickly disperse funds. Although emergency funds were available to be released for emergency relief,
the current system could not get the funds to the state and township level for a number of weeks or
(in the case of DPH) even months. A robust finance mechanism that allows for prepositioning of
funds and rapid reallocation should be investigated.

It is clear that best practices in the planning, delivery, and maintenance of infrastructure
and services have not been identified and taken to scale. This failure will impact on recovery
and rehabilitation response; existing systems are struggling to manage the required work inflow.
Preexisting human resource constraints impede management of current development programs
within the government. These constraints mean that recovery and rehabilitation programs will require
additional government operational resources to ensure that normal development objectives are
not significantly affected.  

The region also provides many opportunities for South-South learning on subsector
implementation and approaches. A range of learning methods is available, including benchmarking
with other countries in the region, study tours, workshops, and twinning arrangements.

Finally, this recommended recovery and reconstruction strategy should be reviewed and
evaluated against the current work being done on the national rural WASH strategy and investment
plan. Consideration should also be given to how this crisis can feed into the long-term development
of comprehensive polices, standards, regulations, and governance.


RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION PLAN

The recovery and reconstruction needs presented here are for the public water supply systems only.
The needs for sanitation have been included in the housing sector. However, this plan allows for the
review of sanitation programming and for scaling up implementation in line with the housing recovery.
WASH needs for education and health have been included in their respective sections. Coordination
and long-term WASH sector development that incorporates WASH in institutions and sanitation
programming have been included in Table 43.

Short term. Immediate humanitarian relief activities were carried out swiftly by government
departments from July to October. These activities ensured dignified access to safe and appropriate
WASH services to the most-affected communities. The government and partners have cleaned and
chlorinated some 137,188 water sources and distributed 19,700 latrine pans to the most affected.86
There has been limited increase in diarrheal disease. These activities are now coming to a close and
the focus is moving to medium-term activities.

                   Medium and long term. The WASH sector in Myanmar has recently undergone major changes,
                   including the recent creation of DRD and DPH. The sector is undertaking a rural WASH strategy
                   and investment planning process (October–March 2016) that aims to address many of the needs
                   identified above. The sector is beginning to plan for mid-term recovery and rehabilitation activities, but
                   there is currently a limited budget for the mid-term recovery and rehabilitation activities identified.
                   This funding gap has resulted in planning priorities shifting back to normal annual work plans which
                   already have allocated budgets.

RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION IMPLEMENTATION

The implications of budget constraints on recovery efforts should be further evaluated. One possibility
is to reallocate some of the yearly budget to the worst-hit townships, re-prioritizing the annual plans.
How the budget would be reallocated and prioritized is unclear, however, given the absence of clear
policies in place historically. The WASH sector will need to address this issue in order to ensure that
the president’s directive—“no one left behind”—is realized.

Moving forward, two options for planning and governance are possible. One option would be for
RRD to lead the WASH sector recovery and rehabilitation, although in this role it would need to
increase its financial capacity and boost its human resources and convening power. The second
option would involve forming a committee that included the WASH sector partners—representatives
from RRD, DPH, DBE, DRD and potentially DMA. The committee would be responsible for recovery
and rehabilitation and provide high-level oversight. The government will need to decide on the
appropriate mechanism for sector leadership. The Government and the development partners will
need to take into account the need to gradually mainstream recovery activities into ongoing reforms
and development work. In line with this, too many separate structures are not advisable especially
where there is no clear cut demarcation between recovery and development.

There also needs to be a decision about who will provide the technical oversight for implementation
across the WASH sector. Currently DRD is responsible for water supply infrastructure, DPH is
responsible for sanitation and hygiene and for WASH facilities in health institutions, and DBE is
responsible for WASH facilities in education institutions. We recommend adopting a standard
approach to implementation across the sectors. Risk reduction should be pursued through “building
back better” and following disaster/climate resilience principles, which includes undertaking risk
assessments, using resilient infrastructure, and mainstreaming disaster risk reduction in WASH
policies and plans. Roles, responsibilities, and leadership related to technical oversight across the
sector partners will need to be clarified. Clarification is also needed to determine who will provide the
monitoring and evaluation of recovery and relief efforts.

The newly structured WASH sector is in urgent need of comprehensive policies, standards, and
regulations. These recovery activities should be undertaken as soon as practical, although this
program of work will need to be undertaken over a number of years. The government will need to
prioritize acute measures in order to meet interim recovery needs while also developing long-term
policies.


SECTOR ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY

To ensure compliance with the assessment methodology, including recognition of sectoral boundaries
as defined in the national accounts, the summary tables of WASH damage and losses refer only to
water supply infrastructure. WASH damages and losses in housing units are referred to in the housing
sector chapter; WASH damages and losses in education facilities are referred to in the education
sector chapter; and WASH damages and losses in health facilities are referred to in the health sector
chapter.

Assessment data were received from multiple sources, including GAD, DRD, DPH, UNICEF, DBE,
Department of Population, and UN Women. These data were used to extrapolate damage to assets
listed in the census, based on household distribution ratios agreed on in consultation with DRD and
DPH. An agreed unit cost was then applied to each unit in proportion to its damage (for destroyed,
100 percent of unit cost; for damaged, 30 percent of unit cost; and for flooded, 10 percent of
unit cost). Losses reflect actual reported additional operational expenditures. Needs reflect actual
damages and loses and include allowance for building back better and more resilient materials and
technology. Needs also include the soft program inputs that promote best practices in disaster risk
reduction.

Transport
SUMMARY

Transport infrastructure throughout Myanmar suffered extensive physical damage as a result of the
July 2015 flooding and landslides. Total damage and losses in the transport sector constitute 3
percent of the effects suffered across all sectors. The majority of damage occurred in the west of
the country, particularly Chin, Sagaing, Rakhine, Bago, and Magway States. Immediate effects in
the transport sector included the following: (i) severance of road and rail transportation links, (ii)
disruption of market access, particularly between the south and north of the country, and (iii) loss of
access in urban and especially rural communities to social facilities such as health and education.
The most common damages were flooded pavement, failure or blockage of road formations due
to landslides, damage to railway embankments, and destruction of bridge and culvert structures,
including approaches. Losses in the sector resulted from increased travel distance required due
to loss of highway connections, as well as lost passenger revenue on the rail network. With the
exception of damage to a small number of private boats, no damage and losses were reported
in the maritime and aviation subsectors. Reconstruction efforts will involve completing temporary
repairs to damaged infrastructure over the short term. Permanent repairs will be completed over
the medium term, with long-term recovery involving a program of upgrading key routes to improve
resilience, particularly in Chin state. Where possible, works will be informed by more resilient design
and construction standards.


PRE-DISASTER CONTEXT

Given the current poor state of access and mobility in Myanmar, the transport sector is of critical
importance to the country’s economic and social development. Currently, 40 percent of Myanmar’s
population (some 20 million people) live in villages without access to the most basic of transport links:
an all-season road. This isolation means limited access to markets and employment opportunities.
Without transportation links, agricultural productivity remains low, while access to health and
education services is limited. Poor access also has effects on traders and market sellers (both men
and women).

The passenger and freight volumes carried by road, railway, river, and air are provided in Table 44.
The vast majority of freight and passengers are carried by road. Railway, river, and air carry far fewer
people, but they still play an important part in Myanmar’s multimodal network (Table 44).

                  Myanmar’s public road network comprises 157,059 km across 14 states, with 34,724 km (22
                  percent) paved. Road access is highest in Yangon, Mandalay, and Magway, where a mere 3 percent
                  of rural residents are without access, while in Rakhine and Kayin, 59 percent of rural residents are not
                  connected. The network includes 39,702 km of highways, expressways, state roads, and regional
                  roads administered by the Ministry of Construction (MOC). A further 18,499 km of urban roads are
                  managed by city and township development committees, while 83,665 km of rural roads fall under
                  the responsibility of the Department of Rural Development (DRD) under the Ministry of Livestock,
                  Fisheries and Rural Development and the Ministry of Border Affairs (MBA). Myanmar is also rapidly
                  motorizing; it had 4.9 million road vehicles in 2014, compared to 1 million in 2004.

                  The rail network in Myanmar consists of 5,934 km of track, with 83 km of the network in urban areas.
                  Operated by Myanmar Railways (MR) under the Ministry of Rail Transportation (MORT), the most
                  trafficked lines are Yangon-Mandalay and Mandalay-Myitkyina, which together carry 20 percent of the
                  passenger traffic. Rolling stock consists of 231 operational locomotives, 1,349 passenger coaches,
                  and 3,377 freight wagons.

                  River transport is a vital link for the communities adjacent to the Ayeyarwady River, which flows from
                  the north of Myanmar to the Andaman Sea in the south. Inland Waterway Transport owns 413 ships,
                  including 255 powered vessels, 148 nonpowered vessels, and 39 stationed pontoons.

                  Air transportation also plays an important role in Myanmar, especially in providing access to remote
                  communities not well served by other modes. There are international airports in Yangon, Nay Pyi Taw,
                  and Mandalay, as well as 30 domestic airports throughout the country. Nine airlines using a combined
                  fleet of 42 aircraft provide service for passengers and meet a small air-freight demand.


                  POST-DISASTER SITUATION

                  Myanmar’s transport infrastructure was extensively damaged by the flooding and landslides.
                  Access to essential services in large towns and state capitals was cut off as a result of the flooding and
                  landslides, with destroyed bridges blocking access to even the most basic mode of transport—foot
                  traffic. Some highways were closed for more than 50 days, and the accessibility that was restored
                  remains very vulnerable to future heavy rain or earthquakes. The lack of access on the rural road
                  network also restricts the delivery of emergency supplies, and will continue to hamper recovery efforts
                  for the most-affected communities. While all main road and rail links are now operational, disruptions
                  to rail and road transport will likely continue because of network limitations, such as weight limits on
                  damaged bridges and poor surface condition of roads. These disruptions will remain until short-term
                  recovery works can be completed, ideally prior to the start of the next monsoon season in May 2016.

                  Increased risk and vulnerability. Road and rail infrastructure will remain vulnerable to further damage
                  and total failure until permanent repair works can be completed. The Chin State road links of Hakha-
                  Gangaw and Kalay-Hakha (Figure 35) as well as Kalewa-Monywa and Kawlin–Kyunhla in Sagaing all
                  remain particularly vulnerable. While there is no immediate threat from the monsoon rainfalls, further
                  storms could re-sever links on the vulnerable road and rail network. Saturated soils in hilly areas are
                  also vulnerable to earthquake-induced slope failures, so seismic risks to transport infrastructure are
                  elevated until permanent repairs can be made. The development and implementation of revised
                  design and construction standards as part of the recovery plan will address some of these risks.

ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE EFFECTS AND THE IMPACT OF
THE DISASTER ON THE SECTOR

Table 45 summarizes the cost of damages to transport infrastructure by subsector, as well as the
value of losses incurred by flooding and landslides (as of October 5, 2015). Table 46  provides the
distribution of damage and losses by state. Chin is the most affected state, with K 27.5 billion of total
effects.

Damages to the transport sector. Damage to roads resulted from inundated pavements
and washouts of bridges and culverts, including approaches. Thirty-two key highway links were
temporarily severed in seven states, though all highway connections had been repaired (with
commendable speed) by late September. Most damage occurred in the western state of Chin, where
numerous landslides destroyed the formation of roads passing through this states’ hilly terrain (Figure
35). Railway line embankments were also severely eroded by floodwaters (Figure 36). Bridge piers,
abutments, approaches, and superstructures were destroyed by high water levels on floodplains
(Figure 37). Delayed effects of this inundation will likely include the premature failure of saturated road
pavements. Table 45 and Table 46 capture transport infrastructure managed by MOC and DRD and
include estimates for MBA. Replacement costs assume force account is used for the replacement
works by MOC, with contracting out by DRD, MR, and MBA.87 The damages determined are very
low by international standards, in part because of the low unit rates inherent in Myanmar, and in part
because of the low standards of construction. Construction standards will be improved as part of the
proposed reconstruction strategy.

  The damage to the rural road network managed by MBA was estimated by taking the ratio of damaged roads to total
network for DRD roads and applying it to MBA’s assumed network for the border states in which it operates.

                   Losses to the transport sector. The losses in the transport sector are also summarized in Table 45
                   and Table 46. Using the best available information, the loss assessment was limited to the higher user
                   costs associated with detours and poor condition of roads, as well as the lost profit on the affected
                   Myanmar Railway lines. Losses for roads were calculated by considering the additional vehicle
                   operating costs across 16 key highway links assuming these costs were borne by private vehicle
                   operators. Calculations included costs resulting from the extra distance required to follow detours
                   during initial closure, as well as marginal costs due rougher road condition on the original route after
                   temporary (and prior to permanent) repair. Rail losses were estimated from the lost passenger profit

losses were minor compared with those in the road sector, being equivalent to approximately 1
percent of road losses.

RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION STRATEGY

The government’s recovery priority for the transport sector is to complete repairs on
highway roads and bridges and to restore rural accessibility through repair of roads and
bridges. The disaster has worsened the normally poor accessibility in rural areas and has resulted
in even longer travel times for vulnerable rural populations. Restoration of connectivity to essential
services (such as hospitals, schools, and markets) and to the main commercial centers will benefit
the entire population but particularly those in isolated rural communities.

Impact on sector development objectives. According to the National Transport Development
Plan, the strategic goal of Myanmar’s transport sector is to create a sustainable, economical, and
efficient sector that ensures the easy flow of goods and services while attracting new commerce and
industry. Although the effects of the flooding and landslides are a setback for the sector, the damage
to key transport routes, including the central north-south route, has been minimal. With some of the
most damaged networks spreading across underdeveloped or proposed corridors, especially in the
west, the reconstruction presents an opportunity to improve the standard of these links and prioritize
them as suggested in the National Transport Development Plan.

                  RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION PLAN

                  Table 47 shows short-, medium-, and long-term recovery needs in the transport sector, and provides
                  an overview of recovery initiatives, the time frames involved, and estimated costs. In addition to
                  discussions with the government, the recovery planning was informed by the Asian Development
                  Bank (ADB) based on its comprehensive understanding of the sector. ADB transport team’s estimates
                  of need were used as a basis for the below recovery plan.

                  Short-term recovery needs. The immediate needs include the completion of temporary repairs to
                  the highway roads and bridges and railways. These repairs are likely to be government funded, and
                  are well under way. The MOC has already made temporary repairs to 96 of the 98 damaged highway
                  bridges. While the works by DRD and MBA on rural roads are also under way, these entities do not
                  have the in-house capacity for repairs and depend on contractors to carry out works. These works
                  will therefore take longer to procure and will require additional resources compared with the force
                  account of MOC. Despite these difficulties, the government plans to complete these permanent
                  repairs to the rural network within the medium term.

                  Medium-term recovery needs. Medium-term needs involve completion of the permanent
                  infrastructure repairs for highways, rural roads, railways and bridges. These needs are partially
                  covered by the current government budgets, with unfinanced permanent repair works as a priority
                  for donor assistance.

                  Long-term recovery needs. Long-term needs include a program of upgrading key routes to improve
                  network resilience and address weakness which emerged during landslides and flooding. In some
                  places this may be limited to providing additional cross drainage, while in others more comprehensive
                  improvements will be required. Based on the recovery plans discussed with the government, several
                  larger initiatives have been proposed in Chin State including upgrading the Hakha-Gangaw, Kalay-
                  Falam-Hakha and Kalewa-Tamu roads. No comprehensive feasibility studies have been undertaken
                  for these initiatives and hence the scope of investment should be subject to a viability analysis. Any
                  works will also need to be considered as part of the broader sector development strategy which
                  goes beyond the scope of this report. Current government budgets cannot fund the standard
                  of infrastructure proposed so that donor support will need to be explored. Any works should be
                  reconstructed to highly resilient standards, for example, slope protection works and retaining walls for
                  mountainous roads, high-level reinforced concrete bridges in place of wooden and bailey structures,
                  and armoring of embankments and approaches to prevent undermining in future flood events.

                  The need to incorporate more resilience in the design—taking a “build back better” approach—
                  means that reconstruction needs over the medium and long term are significantly higher than they
                  would be otherwise, with permanent repair estimates including an allowance of 30 percent to reflect
                  this approach. Additional funding will therefore be required beyond that already provided if the
                  government is to adopt a build back better approach to recovery.

                  Given Myanmar’s exposure to significant disaster risk, replacement transport infrastructure should
                  use sound engineering design that will enhance resilience to natural hazards. Updated design and
                  construction standards are required for various purposes. For example, they will provide guidance
                  on soil-retaining structures; ensure more extensive drainage; add armoring to embankments, bridge
                  abutments, and approaches; and increase design levels and freeboard for bridges. Preparation
                  of updated design and construction standards should therefore be undertaken as part of the
                  government’s disaster response.

                  The losses incurred by private vehicle operators due to higher operating costs, which could stretch
                  some business or individuals financially, and are considered part of the broader economic impact of
                  the disaster. The losses incurred by Myanmar Railways are unlikely to be recovered through normal
                  operations, and the enterprise may need supplementary budget support.

                  RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION IMPLEMENTATION

                  Each responsible ministry and department (Rail Transportation, Construction, Border Affairs, and
                  Department of Rural Development) will lead the implementation of the recovery across its own
                  subsectors. MOC will play a coordinating role and provide technical advice and support where
                  required, given its depth in construction and project management. One expected challenge will be
                  the ability of MR, DRD, and MBA to mobilize the private contractors needed to implement their
                  recovery strategy, in the short, medium, and long term. Where possible these bodies should call upon
                  support from MOC to ensure recovery targets are met.

                  Gender and community considerations for recovery strategy. Where possible, recovery works through
                  either force account or private contractors will make use of local labor. Labor-based methods are the
                  industry standard for civil construction works across Myanmar, and this practice should continue for
                  the recovery. With the loss of income from agriculture during floods, cash for work programs can
                  mobilize labor from local communities to rehabilitate or rebuild infrastructure and provide opportunities
                  to earn much-needed income.

                  Reconstruction of transport infrastructure should consider the safety of local communities, especially
                  for women and vulnerable groups such as the elderly, disabled, and children. Wherever possible,
                  road safety features (such as signage, footpaths, pedestrian crossings, and lighting) should be
                  incorporated. Currently, employment in civil works projects is common for women, particularly in rural
                  areas during the farm off-season.  For any reconstruction works, the government should consider
                  the following:

                  	   •	 	Organizing consultations with local communities to understand their needs
                  	   •	 Including safety features where possible, especially for women and vulnerable groups
                  	   •	 Using community-based labor to provide much-needed employment for affected populations
                  	   •	 Ensuring that employment processes offer women the same opportunity as men to receive
                          information about hiring, and that equal pay for equal work is provided
                  	   •	 Where relevant, encouraging private contractors to hire labor from local communities, and
                          ensuring that equal pay for equal work is provided


                  SECTOR ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY

                  The cost of damage was considered as the replacement cost of infrastructure (that is, the cost of
                  bringing infrastructure to pre-disaster levels). Data for this assessment of damage, loss, and needs
                  were compiled from a range of sources. Given ADB engagement in the transport sector, we relied
                  heavily on its flood damage assessment for trunk and rural roads and bridges as well as railways.
                  We also called on ADB’s sector specialists to verify assessments and provide guidance on country
                  context. ADB’s figures were checked against damage reports from government ministries and were
                  found to be the most accurate. A challenge which remains is to link the damage costs indicated with
                  physical quantities, including kilometers of road (if possible by type, whether highway or rural road),
                  as well as well as length in meters, number, and type of bridges. While some of this information is
                  available, a detailed understanding of quantities for the transport sector is incomplete at the time of
                  this report. The Ministry of Construction was consulted for the recovery plan and helped determine
                  estimates of needs for more resilient infrastructure. Due to time limitations, no field visits could be
                  conducted. Assessment of transport sector damage and losses was coordinated with other sectors,
                  including water resources and agriculture, to ensure against double counting.

Communications
SUMMARY

Myanmar’s communications sector faced significant damage—most notably to telecommunication
networks, postal services, and government offices—in the regions affected by the floods and
landslides. The total damage and losses in economic flows are estimated at K 1,246.85 million and
K 1,243.97 million, respectively. The estimated cost of recovery and reconstruction is estimated at
K 106,287.68 million. In the near term, communications infrastructure in the affected states and
regions will be rehabilitated as quickly as possible using available financial resources. Efforts will
be financed by the operators and coordinated by the Ministry of Communications and Information
Technology (MCIT) and its Post and Telecommunications Department (PTD) in close cooperation
with Myanma Posts and Telecommunications (MPT), private operators, and Myanma Posts. The
long-term recovery goal for the communications sector is to rebuild and establish a future-proof
communications infrastructure and services sector that will serve the needs of a digital Myanmar.
In line with this vision, the approach to reconstruction should ensure increased investments in the
telecommunications sector and the establishment of a resilient public service broadcast sector. In
this way, Myanmar will be able to take advantage of the opportunities provided by technological
developments in the information and communication technology (ICT) sector.


PRE-DISASTER CONTEXT

Myanmar’s communications sector before the floods and landslides was characterized by competition
(introduced in 2014) and fast growth in network coverage and service uptake. Mobile penetration
increased from under 10 percent in 2012 to over 60 percent in September 2015, and prices for SIM
cards fell from US$250 to under US$1.50 in the same period. The broadcast and print media sectors
have grown significantly in the last few years. The public sector radio and television broadcasters
have nationwide coverage. The postal network extends to every township across the country. Table
48 provides a summary of the communications sector and market structure prior to the floods and
landslides.

                  Telecommunications is one of the major infrastructure sectors that have seen significant foreign
                  direct investment. Sector reforms undertaken in 2013 have resulted in a competitive market for
                  telecommunications services. Since 2013, teledensity has increased in Myanmar, from around 10
                  percent to over 60 percent; there has been foreign investment of over US$3 billion; and a large
                  number of direct and indirect jobs have been created.

                  Before the disaster, the telecommunications sector faced a number of policy and regulatory challenges:

                  	   •	 An evolving policy and regulatory framework that did not always keep pace with the significant
                         developments in the sector
                  	   •	 Lack of an emergency and disaster communications  strategy, plan, and network infrastructure
                  	   •	 Significant delays in getting rights-of-way and site clearances for infrastructure rollout,
                         particularly fiber-optic backbone networks and tower infrastructure
                  	   •	 Inadequate radio spectrum for microwave networks
                  	   •	 Limited mobile value-added services and applications designed to serve economic and social
                         sectors—in particular mobile financial services, which lack a clear regulatory framework for
                         mobile network operators.

                  Despite these challenges, there is a huge demand for services, and ICTs are being rapidly adopted
                  across the Myanmar public and private sectors.

POST-DISASTER SITUATION

The communications sector faced significant damage in the regions affected by the floods and
landslides.

Telecommunication networks were affected in a number of ways. Floods affected mobile base
transceiver stations (BTSes), and power disruptions and lack of fuel supply affected service provision.
All operators reported damage to some of their BTS sites. The state-owned incumbent, MPT, faced
significant damage to its office and equipment buildings in affected areas. This damage resulted in
network downtime in the immediate aftermath (a week or longer) of floods in July and August 2015.

While the international gateways, which enable international communications, were not affected,
network backhaul infrastructure (particularly aerially installed fiber-optic cables and some microwave
sites) was damaged in a number of areas. The fixed-line network sustained limited damage, largely to
its outside plant. In low-lying areas, floods caused damage to power supply infrastructure, particularly
battery banks and rectifiers. Network outages occurred when landslides impacted poles on which
fiber-optic cables had been strung. The lack of redundant ring backhaul networks impacted service
provision, and operators found repairing their backhaul networks extremely challenging. Microwave
links were quickly deployed, and fiber cables were repaired on an emergency basis.

To cope with power outages brought about by the floods and landslides, and to support operators’  
efforts to ensure network and service availability, diesel fuel was made available to operators. Operators
provided free voice, data, and SMS services for a period of time, and they also broadcast mass SMS
messages on the flood situation. At this time, services are largely restored. Mobile communication
services are available in even the worst-hit regions, although the quality is affected by the unreliable
power supply and some dead spots in the network. All operators faced revenue losses when network
disruption rendered service unavailable. MPT was able to deploy satellite terminals as a short-term
measure to provide backhaul connectivity between affected sites.

Internet services were not significantly disrupted.

                  continue to be provided, albeit with delays due to road blockages among other
things. Post office buildings were damaged in 19 locations. Myanma Posts has also faced revenue
losses due to service disruption.

Broadcast media faced some challenges, but Myanma Radio and Television (MRTV), the state-
owned broadcaster, continued its broadcasts on a 24/7 basis. It also lost revenues from advertising
and time-slot sales.

Government agencies experienced some damages.   Office buildings belonging to MPT were
damaged, as were staff accommodations belonging to the government.

Sector investments may be affected by the floods and landslides. While government, MCIT, and
PTD provided all regulatory support to service providers, future investments in the telecommunications
sectors rollout may suffer. The cost of insurance for private operators and their third-party suppliers
is likely to increase.

Government functions and systems were not impeded, in part because networks were quickly
restored. The communications sector is key to ensuring that government can communicate and
manage its disaster response, relief, and rehabilitation efforts. While initial network congestion and lack
of coverage were experienced, communication sector damages did not appear to harm governance
and decision-making processes at key government levels. However, in the event that the networks
had failed for longer periods, the government would have been very adversely affected, and the
situation in country would likely have been chaotic. As the government seeks to make cash transfers
to severely affected constituencies and individuals in the aftermath of the floods and landslides, the

                                                                                                                       135

                     importance of mobile financial services is clear: they allow cash (both public and private support for
                     affected communities) to be effectively transferred in a timely manner during a crisis situation, which
                     is especially significant since the banking network and ATM machines are limited in rural Myanmar.

                     Effects on risks and vulnerabilities. As Myanmar does not have a national emergency
                     telecommunications plan, the communications sector faces an increased vulnerability to network
                     downtime. A lack of power supply and damage to road networks following the disaster suggest that
                     operators need to rely on back-up power solutions, such as diesel generators and solar power, for
                     their rural networks. This vulnerability increases the risk of network downtime, as it is challenging to
                     get fuel to remote sites. Further, communication towers and poles located in landslide-prone areas
                     are at risk of collapse.

                     Gender assessment. People living in remote areas reportedly received early warnings of the flood
                     from various sources, including phone, radio, TV, and even letters sent by authorities. “Word of
                     mouth” remains a key source of information in remote areas, but the increasing availability of mobile
                     phones has begun to transform the gender dimensions of information dissemination. The LIRNEasia
                     2015 Baseline Survey of ICT and Knowledge Access reveals a high level of access to mobile phones
                     in rural households: 80 percent of rural households now have access to a mobile phone inside
                     their homes, and that access is fairly equal among men and women. Most of the rural females
                     surveyed (57 percent) indicated that they intend to buy a new phone this year. Rural residents
                     rank weather information the second-most important type of information they need (this is mainly
                     for agriculture-related purposes). These are positive signs of an increasing use of technology for
                     spreading information. During disasters and the immediate recovery period, ICT can play an especially
                     important role in providing information, and ensuring transparency and safety, for vulnerable people—
                     men, women, boys, and girls alike. Communities and population in camps and shelters should be
                     able to access information as well as be able to also share timely reports and complaints based on
                     monitoring of key issues.


                     ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE EFFECTS AND THE IMPACT OF THE
                     DISASTER ON THE SECTOR

                     The overall cost of damage and loss in the communications sector is estimated at K 1,246.85 million
                     and K 1,243.97 million, respectively, as summarized in Table 49. Networks outages caused by the
                     floods and landslides meant that operators bore significant revenue losses. Operators also bore
                     losses associated with provision of free services (e.g., airtime, SMS). MRTV, the state-owned media
                     broadcaster, accumulated revenue losses due to the noncarriage of commercial advertising and time
                     slots.

Impact analysis of sector development goals. Approximately 1.69 million people have been
displaced by the floods and landslides. Most of them are in remote rural communities, facing challenges
in accessing social and economic services. An almost nonexistent mobile money ecosystem has
impacted access to finance. An underdeveloped broadband ecosystem has impacted access to public
services. The lack of a digital national identification system is likely to hamper public service delivery,
given that many affected people have lost their paper-based citizenship identification. The challenges
faced as government agencies and people sought to communicate and receive information following
the disaster demonstrated the need for a very robust and resilient communications infrastructure in
Myanmar. Before the floods, operators had been in the process of increasing coverage of mobile
broadband networks, but in the short term, their focus will be on restoring coverage to pre-disaster
status and expanding coverage to unserved areas. As a result of the disaster, it is likely that the rollout
of services across Myanmar will see some delays.

Cross-sector linkages. ICT and telecommunications in particular constitute a crucial economic
infrastructure, and their early recovery and restoration is important to support economic and public
service delivery in Myanmar. Post-disaster relief efforts have relied heavily on telecommunications,
Internet, and broadcast media.

The government has invested in a national data center and is in the process of developing a Myanmar
national portal. The adoption and mainstreaming of these efforts across all government agencies will
enable faster and cheaper deployment of ICT solutions and applications across government; and it
will also reduce the cost of providing public services using ICT.

Once developed, the government’s disaster risk reduction strategy would make use of monitoring and
early warning systems, many of which rely on telecommunications networks. Further, geo-mapping
activities (e.g., OpenStreetMap, GoogleMaps) rely on Internet access.

Telecommunication networks depend upon the availability of power supply. During the most recent
disaster, lack of reliable power and insufficient fuel for diesel generators caused significant network
downtime. Lack of power also left many mobile subscribers unable to charge their mobile phones
or use their computers. As telecommunication and Internet providers start using optical-fiber ground
wire (OPGW) on power transmission networks, the linkage between the ICT and the power sector
will only become stronger.

Fiber-optic cables for network backhaul that were ducted and buried were not adversely affected—
unlike aerial cables. The communication sector should coordinate with the Ministry of Construction
and urban authorities to facilitate the development of underground ducts for burying fiber networks.  


RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION STRATEGY

In the communications sector, reconstructions needs resulting directly from the disaster
are estimated at K 29,940.80 million over a 24-month period. As recovery and reconstruction
proceed, the government should seek to develop a future-ready communications infrastructure and
service industry that meet the country’s long-term development objectives and that are inclusive,
equitable, and sustainable within a well-functioning digital economy.

In order to build back better, MCIT and operators should consider a telecommunications network that
includes the following measures:

	   •	 Burying cables. Underground cabling in ducts for fiber-optic cables (rather than aerial cables)
       would strengthen the resilience of telecommunication infrastructure.
	   •	 Ensuring multiple route redundancies for the backhaul network, both domestic
       and regional. One way to achieve these redundancies would be to allow infrastructure
       providers (including other utility providers such as the power transmission company and

                                                                                                                       137

                           Myanmar Railways) to lease fiber-optic capacity to operators. In addition, facilitating the rapid
                           clearance of sites and approval of rights-of-way would allow operators to build out towers and
                           transmission networks much faster than they can under the current pace of rollout. Facilitating
                           multiple routes for cross-border international connectivity would help to ensure that Myanmar’s
                           telecommunications and Internet connectivity is not compromised in the future.
                  	   •	   Improving the resilience of BTSes. This could be done by (i) making provisions for vehicles
                           with microwave transceivers combined with the function of a base station as well as a satellite
                           ground station, to be shared between operators; (ii) adjusting the output power and reconfiguring
                           base station antennas to cover more ground so they serve low-population-density and low-
                           network-traffic areas better; and (iii) increasing backup power at base stations and all other
                           communication facilities to counter electricity outages. BTSes have been identified as crucial
                           within the sector and therefore to be earmarked to also receive reliable fuel supply.
                  	   •	   Increasing backup power at the base stations and all other communication facilities.
                           This step would counter electricity outages by deploying more optical fiber on power
                           transmission networks (OPGW and ADSS) and building redundant routes; and it could widen
                           existing coverage by using of techniques such as large-zone base stations.
                  	   •	   Ensuring creation and usage of hazard maps. These should be created by local authorities,
                           including the disaster management agency, and so that necessary safety precautions can be
                           taken while building communications infrastructure.
                  	   •	   Taking measures to mitigate traffic congestion on the network. This can be done by
                           call restriction, call prioritization, and appropriate disclosure of network capacity by operators
                           through a predetermined process.
                  	   •	   Building critical tower infrastructure in key strategic locations nationwide. This step
                           should be taken in conjunction with enabling infrastructure sharing for all operators and
                           potentially for broadcast media providers.

                  While it is expected that telecommunications coverage will eventually be restored to pre-disaster
                  status, the ability of operators to provide broadband Internet access across the country will be limited
                  by certain factors, such as the following:

                  	   •	 Lack of access to affordable backhaul networks (including fiber-optic networks)
                  	   •	 Delayed  clearances for rights-of-way and site acquisition
                  	   •	 Inadequate access to radio spectrum resources, particularly for microwave backbones

                  It is important to note that these factors impact the total cost of ownership and usage for consumers.
                  Populations in severely affected areas will likely have less disposable income to spend on
                  communication services (both voice and Internet). If certain policy decisions and regulatory actions
                  are made a priority, Myanmar is likely to fall behind in connecting its population—particularly its rural
                  population—to the Internet.

                  Television and radio broadcasters (particularly those with MRTV) were instrumental in keeping people
                  fully informed about the disaster. Given broadcasters’ critical public service role, it is important to
                  ensure their resilience for the future. This could include developing backup production studios and
                  broadcasting information in ethnic languages and dialects.

                  ICT is a cross-cutting sector, and key infrastructure—such as shared data centers, the government
                  cloud, and the national identification infrastructure—are also crucial for other sectors. The build back
                  better strategy should therefore address this infrastructure. Overall, given every country’s reliance
                  on ICT in general, Myanmar should also give priority to developing a government data center for
                  disaster recovery. Government could also plan on a cloud strategy for the hosting of government
                  data, applications, and services.

                  To enable government to better provide public services and to target beneficiaries of social protection
                  and other support, both in the post-disaster period and over the long term, government must be able
                  to assess and plan for the implementation of a digital national identification program.

Finally, given the challenge of poor accessing banking and financial services, government should
consider the early approval of regulations that will allow extended mobile operator networks to reach
the financially excluded.


RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION PLAN

While recovery costs (for telecommunications in particular) have been borne by the service providers
who have had to restore services, short-term reconstruction needs do exist. Table 50 shows the
reconstruction needs of the communications sector based on information provided by operators
and service providers. In addition, there is an urgent need for building back better access (cellular
and Internet services), backbone networks, and eGovernment infrastructure platforms (including an
integrated government data center for disaster recovery and national ID infrastructure).

RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION IMPLEMENTATION

Implementation strategy. The proposed strategy revolves around a two-phase intervention: short/
immediate term, medium/long term. Table 51 summarizes key immediate priorities, related both
to restoring basic communications services and to using ICTs in broader cross-sectoral relief and
recovery operations. Those bullet points that are considered crucial and highest priority are rank-
ordered. Medium/long term ICT requirements related to building the country’s resilience to natural
shocks and promoting overall economic competitiveness are identified in Table 52. The overall
estimated cost to implement these high-priority actions is approximately K 106,287.68 million (Table
50).

                  SECTOR ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY

                  The communications sector assessment covers the strategic public and private telecommunications
                  networks (both fixed and mobile), Internet service providers, and postal services. It also includes
                  the MCIT, which is responsible for the telecommunications and postal sectors, and its associated
                  agencies: MPT, Myanma Posts, and PTD. The MCIT and PTD have policy and regulatory oversight
                  of the sector.

                  Damage costs are estimated based on initial assessments by MCIT and PTD, in turn based on
                  information provided by the three telecommunications operators and Myanma Posts.88 These
                  estimates have not been verified through detailed engineering assessments. Further, the damage and
                  losses faced by some of the third-party suppliers to the telecommunication operators have not been
                  captured. The loss figures mainly consist of damage to physical premises, network equipment, and
                  additional maintenance costs (largely for fuel supply for sites where commercial power is unavailable
                  and/or erratic) and immediate rehabilitation/reconstruction works. The damage, loss, and recovery
                  assessments are highly dependent on data provided to MCIT and PTD by operators, service providers,
                  and government agencies.

                  Gender
                  SUMMARY

                  Women’s and girls’ priorities in a disaster differ in nature and degree from those of men and
                  boys because their roles and status differ from—and are often secondary to—those of men
                  and boys. As this chapter shows, pre-disaster vulnerabilities of women and girls are exacerbated
                  during disaster, although women and girls have also displayed great resilience. Some of the key
                  gender-based concerns that have emerged are as follows: age- and sex- disaggregated data across
                  sectors are lacking; compared to men and boys, women and girls are at greater disadvantage and
                  have lower recovery capacity (associated with lower incomes and loss of already-fewer productive
                  assets); they have more limited mobility and less access to employment and socioeconomic
                  resources; they have higher food insecurity and malnutrition; they are subject to increased care work
                  with fewer safety net resources, leading to indebtedness; they experience a high level of stress; they
                  are subject to worsened privacy, safety, and security; and their participation and decision making in
                  response and recovery is limited, especially at local levels.

                  This assessment shows that women and girls brought their capacities, knowledge, and
                  networks to bear on coping and recovery. These assets must be drawn on in recovery planning.
                  Further, Myanmar has a national demographic skewed in favor of women and a high proportion of
                  female-headed households, 1 out of 4 of which were affected in the disaster. Investing in women
                  has multiplier effects, as women tend to use benefits accruing to them for families and communities.

                  To optimize and sustain investment in recovery, it is critical that women and their
                  priorities be included in disaster assessment, response and recovery planning, and
                  implementation—and it is especially critical that female-headed households be targeted.
                  This approach provides an opportunity to build back inclusively and better. Priorities linked to the
                  National Strategic Plan for the Advancement of Women (2013–2022) should (i) ensure sex- and
                  age-disaggregated data collection, classification, analysis, dissemination, and use prior to disaster
                  and in post-disaster assessments; (ii) include women in decision making from response to recovery
                  planning/implementation, with budgets allocated for women’s priorities; (iii) prioritize poor female-
                  headed households in provision of assistance; (iv) focus on pregnant and nursing women’s nutrition;
                  (v) employ women in cash-for-work programs on an equal work for equal pay basis; (vi) provide job-
                  skills training for women in nontraditional sectors; (vii) prioritize women’s access to information; (viii)
                  recognize, reduce, and redistribute women’s care work; and (ix) prevent violence aimed at women
                  and children and protect them from it.

                  They thus outstrip males in all age groups except for birth through four years. The disability
                  prevalence rate is 4.4 percent for men and 4.8 percent for women (4.6 percent overall).92 A very
                  high proportion (23.7 percent) of households is female-headed,93 with one in every four households
                  in affected areas headed by women. This high proportion demands immediate attention, as these
                  households are among the most socially and economically vulnerable in normal times, and they are

disproportionately affected in disaster and recovery efforts. Fewer women than men participate in
the labor force, and households headed by women are 51 percent of the households dependent on
agriculture. Despite their significant contribution to crop cultivation, women are popularly perceived as
laborers rather than farmers, self-employed farmers, or farm managers.94 Compared to men, women
have also less access to credit, and training (which is usually directed at male heads of households).95
Despite these challenges, women in Myanmar play a key role in providing their families with nutrition
and food security, as well as household income for children’s education among other needs.

Myanmar does not have national data on prevalence of violence against women, but indications
are that the level is of concern.96 Women’s representation in leadership and decision making is poor,
especially at subnational levels. There are no women township administrators,97 and only 19 women
village tract/ward administrators out of a total of 16,743 (0.11 percent) in government-controlled
areas.98

Women are almost solely responsible for care work. Although no time-use survey has been conducted
at the regional or national level in Myanmar, findings from a small sample survey conducted by the
United Nations Development Programme in 2012 in villages around Inle Lake clearly demonstrate that
women spend much more time than men on care work—generally four or five times more per day
(Table 53). When combined with limitations in access to and ownership of productive resources and
a high dependence on subsistence agriculture, the long daily periods spent on care make women
extremely vulnerable.

POST-DISASTER SITUATION

Although the national census provides some baseline data, a serious constraint in the current disaster
was the lack of age- and sex-disaggregated data in relation to both baselines and Post-Disaster
Needs Assessment. Without these data, it is difficult to identify the diverse impacts of the disaster on
different population groups (including women and female-headed households), to compute losses
and damages for them, and to ensure that decision making about the allocation of finances, goods,
and services is informed by their needs (i.e., that they are not excluded from the benefits of recovery
planning and investment). Data collection and analysis on damages and losses would have been
more comprehensive if there the rationale for data disaggregation had been better appreciated, and
the information-gathering tools had included the required fields for sex- and age-disaggregated data
collection.

                    ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE EFFECTS AND THE IMPACT OF THE
                    DISASTERS ON THE SECTOR

                    Overall, the disaster has had a more negative impact on women than on men. Faced with the loss
                    of food stocks and livestock, inundation of farmland and subsequent loss of agricultural labor, and
                    the inability to look for alternative livelihoods due to the high burden of care work, women under
                    considerable burden to provide food and nutrition for their families, while at the same time having far
                    fewer resources and options for alternative livelihoods when compared with men.

                    Loss of life and disaster risk reduction. According to the Relief and Resettlement Department
                    (RRD) under the Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement (MSWRR), as of September, 30,
                    2015, there were 139 reported deaths in the floods and landslides in Myanmar.99 Table 54 shows
                    age- and sex-disaggregated information on the 122 deaths for which detailed data were available.

                    a. Deaths of girls 0–14 years were high compared to boys in the same age group. The causes of these deaths need further investigation to
                    identify appropriate preparedness measures and programmatic approaches that address live-saving skills.




                    The patterns of these deaths are intrinsically linked to the traditional division of roles between men
                    and women. The majority of people, 89 percent (109) drowned. Lightning strikes, landslides, and
                    collapsing structures/objects killed 11 percent (13). Age and sex disaggregation show that 26 out of
                    27 children—17 girls versus 9 boys—drowned. Most women, 30 out of 33 in the age bracket 15–65+
                    years, were swept away with children by water flowing at high velocity, or when boats capsized as
                    they were seeking safe ground or refuge, or moving to collect fuel, food, or water—that is, while
                    performing traditional domestic or care-giving roles. Men also drowned in high velocity waters
                    while trying to move to safety or when houses were damaged, but they drowned under different
                    circumstances: they were trying to retrieve goods from the waters or to take large equipment to
                    safety; going to worksites; rescuing others; trying to swim to safety; or rowing children to school.
                    More men than women appear to have died in the landslides.

                    Women in flood-affected communities (Minbu Township in Magway, Kalay in Sagaing, and Aunglan
                    and Myaybon in Rakhine) reported slightly different patterns in early warning and preparedness training
                    and response.100 While radio and TV warnings and written intimation from township administrations
                    were more widespread in Rakhine, information was received via loud speakers or mobile phones in
                    Minbu Township in Magway and Kalay in Sagaing, and it did not always percolate effectively to all
                    villagers. Most poor women-headed households reported not owning a phone, and many women
                    whose husbands owned a phone reported not knowing how to use one. Women and communities
                    in areas that are not prone to routine or high levels of flooding (like Kalay in Sagaing or Minbu in
                    Magway) were unable to assess the danger of the disaster. Communities in these sites also had poor
                    knowledge of household/ community preparedness measures. Many waited too long to try to move

to safe sites. A common narrative emerging from field interviews was that women and girls were very
restricted in their mobility. They found it difficult to swim, row boats, climb trees—routine activities for
men and boys. Moreover, women in general, and especially women household heads, did not own
assets like boats, which were in short supply in the disaster. In any case the boats used were often
not of the size and quality to withstand high water velocity.101

Women’s participation and decision making in response and recovery. A common pattern (reported
by 128 women, men, and youth in Chin, Magway, Rakhine, and Sagaing) was that women were
poorly represented in formal response and recovery work and in formal decision-making bodies.102
Communities perceive disasters as dangerous and better suited for male than for female leadership
and action. Where women participated in response and recovery, they did so at base camps,
while men went further afield into affected villages.103 UN Women observed a strong tendency for
men to monopolize discussions, making separate discussions with women a requirement in future
disaster planning. Cultural norms around men’s leadership perhaps explain women’s lack of voice,
participation, visibility, and influence. Including women in decision making from response to recovery
across all sectors would help ensure that their priorities, which are often different from those of men,
are well integrated in recovery planning and implementation, and that budgets are allocated and
spent to address these priorities.

Time use. There was an absence of pre-disaster time-use data, and time constraints limited more
quantitative post-disaster time-use analysis. Qualitative data, however, suggest that women continue
to bear the sole responsibility for care work, even though care tasks and the time and effort they
require have increased as a result of the floods and landslides. Women spent much time keeping
young children safe above water levels; protecting them from insects and snakes; nursing family
members back to health; queuing for relief items; traveling distances in unsafe conditions to fetch
food, water, animal feed, and firewood; and seeking work.104

Women in Rakhine State reported that polluted village water ponds required them to travel to unaffected
villages for clean water. By conservative estimates, this travel increased the time to secure water, from
20 minutes daily pre-disaster to 90 minutes each time water was needed post-disaster. Depending
on family size, either two or three trips a day were required; in some cases other family members,
especially girls, were involved in the work of fetching water in order to reduce the number of trips.105
Women in camps/shelters in Haka spent large amounts of time in mass cooking, washing, cleaning
utensils, and other care work, with little time or opportunity to earn incomes. When combined with
loss of assets and livelihoods in the floods and landslides, this loss of opportunities to earn income
makes it more difficult for women to recover.106

Sexual and gender-based violence. Domestic and sexual violence and abuse, particularly against
women, girls, and boys was reported through the Multi-Cluster/Sector Initial Rapid Assessment
(MIRA) in the current disaster.107 Out of the 280 locations assessed, 241 (78 percent) reported
security concerns affecting the community.108 In 34 percent of the assessed locations, people
sought police services, and in 55 percent people reported seeking community leaders’ support or

                  advice. Some women reported attacks when going outside the community or risk of attack when
                  going to toilets. Women and girls were also at risk when foraging afar for firewood. Children were
                  at increased risk while moving in camp settlements or assistance distribution and water collection
                  points, as well as when bathing, using health facilities, and or at school. Concerns were expressed
                  about women submitting to sexual extortion for food and shelter and their inability to access services
                  and resources.109

                  Civil society and UN organizations working on response in Rakhine, Sagaing, and Chin identified
                  several triggers for this violence: increased stress due to loss of housing, economic assets, and
                  livelihoods; lack of privacy in shelters and lack of separate bathing and toilet facilities, contributing
                  to opportunistic violence; alcoholism; and men’s assertion of increased control over their families to
                  compensate for a lack of routine and increased vulnerability. Key measures that should be taken to
                  address these concerns include ensuring the equitable (50 percent) inclusion of women in planning
                  and assistance committees at all levels of the response, as well as private bathing areas, segregated
                  latrines, lighting, private shelters, provision of dignity kits, and psychosocial support.

                  Employment and livelihoods. This disaster has had profound, multiple effects on women’s
                  livelihoods, food security, nutrition, income, and other aspects of their lives. Women are primarily
                  responsible for providing food in households. The loss of food stocks increases women’s work
                  because it forces them to find alternative sources of food. Women report reducing the number of daily
                  meals prepared in order to stretch food resources as far as possible. The projected loss of both the
                  monsoon and winter rice crop will have a further negative impact on nutrition, especially for children,
                  lactating mothers, and pregnant women; 50 percent of pregnant women suffer from anaemia and
                  18 percent have vitamin A deficiency.110 Prioritizing provision of cash assistance and food to these
                  groups is critical.

                  Female-headed households were among those who suffered damage to land and crops. Female-
                  headed households are less likely to own crop holdings than male-headed households,111 and their
                  acreage tends to be smaller.112 With relatively fewer people in the family, resource-poor female-
                  headed households may be at a particular disadvantage when crop lands are inundated or under
                  debris; difficulty in clearing and replanting quickly makes them more vulnerable to income losses,
                  food insecurity, and slower recovery.

                  Where farmland becomes useless, female-headed households may be further marginalized.
                  Regenerative inputs are generally provided to males, deemed heads of households. Targeted
                  assistance needs to be directed at female-headed households in terms of cash assistance, agricultural
                  inputs, and clearing of debris from land.

                  Livestock ownership is important in Myanmar. Men own and control large livestock like cattle, while
                  women tend to control smaller livestock like ducks and poultry. Assuming that women controlled
                  poultry in every household in affected regions, then in absolute numbers, women lost about 84
                  percent of all animals to the floods (Table 55). Certainly women lost a large chunk of their livelihoods,
                  and this loss has a huge implication for their ability to provide food and protein to their families, as well
                  as income. Women often sell chickens and ducks and eggs to augment income, especially during
                  stress, but this coping option will no longer be available to them.

                      To combat this, the UN Population Fund used local radio through the BBC Media Action to convey messages designed
                  to prevent gender-based violence—such as information about the risks of trafficking, importance of staying with trustworthy
                  people, and the right to free humanitarian assistance. The fund helped to ensure that messages were well understood by both
                  women and girls, camp committees and village leaders who were distributing the assistance.

Men lost the most in absolute value. Although they control large livestock and only lost 7 percent, in
monetary value, men lost K 23 million versus women who lost K 3,607.53 million representing about
87 percent of the total effect on livestock. Women may find it easier than men to recoup on their
livestock losses; it may take years for men to save enough to restock buffalos and cattle.

Restocking of small animals, particularly chickens, and reconstruction pens, which were also
damaged, are additional urgent requirements, particularly for the poorest female-headed households.
Small animals that breed quickly would help these households increase their incomes, enhance animal
protein intake, and improve nutrition. This restocking should be supported by providing animal feed
and vaccines to prevent the spread of animal diseases and ensure animals remain in good health.

Among female respondents in the Agriculture and Livelihood Flood Impact Assessment, 57 percent
mentioned casual labor as the most important source of income for poor families, especially for poor
women-headed households. Women reported a reduction in casual labor opportunities in agriculture
due to destruction of land and crops, and hence a reduction in their incomes. While men are more
likely to find any kind of alternative work further afield and migrate, women have a more limited set of
job opportunities, and are paid less than men. Care responsibilities further limit mobility and income-
earning opportunities. Cash assistance and agricultural inputs should be provided as a matter of
priority to women who have lost them.

Fisheries and aquaculture were impacted by the floods and landslides. A total of about 30,000
hectares of aquaculture ponds essentially owned and operated by men have been affected. Both
men and women engage in inland-water fishing. Women are involved in fish processing, vending
processed products and fresh fish, and making and repairing fishing nets and lines. They have lost
these processed products, raw materials for processing, and small fishing equipment (nets, traps,
small kayaks) and hence their livelihoods and nutrition. They should be provided with this equipment
to help restore their livelihoods.

Women reported that before the disaster, they had borrowed money for agriculture and livestock
from various sources, including money lenders (at high interest rates), microfinance institutions, and
NGOs with microfinance programs. Damages and losses in land, crops, and livestock, along with
loss of casual labor, have made it difficult for women to repay these loans. Many have sought financial
support from relatives or NGOs. This was corroborated by PACT, which implements microfinance
programs in 58 townships in Myanmar.113 PACT’s client-needs assessment in 1,234 villages of 24
affected townships in Magway and Sagaing revealed that among its total clientele of 321,254—98
percent of them women—71,121 clients were affected; 8,547 clients required cash assistance (for
good-quality seeds for paddy, vegetables, beans, and peanuts and to repair or rebuild houses); 1,587
required a loan write-off; 1,283 required a new loan; and 3,698 wanted to restructure a loan.114

113
     In 24 of PACT’s township project sites, 1,234 villages were affected by the flood; of these, 1,081 villages in Magway,
Sagaing, and Ayeyarwady were severely affected. PACT’s microfinance schemes charge interest at 2.5 percent per month, or
30 percent annually.

OF FLOODS AND LANDSLIDES JULY–SEPTEMBER 2015



                  Women own and manage enterprises, and are employed as workers in the same. They dominate
                  self-run microbusinesses producing/selling food, handicrafts, and kitchen garden produce (also
                  consumed). Women report loss of cooking appliances for care work, and they have also lost
                  equipment/raw materials for handicraft, food, and kitchen garden production/sales. Kitchen gardens
                  themselves have been destroyed. Compensation is required to replace this equipment and seeds
                  for kitchen garden production, and damages and losses for women-owned small and medium
                  enterprises need to be compensated.

                  Housing. The impact of the disaster on housing may have a profound impact on women-headed
                  households, the disabled, and the elderly. While the national average for female-headed households
                  is 23.7 percent, the average in affected states/regions is 25 percent. A total of K 151,490.89 million
                  in damage and losses was borne by female-headed households Table 56. These households tend to
                  be poorer and live in inferior-quality housing, which sustained more extensive damage that of male-
                  headed households. Poverty and a lack of resources (including the ability to purchase labor) make
                  housing reconstruction challenging for them. They will need targeted support in housing reconstruction
                  measures, either through government/private sector rebuilding or monetary compensation for
                  reconstruction materials and hire of laborers to rebuild.

                  Women and children reported that loss of housing represented a loss of “their space,” in which
                  they spent a greater part of their time. It reduced security and privacy levels for all women and girls,
                  which was especially a concern for those menstruating, pregnant, and nursing. Shelters and tents
                  often were designed without sensitivity to female needs: they were too cramped, with no partitions,
                  ledges, or storage space; leaking or touching wet ground; lacking cooking, separate bathing, or toilet
                  facilities; and lacking proper lighting. These features heightened privacy problems and intensified
                  stress, especially for women with young children. They also increased vulnerability to sexual abuse.

                  Women reported that with loss of housing, they also lost important possessions, including cooking
                  equipment, equipment and raw material for agriculture and home-based industries, goods stored
                  for trade, “safety net savings,” food, water, fuel, baby carriers, and toys and educational material for
                  children. The loss of these possessions directly damaged women’s economic assets and caused
                  losses in livelihoods and incomes, increases in care work, fewer earning opportunities, and increased
                  stress in coping.


                  RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION STRATEGY

                  This recovery and reconstruction strategy for gender is closely aligned with the National
                  Strategic Plan for the Advancement of Women 2013–2022, with particular reference to the
                  following: (i) improving women’s livelihoods/reducing poverty; (ii) increasing employment and access
                  to economic assets and benefits; (iii) protecting women in emergencies and their participation in
                  emergency preparedness, response, and disaster risk reduction; (iv) ensuring women’s equal
                  participation in decision-making/leadership at all levels; and (v) eliminating and responding to violence
                  against women and girls.

RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION PLAN

Short-term needs relate to data, compensation for death, decision making, women in the
agricultural sector, infrastructure, and sexual and gender- based violence.

	 1.	Undertake detailed assessment of special needs of poor women and women-headed
      households in affected areas (K 130 million); prioritize them across all sectors in recovery plan.
	 2.	 Ensure payment of compensation at agreed rate of K 100,000 for all disaster-related deaths.
	 3.	 Prioritize poor women and female-headed households in provision of seeds to enable them
      to quickly replant; agricultural equipment and machinery to enable them to quickly clear their
      land; and equipment for cooking/home-based industries for livelihoods recovery,
	 4.	 Target women, especially female-headed and poor households, in poultry restocking. At least
      80 percent of the recovery resources for restocking of poultry should specifically target women
      (K 17.6 million).
	 5.	 Provide cash assistance, no-interest loans, loan restructuring, and loan write-offs, prioritizing
      women and female-headed households.
	 6.	 Prioritize the reconstruction of houses of women-headed households by the government,
      private sector, and NGOs, and consult with women on design features and location. Where the
      above-mentioned stakeholders do not directly rebuild, provide women-headed households
      with cash/reconstruction inputs, so that they can hire laborers to rebuild. Ensure that new
      housing is jointly titled in the names of both spouses and, registered in the name of women
      who head households.
	 7.	 Employ women in cash for work reconstruction (housing, WASH, roads, bridges, canals) on an
      equal pay for equal work basis with men and with crèche facilities.
	 8.	 Repair and provide safe and appropriate water/sanitation, transportation, and energy facilities,
      and include women in village development committees to formulate, implement, and benefit
      from woman-sensitive water and sanitation solutions; safe and time-saving transportation, and
      safe and clean energy initiatives.
	 9.	 Ensure that shelters have design features appropriate for women: partitioned rooms, separate
      baths, lockable toilets, and good lighting to prevent triggers to sexual and gender-based
      violence.

Medium-term needs relate to data and disaster risk reduction.

	 1.	 Strengthen the capacity of Myanmar’s Central Statistical Organization, government departments
      at all levels, and the disaster response and recovery community in the country to (i) address
      the range of gender issues that arise in disasters, and (ii) collect, classify, analyze, and make
      publicly available data disaggregated by age, sex, and location.
	 2.	 Provide women/children with training on early warning, household/community preparedness,
      warning dissemination, and orderly/timely evacuation. Use media (radio, loudspeakers, or
      face-to-face communication) that poor rural women are comfortable with; impart information
      and training at times and in venues convenient to women (face-to-face group communication
      in the afternoons or nights outside one of their homes), and/or post pictorial information at
      sites they frequent (monasteries, water collection points, local markets, community centers).
      Draw on women’s full participation in (i) capacity needs assessment/delivery, (ii) planning and
      operationalizing preparedness measures, and (iii) warning dissemination and evacuations.
      Train women to use mobile phones to increase their ability to respond to emergencies.
	 3.	 Provide women, girls, and boys with life-skills training, such as swimming, rowing, climbing,
      and martial arts, that contribute to enhancing security.
	 4.	 Facilitate women’s leadership and develop their capacity to participate in formal decision-
      making in response and recovery so that their needs, interests, and perspectives shape
      recovery and development plans. Ensure a minimum representation rate for women of 30
      percent in these decision-making mechanisms.

MYANMAR POST-DISASTER NEEDS ASSESSMENT
OF FLOODS AND LANDSLIDES JULY–SEPTEMBER 2015



                      Long-term needs relate to services supporting women’s care work; employment and
                      livelihoods for women; infrastructure; and support services to survivors of sexual and
                      gender-based violence.

                      	 1.	Provide child care services through public-private partnerships and state-run initiatives;
                            support women’s social enterprises/collectives that provide care work that could employ
                            women; free up time for poor women to earn incomes; invest in public goods/services (such
                            as safe and time-saving domestic appliances, and  clean/accessible energy, water, sanitation,
                            and transportation) that reduce time spent on care work); and raise public awareness of men’s
                            shared responsibility for care work to help divide it more equally (K 3,900 million).
                      	 2.	 Adopt policies/programs that expand women’s livelihoods and are not wholly agriculture-
                            dependent. Recovery should target women-owned businesses, especially home-based and
                            microenterprises with compensatory packages to cover losses/damages. Longer term, it is
                            important to provide women with sector-specific business mentoring/marketing skills to help
                            their businesses expand, while taking account of the particular constraints they face.
                      	 3.	 Provide agriculture extension services to women on crop production and livestock management,
                            combined with training of female extension workers to ensure women’s access to these
                            services (K 1,000 million).
                      	 4.	Provide women with nontraditional job-skills training, including in energy, transportation,
                            WASH, and construction, and encourage women’s enrollment in education in these sectors (K
                            2,600 million).
                      	 5.	 Establish one-stop centers in all states/regions to provide tailored legal aid, sexual and
                            reproductive health services, psychosocial support, and hotlines to protect women from
                            violence.

SECTOR ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY

This chapter is anchored in secondary and primary data sources, in particular “Agriculture and
Livelihood Flood Impact Assessment in Myanmar” (by the Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO]
and the World Food Programme [WFP], 2015).

Baseline information came from the Myanmar Population and Housing Census 2014, Agriculture
Census 2010, “Gender Equality and Women’s Rights in Myanmar: A Situation Analysis” (by MSWRR,
United Nations, and Asian Development Bank (forthcoming), and “Gender and Agriculture Review”
(by FAO and UN Women, forthcoming).

Secondary information on disaster impacts on women was based on “Multi-Cluster/Sector Rapid
Assessment Report—Myanmar Floods and Cyclone Response” (by UNOCHA, September 2015);
sector assessment reports, including “Agriculture and Livelihood Flood Impact Assessment in
Myanmar”; the World Bank Social Impact Assessment; the gender-based violence assessment in
Chin State by United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA); government updates; loss/damage costing
data as part of the Post-Flood and -Landslide Needs Assessment; data from Myanmar government
departments and ministries (including Department of Social Welfare and RRD under MSWRR, the
Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation, and the Ministry of Livestock, Fisheries and Rural Development);
specific information from the World Bank and UN agencies (UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF, FAO, Myanmar
Information Management Unit, OCHA, and WFP); and the Gender Needs Assessment and project
reports of NGOs (Gender Equality Network, Chin Human Rights Organization, Action Aid, Care,
Oxfam, and PACT).

Primary data were collected through the following means:

	   •	 Key informant interviews and focus group discussions in the six worst-affected states/regions
       (19 townships and 38 villages), including Ayeyarwady (Ingapu, Ngathaingchaung, Yekyi); Bago
       (Monyo, Tharrawaddy, Waw); Chin (Falam); Magway (Sidoktaya, Pwint Phyu, Aunglan, Hakha);
       eastern Rakhine (Minbya, Mrauk-U, Kyauktaw); northern Rakhine (Buthitaung, Maungdaw);
       and Sagaing (Kawlin, Kantbalu, Kalay). Interviews were conducted with government officials
       and male and female market vendors. Focus group discussions were conducted with men and
       women (316 of each) via the Agriculture and Livelihood Flood Impact Assessment.
	   •	 Focus group discussions with 60 women in eastern Rakhine (in three townships and two
       villages), conducted by UN Women.
	   •	 Focus group discussions with 128 women in four states and regions in eight townships,
       including Chin (Matupi, Rezua), Magway (Sidoktaya, Pwint Phyu), Sagaing (Kawlin, Kantbalu),
       Rakhine (Myauk-U, Myinpya), and 16 villages. Discussions were part of Gender Equality
       Network’s Gender Needs Assessment; further discussions were held with the Gender Equality
       Network enumerators.
	   •	 Key informant interviews with project staff from UNDP, UNFPA, Action Aid, Care, Chin Human
       Rights Organization, Gender Equality Network, Gender and Development Institute, Oxfam,
       and PACT working in sites such as Rakhine, Sagaing, Magway, and Chin.

SUMMARY

While appreciable damages and losses were not reported for the environment sector, it is recognized
that environmental degradation played a role in the 2015 floods and landslides, contributing to
damages and losses in other sectors. Going forward, these drivers will continue to contribute to
disaster risks. In order to manage these drivers and thereby reduce disaster risks, the following
priorities were identified: (i) in the short term, ensure reconstruction efforts do not exacerbate future
disaster risks; (ii) in the medium term, assess and strengthen capacity for environmental and land
governance, through adopting policies and procedures, and through strengthening institutional
capacity at all levels; and (iii) in the long term, promote ecosystem-based approaches to disaster risk
reduction.


PRE-DISASTER CONTEXT

Myanmar is located at the intersection of three different ecoregions: the Sino-Himalayan region in
the north, the Indochinese region in the east, and the Malayan Peninsular region in the south. As
a consequence, the country includes several ecological and climatic zones and contains diverse
aquatic and terrestrial habitats and species. The four main rivers—Ayeyarwady, Chindwin, Sittaung,
and Thanlwin—flow from north to south over a large area of the country and, along with large wetland
areas and lakes, support extensive freshwater ecosystems. Beaches and dunes occur along most of
Myanmar’s extensive coastline, with coral reefs and seagrass beds featuring in the Myeik Archipalago,
and estuaries and mud flats in the Ayeyarwady delta.

Myanmar has some of the most ecologically intact forests remaining in the Southeast Asia region.
About 43 percent (or about 29 million ha) of the country is covered by natural forest, half of which
is closed (i.e., in good condition) forest and the other half open (i.e., degraded) forest. The country’s
rich natural forest resources include evergreen forests in the southern part of the country, deciduous
dipterocarp forests and thorn scrub in the central part, and subalpine forests in the north. In addition,
Myanmar has the fourth-largest area of mangroves in Asia, which covered an estimated area of
467,330 ha (or 1.47 percent of Myanmar’s total forest area) in 2010, mostly on the Ayeyarwady
floodplains, but also in Tanintharyi and a small area of Rakhine.

Between 2010 and 2015, Myanmar is estimated to have lost about 546,000 ha of forest, or 1.7
percent of the 2010 forest area, representing the third-largest loss of forest area in the world during
this period, behind only Brazil and Indonesia. This is in addition to the estimated 7.4 million ha (about
20 percent) of forest lost during the previous two decades (1990–2010). During the last five years, the
proportion of closed forest in total forest area has declined significantly.  

Myanmar’s forest cover comprises several classifications of forest land, which signify different levels of
legal protection. The largest category is Permanent Forest Estate (PFE), which is divided into
	 •	 Reserved forests, intended for multiple purposes, for both conservation and sustainable forest
       use
	 •	 Protected public forests, intended primarily for conservation purposes, although some logging
       is permitted
	 •	 Protected areas, including national parks, nature and wildlife reserves, and other conservation
       areas, where no use is permitted except for conservation purposes

A second category is Non-Permanent Forest Estates, including public forests and so-called
wastelands.

Management of PFE is the responsibility of the Ministry of Environmental Conservation and Forestry
(MOECAF), Forest Department (FD). Although the PFE currently covers approximately 24 percent

                                                                                                             157
MYANMAR POST-DISASTER NEEDS ASSESSMENT
OF FLOODS AND LANDSLIDES JULY–SEPTEMBER 2015



                  of total land area, the target is to expand this to 30 percent. This target will likely be difficult to
                  achieve, however, given the limited effective protection and significant demand for land for various
                  uses. As a result of significant past and continuing encroachment, including for large-scale agriculture
                  development in particular, much of the land classified as reserved forest is de facto in other land uses.
                  Protected public forests tend to be better demarcated and relatively less susceptible to encroachment.
                  There are currently 34 protected areas, but these are not adequately representative of the country’s
                  diverse ecology and biodiversity; moreover, the designation offers limited effective protection, as
                  these areas are generally understaffed and undermanaged. Public forests (aka unclassified forests)
                  are not gazetted or classified as PFE but fall under the Forest Law and are the responsibility of the
                  MOECAF, FD.

                  The main contributors to loss and degradation of forest area are conversion for large-scale agriculture
                  and mining; dam development for irrigation and hydropower; overexploitation of timber, including
                  from illegal logging and exceeding annual allowable cut limits; shifting cultivation in upland areas; and
                  a heavy reliance on wood as the primary energy source, particularly for cooking and heating, in rural
                  areas.

                  Public forests, along with so-called wastelands, are under significant conversion pressure for
                  agriculture and other development, including mining. Under the Vacant, Fallow and Virgin Land Law
                  (2012), “virgin” land is defined as any land that has not been previously cultivated (including forest
                  lands that are not gazetted or reserved), and “vacant and fallow” land is defined as land that had
                  been cultivated and consequently abandoned (including shrub land and secondary forests in shifting
                  cultivation areas). The Central Committee for the Management of Vacant, Fallow and Virgin Lands, an
                  interministerial committee chaired by the minister of the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation (MOAI),
                  may make a request to MOECAF to use “virgin” land for agriculture development purposes. The
                  committee also oversees the granting and monitoring of use rights over vacant, fallow, and virgin
                  lands for agriculture, mining, and other allowable purposes under the Vacant, Fallow and Virgin Land
                  Law.

                  Dam development is also an important driver of deforestation, as large areas of forest are often
                  submerged by reservoirs. In support of agricultural development and power generation, dams and
                  reservoirs are being constructed at a rapid rate in Myanmar. To date, the MOAI has constructed
                  over 371 dams and has plans for many more. A significant number of the dams (about 67, or 18
                  percent) do not yet have associated canals and irrigation infrastructure. Moreover, only a fraction
                  of the watersheds above these dams are being actively managed, since MOECAF FD has limited
                  resources allocated for watershed management.

                  Logging, both legal and illegal, also contributes to deforestation. The Myanmar Selection System, a
                  silvicultural system that is in principle well suited for use in complex multispecies forests, focuses on
                  selective extraction of mature trees while protecting immature stock. The system defines the annual
                  allowable cut—that is, the size and number of trees that can be extracted per year. In practice,
                  however, Myanmar’s forest management system has not been implemented as intended; the annual
                  allowable cut is often not strictly applied, and the result has been systematic overexploitation.

                  A key driver of illegal logging is demand from the wood-processing industries in China, Vietnam, and
                  Thailand. While these countries have strict logging controls in their own natural forests, they have
                  continued to source raw materials, often illegally, from Myanmar, which still has stocks of valuable
                  species, notably teak and rosewood. In April 2014, Myanmar enacted a log export ban in an effort
                  to slow the rate of forest loss. Nonetheless, significant illegal cross-border trade has continued.
                  More recently, bilateral discussions between Myanmar and China resulted in the China State Forest
                  Administration putting in place a temporary log import ban (September 1 to December 31 2015) to
                  give some time for an assessment of the situation.

                  Shifting cultivation by smallholder farmers is common in public forests. If practiced on a sufficient
                  rotational basis, shifting cultivation is sustainable and compatible with management of natural forests.
                  However, as upland populations grow and traditional lands are lost to other uses, fallow periods have

shortened. As a result, shifting cultivation has spread into new forest land, and degraded areas with
reduced regeneration potential have increased.

Given relatively limited access to electricity, from both on-grid and off-grid sources, both rural and
urban households are heavily dependent on biomass energy, which contributes more than 60 percent
of the total energy consumption and is used by more than 70 percent of the population. Wood is the
largest source of biomass energy, and households are heavily dependent on fuelwood and charcoal,
particularly for cooking. It is estimated that the total annual fuelwood demand is about 20 million
cubic tons,115 which puts tremendous pressure on forests. To help meet this demand, the FD has
started to establish designated village supply plantations in degraded reserved forests and protected
public forests.

Like other forests, mangroves have long been exploited for charcoal and firewood for cooking, and
they are under intense pressure due both to overexploitation to conversion of growing areas to
other uses, particularly agricultural expansion and conversion to fish ponds and shrimp ponds. In
Ayeyarwady Region in particular, mangroves have been degraded because of overexploitation to
meet the demand for fuelwood from the large population nearby. Given lower population density and
a more sheltered coastal landscape in Rakhine State and Tanintharyi Region, mangroves in these
areas are under less intense pressure.

Myanmar enacted the Environment Conservation Law in 2012 and adopted the related implementing
regulations the following year. MOECAF is responsible for coordinating implementation of this law
and also has specific regulatory responsibilities for developing and implementing environmental
management systems. MOECAF’s Environmental Conservation Department (ECD) is responsible for
Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (EIA) of private investments issuing environmental
compliance certification through the Myanmar Investment Commission. Recently ECD finalized the
drafting of new environment impact assessment procedures, which broaden the requirement for
EIA to also cover public investment. The EIA procedures are under review by the cabinet and are
expected to be in place soon. Nonetheless, ECD has limited capacity to implement the new EIA and
regulations, and requires more staff and significant capacity building to be able to fulfill its expanded
mandate.


POST-DISASTER SITUATION

Effects on natural environment and environmental management and governance. MOECAF
reported that overall, the 2015 floods and landslides caused minimal damage to or losses of natural
forests, protected areas, or wildlife. In most of the affected areas, the extent of the impact was
within the natural system’s ability to recover in the short term, and system stability was not adversely
affected. In the areas affected by landslides, particularly in Chin State, there were localized severe
effects from which recovery will take longer, and significant resources will be needed to plan, design,
and put in place structural and biological measures to stabilize slopes.

While disasters can affect institutions responsible for environmental management and governance,
MOECAF reported that such effects were limited as a result of the recent floods and landslides.
Damage to physical resources, including MOECAF infrastructure, vehicles, equipment, data-
gathering systems, and data records, were relatively minor and were reported and accounted for
under the agriculture sector. MOECAF further reported that staff capacity in the affected areas was
not disrupted appreciably.

In post-disaster settings, there may be pressure on the environmental ministries not to enforce
environmental regulations in an attempt to help speed recovery. In the aftermath of the recent floods
and landslides, there will be significant demand both for timber for reconstruction of houses and other

MYANMAR POST-DISASTER NEEDS ASSESSMENT

                  structures, and for fuelwood for production of housing materials (e.g., bricks). Also, under normal
                  circumstances, rural populations rely heavily on wood as a fuel source for cooking and heating. The
                  floods and landslides have displaced significant numbers of people, and these people will need to
                  source fuelwood from other areas than their location. MOECAF FD is aware of the need to monitor
                  the situation to ensure that the geographic shift of fuelwood demand does not adversely affected
                  PFE, particularly protected public forests and protected areas.

                  In post-disaster settings, there also may be impacts associated with reconstruction and repair to
                  damaged infrastructure if done without appropriate environmental controls. In the case of Myanmar,
                  environmental controls are still weak. As noted above, revised environment impact assessment
                  procedures are still under review by the cabinet and not yet in effect. Without appropriate environmental
                  review and controls, there is a risk that the reconstruction work could cause unintended impacts on
                  the environment. For example, in the case of demolition and reconstruction of damaged infrastructure,
                  it will be important to give sufficient attention to appropriate sourcing of construction materials. Also,
                  careful planning and implementation will be needed for disposal of debris and rubble, including early
                  identification of suitable disposal sites accessible from affected areas, and for disposal  of landslide
                  materials (either on site or off site).   

                  Effects on risks and vulnerabilities. Environmental degradation can aggravate the effects of natural
                  hazards, and thereby act as an environmental driver of disaster risks. Changes in land cover and land
                  uses, which affect the ability of water to infiltrate and be stored in the soil column for slow release, are
                  known to increase runoff, and thereby exacerbate soil erosion and flooding.

                  Land-use and land-cover changes can affect flood risks as well as seasonal water availability. Alterations
                  in catchment surface characteristics (e.g., land cover and land uses that compact soil or otherwise
                  limit soil’s permeability and capacity to store water) can modify the physical characteristics of river
                  floods.  The reduction in forests and wetland areas, for example, means that these ecosystems will
                  play a smaller role in buffering flood events. The role of mangroves in dampening the effects of coastal
                  storms, wind, and tidal surges on coastal lands and nearby infrastructure is also well-recognized; thus
                  damage to mangroves can result in increased coastal flooding. Moreover, changes in land use are
                  known to influence the scale and extent of erosion. For example, the loss and degradation of forest
                  areas affects the velocity and intensity of runoff and thereby increases the amount of soil erosion and
                  sedimentation. Mine tailings also increase sedimentation of reservoirs and rivers.

                  The sediment load in a river system is influenced by the amount of natural and human-influenced
                  erosion in the river basin, as well as by construction of dams and reservoirs that trap sediment
                  upstream. Sediment load contributes significantly to the river’s physical, chemical, and biological
                  characteristics, including navigability, water and habitat quality, conveyance capacity, and flood risk.
                  In Myanmar, a 2011 study concluded that changes in land use over time in the Ayeyarwady basin
                  have affected the hydrology of the basin, which in turn has influenced the sediment load and flux.116
                  The study further concluded that changes in water flow and sediment flux in the river in both wet and
                  dry seasons can have significant implications for seasonal water availability and flood risks. Sediment-
                  related flood damages can be significant. In the 2015 floods, extensive overbank deposition of coarse
                  sediments caused significant damage to farmland, residential property, and public infrastructure.


                  RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION STRATEGY

                  The extent of the devastation caused by the 2015 multi-hazard disaster, and a growing awareness
                  of how underlying environmental factors contribute to disaster-related damages and losses in key
                  sectors, present a significant opportunity to address within the recovery strategy some long-standing
                  issues related to managing the environment and natural resources—and in this way reduce disaster
                  risks in future. The proposed strategy focuses on three strategic elements within three different time
                  frames:
                  116
                        Win (2011).

	   •	 Short term (within four months): Ensure reconstruction efforts do not exacerbate future disaster
       risks.
	   •	 Medium term (within one year): Assess and strengthen capacity for environmental and land
       governance, through adopting policies and procedures and strengthening institutional capacity
       at all levels.
	   •	 Long term (more than two years): Promote ecosystem-based approaches to disaster risk
       reduction.


RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION PLAN

To achieve these objectives, the following priority work areas are proposed.

Ensuring appropriate siting for waste disposal and sourcing of reconstruction materials.
During the reconstruction period, MOECAF should provide guidance to affected states/regions
and townships on (i) criteria for appropriate siting for disposal of demolition rubble, construction
debris, and sediment; and (ii) environmental screening for sourcing of reconstruction materials that is
compatible with disaster risk management.

Deriving environment-related lessons for disaster risk reduction. An ex post systematic
environmental assessment in the disaster-affected areas should be conducted. By providing
information on the relationship between environmental degradation and disaster risks and how
environmental management can contribute to disaster risk management, this assessment will offer
important lessons for future disasters.

Strengthening environmental and land governance. This would include (i) approval of the draft
EIA procedures, capacity assessment of the procedures, implementation of the new procedures, as
well as increased staffing and budget for effective implementation of the EIA system; and (ii) approval
of draft National Land Use Policy, and undertaking a land governance assessment.

Promoting ecosystem-based approaches to disaster risk reduction. Sustainable natural
resource management can be a significant contributor to a disaster risk reduction strategy, since
healthy and diverse ecosystems are more resilient to hazards. Improved land-use planning and
management would help to proactively use ecosystems as disaster-reduction measures. Improving
and maintaining good land cover and soil integrity would increase infiltration and allow water to
be stored in the soil column, thereby slowing runoff and decreasing risks of flood and sediment-
related damages and losses. For example, restoring or preserving forests and wetlands can lower
potential flood risks. Forests provide shelterbelts and windbreaks and stabilize soil and reduce soil
erosion. Wetlands are a natural sponge and capable of absorbing floodwaters; research has found
that maintaining a relatively small area of wetlands can reduce peak stream flows by a significant
amount compared with no wetlands.

Work in this area would include (i) rationalizing the legal framework for land management; (ii)
strengthening coastal and wetland (including mangrove) management; (iii) strengthening forest
exploitation and management and watershed management; (iv) conducting strategic environmental
assessments of key sectors, especially large-scale agriculture, mining, infrastructure, and dam
development programs; and (v) introducing measures to reduce current overreliance on fuelwood,
including more efficient stoves, increased energy access (from both grid and nongrid renewable
sources), and increased use of biofuels.

Table 58 presents the prioritization, sequencing, and costing of recovery activities to be implemented
under each of the work areas described above.

IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY AND ARRANGEMENTS FOR RECOVERY

The MOECAF FD and ECD are the central departments for the environment-related recovery effort,
but MOAI is also a key player. On land, the FD acts as the Secretariat for the National Land Resource
Management Committee, and it has coordinated the recent work on the National Land Use Policy
with other key agencies, including MOAI. Going forward, FD will continue to have a key coordinating
role with the Attorney General’s Office in drafting the proposed umbrella Land Law and will also be
involved in the proposed land governance assessment.

ECD has the lead role in strategic environmental assessments in key sectors, as well as in
implementation of the new EIA procedures (which are expected to be approved soon).

The National Electrification Program will expand access to electricity from on-grid and off-grid sources
and so contribute significantly to reducing reliance on fuelwood; but the program will take decades to
roll out to the entire country. In the interim, the FD has a continuing role to play in village plantations.
The MOAI also has a key role in promoting the use of agro-waste for fuel (direct combustion) as well
as biofuels.


SECTOR ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY

No field visits or surveys were conducted for the environment sector assessment. The chapter was
based on detailed face-to-face consultations with MOECAF, ECD, and FD; with Myanmar Forestry
Association; and with individual experts and advisors. In addition, available reports were consulted
as references.

Disaster Risk Management
SUMMARY

The floods and landslides caused destruction of public and private infrastructure, including
houses, railways, roads, bridges, schools, health facilities, and monasteries, with extensive
impacts on the agriculture and other sectors. Strengthened disaster risk management (DRM)
systems will play a critical role in coordinating and informing the resilient recovery and reconstruction
of Myanmar, and in preventing future such disasters in the country. In order to manage risks in this
multi-hazard environment, the government needs to strengthen its capacity to understand, assess,
and anticipate future disasters, and it also needs to improve both physical and financial preparedness
systems. The following priorities will help to achieve these goals: (i) public awareness and community
engagement through community-based DRM, (ii) strengthened risk assessment and risk information
systems, (iii) development of DRM financing instruments, (iv) strengthened disaster risk governance
and mainstreaming of DRM, and (v) enhanced disaster preparedness.


PRE-DISASTER CONTEXT

DRM institutional arrangements. A positive impact of Cyclone Nargis was that it increased
government’s awareness of the need to plan and prepare for future disasters, and of the need for
prevention, mitigation, and community awareness activities.117 At the national level, the National
Natural Disaster Management Committee (NNDMC) is the apex body for disaster management in
the country. It has the authority to formulate disaster management policies, issue guidelines, and
activate working committees.118 These committees are dormant in normal times, and get activated
by the NNDMC, on a case-by-case and needs basis, to respond to medium to large disasters. At
the subnational level, interdepartmental disaster management committees are chaired respectively
by the chief minister at state/region level, the district commissioner at district level, and the township
administrator at township level. These subnational committees are also typically activated only after a
disaster has happened. The Relief and Resettlement Department (RRD) under the Ministry of Social
Welfare, Relief and Resettlement (MSWRR) is responsible for the coordination of DRM activities in
the country.119 However, although RRD has the mandate for DRM,120 limited financial121 and human
resources, combined with lack of interministerial convening power and limited presence below state/
region level,122 make it challenging for the department to perform these wide-ranging responsibilities
and coordinate and influence the work of a number of line ministries.

DRM legal arrangements. In 2009, the government issued Standing Order on Disaster Management,
which outlined the roles of each ministry before, during, and after a disaster to increase preparedness
and response capacity. In 2013, the government enacted the Disaster Management Law and the
supporting Disaster Management Rules were issued in July 2015. The Disaster Management Rules
require all ministries and administrative units to prepare standing orders and disaster management
plans in order to promote systematic and effective risk reduction as well as preparedness and
response. At the time of the floods and landslides, however, the Rules had not yet been disseminated;
accordingly enforcement and application of both the Law and Rules were weak.

    The Disaster Management Law (2013) and the Natural Disaster Management Law – Rules and Regulations (2015) describe
the mandate and responsibilities of the different institutions involved in DRM. See Annex 5 for further details.
119
    The RRD acts in its capacity as Secretariat of the NNDMC.
120
    See the Natural Disaster Management Law, Rules and Regulations, Chapter IV.
121
    According to UNICEF’s calculations based on the BOOST database and union budget, MSWRR’s budget has fluctuated
between US$15 million and US$16 million in the last two years (0.07–0.08 percent of the union’s budget), with RRD absorbing
around 31 percent of the ministry’s budget.
122
    RRD’s institutional footprint reaches down only to the state/region level and to a limited number of districts and townships
identified as high risk.

                  DRM financing. The budget for RRD, which is meant to have the responsibility for coordinating
                  DRM, is very small (Table 59). There has not been an assessment of all DRM expenditures throughout
                  the government.

                  Note: -- = not available. The budget for RRD is not a fully adequate proxy for the DRM sector budget, given that it omits important
                  infrastructure and other investments that build disaster resilience. However, the government of Myanmar does not have a DRM financial
                  tracking system and currently uses the total budgets of RRD, the Fire Services Department, and the Emergency Reserve Fund as a
                  proxy for DRM spending in the Hyogo Framework for Action reporting system. The Emergency Reserve Fund, however, is spent on relief
                  operations only if a national disaster is declared and should not be accounted as DRM spending.



                  The Disaster Management Law and Rules have provisions for a Disaster Management Fund that
                  would finance disaster-related activities at national and subnational level.123 The fund has only recently
                  been activated,124 so it has not had an impact on response activities or risk reduction activities to
                  date. The budget reserve fund (or President’s Reserve Fund) is allocated at the union level under
                  the Union Budget Law and can be accessed by ministries and states/regions with the approval
                  of the cabinet for urgent and priority needs, including (but not limited to) disaster response. The
                  allocation to the fund is K 100 billion and is replenished every year. Myanmar does not currently have
                  a strategy or policy in place to systematically manage the financial impact of natural disasters. Overall,
                  limited budgetary provision is made, and preliminary analysis suggests that current disaster funds are
                  insufficient to cover even recurrent losses. The government remains exposed to extreme events, and
                  relies heavily on international donor assistance for response, relief, and recovery.

                  Hazard monitoring and warning dissemination. The Department of Meteorology and Hydrology
                  (DMH) is the National Hydro-Meteorological Service of Myanmar and responsible for monitoring,
                  forecasting, and warning for severe weather and hydrological and tsunami events. In addition,
                  various departments (such as the Irrigation and Agriculture departments in the Ministry of Agriculture
                  and Irrigation) have their own observation stations. However, there is no data sharing among these
                  agencies, and the numbers of observation stations are well below World Meteorological Organization
                  recommendations for all types of observation.

                  With the above limitations, at present DMH is able to provide good general forecasts (daily, 3-day,
                  10-day, monthly, and seasonal). However, it is unable to meet the specific requirements of many of
                  its stakeholders or to provide accurate forecasting of rainfall intensity in the remote catchment areas
                  (a failing that impacts dam safety and irrigation networks). As a consequence, DMH’s capacity to
                  detect and forecast flash floods and riverine floods is limited. A modernization process is under way
                  to strengthen the system.

                  The National Multi-Hazard Early Warning Center, established in July 2006 and operated by DMH, is
                  responsible for issuance of early warning for hydrometeorological, geological, and maritime-related
                  hazards to all public authorities and stakeholders. In addition, the NNDMC is supported by the
                  Emergency Operation Center (EOC) with real-time hazard information collected from regional and
                  global networks.




                  123
                     The fund is chaired by the deputy minister of finance; the secretary is the permanent secretary of MSWRR.
                  124
                     As of the time this report was prepared, the regulations for the use of the fund had been drafted but had yet to be shared
                  or discussed with stakeholders.

When flood danger levels are reached, DMH collects rainfall and river-level data much more often,
and issues hourly forecasts. These forecasts and flood warnings are shared with the media and state/
region governments, which in turn disseminate downward using administrative channels. Recent
developments in telecommunications in Myanmar, in particular the increased mobile coverage, also
help communities to promptly receive the early warning from different information sources. However,
communities residing in the most remote areas remain hard to reach through traditional warning
dissemination systems as well as new technologies.

Risk assessment capacity. DMH provides meteorological, hydrological, and seismological
information to authorities from the transport, health, agriculture, construction, and tourism sectors
to assist in development planning; but this is limited to single-hazard maps for floods and tsunamis.
A hazard profile of Myanmar was developed in 2009 based on the historical data.125 Professional
societies such as the Myanmar Geo-Sciences Society and Myanmar Engineering Society have
developed hazard-specific maps (earthquake, landslides) for various spatial scales. Over the past
few years a number of geographically targeted and hazard-specific assessments were undertaken
with the support of development partners.126  However, these efforts have remained fragmented and
have lacked a comparable methodology. Other layers of risk assessment data, in particular exposure
and vulnerability data, are lacking or outdated. Historical hazard data are also incomplete, although
RRD is establishing a National Disaster Damage and Loss Database.127 RRD is also in the process of
finalizing a road map that establishes a common vision and objectives for a national risk assessment
and that identifies the steps, roles and responsibilities, and resources that will be needed to develop
a national risk atlas within the next five years.128


POST-DISASTER SITUATION

Emergency operations, relief. The National Disaster Management Committee started search-and-
rescue and emergency relief operations in late July. On July 31, the president declared Chin and
Rakhine States and Magway and Sagaing Regions to be natural disaster zones. The National Natural
Disaster Management Working Committee (NNDMWC) took the lead in emergency coordination,
communication, and relief-item distribution; it also took the lead in facilitating the inflow of international
assistance (cash and in-kind) and in conducting immediate needs assessments. The NNDMWC was
supported by the EOC, which was established under the Relief and Resettlement Department in
mid-2014 to provide situational awareness and support emergency operations. Regional bodies
(ASEAN-ERAT), UN agencies, international organizations, and Red Cross staff were also deployed
at the EOC to provide technical support, primarily in the areas of logistics and ICT (information and
communication technology) systems, intragovernmental coordination, and information management
and reporting. Although the EOC greatly contributed to the response efforts, there is a need to
adapt its systems to the country context and to further strengthen the capacity of its staff. The EOC
indeed faced several challenges, such as difficult communication with authorities at the state/region
level, lack of standardized data collection formats, and limited information management and reporting
capacity.

With help from international agencies, the EOC was able to produce six situation reports that
provided key information on the identified needs and ongoing response efforts. Other information
management products, however, had to be deprioritized because of human resource constraints.
In spite of the presence of international partners in the EOC, the linkages between the national
institutional framework and the international humanitarian community were limited, in particular at
the sectoral level. This was mainly because the subcommittees under the NNDMC were never fully

                    while the subcommittees are based in Nay Pyi Taw. There is a need to strengthen the role of the EOC
                    in bringing together line ministries, subcommittees, and international sectors and clusters to increase
                    the effectiveness of the response. An overview of the response and recovery coordination structure

                    Emergency coordination at the subnational level was led by respective local governments, using
                    varying models (see Box 2) and achieving different levels of effectiveness. Overall, there was a
                    recognized vertical coordination gap between the national and the subnational levels, as well as a
                    horizontal gap among the different branches of local government in affected townships. These gaps
                    affected the allocation of emergency funds and relief items; some areas received a higher level of
                    support in spite of being relatively less affected. In addition to government, civil society organizations
                    and the private sector actively participated in the emergency operations and provided relief materials;
                    there was a broad mobilization of the public under the slogan “Save Myanmar.”


  Box 2.
  State/region-         A rapid qualitative survey was carried out by the Disaster Risk Reduction Working Group (DRR
  and township-         WG) in five affected townships. The results indicated that response and recovery activities at
  level response        the state/region level varied significantly from one area to another. For instance, Chin State
                        established a state-level 10-member Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Committee, chaired by
                        the chief minister, to lead relief efforts, while Ayeyarwady focused on the township level, and
                        the regional government took a supporting role. In terms of early warning, some townships
                        reported receiving information well before the flood event (e.g., Hintada Township); others
                        were given very little notice, undermining their preparedness efforts (e.g., Kalay Township).
                        A few townships reportedly relied on information received through social media (e.g., Hakha
                        Township), while others struggled to share the information down to the village level due to
                        disrupted communication services (e.g., Kalay). Almost all townships reported having disaster
                        management plans and committees, but the content of those plans was not always adapted
                        to the local risk profile, nor were the committees formally activated in most places. Previous
                        disaster experience, timely early warning, investment in mitigation, and presence of safe
                        shelters have been identified by the assessed townships as critical elements in the disaster
                        management system performance at the local level. All assessed townships identified the need
                        to increase investment in disaster mitigation, awareness-raising, and capacity development.

Transition from relief to recovery. The government of Myanmar transitioned rapidly from the relief
to the recovery phase in line with international standards. In order to effectively manage the recovery
planning and implementation process, the NNDMC constituted the Recovery Coordination Committee
(RCC) under the leadership of the Ministry of Construction. Recovery coordination centers were also
opened in Yangon, Mandalay, and Nay Pyi Taw, although the extent to which these centers were
effective in coordinating subnational recovery efforts remains unclear (Figure 40). As a first step, the
RCC was tasked with collection of detailed loss and damage data. However the RCC faced a number
of challenges in collecting reliable data in a timely manner, compiling and analyzing these data, and
facilitating a multi-sectoral and bottom-up recovery planning process.

The RCC is in the early stage of its establishment. It is now supported by a newly established Advisory
Group, composed of experienced sector specialists, for the purpose of recovery planning. This Post-
Flood and -Landslide Needs Assessment (PFLNA) is also meant to support the recovery planning
process, and in the coming weeks the RCC-led sectoral plans should be combined with PFLNA
recovery needs to form a comprehensive recovery framework. The role of RCC is then expected
to become more prominent for coordinating recovery among the different actors, monitoring
implementation, and communicating progress to key stakeholders, including the donor community. In
this regard, there is an urgent need for the RCC to have a stronger institutional structure and capacity
at both union and subnational levels. In addition, the recovery capacity and coordination mechanism
of the NNDMC should be strengthened for future disasters. This includes building the capacity of RCC
in post-disaster needs assessments, recovery planning and programming, institutional arrangements
and coordination, resource mobilization and communication, and monitoring, in order to ensure a
well-planned recovery in the future.

Disaster response financing. By August 9, when the affected population exceeded 1 million
people, the government had mobilized K 488 million for response and received about the same
amount in cash assistance from international partners. By October 5, a combined contribution of over
K 187 billion had been committed to response activities, according to the government of Myanmar
and the UN Financial Tracking Service. In total, the government has allocated K 42.2 billion from the
President’s Reserve Fund, K 6.5 billion from the national government, and K 22.3 billion from state/
region governments, as well as contributions from private sector and civil society. The government of
Myanmar has been promised K 22.8 billion from international partners, although much of this amount
has yet to be received. The government appears to have faced challenges in mobilizing funding
necessary to meet the extensive needs of the impacts of the floods and has limited budget flexibility,
especially as the government goes into an election in early November. While the government was able
to draw on the President’s Reserve Fund for emergency funding, there remain concerns that regular

                    budget lines in line ministries have been diverted toward recovery and reconstruction activities, and
                    away from sectoral development activities. The absence of insurance coverage in the country has
                    placed extra burden on the government to support households in recovering from the floods.


                    ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE EFFECTS AND THE IMPACT OF THE
                    DISASTER ON THE SECTOR

                    Damages to DRM systems were negligible—amounting to K 0.27 million—and included
                    only a few damages to the Department of Meteorology and Hydrology’s office buildings
                    and equipment. Losses were calculated based on the budget allocated to relief activities, as well
                    as materials and food provided throughout the disaster that were not accounted for in other sectors.
                    Losses also do not include the cost associated with search and rescue, which amounted to almost
                    K 24 billion. It is important to note that two members of the search and rescue teams operated by
                    the Fire Services Department lost their lives during the disaster, highlighting the need for increased
                    investment in relief workers’ health and safety. The geographic distribution of damage and losses is
                    provided in Table 60.

                    RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION STRATEGY

                    Despite the devastation that was caused by the multi-hazard disaster, the event presents
                    many opportunities to learn and reinvigorate DRM systems in the country. The current
                    context also presents a key opportunity for resilient recovery, as highlighted in each of the sectoral
                    chapters. The present strategy focuses on strengthening the DRM system itself according to the
                    following strategic objectives:

                    	    •	 Short term (within four months): Strengthen the understanding of the disaster event (including
                            the performance of the DRM system at all levels) and capitalize on increased awareness
                            to operationalize key DRM policies and instruments (Disaster Management Rules, Disaster
                            Management Fund, etc.).
                    	    •	 Medium term (within one year): Strengthen institutional capacity for disaster risk management
                            at all levels through improved risk assessment systems, comprehensive and inclusive
                            DRM policies, capacity development for policy implementation, and enhanced community
                            engagement in DRM.

	   •	 Long term (within five years): Integrate disaster and climate risk management into national
       development planning and budgeting and scale up DRM implementation at all levels.

In order to achieve these overall objectives, the following five priority work streams are proposed,
each of which is associated with a specific gap or need.

	1.	
   Awareness raising and community engagement through community-based DRM.
   Communities’ awareness of disaster risk is low, undermining their capacity to prepare for,
   mitigate the impacts of, and respond to the next disaster. Public awareness and education
   initiatives have had limited coverage and impact at the grassroots level. Furthermore,
   community-based DRM activities are typically driven by external agencies, resulting in issues
   of scale and sustainability. A more comprehensive, strategic, and sustained investment in
   both public awareness of and community participation in DRM is therefore required to build
   resilience at the grassroots level, with a particular focus on reaching vulnerable groups and
   linking community resilience efforts to the formal DRM structures.

   Strengthening risk assessment and risk information systems. There is no comprehensive
	2.	
   national risk assessment in Myanmar; and although early warning and forecasting capacity
   has improved substantially in the last decade, it requires further strengthening and increased
   investment. With rapid telecommunication changes, Myanmar can take advantage of newly
   affordable technologies to improve the collection, management, and applications of risk data
   and information.

   DRM financing and financial protection. A disaster management fund has been established;
	3.	
   however, it is not yet clear how the resources will be mobilized. Myanmar does not currently
   have a strategy or policy in place to systematically manage the financial impact of natural
   disasters. The government has a unique opportunity to design new financing instruments that
   are able to effectively address post-disaster funding needs—from emergency response to
   long-term reconstruction—for events of different frequency and severity.

   Strengthening disaster risk governance and mainstreaming. Based on learning from the
	4.	
   floods and landslides, there is a need to streamline and strengthen institutional arrangements
   for DRM at both union and subnational levels. This will be particularly important for the RCC
   in the short to medium term, given their role in monitoring the implementation and progress of
   recovery activities throughout the country. The flood and landslides also provide an opportunity
   to review and/or operationalize key DRM policies and to develop disaster management plans
   in all sectors and at all levels, as called for in the Disaster Management Rules. Developing
   the institutional structure and incentives required to integrate DRM into the government’s
   budgeting and development planning process should also be considered.

	5.	Enhancing disaster preparedness. Disaster preparedness and response capacity and
    coordination have room for improvement. An assessment of the preparedness and response
    performance of the government in the recent disaster will provide the foundation for renewed
    investment in disaster preparedness, with a focus on the following: updating and/or developing
    standing orders and contingency plans in all sectors and at all levels, strengthening the role
    and capacity of the EOC, improving key emergency response functions (search and rescue,
    logistics, ICT, information management), and improving the safety of frontline relief workers.
    The opening of the National Disaster Management Training Center also provides an opportunity
    to improve capacity in preparedness and response at all levels. Finally, continuous investment
    is required in an end-to-end early warning system, building on opportunities created by the rise
    of new technologies.

RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION IMPLEMENTATION

This PFLNA and the following national recovery strategy will likely inform key strategic documents
and plans in the coming years. For example, because the Disaster Management Rules were adopted
and the Disaster Management Fund was established just before the disaster, their operationalization
may still be able to take advantage of lessons learned from the recent disaster and associated
recommendations.

At the same time, the Myanmar Action Plan for Disaster Risk Reduction (MAPDRR) is due for an
update. MAPDRR lays out a list of activities to implement the priorities of the Hyogo Framework
for Action. The new MAPDRR consultations have already started, and the proposal is to structure
the new plan on the successor to the Hyogo Framework: the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk
Reduction, which was adopted in March 2015. This action plan may also benefit from these recent
experiences and analysis.

Financing for resilient recovery and development will be critical for these activities. The government
will benefit if it is able to demonstrate a results-based approach that is transparent and fair, reaching
down to the local communities and benefitting those households that need it the most.


SECTOR ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY

This analysis was based on detailed consultations with the following government departments:
MWSRR, Relief and Resettlement Department, Emergency Operations Center, Ministry of Transport,
Department of Meteorology and Hydrology, Fire Services Department, and Myanmar Red Cross
Society.

Damage data were collected from DMH, while data on relief spending were gathered from a database
at MSWRR that was being used to inform the writing of the situation reports. This information was
being faxed from all ministries to MSWRR. A rapid qualitative survey was carried out by the Myanmar
Disaster Risk Reduction Working Group in five affected townships to assess the impacts of the floods
and get some preliminary feedback on performance during the floods.

OF FLOODS AND LANDSLIDES JULY–SEPTEMBER 2015




                      Macroeconomic Impact
                      SUMMARY

                      From a macroeconomic perspective, the floods and landslides are estimated to have
                      caused K 1,080,573 million of production losses to the economy for 2015/2016, or about 1.7
                      percent of last year’s GDP. In value-added terms, the economic loss is estimated at K 609,265
                      million, equivalent to around 1 percent of 2014/2015 GDP. GDP growth could drop by 0.8 percentage
                      points in 2015/2016 if recovery efforts are not undertaken. This impact is driven by the effect of
                      the floods on crop and fisheries production. Crops alone account for over 20 percent of GDP in
                      Myanmar, and are therefore a strategic sector of the economy. In addition, the current account deficit
                      is expected to increase to above 8 percent of GDP, and the fiscal deficit is projected at just under 5
                      percent of GDP. In the medium term, the economy is expected to bounce back with strong recovery
                      in the agriculture sector.


                      PRE-DISASTER CONTEXT

                      Myanmar grew at an estimated 8.5 percent in real terms in 2014/2015. Economic reforms have
                      supported consumer and investor confidence despite ongoing challenges in the business environment
                      and sociopolitical issues. Public consumption and private investment on the demand side, and the
                      services sector on the production side, were the main drivers of growth. Agricultural output picked
                      up in 2014/2015 after two years of sluggish growth (Figure 41). Output in manufacturing and industry
                      has been strong thanks to gas in particular and growing investment in light manufacturing.

                      The pre-floods growth prospects remained strong for 2015/2016 (and over the medium term), though
                      they were tempered by some slowdown in investments this fiscal year. Private investments have
                      grown very rapidly since 2011, expanding by more than 20 percent in real terms over the past two
                      years. Some moderation is therefore to be expected, particularly when also factoring in the possibility

Inflationary pressures have been strong over the course of 2014/2015 (7.5 percent year on year)
and first half of 2015/2016 (Figure 41). Part of this trend was due to very rapid growth in private
sector credit (36 percent in 2014/2015), which contributed to a rapid expansion in overall money
supply. General government consumption also grew rapidly (around 30 percent in nominal terms in
2014/2015) to meet large public service delivery needs.

These factors contributed to growing external pressures, including a rising current account deficit
(6.3 percent of GDP in 2014/2015) and strong downward pressure on the exchange rate (25 percent
nominal depreciation against the U.S. dollar in the 12 months to August 2015). At the same time, the
current account deficit in 2014/2015 was largely driven by foreign investment–related imports. While
investment-related imports are expected to have slowed down in the first half of 2015/2016, exports
are also expected to have slowed down, so a wide trade deficit will be maintained.


POST-DISASTER SITUATION

Economic losses due to the floods. The economic impact of the floods, as measured by damage
to physical assets and loss in production flows, is estimated at K 2.06 trillion, which is close to 3.3
percent of 2014/2015 GDP. Total production losses are estimated at K 1.08 trillion (1.71 percent of
2014/2015 GDP), whereas damages are around K 913 billion (1.4 percent of 2014/2015 GDP). This
is not an insignificant disaster impact when compared to other floods in the world in the early 2000s.
On the other hand, recent floods in Bosnia and Herzegovina (2014) were estimated to have caused
damages worth 15 percent of GDP, and losses close to 5.6 percent of GDP. The 2011 floods in
Thailand caused around 11 percent of GDP in damage and losses. Figures for other countries that
have experienced significant floods since 2000 are shown in Figure 42.

MYANMAR POST-DISASTER NEEDS ASSESSMENT
OF FLOODS AND LANDSLIDES JULY–SEPTEMBER 2015



                    While the economic impacts of the 2015 floods are less than those of Cyclone Nargis in 2008 (Table
                    62), they are also geographically more widespread, with 12 out of 14 states and regions affected.
                    Economic losses during Nargis were concentrated in the Ayeyarwady and Yangon Regions. This
                    had an impact on the economy as a whole, given that these are two important growth centers
                    in the country. Most of the losses were concentrated in industry and commerce. The economic
                    losses resulting from the 2015 floods, on the other hand, are less concentrated geographically.
                    This distribution of losses poses its own challenges for economic recovery, as reconstruction and
                    rehabilitation efforts will have to be spread across a bigger part of the country.

                    Aside from the wide geographic coverage, the floods have also hit major agricultural areas. This
                    includes regions like Sagaing, Magway, Ayeyarwady, and Bago, which together account for a large
                    share of the national production of crops, which account for around three-quarters of agriculture
                    value added. Areas like Bago, which accounted for 11 percent of national agriculture output in
                    2014/2015, are particularly badly affected, with around 24 percent of total agricultural losses from
                    the floods (Figure 43). Similarly Ayeyarwady, which accounted for around 16 percent of national
                    agriculture output in 2014/2015, suffered around 23 percent of total agricultural losses.

Impact on GDP. The floods are estimated to have had a significant impact on GDP in 2015/2016.
The production losses are estimated to reach K 1,081 billion, which translates into K 609.2 billion in
value-added losses. After taking into account relief expenditures, which add to GDP, the total disaster-
induced losses are estimated at K 571 billion, which is equivalent to 0.9 percent of 2014/2015 GDP
(Table 63). In terms of 2015/2016 projected growth, the disaster impact could reduce GDP growth
by up to 0.8 percentage points, before factoring in reconstruction and recovery effort. Reconstruction
and rehabilitation works aimed at restoring damaged assets would of course reduce the negative
growth impact. A 50 percent replacement of damaged private assets in non-agriculture sectors could
lessen growth reduction to 0.6 percentage points.

Eighty-two percent of the value-added losses come from the agriculture sector. The crop subsector
contributes to around 48 percent of value-added losses, which is due mostly due to reduced yield
in all affected areas. Although replanting has already started in some regions, the expected yield
in these areas will quite likely be lower due to the delay in sowing and the lack of good agricultural
practices (see agriculture sector assessment). The second-biggest losses in terms of value addition
were incurred by the livestock and fishery sector (33 percent); losses occurred mostly in freshwater
fishing due to the loss of almost 30,000 ha of fish and shrimp ponds. The losses in the agriculture
sector also affected the commerce and industry sector, particularly food processing sectors through
the disruption in the availability of raw agricultural materials.

The magnitude of production losses in terms of GDP is more significant in some states and regions
than in others (Figure 44). There are five states/regions whose losses-to-GDP ratio are higher than the
national ratio, namely Sagaing, Chin, Ayeyarwady, Bago, and Rakhine. The remaining three states/
regions that also incurred significant production losses are Mon, Mandalay, and Magway.

                     Although GDP growth is expected to bounce back rapidly in 2016/2017, it is difficult to estimate the
                     extent to which the economy will begin recovering in 2015/2016. Replanting has already started,
                     but the likelihood of offsetting agriculture production losses in 2015/2016 may not be very high due
                     to the timing of the monsoon harvest and the quality of seeds. Reconstruction and rehabilitation
                     works aimed at restoring damaged assets would reduce the negative growth impact. A 50 percent
                     replacement of damaged private assets in nonagriculture sectors could lessen growth reduction to
                     0.6 percentage points. Experience from other countries suggests that while the short-term impact of
                     floods can be quite severe, growth tends to bounce back rapidly over the medium term (Figure 45).

Inflation. Inflationary pressures are expected to pick up as a result of the floods, and inflation is
projected to average over 11 percent over the course of 2015/2016 (or above 12 percent year-on-
year by end March 2015/2016). Inflation in the 12 months ending July 2015 is estimated at over 10
percent. The price of food items, which accounts for 68 percent of Myanmar’s consumer price index
basket, is expected to have picked up sharply in August. The prices of staples such as rice, beans,
and pulses in particular have reportedly jumped as a result of supply pressures caused by the floods.

Rice prices tend to be quite volatile, dropping in the period after the major paddy harvest, which
usually takes place in November-December every year. However, this year it is still unclear whether the
monsoon paddy will be able to recover the losses from the floods. Even if losses are not recovered,
Myanmar is expected to produce sufficient rice for export. The price of rice is mainly influenced by
two factors: export prices in the cross-border rice trade (largely with China) and domestic demand/
consumption. The government needs to balance these two factors, and develop appropriate export
and import policies and a rice stock policy to protect against disasters. The Ministry of Commerce is
already aware of this. Advised by the Myanmar Rice Federation, the ministry took steps in August to
impose a temporary export ban on rice. After carefully monitoring rice prices, it lifted the ban once
farm-gate prices started falling (when the harvest season for short-lived varieties began).

Inflationary pressures are likely to be further compounded by increased cost of imports, particularly
processed foods and other necessities coming from China and Thailand in particular. Without
adequate external support, foreign reserves and the exchange rate could be under further pressure,
contributing to even higher inflation.

Balance of payments. The floods are expected to lead to a slowdown in agricultural exports and
further widen the current account deficit, which is projected to increase to around 8 percent of
GDP. Agriculture exports in recent years accounted for around a quarter of all merchandise exports.
The moratorium on rice exports imposed over the summer (until October 15), together with lower
production due to losses, will negatively affect overall export growth. This is likely to be compounded
by a more challenging external environment, dominated by the slowdown in China. China accounts
for around 40 percent of Myanmar’s exports, which are mostly natural resources, including gems. The
recent decline in gem sales may be a symptom of falling demand in China.

Investment-related imports are expected to have slowed down in the first half of 2015/2016, though
this trend would be to some extent offset by demand for humanitarian and reconstruction-related
needs. Some of these will be financed by external aid and concessional financing. However, the
decline in foreign investment flows is likely to lead to a slowdown in the accumulation of foreign
exchange reserves. This will put added pressure on Myanmar’s overall external position and the
exchange rate.

Fiscal policy. Public expenditure on humanitarian and reconstruction-related activities resulting from
the floods will pick up. However, the government is still expected to maintain the general government
budget deficit at below 5 percent of GDP in 2015/2016. It will do so for several reasons. Revenue
tends to be underestimated in the budget. Ongoing reforms to tax administration and to tax collection
from the service and manufacturing sectors should enable the government to meet its 2015/2016
revenue target even with any impact from the floods, which will affect mostly the agriculture sector.
If the government collects 10 percent above what was planned, which is not unlikely, it could cover
the costs of nearly all damages (though recovery will not be possible to implement in one year) and
maintain the general government deficit within 5 percent of GDP. One important risk to this outlook
is the potential impact of international commodity prices on Myanmar’s gas receipts. A sustained
decline would require important spending adjustments even assuming steady growth in output. At the
same time, the drop in gas prices could also be offset by the positive impact of currency depreciation
on kyat-denominated earnings.

                  Employment and Livelihoods Impact
                  SUMMARY

                  The 2015 floods and landslides dealt a serious and pervasive blow to the livelihoods of millions in
                  12 states/regions. The floods displaced at least 1.6 million people and may have adversely affected
                  up to 5.4 million people. They also brought significant economic losses and damages to many local
                  economies across different agro-ecological zones. Given that six of the most affected regions (Chin,
                  Rakhine, Magway, Ayeyarwady, Sagaing, and Mandalay) were home to approximately 60 percent of
                  the entire labor force, the effects of the flood could be devastating and further jeopardize the national
                  economy. It is expected that at least 9.4 million workdays will be lost, along with K 21,133.1 million in
                  personal wage income. Since the adverse effects of the floods are disproportionately felt among the
                  most vulnerable sectors of Myanmar society, labor-intensive recovery strategies and social protection
                  measures should be deployed immediately to restore economic continuity and livelihood losses in the
                  flood-affected areas.


                  POST-DISASTER CONTEXT AND ESTIMATION OF DAMAGES AND LOSSES

                  Assumptions. As with the estimation of the impact of flood on employment in agriculture, several
                  assumptions were made in the calculation of employment and livelihood losses in commerce and
                  industry. To calculate the total workdays lost in commerce and industry sectors, the information on
                  the number of firms, the number of workers, annual sales, and value of fixed assets for every state
                  and region were gathered from the business census of the United Nations Development Programme
                  for 2014. Subsequently, the percentage of firms affected per state/region, average stopping time,
                  and average reduction of workers were extracted from the quick assessment of the commerce
                  and industry sector. In the areas where the data are missing, we assumed that the percentage of
                  damaged housing in a given area can be used as a proxy to estimate the percentage of affected firms
182
                                                                                               ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL IMPACTS




in that area. For wage information in the agricultural sector, in light of the absence of information on
sector-specific and region-specific wages for 2015, we used the information from the Livelihoods and
Food Security Trust (LIFT) household survey on average rural wages in three agro-ecological zones
for 2013. For commerce and industry, regional agricultural wages were weighted by 1.5 to reflect
higher wages in the commerce and industry sectors. To account for the effects on livelihood and
employment of the decline in raw materials due to the flood, the ratio of value loss from stoppage
and value loss from decline per state/region was used to produce a weight to estimate the personal
income loss and employment loss due to the decline in raw agricultural materials and consequent
effect on the commerce and industry sector.

Agriculture. It is estimated that 7.2 million workdays will be lost in the agriculture sector, resulting
in personal income loss of K 14,647.8 million over the next year in this sector. This will have a
singularly pronounced effect on the livelihood of casual agricultural workers, given that the six most-
affected regions/states account for approximately 80 percent of all casual labor, and that casual labor
accounts for more than 65 percent of the rural agricultural labor market in Myanmar. Thus casual
workers—the most vulnerable segment of the labor market, with extremely limited access to social
protection—will likely incur a large proportion of losses. The flood also poses a major threat to the
livelihood of small landholders with substantive damages to their shelters and farmlands, who have
become vulnerable to casualization of their labor for livelihood, and to that of workers in aquafarms,
especially in the dry zone and delta region, where damage to aquaculture was severe (approximately
67 percent of aquafarms were destroyed in Bago, and 40 percent were destroyed in Ayeyarwady).

A majority of female workers in the agricultural sector are employed as “own account workers” and
“unpaid family workers.” Given their fragile socioeconomic conditions, characterized by gendered
employment segregation and wage gap in agricultural work, lack of social protection, and lack of
access to secure land tenure, female-headed agricultural households and female agriculture workers
are particularly vulnerable in the affected areas.


                                                                                                                     183
MYANMAR POST-DISASTER NEEDS ASSESSMENT

                  It is expected that the flood will increase rural-urban migration from the affected areas to nearby urban
                  centers such as Yangon and Mandalay. With at least 1.6 million displaced people and 5.4 million
                  affected people, the flood-induced exodus will have the effect of increasing the composition of casual
                  labor in the urban sector. More importantly, since casual workers in the urban sector are subject to
                  the risks and vulnerabilities associated with urban slums (unsanitary living conditions, irregularity of
                  income, and absence of social protection mechanisms), this influx of migrant laborers could further
                  strain scarce resources available to slum dwellers for coping with shocks and emergencies.

                  Commerce and industry. It is estimated that as a result of the floods, 1.6 million workdays were
                  lost in the industry subsector and 0.57 million workdays were lost in the commerce subsector. These
                  losses in employment have resulted in personal wage income losses of K 3.7 million and K 1.37
                  million in industry and commerce respectively.

                  It is important to highlight that in the most-affected regions/states, the average share of commerce
                  and industry in total employment is conspicuously lower than that of agriculture; the total share of
                  manufacturing, construction, and retail typically is less than 10 percent of total employment in these
                  six most-affected regions/states. However, the effects of flood in the commerce and industry sector
                  will be more acutely felt among female employees, because of the higher percentage of women
                  working in manufacturing and retail sectors in most of the affected regions and states.

                  It is common for casual workers in agriculture as well as in commerce and industry to borrow money
                  with high interest to finance consumption. In the post-flood credit-constrained environment, these
                  casual workers are in grave danger of being caught in a high-interest perverse loan circle and ultimately
                  trapped in deep poverty. Owners of small and medium enterprises in the most-affected areas are also
                  vulnerable in the credit-constrained environment if they seek to resuscitate their businesses. In Pwint
                  Phyu, one of the most affected townships in the country, all 40 enterprises included in the rapid
                  assessment surveys were temporarily suspended, and 65 percent of these enterprises claimed that
                  their access to finance had been affected by the flood.


                  RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION STRATEGY AND PLAN

                  Short term. The key immediate recovery strategy is to provide income for basic needs and income-
                  generating opportunities so that farmers and owners of small and medium enterprises can rebuild
                  their livelihoods and return to their workplaces.

                  An immediate cash transfer program to the most vulnerable and affected groups, such as casual
                  workers and female-headed agricultural households, is required. The Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief
                  and Resettlement has already put in place a series of cash transfer programs in the affected areas.
                  The programs cover rice assistance, emergency food assistance, housing assistance, rehabilitation
                  assistance, and compensation for death and have a total value of K 591.53 million. Given the
                  magnitude of the floods and their large effect on the labor market, the cash transfer programs should
                  also cover employment protection and salary disbursement for the flood-affected workers in the
                  formal sector. Cash transfer programs as well as food transfer programs should be based on an
                  employment scheme for rehabilitation, reconstruction, and development of disaster adaptation and
                  mitigation activities, including flood protection, water harvesting, soil improvement, and watershed
                  management within individual regions. Large cash transfer programs need to be piloted to ensure
                  transparency and accountability.

                  Labor-intensive strategies are also an important element in a short-term recovery plan because they
                  can generate rural employment and restore rural infrastructure in affected areas. Cash-for-work
                  programs offer a particularly effective policy platform for implementing this strategy. According to figures
                  from the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security (MOLES) on post-flood reemployment
                  in affected areas, a total of 6,210 unemployed workers were able to regain their employment for

construction work in the reconstruction projects and for the fisheries sector. However, there is a
geographic imbalance in the current regeneration of post-flood employment, since Sagaing Region
accounts for approximately 69 percent of all reported reemployment. A short-term reemployment
scheme should be reviewed and implemented to ensure inclusivity, transparency, and accountability.
The participation of the community as community contractors should be encouraged in the restoration
of rural infrastructure.

As part of the short-term recovery strategy for the agricultural sector, cash/voucher transfers for inputs
and government subsidies for inputs will be crucial; they will help to revitalize the agricultural sector
and allow it to reabsorb the labor losses due to the flood. Given the severe credit constraint in the
rural sector, an extension of rural credit and a moratorium on credit payment should be implemented
to offer farmers and rural enterprises an opportunity to overcome the binding constraint of finance
in their production. Because the labor demand for construction will increase in the aftermath of
the flood, vocational training programs for specific skills (such as construction and welding) are
crucial for generating employment opportunities for those affected by the flood. MOLES has already
implemented a series of measures to provide vocational training in the most-affected areas.

The ministry has designed a program to offer high-frequency training on carpentry, brick masonry,
and ironwork in places such as Haka and Kalay in Chin State. With the collaboration of the Ministry
of Construction and other relevant line ministries, MOLES will act as a focal ministry in designing and
implementing training programs for elementary skills required in rural roadwork and reconstruction.
The ministry plans to send mobile training teams, in conjunction with existing vocational training
programs, to affected areas to train people in carpentry, masonry, electrical work, and bricklaying. It
is critical that these multi-sectoral programs address both short-term needs (generating employment
for affected workers) and long-term recovery needs (generating enterprises in affected areas). The
International Labour Organization is well positioned to offer technical assistance on these important
initiatives.

In the short term, employment facilitation centers, building on the existing structure of labor exchange
offices under MOLES, should be set up to facilitate the job search process for workers in affected
areas.

The recovery efforts should take into account the existing gender and social inequalities in the labor
market. It is important to ensure the participation of women and other marginalized minorities in
vocational training and skill development. Further, sensitivity and awareness of important labor
issues—such as forced labor, child labor, and occupational safety and health—need to be integrated
into the employment and livelihood recovery programs. Implementation of these programs should
also embed enforcement of international labor standards and minimum wage practices.

Medium and Long term. Consistent with the government of Myanmar’s initiative on fiscal
decentralization, regional and state governments should play an important role in the design and
implementation of labor policies and social protection measures for recovery. Large-scale recovery
and reconstruction efforts are likely to stimulate local economies in both the short and long term. The
government should ensure that recovery financing would strengthen the fiscal and physical capacity
of the local governments, while also funneling the benefits of the recovery boom to generate local
enterprises and employment. In the long term, the possibility of labor employment guarantee scheme
should be reviewed to ensure employment and livelihood for casual workers in the rural sector.

New-skills development should be consistent with the principles of building back better. For example,
in construction/infrastructure work, the objective is to not reconstruct the damaged infrastructure to
its pre-disaster form; it is to build better and more resilient infrastructure while also developing new
skills for the labor force involved in the process of the reconstruction.

                  In the long term, the role and capacities of labor exchange offices should be strengthened to offer
                  employment facilitation services at the local level. It is therefore important to support and strengthen
                  the existing infrastructure—specifically the national employment database—to minimize the search
                  cost for workers.

                  To ensure that an influx of rural migrants to urban centers does not add further strain to urban
                  livelihoods in the slums, the government should devise and design adequate social protection
                  measures for the most vulnerable groups in the urban slums and should also provide vocational
                  training and skill development programs for migrant workers. Existing urban planning and urban
                  structure should be reviewed to accommodate the expansion of urban livelihoods within the slums.

                  METHODOLOGY
                  The damage and loss estimates for the employment and livelihood sector are based on a multitude
                  of assumptions and extrapolations from limited data sources and are used to inform recovery policies
                  and programs in the sector. The methodology for estimating the effect of flood on employment is
                  as follow. Average workday per acre per crop (for agriculture) and average workday per acre (for
                  aquaculture) were estimated using the information from the Integrated Households Living Condition
                  Assessment (2010). Using the information on damaged and destroyed acreages per types of crop in
                  Myanmar, workdays lost per crop were estimated. For destroyed crops, the information of nonfamily
                  labor needed for one crop season was used to estimate the agricultural workday per acre, whereas
                  nonfamily labor needed for half a crop season was used to estimate average workday per acre for
                  damaged acreages.

                   Poverty, Social Impact, and Social Protection
                   SUMMARY

                   The floods and landslides are affecting a population that even before the disaster struck
                   was more likely to be poor than the rest of Myanmar’s population.133 The floods took place
                   predominantly in rural villages. Half of the most-affected 40 townships are in the two poorest states
                   in Myanmar: Rakhine and Chin. The most severely affected areas had a 50 percent higher poverty
                   incidence than the national average in 2009–2010.134 These areas also have high elderly and child
                   dependency rates, and affected households are more likely to have less resilient housing. There is
                   great disparity in housing stock in Myanmar; poorer households have lower-quality stock and are more
                   vulnerable to damages. The full poverty and social impacts of the floods will take time to unfold and
                   will depend on the nature of the flood response. Understanding the social and economic structures of
                   villages in rural Myanmar can guide external actors, including government and development partners,
                   in how communities will react to damage and how best to support recovery.


                   POST-DISASTER SITUATION

                   Up to 5.2 million people were exposed to the floods and landslides in the 40 most heavily
                   affected townships. An estimated 1.6 million individuals were recorded as having been temporarily
                   displaced from their homes by the disaster, and 132 lost their lives. Within the 40 most-affected
                   townships, 775,810 individuals have been displaced, representing approximately half of the total
                   displaced population (Table 65).

                   The most severely flood-affected areas had a 50 percent higher poverty incidence than
                   the national average in 2009–2010.135 The floods took place predominantly in rural villages; the
                   townships most severely affected have less than 19 percent of the population living in urban areas.
                   Those most affected by the disaster were worse off in 2009–2010 and in 2014 than those either
                   less affected or unaffected. Half of the 40 most-affected townships are in the two poorest states in

These most severely affected areas have high elderly and child dependency rates (Table
66). Households with a larger share of children are more likely to have been among the bottom 40
percent—that is, among the two lowest quintiles—of the welfare distribution prior to the disaster.
School costs compared to labor income are an important factor in children’s failure to complete
school; declines in income may place children at risk of dropping out.

                   Affected households are more likely than others to have less resilient housing. There is
                   great disparity in housing stock in Myanmar; poorer households have lower-quality stock
                   and are more vulnerable to damages. Households in these townships are more likely to have
                   roofs made of more permeable and easily damaged dhani, theke, and leaves. The likely result is that
                   the poorer households will have far greater damage to housing as a consequence of the disaster.
                   Among the bottom 40 percent of the welfare distribution in the most-affected areas, only 24 percent
                   of households have resilient roofing.

                   The majority of the population in flood-affected areas relies on agriculture. According to data
                   from the Integrated Households Living Condition Assessment-2 (IHLCA-2), 52 percent of those in
                   the economically active population in the most severely affected areas work in agriculture (Table 67).
                   This share is similar to the national average. A further 4 percent work in fisheries. Farming patterns
                   and types of crops produced vary significantly. Across agro-ecological zones, however, farmers face
                   ongoing vulnerability because of low profitability, and they tend to rely on credit to finance agricultural
                   production. The result is heavy debt burdens, a lack of steady labor, and limited income-generating
                   opportunities.

                   These households face routine risks associated with weather-related events. One in three
                   households engaged in agriculture had reported at least one flood or storm that negatively affected
                   production in the five years prior to the IHLCA survey. The highest incidence was in Ayeyarwady and
                   Rakhine, where (respectively) 40 percent and 23 percent of agricultural households suffered from an
                   average 50 percent crop loss due to flooding.

                   Rural households are increasingly attempting to diversify income sources. There is increasing
                   migration of family members, predominantly to find work as unskilled laborers in Yangon. Recent
                   years have also seen more investment in rural nonfarm businesses to provide a secondary source of
                   income, although the nature and extent of these small enterprises vary significantly by location.

                   Villages have traditionally been relatively self-reliant and socially cohesive. Villages have a
                   tradition of collective action. This has played a crucial role in responding to previous natural disasters,
                   including Cyclone Nargis (2008) and Cyclone Giri (2010). Formal village leaders, informal elders, and
                   religious institutions all play an influential role in managing village affairs.

                   As result of recent trends, people in rural villages have wider social networks than in the
                   past. These trends include increased government services at the local level, mobile phone penetration
                   across much of the country, and increased migration of predominantly young family members to
                   urban areas.

                   A minority of townships in flood-affected areas have experienced conflict and communal
                   tension, complicating the social risk of the flood response. In a quarter of the 40 most-affected
                   townships, residents have experienced some form of conflict in recent years. This includes several
                   townships in northern Rakhine, and a smaller number in Chin and Shan States. The delivery of
                   assistance in these areas will need to be sensitive to conflict dynamics to avoid exacerbating tensions.

PRELIMINARY IMPACT ANALYSIS

Crop losses have been significant. The floods damaged crop production in all states and regions;
this damage is affecting those engaged in cultivation as well as landless laborers. Assessments
indicate that floods affected almost 9 percent of cultivated land in the six most-affected states, though
with significant variation both across regions and within regions.

Small and medium farmers and casual laborers—a population already at risk of not meeting
basic minimum needs—were particularly affected. In the most-affected areas, 54 percent of
those in the bottom 40 percent of the welfare distribution work in agriculture, and a further 5 percent
work in fisheries. Small farmers will be burdened by loans taken to plant a monsoon harvest with
little return, and it will be difficult for many to invest in a winter crop. The loss of the monsoon harvest
will reduce labor opportunities at harvest time in late 2015, and casual laborers will face greater
competition from farmers for nonfarm casual labor.136 The worst-off households—those in the bottom
40 percent—are also far more likely to be working as casual laborers.

The impact on fisheries was felt by subsistence fishermen across a number of regions
and by commercial fishermen, mainly in Rakhine. There will be a need, primarily in Rakhine,
for capital to rebuild damaged embankments and restock fish and prawn farms. The floods also
harmed small-scale and subsistence fishermen by damaging boats and nets. Even prior to the floods,
subsistence fishermen had been identified as a particularly vulnerable socioeconomic group.137

Women-headed households appear to have suffered disproportionate housing losses
and higher immediate post-disaster costs. Women-headed households tend to have less
sturdy houses and experienced more significant damage to their houses. In one village visited by
research teams, for example, houses of all eight women-headed households were destroyed. These
households reported having to pay casual laborers to help with the cleanup after the floods, a cost
not borne by other households that could draw on male labor.

The cumulative impacts of livelihood degradation and increased indebtedness are likely to
worsen over the medium term, and include a risk of increased food insecurity. The effects
on livelihoods described above are cumulative over time and are highly like to result in significant
problems for villagers in early 2016 and beyond. Potential risks due to cumulative pressure on
livelihood include high levels of food insecurity, high debt levels, and a range of negative coping
strategies in response to these pressures. Some examples of extremely high interest rates were
already beginning to emerge. One villager, for example, described paying interest of K 500 per day on
a loan of K 10,000 taken following the floods.

Food insecurity risks have longer-term consequences for young children and babies in
utero. As the implications of the floods and landslide for food production and insecurity become
clearer, it will be important to protect young children and babies in utero from the longer-term
consequences of a nutritional deficit. For more details see Annex 6 and Table 68).

                  The effects of the flooding on livelihoods are likely to be regressive, with poorer households
                  struggling more than wealthier ones. As the negative effects on livelihoods accumulate, it is
                  those households least able to withstand economic shocks that will be hurt the most. Poor landless
                  households that are dependent on labor will not have access to agricultural jobs. Small farmers, also
                  a vulnerable economic group, have few assets apart from their land and are therefore ill equipped to
                  deal with the economic shock that will emerge in early to mid-2016, when the lack of harvest begins
                  to take its toll on savings and food stocks.

                  Land and resettlement. There will be a need to relocate at least 4,500 households in Chin
                  State and Sagaing Region. According to the National Natural Disaster Management Committee
                  (in October), this figure includes 2,987 houses destroyed by landslides in Chin State and over 1,600
                  houses destroyed by flooding in Kalay Township, Sagaing. Relocation will require identification and
                  selection of land not exposed to landslide hazards, as well as negotiations relating to meeting the
                  costs of relocation. It will also require informing affected communities about relocation and ensuring
                  that they can participate in decision making. Finally, it will require developing relocation plans that
                  consider access to basic services and livelihoods. In some cases, careful consideration of land
                  ownership issues will be necessary, although, in some instances, for example in Chin, relocation is
                  expected to occur on government land. Land allocation mechanisms will also need to be equitable to
                  ensure that the poor and vulnerable are not disadvantaged in identifying new land.

                  The damage in Chin differs from that in other regions. Chin was affected by a number of
                  landslides, and the damage they caused will have longer-term impacts than damage in other areas.
                  It is estimated that 4,000 people are still residing in internally displaced person (IDP) camps due to
                  destruction of housing.138 There has been widespread damage to infrastructure, with approximately
                  500 instances of damage to local roads and bridges.139 The lack of access to townships and markets,
                  along with the more complex nature of rebuilding infrastructure in remote areas, is likely to have
                  significant ongoing livelihood impacts, including aggravating food shortages already common in rural
                  Chin.

                  Some areas face more permanent damage to agricultural land. Approximately 2,154 hectares
                  of agricultural land were destroyed by landslides across six townships in Chin State.140 Some land in
                  other regions will require rehabilitation from sand and sediment debris. Managing these land issues is
                  also likely to have implications for social relations of affected communities.

                  Household coping strategies. Households are employing a range of strategies to cope with
                  the floods. The Agriculture and Livelihood Flood Impact Assessment141 conducted in Ayeyarwady,
                  Bago, Chin, Magway, Rakhine, and Sagaing reports various coping patterns (see Figure 47). However,
                  some of these coping strategies are negative: they reduce assets and undermine the recovery over
                  the longer term. See Annex 6 for more detail.

Households face a risk of increasing indebtedness from already high levels. A third of all
households and half of agricultural households were overindebted prior to the floods.142
During the qualitative assessment, farmers indicated relying increasingly on informal credit sources
and in some cases were borrowing at high interest rates (~10 percent per month) to pay existing low-
interest (1–2 percent per month) loans. Respondents also expressed concern that their repayment
challenges will likely worsen over time, as the lack of harvest income takes its toll on savings and
payment of the principal comes due in December/January.

Households report borrowing for food, eating cheaper food, and eating less food, all of
which may undermine health and well-being. In the areas affected by the floods, households
were already more likely to borrow to meet basic food needs. One in 10 households in affected
areas had a loan to meet basic food needs in 2009–2010. The Agriculture and Livelihood Flood
Impact Assessment found that up to 75 percent of villages reported using a variety of food-based
coping mechanisms.143 Twice as many women as men reported reducing their food intake and eating
smaller portions. For example, respondents told field researchers that they omitted the curry in their
meals and ate just rice and chili.

There are risks of additional negative coping strategies in the medium term. The field research
found no current indications that withdrawing children from school was a widespread problem, though
parents highlighted the difficulties of meeting the costs associated with sending children to secondary
school. As food security risks become more severe, however, additional school withdrawals are likely.
Migration as a flood response has been limited to areas where improved opportunities are clear and
village networks exist, but this response will potentially increase as job opportunities in the winter crop
season fail to materialize.

Over time, the compounded impacts of livelihood degradation, indebtedness, and negative
coping strategies are likely to weaken the ability of households to cope with subsequent
external shocks. Households struggling to meet their basic minimum needs have been coping
through channels that are likely to reinforce a cycle of poverty.

    Overindebtedness is measured in terms of a ratio of debt to asset value (Schicks and Rosenberg 2011; Khandker, Faruqee,
and Samad 2013). Households are regarded as overindebted if their debt-to-asset ratio is equal to or larger than 0.4. The
calculation includes only assets that can be liquidized easily. These figures come from analysis of IHLCA-2 data.

                  Community coping mechanisms and social relations. In the immediate aftermath of
                  the floods, community structures played a pivotal role in helping communities to cope.
                  Warnings issued by township authorities through village leaders enabled communities to relocate
                  to safer locations. Early warning mechanisms appeared particularly effective in locations that had
                  had previous experience with natural disasters. In rural areas, religious buildings were generally the
                  primary point of relocation. Field research found that community groups quickly mobilized to facilitate
                  access to immediate food and nonfood aid and to ensure equal distribution of that assistance. The
                  importance of community coping mechanisms continued into the medium-term recovery period.

                  Affected people were starting to use mobile phones and social media to collectively
                  mobilize assistance. Improvements in telecommunications resulted in some noticeable changes
                  in how communities accessed immediate aid; for example, some local NGOs and volunteers within
                  communities set up Facebook or messaging groups to elicit donations. At the same time, the ability
                  to draw on advances in telecommunications varied greatly depending on access to networks. Thus
                  more remote communities had less ability to mobilize these forms of support. Communities’ access
                  to preexisting migrant networks also affected their ability to access aid, since these networks appear
                  to be the source of most private donations.

                  The impacts of the floods and landslides on social relations and cohesion are likely to
                  derive not from demographic changes, which have been few, but rather from livelihood
                  degradation and the nature of the flood response. The significant degradation of livelihoods
                  in highly affected areas is likely to have secondary, cumulative effects on poorer households and
                  vulnerable groups. Whether and how communities participate in decisions about aid is also likely to
                  affect social cohesion.

                  There are risks of social tension over perceived aid inequity. The experience of previous
                  disasters in Myanmar suggests that an influx of post-disaster aid can create social tension, especially
                  if community members feel left out of decision making and have perceptions of aid inequity.144 Field
                  researchers heard some complaints relating to aid distribution, particularly in heavily affected areas.
                  Respondents reported tensions between a village and religious leader over their respective role in the
                  distribution of aid, and complaints that better-off villagers were receiving food aid. Villagers reported
                  preferring that officials be offered the opportunity to participate in and influence how aid was delivered
                  to their communities.

                  The floods and landslides have had different impacts on men and women. Women and men
                  across the survey areas experienced high levels of stress. Women, however, were reported to show
                  particular emotional distress and sadness. The teams sent to affected areas by the Emergency
                  Operation Center of the Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement (MSWRR) found that
                  floods have had a psychological impact. A UN assessment in Rakhine also found that people living in
                  shelters began to use negative coping strategies, such as turning to alcohol, which could lead to an
                  increase in gender-based violence.

                  Aid effectiveness and village delivery mechanisms. At the request of township officials,
                  new village-level committees were created to distribute aid in the worst-affected areas.
                  These appear to be separate from existing village administration structures and, in the villages visited,
                  were heavily influenced by senior monks and village elders. Most non-NGO assistance was collected
                  and distributed by these committees. Where NGOs had preexisting activities in villages, they used
                  committees established through those activities.




                  144
                      This is the conclusion of Myanmar Social Impacts Monitoring, rounds 1 through 4 (TCG 2008, 2009, 2010; World Bank/
                  GDDRR 2014). These studies were conducted between 2008 and 2013. Three rounds of Post-Nargis Social Impacts
                  Monitoring accompanied the post-disaster recovery period from 2008 to 2010; the fourth round assessed the economic and
                  social life five years after Cyclone Nargis struck.

Villages demonstrated a tendency toward equal redistribution to the whole village of any
targeted aid. Village administrators justified this approach as a way to eliminate potential communal
tension. Vulnerable populations voiced some dissatisfaction with it, however. While they reported
understanding why the village distributed aid equally, they claimed it was unfair that rich farmers
were receiving the same level of food aid as more vulnerable households. Appropriate grievance
mechanisms will help to ensure that the voices of these villagers can be heard.

Women lack a formal role in aid governance, but can influence delivery through informal
means. In villages visited by the research team, women played no formal role in aid delivery. This
is consistent with findings from other research, though donor projects that explicitly require women
to take leadership positions—for example, on village development committees—constitute an
exception.145 There were signs of women having informal influence on aid, such as a woman in one
village who persuaded the village administrator that households missing on a village list be included
in aid distribution.


RELIEF AND RESPONSE PROGRAMS: SOCIAL PROTECTION

Myanmar seeks to improve “livelihoods of poor families and communities before disasters arise, by
smoothing consumption over the year to address seasonal or weather-related nutrition shortfalls, by
building the capacity to deliver cash benefits where needed, and by supporting public employment
programs that mitigate community risks to disasters.”146 This section outlines social protection
programs that currently exist in Myanmar, and it examines options for programs that can respond to
social protection needs following the floods while also entrenching a more systematic approach to
social protection issues.

Pre-flood social protection programs. At present, there is no comprehensive safety net for the
country, and few delivery mechanisms that could be used in the event of emergencies. Government
spending on social assistance is extremely low, at 0.02 percent of GDP. The main social assistance
programs include welfare programs and support for vulnerable groups from MSWRR and the stipends
program from the Ministry of Education (MOE), with new programs specified under the recently
endorsed Social Protection Strategic Plan (SPSP) and the Rural Development Strategic Framework
(RDSF). Development partners have provided social assistance to vulnerable populations in selected
areas, through unconditional food and cash transfers along with cash/food for work programs.147
However, Myanmar’s social protection programs and delivery systems are still underdeveloped,
requiring people to resort to informal coping mechanisms.

Nature of support offered by immediate relief and response programs. Government response
channeled through ministries and state/region governments so far amounts to K 28.8 billion.148 The
MSWRR Relief and Resettlement Department (RRD) has coordinated cash and in-kind support for
emergency relief and household assistance. Food assistance accounted for 59 percent of the total
support provided as of October 1, followed by cash (26 percent) and nonfood items (17 percent),149
but there are significant geographic variations in this distribution. The Ministry of Agriculture and
Irrigation and state and region governments have provided cash and in-kind support. The MSWRR
Department of Social Welfare (DSW) has coordinated psychosocial support and awareness raising
about protection issues in selected areas. Development partners have also focused on distribution of
food and essential nonfood items. The use of cash support has been limited so far, but it is expected
to become more prominent in the near future as part of early recovery activities. As of September,
food support had reached nearly half a million people;150 and development partners had also
provided displaced populations with nonfood items (see Annex 6). There was also an influx of private

                  contributions, including private donations and localized and informal responses from communities, as
                  noted above. Much of this assistance was donated directly to villages in affected areas. Local groups
                  provided clothes, water, food, and cash. Private donations have decreased considerably after the
                  initial period following the floods.

                  Geographic coverage. Response efforts have largely focused on the most-affected areas. There is
                  generally higher RRD spending in townships with a greater number of people affected. Ayeyarwady
                  has seen the highest government spending (24 percent), both in absolute terms and relative to
                  other regions/states, followed by Rakhine (15 percent), Bago (13 percent), Shan (11 percent), and
                  Kayin (10 percent).151 Support from development partners has primarily focused on severely affected
                  areas, such as Rakhine, Chin, Magway, and Sagaing, largely in locations where they operate. Taking
                  economic losses into account, additional geographical needs become apparent. For instance, 79
                  percent of all destroyed houses and 36 percent of direct economic losses are found in Rakhine
                  and Chin, but only 19 percent of government support has gone to these states.152 Government
                  is increasing support to these areas and including them as a priority in recovery programs; better
                  coordination with development partners could enhance coverage of underserved areas.

                  Remaining needs. Response efforts seem to be reaching most communities in need, but challenges
                  on coverage and duration of support remain. The Multi-Cluster/Sector Initial Rapid Assessment (MIRA)
                  shows that nearly all respondents (92–100 percent) reported receiving some sort of humanitarian
                  assistance in the areas surveyed.153 There is a general overlap between government and development
                  partner support, but some townships and some groups are being underserved (see Annex 6). For
                  instance, IDP needs in Chin camps were met quickly and effectively,154 but there were difficulties
                  reaching the worst-hit areas in Chin and Rakhine through early September, which are likely continuing
                  in areas not assessed by MIRA.

                  More sustained effort is required to increase food, income and livelihood security for the
                  flood-affected households, particularly the poorest and most vulnerable. The damage and
                  loss assessments suggest a cumulative decline in household livelihood and food security in coming
                  months, with a weakened ability to withstand future shocks. As seen before with Cyclones Nargis
                  and Giri, most humanitarian response from development partners has a short time horizon of one to
                  six months.155 Financing for recovery and rehabilitation beyond the initial relief and response efforts
                  is thus needed.


                  RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION STRATEGY

                  There is no large-scale social protection program in Myanmar that could be scaled up
                  to support flood-affected households in terms of cash transfers and social work support
                  services. Nor are there robust systems in place that facilitate rapid identification and enrollment of
                  beneficiaries and benefit payments. International experience demonstrates that these are critical for
                  protecting people against disasters and building long-term resilience (see Annex 6).

                  The President’s Instructions call for social protection interventions to support flood-affected
                  households as a core element of the government’s recovery plan.156 These interventions include
                  rice rations, cash transfers to poor households and vulnerable groups, youth volunteer opportunities,
                  reconstruction of housing and public infrastructure, and creation of employment opportunities
                  through cash for work programs. The SPSP and the RDSF also include these interventions as core
                  elements of Myanmar’s emerging social protection system (see also the 2015 National Natural
                  Disaster Management Committee Action Plan).

RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION PLAN

The proposed social protection recovery plan described below summarizes the interventions
required in the short term (six months), medium term (one year), and long term (two or more
years). These will form the foundation for a robust social protection system able to respond to future
disasters. The plan includes interventions to meet different needs of men and women, as well as
those of different age groups. Design of certain interventions such as cash for work would need to be
adapted to local conditions to reflect geographical needs and priorities (e.g., infrastructure projects).  

1. Provide immediate income support to households.

Cash transfers are an important component of how countries coordinate and deliver
emergency assistance. In the short term, immediate income and psychosocial support will be
provided through cash transfers and social work interventions for poor households and vulnerable
groups; in the medium term, an equitable national social protection system will be strengthened. The
following cash transfers are proposed: (i) categorical benefits (monthly) for pregnant women, children
under two years of age, persons aged 70 and above, and persons with disabilities; and (ii) household
benefit (monthly). The National Action Plan also calls for the provision of psychosocial support in the
flood-affected areas; this support has been initiated in the flood-affected areas by mobile teams (see
Annex 6 for details).

Implementation and financing. DSW (under MSWRR) has the oversight of the flood recovery
cash transfers and the responsibility for providing psychosocial support through social work case
management; implementation of the cash transfers will be through the collaborative efforts of the
General Administration Department and the Myanmar Maternal and Child Welfare Association. The
financing requirement for providing the benefits in the short term (for the preferred option) is estimated
at 0.03 percent of GDP, while medium- to long-term continuation of these benefits would cost roughly
1 percent of GDP. In addition, medium-term needs include the development of and capacity building
for MSWRR/DSW offices in each of the affected townships. The related infrastructure and equipment
costs are estimated at roughly K 712.5 million in the affected townships, with total staffing/operational
costs accordingly at roughly K 625 million per year (or roughly 1 percent of program costs under
Option A in Annex 6).

2. Provide income security and livelihoods opportunities for affected households while
contributing to asset recovery.

Cash/food for work programs are effective in reconstructing community assets while
also contributing to household recovery by providing temporary employment at low
wages, mainly to unskilled workers in rural areas. In the medium term, a cash/food for work
recovery program is proposed to provide temporary employment and rebuild/repair damaged
local infrastructure in selected flood-affected areas only. The extensive experience of development
partners in implementing these programs in Myanmar provides a firm foundation for introducing a
government-led cash/food for work program. This will form the basis for a long-term cash/food for
work program in rural areas that suffer high levels of seasonal unemployment, food insecurity, and
indebtedness (see Annex 6).

Implementation and financing. The Department of Rural Development (DRD), under the Ministry of
Livestock, Fisheries and Rural Development (MLFRD), has the mandate for implementing cash/food
for work programs according to the RDSF and the SPSP. The financing requirement for providing
the benefits in the medium term ranges from 0.07 percent to 0.09 percent of GDP (depending on
geographic coverage), while long-term continuation of these benefits would cost roughly 0.2 percent
of GDP. Annex 6 provides further information on benefit costs and related administrative and other
costs.

                  3. Ensure financial access to essential health and education.

                  Ensuring geographical and financial access to essential health and education is crucial
                  for limiting impoverishment due to catastrophic health expenditure, and for fostering
                  the return to school of children and preventing child labor. After the recovery of health and
                  education physical assets in the short term, existing government programs could be scaled up in
                  affected areas to meet these objectives. In particular, school stipends and school feeding programs
                  piloted by MOE could be scaled up, first in affected townships to provide an incentive for children to
                  go back to school after the floods, and then progressively across the country to ensure longer-term
                  resilience. Those forced to migrate should be properly registered and given the necessary documents
                  to be able to access health and education services in the area of destination (see also recovery plans
                  in the chapters on the education and health sectors).

                  on institutional mandates for design and implementation of social protection programs, as follows:

                  	   •	 MSWRR/DSW is responsible for supporting vulnerable groups, such as older people, women
                         and children in need, and persons with disabilities.
                  	   •	 MLFRD/DRD is responsible for cash/food for work programs in rural areas.
                  	   •	 Ministries of Education and Health are responsible for implementing stipends and vouchers
                         (i.e., cash and near-cash transfers) to promote access to education and maternal and child
                         health care, respectively.
                  	   •	 Ministry of Construction has overall responsibility for reconstruction (that contributes to
                         restoration of livelihoods and income security), and General Administration Department plays a
                         key role in social protection delivery. At the local level, elected village administrators and village
                         tract administrators can potentially support some of the delivery functions more actively. The
                         role of communities is also central.

                  Delivery systems. The implementation modalities for the proposed interventions are outlined in
                  Annex 6. Having effective systems in place will make response and recovery efforts faster and more
                  effective in the future. These systems include data collection and mapping of vulnerability and hazard
                  risk; systems for geographic targeting; beneficiary identification and enrollment; systems for payments
                  (moving from cash to electronic payments); communication and outreach; grievance redress; record
                  keeping; and monitoring and evaluation.


                  SECTOR ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY

                  The analysis presented is by definition preliminary. Immediate livelihoods and socioeconomic impacts
                  were measured and are likely to evolve over time. It is too early to identify the full social impacts of
                  the floods: they will take time to emerge, and depend on the nature of the flood response. Poverty
                  and social impacts are identified based on a combination of qualitative and quantitative evidence.
                  The primary data sources are a review of baseline data sources, the existing post-floods secondary
                  assessments and data, lessons from two large-scale longitudinal studies, and small-scale field
                  verification. The analysis follows the categorization of the National Natural Disaster Management
                  Committee by dividing the disaster-affected townships into the most severely affected areas,
                  consisting of the 40 most-affected townships, and the remaining less-affected areas, covering 178
                  townships. These top 40 townships account for 92 percent of destroyed houses, 83 percent of
                  destroyed schools, and 64 percent of destroyed farmland. These townships also account for 49
                  percent of displaced people.

                  Disaster Impact on Quality of Life
                  SUMMARY

                  Disaster may or may not have a significant impact on overall economic development, but it always
                  has a very significant impact on affected populations’ quality of life or well-being at the personal
                  or household level, especially for more vulnerable population groups, including women, children,
                  and the elderly. The 2015 Post-Flood and -Landslide Needs Assessment in Myanmar used existing
                  sectoral baseline information and the estimated value of the main disaster effects as observed during
                  field surveys to estimate the sectoral indicators and define quality of life. A gap analysis of the quality-
                  of-life indicators reveals that the impact of the floods and landslides has triggered a geographically
                  widespread decline in the quality of life of the disaster-affected population, particularly in Ayeyarwady,
                  Bago and Chin, which sustained the highest decline in the quality-of-life index. There seems to be
                  a correlation between a low quality of life and vulnerability to external shocks: high exposure to a
                  disaster was found to coincide with a significant decline in post-disaster quality of life in Chin, Bago,
                  Ayeyarwady, Kachin, Rakhine and Magway.


                  INTRODUCTION

                  While reliable quantitative procedures have been devised to estimate disaster impact at the
                  macroeconomic level, methodologies to estimate disaster impact at personal or household level have
                  lagged behind, and often qualitative means of assessment are the only ones available. Attempts have
                  been made to adopt the Human Development Index for estimating household-level disaster impact;
                  however, this index is relatively static and does not lend itself to measuring the sudden deterioration
                  of quality of life caused by disasters. In addition, the Human Development Index is not available in all
                  countries or at subnational levels.

                  One recently proposed approach to measuring disaster’s impact on quality of life is to adopt a
                  composite index using relatively simple indicators that can be collected over the relatively short
                  period—three to five weeks—of a typical Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA).  This approach
                  was applied and tested during the recent PDNA conducted after the 2015 Nepal earthquake. The
                  following sectoral indicators were selected for use in the estimation of disaster impact on quality of
                  life for the affected population:

                  	   •	 Housing deficit
                  	   •	 Number of patients treated in hospitals because of physical or psychological injuries, or due to
                         the occurrence of disease outbreaks arising from the disaster
                  	   •	 Number of school days lost by students due to interruption of classes
                  	   •	 Decline in household connections to electricity grid
                  	   •	 Decline in household connections to collective water supply and sanitation systems
                  	   •	 Decline in personal or household income

                  In addition to the above, whenever agricultural production losses have been high in comparison to
                  the normal volume of production—such as may occur as a result of slow-evolving disasters—an
                  additional indicator measuring food insecurity may be added.

                  On the basis of the values obtained for pre-disaster and post-disaster conditions for the sector
                  indicators listed above, with equal weights assigned to each, a composite indicator can be developed
                  that provides a picture of the disaster’s effect on the population’s quality of life. The estimated quality-
                  of life-composite indicator can also be used to measure the degree of recovery being achieved over
                  time.

QUANTIFICATION OF SECTORAL QUALITY-OF-LIFE INDICATORS

Housing. While complete information on existing housing deficits was not available, the recent
census and household survey provided the number of households in all disaster-affected states and
regions. It was assumed that each household occupied one housing unit. The number of housing
units that were fully destroyed and partially damaged (moderately or severely) was ascertained from
local and state/region authorities. Information on the number of pre-disaster households and the
number of destroyed or damaged houses is show in Table 69.

Housing units that sustained minor damage are not included in Table 69, as their impact on quality
of life is deemed not very significant. On the basis of the above, and in the absence of statistics on
pre-disaster housing deficits for all affected states and regions, the following indexes were developed
for the housing sector for both pre-disaster and post-disaster situations (Table 70).

                    Education. The baseline on number of schools and of students enrolled per state/region and district
                    was obtained from different official sources. Data on the number of schools that were fully destroyed
                    or partially damaged were collected during field surveys by government officials at national and state/
                    region levels. Although temporary facilities were secured to allow classes to resume and reduce
                    student education losses even where schools had been fully destroyed, an average interruption of
                    15 school days did occur. Total lost education days were estimated by taking into consideration the
                    number of students enrolled in those school facilities that had to close temporarily. On that basis,
                    education indexes were developed for each of the affected states and regions for both pre-disaster
                    and post-disaster situations (Table 71).

                    Health. In this sector it was not possible to obtain data on the number of in-hospital visits or the
                    number of cases of disaster-related disease treated after the floods and landslides. The Ministry of
                    Health did not have such information available (although it did have data on morbidity for previous
                    years). Because of those limitations in information, no health-related index was developed.

                    Water supply. For every state and region, full baseline information was available about the number
                    of households with access to improved water supply, and the baseline data were compared with
                    census data on the number of households in the country (see Table 72). During the assessment,
                    data were collected on the number of households that no longer have such access to these services.
                    Using data on the number of existing households in each of the states and regions of the country,
                    available in the recent census and household survey, it was then possible to derive pre-disaster and
                    post-disaster indexes on improved water supply access, as shown in Table 73.

Sanitation. As was the case for water supply, full baseline information was available about the
number of households that have access to improved sanitation facilities for all states and regions,
and was compared with census data on the number of households in the country (Table 74). Data
on the number of households that no longer have such access to improved sanitation services were
also collected during the assessment. Using data on the number of existing households in each of the
states and regions—available in the recent census and household survey—it was possible to derive
pre-disaster and post-disaster indexes on improved sanitation access (Table 75).

                     Electricity. Baseline information on the number of households connected to the electrical grid was
                     compared to data on total number of households (from the census and household survey) to arrive
                     at the pre-disaster electricity index. To estimate the post-disaster electricity index, use was made of
                     data collected by electricity companies on the number of disaster-affected houses that would not
                     be connected to the grid until they were repaired or rebuilt. These houses were broken down into
                     those that would be reconnected in about 12 months (rebuilt) and those that would be reconnected
                     in about 4 months (repaired), and due weight was given to each category. These data are shown in
                     Table 76. Using this information, the values of pre-disaster and post-disaster electricity indexes were
                     developed for each affected state and region (Table 77). It should be noted that the change or decline
                     in the electricity index is very limited because the rates of household connection to the grid were very
                     low to start with.

Personal income. Use was made of per capita GDP information for fiscal year 2014/2015 to define
pre-disaster personal income for the population living in the affected states and regions. After the
values of production losses and higher expenditures were estimated by each disaster-affected sector
of activity, projected state and region GDP was used to derive post-disaster per capita GDP. This
process made it possible to define pre- and post-disaster personal income indexes by state and
region, using the highest per capita income in Tanuntharyi as the reference (values are shown in Table
78).

                      COMPOSITE INDEX ON QUALITY OF LIFE

                      Using the above-described six sectoral indicators, an equal-weight composite quality-of-life index
                      was developed for both pre-disaster and post-disaster situations in all affected states and regions
                      (Table 79). The decline in quality of life sustained by the population in the disaster-affected states and
                      regions is illustrated in Figure 48. Figure 49 shows the most affected states and regions in terms of
                      the decline in quality of life among their population, and which would therefore require more focused
                      assistance for recovery of their living conditions

A ranking of the states and regions that saw the biggest decline in quality of life for their populations,
and which would hence require more focused assistance for recovery of living conditions, is provided
in Figure 51. Results of the analysis conducted to relate pre-disaster conditions and post-disaster
decline in the quality-of-life index are shown in Table 80.

                    KEY FINDINGS

                    Making use of the sectoral baseline and post-disaster information on disaster effects, a gap analysis
                    of the quality-of-life indicators reveals the following:

                    	    •	 The impact of the floods and landslides has triggered a geographically widespread decline in
                            the quality of life in the affected population. The analysis reveals that while before the disaster
                            five states and regions (Bago, Magway, Mandalay, Sagaing and Tanuntharyi) had a quality-
                            of-life index of between 0.7 and 0.8, after the disaster three of them (Bago, Mandalay and
                            Sagaing) had dropped to the next lower level. The analysis also reveals that while before the
                            disaster there were six states and regions (Ayeyarwady, Chin, Kachin, Kayah, Kayin, and Mon)
                            with an index of between 0.6 and 0.7; after the disaster, there are four at the lowest level
                            (Ayeyarwady, Chin, Rakhine and Shan) (Figure 50).
                    	    •	 There seems to be a correlation between a low quality of life and vulnerability to external
                            shocks in at least some of the states and regions. High exposure to a disaster coincides with
                            a significant post-disaster decline in quality of life, such as in Chin, Bago, Ayeyarwady, Kachin,
                            Rakhine, and Magway (Figure 51).
                    	    •	 Overall, Ayeyarwady, Bago and Chin sustained the highest decline in the quality-of life-index
                            (Figure 51).

                  SPECIAL FOCUS ON CHIN

                  The quality-of-life index provides an essential geographical overview of the disaster’s impact on the
                  quality of life. However, a complementary demographic analysis is needed to explore the underlying
                  socioeconomic vulnerabilities of the local population in question. In the case of Myanmar, the dramatic
                  decline in the quality of life in Chin, combined with the region’s low pre-disaster income levels, calls for
                  a closer analysis—and for prioritized assistance during the recovery phase.

                  According to the 2014 Myanmar Population and Housing Census, Chin is the least-populated region
                  in the country, with a striking population density of only 13 people per km2, compared to a national
                  average of 76. Chin’s population is predominantly rural (79.0 percent of the total) and is, as is typical
                  for Myanmar, more heavily female (196,586 women compared to 182,406 men); furthermore, 22.9
                  percent of all households in Chin are female-headed.

                  Chin’s demographic development is characterized by the highest fertility rate in the country, with an
                  average of 4.4 children per woman. As a consequence, Chin has the highest child population (72.3
                  percent) in Myanmar and an average age of 12 years. These demographics give rise to the highest
                  total dependency ratio across the country, at a staggering 81.0 percent, compared to the union
                  average total dependency ratio of 53.0 percent. This very high dependency presents a large burden
                  for the productive age population in Chin.

                  Socioeconomic development in Chin is lagging behind all the other states and regions, and Chin’s
                  performance on key indicators is alarmingly low. Chin has the lowest literacy rate across the country
                  (79.4 percent); 28.1 percent of all women in Chin are illiterate. Chin has also the highest disability
                  rate in Myanmar (7.4 percent), with 35,669 people who are reported to have some sort of disability.
                  Chin has the second-highest infant mortality rate in Myanmar: the census shows that for every 1,000
                  children born in Chin, 76 die before reaching their first birthday. Similarly, life expectancy at birth in
                  Chin is 63.6 years, the second lowest in Myanmar.

                  These demographic challenges are combined with an above-average unemployment rate of 5.4
                  percent, (compared to the national average of 4.0 percent) and the lowest per capita GDP across the
                  country (K 491,000/person).


                  USE OF THE QUALITY OF LIFE INDEX TO MONITOR RECOVERY

                  The composite quality-of-life index that has been derived for the Myanmar disaster can assist in
                  focusing priorities for recovery in two ways: it provides a measure of negative disaster impact on the
                  living conditions of the affected population, and it also shows the geographical distribution of the
                  impact. But it also serves a further function by offering a quantitative means to measure progress in
                  achieving recovery over time. Indeed, in view of its relative simplicity and of the ready availability of
                  information for its calculation, the quality-of-life index may be reevaluated periodically to determine
                  progress in achieving recovery and reconstruction.

                    Recovery Strategy And Way Forward
                    Summary
                    The post-flood and -landslide recovery strategy poses many challenges to the government
                    of Myanmar: political, technical, social, and institutional. The government of Myanmar’s
                    recovery vision is to promote “a people-centered resilient growth by building back better”158 in all 12
                    affected states and regions. The government is taking a whole-of-society approach to preparing the
                    recovery plan. It is engaging every level of government (union, state and region, township) and has
                    support from the private sector, civil society, academia, communities, and development partners.
                    The recovery process should be directed by guiding principles that ensure the recovery strategy is
                    harmonious with government policies and draws on the body of international good practice. A key
                    aspect of this approach is a seamless transition from short- to medium-term goals—a continuous
                    process encompassing the ongoing emergency response, the post-flood and -landslide recovery,
                    and progressive integration with the national development strategy and plan. It is recommended
                    that the results and data from the Post-Flood and -Landslide Needs Assessment (PFLNA) be
                    integrated in preparing the Comprehensive Recovery Plan and Strategy, so that ministries, regions,
                    states, and unions have a baseline to use in preparing their respective recovery plans. Recovery and
                    reconstruction needs have been estimated by the PFLNA in the order of K 2.035 trillion (Table 81).

                    to affected households for the repair and reconstruction of local infrastructure (schools, health clinics, housing, fish ponds, water and
                    sanitation, wells and other water sources etc.). The bulk of the equipment and material costs are already covered by reallocations to
                    sectoral reconstruction budgets. A part of this reconstruction budget needs to be reallocated for labor costs under the cash for work
                    program.

Guiding Principles
The “build back better” principle serves as the guiding framework in the development and
implementation of rehabilitation and recovery interventions. The principle focuses on long-term,
sustainable efforts to reduce vulnerabilities and strengthen capacities to cope with future hazard
events. This approach takes into consideration the need for urgency while ensuring safety in
implementing programs and projects. More specifically, recovery seeks to do the following:

	   •	 Set up scalable programs and systems. Adequate and predictable financing should be in
       place before disaster strikes. Global and ASEAN examples show that pre-committed financing
       mechanisms help reduce response times and allow scale-up to increase coverage after a
       disaster (see Annex 6).
	   •	 Keep program design appropriate and simple. Programs should be based on a rapid
       assessment of the needs of beneficiaries and build on existing experience in the country.
       Disaster risk management considerations need to be explicitly integrated to increase
       communities’ capacity to cope with future shocks (e.g., apply build back better principles in
       cash-for-word projects). Any new programs introduced should form the basis for a long-term
       sustainable social protection system.
	   •	 In the immediate aftermath of a disaster, assist both poor and non-poor households.
       Targeted assistance can be difficult to implement and can be perceived as divisive. In the
       recovery phase, support can be targeted to the most vulnerable and most affected households.
	   •	 Increase impact through partnerships and coordination. This requires minimizing
       program overlap geographically, ensuring program delivery mechanisms minimize the burden
       on local officials, and providing adequate financing for implementation costs at all levels.
	   •	 Integrate key future risks into program design. Risks related to the post-disaster situation
       include unsafe migration and trafficking, shifts in gender dynamics, and the appearance and/
       or increase of child labor. Programs need to take these risks into account in their design
       and ensure appropriate coordination with education and health services and with institutions
       responsible for mainstreaming information at community level.
	   •	 Build on existing institutions. Numerous institutions, both formal and informal, already exist
       in most villages. Recovery efforts should build on these structures, and build their capacities,
       rather than establish new mechanisms, and where limitations exist, efforts should be made to
       address them.
	   •	 Ensure community participation. Communities should actively participate in the recovery
       of their livelihoods and village infrastructure. Besides producing more sustainable results,
       community participation enables more effective grievance resolution and reduces escalation of
       disputes. If community-drive development platforms exist, these can be prioritized to channel
       resources for recovery.
	   •	 Ensure gender equality. Women and other vulnerable and disadvantaged groups should be
       able to participate in decision making for and receive benefits from social protection programs.
       These interventions should be directed at the needs of women, and cash/food for work
       programs should ensure equal pay for equal work.
	   •	 Sustain substantial assistance in villages most affected. After Nargis, the most severely
       impacted villages faced protracted challenges recovering, irrespective of their economic or
       social context prior to the disaster (World Bank/GFDRR 2014).
	   •	 Establish a sound monitoring and evaluation mechanism. This mechanism must have
       clear performance indicators and must be part of the post-flood and -landslide recovery
       framework and plan.

                  Key Issues and Challenges
                  The recovery strategy poses many challenges to the government. The political challenge is
                  to carry out the recovery planning during a preelection period (which is being closely observed by
                  the international community, and which the diverse components of Myanmar’s civil society have high
                  expectations for). The technical challenge is to salvage the agricultural sector, which requires seeds,
                  other inputs, and easing of rural credit to facilitate immediate replanting of beans and pulses and to
                  support livelihoods and food security for agriculture-dependent households. The social challenge
                  is to provide shelter by supporting an owner-built housing initiative through financial and technical
                  assistance. The institutional challenge stems from a situation where the implementing instruments at
                  the central and local levels are not appropriately geared to reach affected individuals and communities
                  in remote or conflict-prone areas. These challenges are compounded by the limited ability to mobilize
                  resources—both within the government of Myanmar budget (during the current and 2015–2016
                  exercises), and by development partners in the short term (i.e., four months) in the context of the
                  ongoing political-electoral process and the time required for processing loans and new cooperation
                  operations that require national legislation approval.

                  Other challenges include the following:

                  	   •	 Existing government institutional capacity. Institutional capacity constraints involve
                         coordination among overlapping, contrasting mandates and competences.
                  	   •	 Capacity for local implementation. Inadequate human resources, lack of material and
                         financial resources, and local governments’ authority over land planning and use of their
                         territories all pose problems for local implementation. These are aggravated in areas under
                         conflict.
                  	   •	 Cross-cutting needs. Given the cross-cutting nature of recovery and resilience building,
                         there is a need to develop or strengthen inter-sectoral and interinstitutional coordination for
                         recovery.
                  	   •	 Internal and external financial constraints. It is strategically vital to clearly define, prioritize,
                         and sequence interventions on the basis of immediate needs and feasibility of implementation.
                         Given these constraints, a dialogue is needed in order to harmonize national and development
                         partners’ priorities.
                  	   •	 Additionality of resources. In budgeting for economic and social recovery needs, the
                         additionality of resources (internal and external) needs to be related to already existing
                         responsibilities and tasks in order to ensure that resources are efficiently used.
                  	   •	 Compatibility with national development and sectoral plans. For recovery to be
                         sustainable, it must ultimately be integrated into the county’s longer- term national development
                         and sectoral plans.
                  	   •	 Need for broad acceptance among diverse beneficiaries. Recovery interventions,
                         instruments, and operational procedures need to respond to region-specific socioeconomic,
                         geographical, and physical characteristics in order to be widely acceptable and avoid
                         exacerbating or creating conflict (see Box 3).

                                                                                                           Box 3.
    In a disaster or post-disaster context, there is a two-way relationship between intervention/          Disaster recov-
    action and conflict. All recovery actions in conflict contexts can be affected by, and will likely     ery in conflict
    themselves affect, the conflict. It is essential, therefore, that participating agencies understand    or post-conflict
    the conflict dynamics, particularly the relations between stakeholders and the relevant issues.        situations
    They can then analyze how a particular intervention will impact these dynamics.

    Conflict sensitivity means ensuring that recovery activities (i) avoid, as much as possible,
    having a negative impact, and (ii) maximize the positive impact on conflict dynamics, thereby
    strengthening conflict prevention, structural stability, and peace building. This sensitivity
    should guide any disaster recovery initiative in conflict contexts. A key principle to be applied
    is that of impartiality, meaning that the response should be guided by human needs alone,
    rather than by political or other criteria. (In peace building, impartiality or neutrality allows a
    mediator or peace builder to build trust among all involved parties). It is important that (i)
    disaster risk reduction and conflict prevention measures occur together, and that (ii) disaster
    response needs be conflict-sensitive, so as to prevent hard-won peace dividends from being
    undermined and ensure that aid programming is effective.

    The process of constructing a disaster recovery framework will always be highly context
    specific, especially in the case of conflict settings. However, past experiences suggest some
    generally applicable guidelines where conflict is concerned. A conflict-sensitive framework
    seeks to “do no harm” (or do the least harm), and potentially uses the window of opportunity
    created by the disaster to contribute to peace building. Transparency and communication
    are essential for limiting politicization and for promoting social cohesion throughout the entire
    disaster recovery process.

Priorities
The sectoral and geographic characteristics of damages and losses from the floods and landslides,
combined with the country’s development priorities, suggest a number of clear priorities for recovery:

	   •	 Use the recovery as an opportunity to reinforce ongoing reforms, with the understanding
       that the disaster recovery is no substitute for the ongoing development plan.
	   •	 Focus on specific needs among states, townships, and village tracts, which will
       require more in-depth information and reach at the local level, over and above the existing
       mechanisms, and which should help to create more reliable decentralized mechanisms of
       implementation.
	   •	 Provide quick assistance to the agricultural producers unable to rebound by themselves,
       allowing for replanting of winter crops, beans, pulses, summer rice, and other cash crops.
	   •	 Restore livelihoods by several means, from cash transfers to expanding microcredit,
       restructuring loans and/or provide debt relief. Avoid sending already fragile, debt-ridden
       households and micro and small entrepreneurs into further debt such as by offering an
       extra twelve months for the principal repayment. Innovative means of asset creation and
       enhancement at the individual level should be complemented by support and financing to the
       microfinancing and savings and loans schemes at the community level.
	   •	 Rapidly support self-reconstruction of housing through provision of materials and cash
       grants tied to work. Use, expand, and cooperate with existing mechanisms.
	   •	 Over the medium to long term, prioritize an integrated approach to environmental
       and water resource management as part of the government’s effort to mainstream risk
       reduction and build resilience to natural hazards. Water resource management should be
       accompanied by disaster risk–sensitive land-use/urban planning, which requires not only

                                                                                                                        217

                         legislative and regulative measures but also scientific research and appropriate consultation
                         and delegation of responsibility and accountability.
                  	   •	 Address risk reduction in the medium to long term, given the country’s high exposure
                         to natural hazards and the increased vulnerabilities in the course of the floods and landslides.
                         Specific measures should be implemented to address disaster vulnerabilities.
                  	   •	 Strengthen the institutional capacity of relevant institutions to lead and manage
                         recovery. Given the country’s disaster risk profile, this will have benefits in the medium and
                         long-term too.
                  	   •	 Make full use of the existing local good practices, and use and strengthen local capacities,
                         indigenous knowledge, and diverse cultural richness.


                  Post-Flood and -Landslide Recovery Plan and Strategy
                  The government’s Comprehensive Recovery Plan and Strategy should articulate the
                  overall strategic vision and integrated short-term, medium-term, and long-term plans and
                  programs across the affected states, regions, unions, and townships. The objectives are to (i)
                  restore, rehabilitate, or reconstruct damaged infrastructure necessary to sustain economic and social
                  activities in the affected areas; (ii) repair houses or rebuild settlements and basic community facilities
                  and services so they are more resilient to natural calamities; (iii) restore peoples’ means of livelihood
                  and the continuity of economic activities and businesses; and (iv) increase resilience and capacities
                  of communities to cope with future hazard events.

                  The results and data from the PFLNA must be integrated in preparing the Comprehensive Recovery
                  Plan and Strategy; they will serve as a good baseline that ministries, regions, states, and unions can
                  use in preparing their respective recovery plans. It is recommended that for better integration of the
                  ministry recovery plans and strategies, ministry plans should be consolidated into the respective
                  sectoral working group plans and strategies. It is further recommended that recovery plans involve
                  a multi-year implementation of programs and projects, and that plans be disaggregated based on
                  specific time lines (fiscal years) for implementation, per ministry and per region, state, and township
                  to the extent possible. This will be useful for budgetary and funding purposes, will facilitate tracking
                  of programs’ progress, and will help government in managing expectations and setting clear metrics
                  on recovery efforts. In parallel, the affected areas (unions, regions, states, and townships) are
                  preparing their local recovery plans, which articulate the needs and requirements for integration in
                  the Comprehensive Recovery Plan and Strategy. This confluence of efforts ensures that planning
                  is consultative, participatory, and customized to the unique situations of each state, region, and
                  township.


                  Sequencing
                  Within given time lines, priorities and needs pose budgetary, institutional, administrative,
                  and logistical challenges to the government of Myanmar that will condition and frame the
                  development partners’ post-flood interventions. The summary needs tables in this PFLNA
                  show the areas that sectors are emphasizing in the short, medium, and long term; some of the key
                  considerations are summarized below. In the immediate time frame, interventions will have to be
                  limited and tailored to the existing financial, technical, and institutional capacities. The needs identified
                  for the short term far exceed existing financial and technical capabilities and will spill over to the next
                  budgetary exercise; they will have to be incorporated in the new development plan, once the current
                  electoral process culminates. The government sees the disaster as opening opportunities for the
                  economic rejuvenation of Myanmar in the medium and long term.

   1.	 The immediate focus should be on agriculture and housing, and specifically on the
       following:
       •	 Rapid and appropriate instruments that reach individuals and communities using a
            decentralized approach
       •	 Use and strengthening of local capacities and governments
       •	 Ongoing support from development partners in rural development and livelihoods
       •	 Use of existing mechanisms and ongoing instruments

   2.	 In the medium term, the education sector and transport network require infrastructure
       improvement and resilience, specifically through the following:
       •	 Efforts that build on work by development partners in these sectors
       •	 Continued effort in housing reconstruction tied to economic recovery and credit access

   3.	 In the longer term, given the recurrence and intensity of floods and impacts of climate
       change, a better risk reduction strategy is needed, which would include the following:
       •	 Strengthened, more diversified agriculture, livestock, and fisheries that are better linked to
           processing and markets, which would increase value added and reduce the gap between
           farmers’ income and market price
       •	 Expanded and improved flood control and irrigation designed to reduce risk and build
           resilience.
       •	 More coherent land-use and urban planning, allowing for economic activities and housing
           risk reduction, to include slope stabilization, flood protection, and proper buffer zones in
           floodplains in addition to infrastructure improvements
       •	 Prioritization of the transport sector as the strategic network that provides connectivity
           among communities and people, permits flow of goods from producers to markets, and
           moves goods and services to distant, hard-to-reach, and isolated locations
       •	 Systematic institutional and capacity-building of relevant authorities


Implementation Arrangements
Working within the current national disaster management framework, the president has appointed an
Advisory Group to work with the National Natural Disaster Management Committee (NNDMC) and
the ministries in preparing and implementing the recovery plan. In order to effectively manage the
recovery planning and implementation process, the NNDMC established the Recovery Coordination
Committee (RCC) under the leadership of the Ministry of Construction (MOC). At present, government
has embarked on three parallel and simultaneous tracks of recovery efforts: (i) the central government
through the line ministries is preparing its recovery plans and strategies; (ii) states and regions are also
preparing their local recovery plans and strategies; and (iii) government has conducted the PFLNA
with the support of development partners.

Considering the impact and magnitude of the disaster, it is recommended that the government
identify a lead dedicated agency to integrate all these parallel recovery efforts. It is crucial for the lead
dedicated recovery agency to do the following:

   •	 Put together the Post-Flood and -Landslide Comprehensive Recovery Plan, an overall strategic
      vision with integrated short-term, medium-term, and long-term plans and programs.
   •	 Coordinate with NNDMC Working Groups and its member line ministries, and consult with
      unions, states, regions, and townships in the formulation of plans and programs for the
      rehabilitation, recovery, and development of affected areas.
   •	 Propose a funding mechanism and support for the implementation of the plans and programs.
   •	 Exercise oversight over the relevant ministries with respect to the implementation of the plans
      and programs.




                                                                                                                       219
MYANMAR POST-DISASTER NEEDS ASSESSMENT
OF FLOODS AND LANDSLIDES JULY–SEPTEMBER 2015



                  Under Myanmar’s Disaster Management Law of 2013 and the current national recovery coordination
                  organizational structure, the vice president as chair of the NNDMC and the Advisory Group will be
                  working closely with the RCC and the NNDMC Working Committees. The key to a speedy and
                  effective recovery is to involve the regions, states, unions, and townships in the recovery planning and
                  in implementation of specific projects and programs, depending on their respective capacities. They
                  can also be involved in some of the recovery sector working group coordination meetings to allow a
                  better flow of information and feedback between central and local governments.

                  To facilitate overall management and coordination of all government recovery efforts in the affected
                  areas, it will be beneficial to strengthen the existing recovery sector working groups. Because
                  effectively implementing the recovery programs requires the intervention of two or more ministries,
                  the RCC is grouping the ministries according to the recovery sector working groups. This should
                  make planning, coordination, and implementation easier. The role of RCC is expected to become
                  more prominent for coordinating recovery among the different actors, monitoring implementation,
                  and communicating progress to key stakeholders, including the donor community.

                  Implementation of major recovery programs and projects can be done through the ministries and/
                  or clusters. The localized and smaller recovery programs and projects can be implemented by the
                  regions, states, unions, and townships, depending on their capacities. For the simple recovery projects,
                  communities may be involved in the implementation, depending on their capacities. Throughout the
                  delivery of programs and projects in the recovery phase, implementation bottlenecks and cross-
                  cutting policy issues will arise. Several ministries will need to work together to thresh out the issues
                  and reach high-level decisions for policies that can be carried out through the recovery clusters.

                  Capacity-building: There is a need for RCC to have a stronger institutional structure and capacity
                  at both union and subnational levels. Likewise, the recovery capacity and coordination mechanism of
                  the NNDMC should be strengthened for future disasters. This includes building the capacity of RCC
                  in post-disaster needs assessments, recovery planning and programming, institutional arrangements
                  and coordination, resource mobilization and communication, and monitoring, in order to ensure a
                  well-planned recovery in the future.

                  Monitoring. A monitoring and evaluation framework and system, anchored in the Myanmar
                  development plans (the medium- and long-term government plans),159 can serve as a periodic review
                  mechanism to track the quality and progress of the recovery efforts at every level of government.
                  Some countries have set up a simple and accessible recovery monitoring platform and tracking
                  system for all recovery projects that the central and local governments will use. Such a system
                  aims to promote transparency and accountability in the rehabilitation and recovery efforts. It ensures
                  that government will be able to track who does what, where they do it, and how far along they are
                  in implementing programs, projects, and activities in the affected areas. For the current recovery
                  effort, the government can explore the possibility of setting up a simple management information
                  system that can be lodged in the NNDMC or in any relevant ministry to track the flow of aid and
                  funds, monitor the progress of projects, and systematically capture the efforts of all the actors and
                  stakeholders involved in the recovery efforts. This system can later be scaled up by government to
                  cover other programs and projects in the future.

                  Strategic communications plan and community outreach. A strategic communications plan
                  will help to disseminate information on implementation of programs and will address recurring issues
                  in the recovery phase by keeping affected communities and other stakeholders well-informed. The
                  vice president as head of the NNDMC has reiterated the need to focus on the communities and the
                  affected people. It is therefore important to set up a feedback mechanism or a grievance system
                  whereby people can report and share their concerns in the recovery phase. This system would allow
                  people to feel that they have a stake in the rehabilitation efforts, and that government is providing
                  them with the platform to contribute.

Annex 4. Water Resource Management
(Irrigation and Flood Control)
SECTOR BACKGROUND
Myanmar is a water-rich country, and water resources are an integral part of Myanmar life. Endowed
with a large water availability of over 20,000 m3 per capita, Myanmar is far above the Asian average
(of around 4,000 m3 water availability per capita) and has more than twice the renewable freshwater
capacity of the United States. The mean annual rainfall is around 2,341 mm, ranging from 4,000–
6,000 mm along the coastal region and in the mountains of Rakhine in the west and Tanintharyi in the
south, to as low as 500–1,000 mm in the central dry zone. The north-south direction of Myanmar’s
mountain ranges is reflected in the flow of its major rivers. The monthly distribution of river flows follows
the pattern of rainfall, which means that about 80 percent flows during the monsoon season (May–
October) and 20 percent in the dry season (November–April). The water flow of the Ayeyarwady, the
largest river in Myanmar, varies from 2,500 m3/s in the dry season to 35,000 m3/s in the wet season.

Most of Myanmar’s rural poor are located in the dry zone and the Ayeyarwady delta, and they rely
heavily on water resources and agriculture for their livelihood. Around 70 percent of Myanmar’s incipient
irrigated agriculture is located in the dry zone, although most of these schemes function below their
potential, and there is great opportunity for expansion. The hydropower potential of Myanmar is estimated
at 100,000 MW, of which 2,600 MW has already been developed. The government is increasingly
interested in developing hydropower in a sustainable way, and wishes to better manage controversies
over hydropower developments, which have occurred in the past. For example, construction of the
Myitsone was halted in 2011 due to public concerns. Myanmar water-related infrastructure is overall
aged and poorly maintained. Access to improved water supply is reported as 86 percent nationwide,
while for sanitation it is 77 percent, with open defecation at just 5 percent. There are serious deficiencies
in service quality and reliability, however, which are often seasonal in rural areas. The availability of safe
drinking water depends on some reservoirs, communal ponds, and privately collected rainwater and
groundwater, and sanitation relies mostly on latrines and septic tanks.

Most of Myanmar’s rivers flow within its national border, which puts Myanmar in a position to solely
manage its water resources. The legal and institutional framework for Myanmar’s water resources
management is in the process of being developed, but overall it is fragmented, with outdated sectoral
laws, over 34 government agencies with some water management mandate, and daunting capacity
and budgetary challenges. The 2014 Myanmar Water Policy, the ongoing Water Law drafting, and
the establishment in 2013 of the National Water Resources Council, are a few examples of recent
developments. No single institution has the overall mandate to carry integrated water resources
management; there are no river basin organizations currently managing water at the basin level;
and incipient water users’ associations do not have a clear function. Municipal bodies and Village
Development Committees are slowly taking over tasks related to water supply and sanitation.

Given the magnitude of available water, as well as the spatial and seasonal variability, managing water
resources in an integrated way is a major challenge. Myanmar water resources are affected by severe
weather events and floods on an annual basis, and climate change will likely intensify these events.
Myanmar’s mostly undeveloped rivers carry a remarkable amount of sediment load, and water quality
is an increased concern due to unrestricted mining and poor sanitation. Groundwater availability is a
significant but yet unquantified resource.

                     In July 2003, the president of Myanmar established by decree the National Water Resources
                     Committee (NWRC). The objective of the NWRC is to promote cooperation between agencies with
                     water management mandates. The NWRC consists of over 34 members, including union ministries,
                     deputy ministries and mayors, state and region ministers, and director generals. The NWRC, chaired
                     by the vice president, has three pillars: (a) a Secretariat; (b) a Hydro-Informatics Center; and (c) an
                     Advisory Group. The Advisory Group is in the process of developing key legislation such as the Water
                     Framework Directive and the National Water Policy Action Plan. The Hydro-Informatics Center, which
                     is currently being developed, staffed, and trained, aims to be a center of expertise for all the knowledge
                     domains involving integrated water resources management, including planning, hydrology, hydraulics,
                     environment, social, and economy. The NWRC Secretariat carries out the day-to-day coordination
                     among different entities. Municipal bodies—such as the Yangon, Nay Pyi Taw, and Mandalay City
                     Development Committees, as well as Village Development Committees—are slowly taking over tasks
                     related to water supply and sanitation.

                     Beyond the fragmentation of water resources management mandates, most of these agencies have
                     daunting capacity challenges, are understaffed, and are underfunded. Myanmar is in the process of
                     increasing its data collection, storage, and modeling capacity, but there is no cohesive water resources
                     management decision support system. Coordination between sectoral ministries and between union
                     and local government needs to be improved. The main agencies with a water management mandate
                     are described below.

Myanmar does not have umbrella legislation for integrated water resources management. Instead,
various sectoral laws and bylaws grant some water management duties to different institutions, leading
to fragmentation and to overlap of and gaps in responsibilities. For example, the 2006 Conservation
of Water Resources Law grants different functions to the Ministry of Transport for protecting water
resources and river systems, but it is mostly focused on navigation management and river training
works. Table 89 provides a more detailed description of Myanmar’s water-related legal framework.

Other regulations affecting water resources management include the following:

      •	   The Rangoon Water Works Act, 1885
      •	   The Burma Municipal Act, 1898
      •	   The Burma Canal Act, 1905 as amended by Burma Act, 1914, 1924, 1928, and 1934
      •	   The Burma Embankment Act, 1905 as amended by Burma Act 1923 and 1931
      •	   The City of Rangoon Municipal Act, 1922
      •	   The Underground Water Act, 1930
      •	   The Burma Water Power Rules, 1932160

In an effort to modernize its water resources framework, the government of Myanmar approved
two major pieces of legislation in 2014: the National Water Policy, which for the first time introduces
integrated water resources management concepts into decision making; and Water Quality Standards.
In 2015, based on the National Water Policy and numerous consultations, the Myanmar Water Vision
2040 was published. The Water Law, currently being drafted, is expected to further operationalize
integrated water resources management and establish a much clearer institutional framework.

The National Water Policy is the first integrated water policy for the watersheds, rivers, lakes,
reservoirs, groundwater aquifers, and coastal and marine waters of all of Myanmar. Its objective is to
take cognizance of the existing situation and to propose a framework for creating a system of laws
and institutions and a plan of action with a unified national perspective.

The Expert Group of the National Water Resources Committee is in the process of drafting a Myanmar
Water Framework Directive, which aims at including general principles governing the exercise of
legislative and/or executive powers by the union, the states and regions, and the local governing bodies.
The Expert Group is also tasked with preparing a plan of action based on the National Water Policy.

The Myanmar Water Law is in the process of being drafted. The government has led various
consultations and is expecting to finalize the Myanmar Water Law by November 2015.

                  Annex 5. Disaster Risk Management
                  Myanmar’s disaster risk management plans. Myanmar endorsed the Hyogo Framework for
                  Action 2005–2015 (HFA), as well as its follower agreement, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk
                  Reduction 2015–2030. In par with other ASEAN member states, Myanmar also ratified the ASEAN
                  Agreement on Disaster Management and Emergency Response, which was the first legally binding
                  regional treaty aligned with the HFA. For the implementation of the HFA and ASEAN treaty at the
                  national level, the Myanmar Action Plan for Disaster Risk Reduction (MAPDRR) was developed in
                  2009 and enacted in 2012 to accelerate the implementation of prioritized activities. The objective of
                  MAPDRR is “to make Myanmar Safer and more Resilient against Natural Hazards, thus Protecting
                  Lives, Livelihood and Developmental Gains.”161 The plan lays out a series of objectives and projects
                  that the government and international partners can undertake to support achievement of the HFA
                  priorities.

                  Myanmar’s disaster risk management framework. The National Natural Disaster Management
                  Committee (NNDMC) is chaired by the vice president, with the Union Minister of the Ministry of Social
                  Welfare, Relief and Resettlement (MSWRR) and the Union Minister of Home Affairs as vice-chairs;
                  and the Deputy Minister of MSWRR is the secretary. Union ministers from different ministries and
                  the chief ministers of 14 states/regions are also included in the NDMC. Two working committees
                  operate under the NDMC: the Search and Rescue Working Committee, chaired by the union minister
                  for the Ministry of Home Affairs, and the National Natural Disaster Management Working Committee
                  (NNDMWC), chaired by the Union Minister for Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement. Further, there
                  are 10 subcommittees with different technical and sectoral functions under the NNDMWC.

                  Department of Meteorology and Hydrology (DMH). DMH has significant assets, such as
                  government land where observation sites and facilities are located; its main facilities in Yangon, Nay
                  Pyi Taw, and Mandalay; 14 regional offices; a water quality laboratory at Yangon; and observation
                  equipment and machinery. DMH has recently built a new forecasting and early warning center building
                  in Nay Pyi Taw. The facility, which was completed in 2014, provides a separate large meteorological
                  office and a smaller hydrological office.   A large studio designed for recording of daily television
                  segments is located at the rear of the ground-floor complex. Although DMH’s total staff quota is
                  1,425, the current staff ceiling is 730, including 40 seismologists. One hundred and seventy-seven
                  DMH personnel are based in Yangon, where the Lower Myanmar and Aviation Divisions are located;
                  and 110 are based in Nay Pyi Taw at DMH’s headquarters. DMH employees include 299 women and
                  431 men; 600 employees are observers and technicians. There are eight trained weather forecasters,
                  of whom four are stationed in NPT, and there are six hydrological specialists.

                  Education and training has been a high priority for DMH, and overall the department has a high
                  level of expertise, which is continually refreshed through international training opportunities offered
                  by partners (including the World Meteorological Organization [WMO], Asian Disaster Preparedness
                  Center, and Regional Integrated Multi-Hazard Early Warning System for Africa and Asia [RIMES],
                  along with Norway, Japan, China, and Korea). Compared with other regions, then, staffing is not a
                  significant limitation to modernization of services, although new skill sets are needed.

                  The modernization efforts are all in an early stage of implementation. It would therefore be premature
                  to expand on these efforts before DMH has begun to operate its new capabilities. The current radar
                  network of three radars will be fully operational within 18 months. The expanded in situ hydrological
                  and meteorological networks will be operational within two to three years.

                  In the meantime, several things can be done to accelerate improvements in DMH’s capabilities
                  through closer cooperation and partnership with more advanced national meteorological and
                  hydrological services. At the request of DMHl, WMO has initiated this process and will facilitate
                  twinning arrangements with the Indian Meteorological Department and secure support for numerical

weather prediction from the UK Met Office, the China Meteorological Administration, and the European
Centre for Medium-Range Forecasting. This effort can be extended to include twinning arrangements
with hydrological centers capable of providing DMH with operational flood-forecasting guidance.
Preference should be given to those working closely with the numerical weather prediction centers to
drive the hydrological forecast models. Some resources are available to initiate this process through
WMO, but additional funding could be used effectively to support the operational partnership until
DMH’s own capabilities come on line (in approximately three years).

The government of Myanmar is already engaged in a hydromet modernization program with the
support of a few key development partners. The Norwegian government is helping DMH improve
its numerical weather prediction guidance; and the Japanese government is significantly increasing
DMH’s capacity to observe hazardous weather events through the installation of three Doppler
weather radars and a network of high-quality automatic weather stations. In addition, the government
of India is supporting an expansion of the real-time hydrological and meteorological networks and
the integration of all donor-supported observations into a single system that can support more
accurate, more timely, and higher-resolution forecasting of meteorological and hydrological events.
Efforts related to longer-lead flood forecasts for the Ayeyarwady, Chindwin, and Sittoung basins are
taking place through RIMES, while the Ayeyarwady River Basin Management Project is taking place
through the World Bank. The project also seeks to improve the services provided to stakeholders by
focusing on the impact of weather and hydrological extremes—that is, on so-called impact-based
forecasting and warning services. Several other efforts are under way to improve early warning, but
generally these are preliminary pilot studies that need to be scaled up to the whole country. Norway
and the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center have assisted with the digitization of climate records
and downscaling of climate information. Climate information services through Monsoon Forums at
national level have been a primary institutional arrangement for information sharing, and currently they
are being expanded to subnational level.

                  Annex 6. Poverty and Social Impact Assessment
                  I. DESCRIPTION OF DATA SOURCES FOR THE POVERTY AND SOCIAL
                  IMPACT ANALYSIS

                  Poverty and social impacts were identified based on a combination of qualitative and
                  quantitative evidence. The primary data sources are a review of baseline data sources, the existing
                  post-flood secondary assessments and data, lessons from two large-scale longitudinal studies, and
                  small-scale field verification conducted for the poverty and preliminary social impact analysis. For the
                  numerical data analysis, census and Integrated Households Living Condition Assessment (IHLCA)
                  2009–2010 household data were used. For both of these data sets, most-affected, less-affected and
                  unaffected areas were identified, as follows:

                        •	 The IHLCA-2 allows a detailed description of the poverty and socioeconomic profile of the
                           areas affected by floods; note that the description refers to the areas in 2009–2010. We divide
                           the IHLCA sample into three parts: households that reside within townships that were among
                           the most affected by floods; households that reside within townships that were less flood; and
                           households who reside within unaffected townships. Of the IHLCA sample, 13,699 households
                           were in areas affected by the floods; of these, 3,191 households were in the most severely
                           affected areas, and 10,508 were in less-affected areas.162
                        •	 We additionally draw upon the 2014 Population and Housing Census. We match the list of
                           affected townships to the township level Census tabulations. The census tabulations at a
                           township level reflect the characteristics of the enumerated population.

                  The two longitudinal studies we drew on looked at life in rural Myanmar and were conducted between
                  2008 and 2015. The Social Impacts Monitoring (SIM) studies, conducted between 2008 and 2013
                  included four rounds of qualitative research to document the long-term social and socioeconomic
                  impacts of Cyclone Nargis across 40 villages in Ayeyarwady region. The Qualitative Social and
                  Economic Monitoring (QSEM) studies, conducted by the World Bank in partnership with the
                  Livelihoods and Food Security Trust Fund (LIFT) between 2012 and 2015, have covered five rounds
                  of qualitative research on livelihoods, social relations, aid, and village governance in 54 villages in
                  Ayeyarwady, Chin, Magway, Mandalay, Rakhine, and Shan. Combined, these studies have involved
                  interviews and focus group discussions with over 7,000 participants.

                  In order to understand the post-flood context, we draw on a review of existing post-flood assessments
                  and data and a review of media reports since the floods, triangulated by a small-scale qualitative
                  assessment conducted in September 2015 for the chapter on poverty, social impact, and social
                  protection in this Post-Floods and -Landslides Needs Assessment. The qualitative research was
                  conducted in six villages in Magway, Rakhine, and Sagaing that were purposively selected to
                  cover different levels of flood damage. The research involved in-depth interviews and focus group
                  discussions covering approximately 130 participants and representing people from farming, fishing,
                  casual labor, and small business households, including poorer and more vulnerable households. The
                  purpose of the qualitative assessment was to conduct some limited field verification of the findings
                  from the secondary data and assessments in order to triangulate existing socioeconomic findings
                  and be better able to predict social risk.




                  162
                      Of the 126 townships in the IHLCA, 88 were in flood-affected areas, of which 21 were in the most-affected areas and 67
                  were in less-affected areas. Note that the IHLCA cannot be used to make inferences about individual townships; this exercise
                  defines groupings of townships based on flood outreach in a manner that is consistent with the sampling approach used in the
                  IHLCA. The IHLCA-2 had 62 strata at a district level; within these, two townships were selected with probability proportionate
                  to the estimated size with replacement. Because of the highly geographically clustered impact of the floods, there is strong
                  clustering within districts of flood-affected townships. In 42 districts, all the townships within the district were categorized as
                  flood affected (177 townships), and in a further 10 districts more than half the townships were classified as flood affected (38
                  township). With the exception of the two townships in Kachin and Bago, the same case can be made for the most-affected
                  townships.

II. PRE-FLOOD PROFILE OF AFFECTED AREAS

Welfare levels in affected areas
The areas that were most affected by the disaster were worse off in 2009–2010 and in 2014
than those that were less affected and unaffected by the floods. Half of the most-affected
townships are found in the two poorest states in Myanmar: Rakhine and Chin. These states have
the country’s highest poverty rates. Analysis from the IHLCA for 2009–2010 suggests that the most-
affected areas had a 50 percent higher poverty incidence than the national average in 2009–2010.
The floods are therefore affecting a population who was more likely to be poor or vulnerable to
poverty before the disaster struck.

The analysis conducted is robust to the consumption aggregate used. The analysis
was conducted using two different aggregates to ensure that it was robust to methodological
assumptions.163   Both sets of analysis showed that the flood-affected areas have higher rates of
poverty than the national average, and also showed very similar results for the socioeconomic profile
of population in the bottom two quintiles (the bottom 40 percent). We are therefore confident that the
analysis in this note reflects the nature of poverty in flood-affected areas.

The analysis of relative well-being was verified using data from the census; flood-affected
townships were found to be worse off before the floods hit than other areas. Although the
census does not include the information that is needed to measure poverty, it contains a number
of indicators that are associated with poverty. Comparing average characteristics of the 40 most-
affected townships with characteristics of townships that were less or not affected by the disaster
shows that—across a range of household characteristics associated with being better off (such as
housing facilities, communications, and transport)—affected townships were relatively worse off prior
to the flooding than the rest (Figure 46).

The housing stock in some of the most-affected areas was less resilient prior to the floods.
Households in these townships are more likely to have roofs made of more permeable and easily
damaged dhani, theke, and leaves (Figure 52). Similarly, fewer households in these areas reported
having quality walls and quality sanitation (Table 90).


Village socioeconomic profiles
Understanding the social and economic structures of villages in rural Myanmar can help guide external
actors, including government and development partners, on how communities are likely to react to
flood and landslide damage and how best to support recovery.

Although farming patterns and types of crops produced vary significantly, farmers face
vulnerability across much of the country. Some areas, in particular Ayeyarwady Region, focus
on producing paddy, and have sizeable populations of landless households who depend on casual
agricultural labor opportunities at particular points of the agricultural cycle. A number of other areas,
including Chin State and the dry zone regions of Sagaing and Magway, have higher rates of land
ownership and farmers who invest in a variety of crops. Across agro-ecological zones, farmers and
casual laborers face ongoing vulnerability resulting from low levels of profitability, significant reliance
on credit to finance investment in agricultural production, high debt levels, and a lack of steady labor
or income-generating opportunities.

    Differences in the assumptions entering into the consumption aggregate will affect the degree of reported poverty. Detailed
information on the aggregates is found in World Bank (2015).

                     Rural households are increasingly attempting to diversify income sources. Opportunities
                     arising from the economic reforms that have taken place since 2011, combined with the risks
                     associated with farming, have increasingly led rural households to diversify their sources of income in
                     recent years. There is evidence to suggest increasing migration of family members; most seek work
                     as unskilled laborers in Yangon but some leave the country. Recent years have also seen an increase
                     in investment in rural, nonfarm businesses, which provide a secondary source of income for families

                                                                                                         annexes




with surplus labor. The nature of these small enterprises varies significantly dependent on location,
access to markets, and the natural resources available.

Villages have traditionally been relatively self-reliant and socially cohesive. A number of
studies note that villages in rural Myanmar are characterized by strong social cohesion. Although
there is considerable ethnic diversity across Myanmar, and some intergroup communal tension,
village units themselves are often relatively homogenous.164 This tradition of collective action has
helped villages respond to previous disasters.

In recent years, access to government services, mobile phone access, and rural-urban
migration have increased, with a commensurate impact on village life. Villages are becoming
more connected with one another and the outside world. Increases in expenditure in health and
education, along with new initiatives targeting rural development (including the National Community
Driven Development Program and the Green Emerald Fund), have seen noticeable increases in
government services at the local level, albeit starting from a low base. Mobile phone usage has rolled
out across much of the country following the opening of the telecommunications market in 2014.
Migration of predominantly young family members to urban areas has increased. Such changes are
resulting in more complex and entrenched social networks beyond the village level.

A minority of townships in flood-affected areas have experienced conflict and communal
tension, which complicates the social risk of the flood response. Although most flood-affected
areas are outside conflict areas, there are some exceptions. In approximately a quarter of the 40
most-affected townships, residents have experienced some form of conflict in recent years. In several
townships in northern Rakhine State, social conflict has resulted in a significant number of people
(predominantly but not exclusively Muslims) living in internally displaced person (IDP) camps. (In
these areas, Muslims face restrictions on movement and therefore disruptions in livelihoods, access
to markets, and services.) A small number of flood-affected townships in Chin and Shan States
have also been subject to conflict in recent years. The delivery of humanitarian and development
assistance is particularly complicated in areas affected by conflict, as any perceived aid inequities
have the potential to aggravate preexisting tensions.


III. IMPACTS OF DISASTER ON HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AND LIVELIHOODS

Human development impacts
In the aftermath of the floods, there is a risk of children being withdrawn from school to
support the household’s economic situation. Education provision has been disrupted in several
locations affected by the floods and landslides. Damages range from temporary school closures to
a complete loss of infrastructure. In many schools, school furniture, learning materials, and supplies
have been reported damaged.165 This disruption to education may have long-term implications for
enrollment, particularly among poorer families whose children drop out of school earlier.

Qualitative research identified some families already considering removing children from
secondary and college education. In one heavily affected village in Sagaing, respondents claimed
they would no longer be able to meet the transportation costs required to send their children to
secondary school or the boarding costs for college education; these families said they would remove
children from school in the coming months.

MYANMAR POST-DISASTER NEEDS ASSESSMENT
OF FLOODS AND LANDSLIDES JULY–SEPTEMBER 2015



                  Compared to their peers, children in affected areas face a greater risk of suffering long-
                  term impacts from disruptions to their physical development (due to limited nutrition) and
                  from disruptions to their education (due to having to work). Even before the flood, one-third
                  of children in Myanmar suffered moderate underweight (Table 68); rates in the most-affected areas
                  are even higher. This prevalence of underweight associated with limited nutrition can have long-
                  term consequences because early childhood is a period of rapid brain development. When children
                  spend their early years in a less supportive environment, brain development is affected and leads to
                  cognitive, social, and behavioral delays. For example, high levels of adversity during early childhood
                  have been linked to an increased risk of stress‐related disease and learning problems later in life.166
                  There is therefore a risk that even temporary food insecurity can have longer-term consequences for
                  young children or unborn babies.


                  Livelihood impacts
                  Crop losses have been significant. Assessments indicate that almost 9 percent of cultivated land
                  was affected by the flood in the six most-affected states. There was significant variation both across
                  regions and within regions. In Ayeyarwady, crops covering over 100,000 hectares of land, or 12
                  percent of cultivated land, were destroyed.167 Elsewhere, for example in Rakhine, a greater proportion
                  of crops could be replanted as the waters receded. Monsoon paddy was the most affected crop,
                  accounting for almost 80 percent of all crops destroyed. Landslides in Chin, along with mud and
                  sediment damage elsewhere, are likely to have longer-term impacts for farmers in affected areas.
                  Although crop damage in Chin was mainly caused by landslides and was therefore less significant
                  (affecting approximately 2 percent of overall cultivated land), it is likely to affect farming across multiple
                  seasons.

                  Small and medium farmers and casual laborers were particularly affected. Small and medium
                  farmers report crop losses. Debt burdens from loans taken to plant a monsoon harvest with little
                  return will make it difficult for many to invest in a winter crop. In field research, small farmers reported
                  turning to nonfarm casual labor opportunities to make ends meet. Casual laborers also face difficulty.
                  The loss of the monsoon harvest will impact labor opportunities at harvest time in late 2015. Field
                  research found in addition that there is greater competition from farmers for nonfarm casual labor
                  work.168

                  The impact on fisheries was felt by subsistence fishermen across a number of regions
                  and by commercial fishermen mainly in Rakhine. Approximately 70 percent of damage to
                  aquaculture production was located in Rakhine.169 Over the medium term, there is a need for capital
                  to rebuild embankments for fish and prawn ponds and to restock fish and prawn farms. The floods
                  also affected small-scale and subsistence fishermen by limiting their capacity to earn a living during
                  the floods and by damaging boats and nets. In Rakhine, for example, an estimated 45 percent of
                  fishing households experienced substantial damage to their equipment.170 Even prior to the floods,
                  subsistence fishermen had been identified as a particularly vulnerable socioeconomic group.171
                  Although representing only a small proportion of the population across affected areas, they will require
                  assistance to reestablish their livelihoods.

                  Women-headed households suffered disproportionate housing loss and higher immediate
                  post-disaster costs. Vulnerable groups such as women-headed households tend to have less
                  sturdy houses, and these houses experienced more significant damage. More analysis is needed,
                  however, to assess whether the overall economic situation of women-headed households is worse

than that of male-headed households with similar characteristics. In one village visited by research
teams, houses of all eight women-headed households were destroyed; in the aftermath of the floods,
these households reported difficulties accomplishing certain tasks because there were no men to
perform necessary work. Some households headed by women had to pay a laborer K 5,000 per day
(for as much as five days) to clean up their houses, an expense that households with male labor did
not need to bear.

Investments in secondary income sources were also damaged. Across a number of villages
visited as part of the field research, machinery and assets used for small nonfarm businesses were
damaged. In a village in Sagaing, for example, where women had previously generated income from
sewing, the flood damaged 38 of 41 sewing machines. In addition, as electricity had not yet been
restored to the village, orders could not be filled subsequent to the flood. On a village visited in
Rakhine, one-fifth of the charcoal-making businesses were also damaged. The capital outlay required
to rejuvenate these businesses will vary significantly from area to area.

Potential risks due to cumulative pressure on livelihoods include high levels of food
insecurity, high debt levels, and a range of negative coping strategies that households will
use to respond to these pressures. Examples of exploitative interest rates were already beginning
to emerge in field research. In one instance, a villager in Magway described having to take a loan of
K 10,000 to help repay another loan immediately following the flood. Interest was charged at K 500
per day, equating to approximately 15 percent per month.


Land and resettlement
Field research indicates that some villagers not identified by government for relocation will
advocate for assistance in relocating all or parts of their village. These villagers are likely those
that have been subject to flooding on multiple occasions. In one village in Magway, for example, where
households had been damaged by floods at least twice in recent years, villagers were requesting
assistance from the government to relocate part of the village to higher ground within the village
boundaries. However, in this instance no government land is available, so relocation would require
the purchase of land from individuals.



IV. COPING STRATEGIES: THE RISK OF INDEBTEDNESS AND
FOOD SECURITY

Households are employing a range of strategies to cope with the floods. The Agriculture and
Livelihood Flood Impact Assessment172 conducted in Ayeyarwady, Bago, Chin, Magway, Rakhine,
and Sagaing reports a variety of coping patterns (see Figure 47). However, some of these coping
strategies are negative: they reduce assets and undermine the recovery over the longer term.

Borrowing money is one of the most common coping strategies, but households risk
becoming trapped in debt. The United Nations Development Programme’s REACH assessment
in Rakhine shows that the three most common coping strategies households report using are taking
out loans, buying food on credit, and reducing spending on basic goods. The assessment asked
households about their potential coping strategies in three months in the absence of external support
(such as food aid). By far the most likely coping strategy would be to take on more debt, either
in the form of loans or the purchase of food on credit. In the IHLCA-2 data, more than one-third
of households have debts, with rates being higher in rural area, where loans are often taken for
agricultural inputs. For a quarter of households, debts count for more than a quarter of their (easily
cashable) assets, a sign of overindebtedness.

                   Research prior to the flood indicated a decline in debt burden of farmers in recent years.
                   Some regions, for example Ayeyarwady, had benefited from a combination of reasonably positive
                   agricultural outcomes and increase in availability of credit at lower interest rates. Where regions were
                   affected by ongoing weather-related shocks, such as water shortages in Rakhine and Chin, there was
                   less evidence of a reduction in debt levels.173

                   Households also report borrowing for food, eating cheaper food, and eating less food,
                   practices that can undermine health and well-being. The Agriculture and Livelihood Flood
                   Impact Assessment found that up to 75 percent of villages reported using a variety of food-based
                   coping mechanisms, including “borrowing food from friends and relatives, reducing the number of
                   daily meals and reducing the quantity of food consumed.” There was some intrahousehold variation,
                   with parents coping with insufficient food by allowing their children to eat first.174

                   The cumulative effects of crop damage raise the risk of additional negative coping
                   strategies in the medium term. These negative strategies potentially include withdrawing children
                   from school so they can work and exploitative migration due to lack of job opportunities in the village.
                   In field visits there were no indications that withdrawing children from school for work is a widespread
                   problem, but as food security risks become more severe, additional school withdrawals are likely.
                   Field research identified a few examples of migration immediately following the floods. These were
                   limited to villages that had no clear livelihood opportunities following the flood and had preexisting
                   networks guaranteeing jobs elsewhere. In one village in Sagaing, for example, a number of villagers
                   moved temporarily to Chin to work on infrastructure projects, drawing on networks from work prior to
                   the flood. Experience from Cyclone Nargis suggests that as agricultural job opportunities in the winter
                   crop season fail to materialize, rural laborers will resort to migration in order to find work.175


                   V. IMPACTS OF THE FLOODS ON SOCIAL RELATIONS

                   The impacts of the floods and landslides on social relations and cohesion are likely to derive
                   not from demographic changes, but rather from livelihood degradation and the nature of
                   the flood response. The floods and landslides did not bring about the immense demographic
                   changes seen in disasters with high death tolls. However, the significant degradation of livelihoods
                   in highly affected areas is likely to have secondary, cumulative effects on poorer households and
                   vulnerable groups. Social relations will also likely be influenced by how communities respond to these
                   challenges, and by how external actors, including government and development partners, engage
                   with communities in delivering assistance.

                   Community coping mechanisms
                   In rural areas, religious buildings were generally the primary point of relocation. This was
                   in part because communities had confidence that religious leaders could mobilize support for
                   immediate needs. Assessments from Rakhine indicate that reliance on religious buildings was also

more prevalent in Buddhist communities, where building infrastructure was relatively safe and where
monasteries tend to be located away from flooding.176

The importance of community coping mechanisms continued into the medium-term
recovery period. Even in the small sample of villages visited to assess social impact, ongoing
community mobilization in response to the disaster was evident. In one village in the Sagaing Region,
different community working units were established to deal with the withdrawal of food and nonfood
aid from township collection points, generate donations, and distribute aid within the village. In
Magway, casual labor groups accepted more members and redistributed job opportunities to ensure
more people could access paid work, even though it meant less income per person.


Social relations, village leadership, and aid effectiveness
The capacity for collective action within villages is likely to remain relatively strong. The
collective coping mechanisms exhibited by communities since the floods are similar to those seen
after earlier disasters in Myanmar. Because there have been few recent demographic changes,
relations between ethnic and religious groups at the intravillage level is not very likely to change—with
the caveat that perceived inequities over aid distributed along ethnic or religious lines could affect
social relations.

There are unlikely to be significant changes to intergenerational relations in response to
the floods, though the participation of young people in mobilizing assistance opens up
avenues of youth leadership. Several youth leaders in a village in Sagaing, for example, created a
Facebook group to request aid from networks in urban areas as far as Yangon. Once the village had
received enough immediate assistance, the youth leaders suggested redistributing the remaining aid
to a neighboring village still in need. After the village committee established to oversee the response
to the floods agreed, youth leaders organized villagers to transport the aid to the neighboring village.

New village-level committees were created to distribute aid in heavily affected areas. Field
researchers in Sagaing and Magway reported that village-level emergency response committees
were set up to respond to the floods. These committees were established at the direction of the
township administration at the village level, effectively ensuring that responses were coordinated
between townships and individual villages, bypassing the village tract. The committees were separate
from existing village administration structures, and respondents perceived this as an explicit attempt
to minimize the role of village administrators. All government assistance and the majority of NGO
and private sector aid was collected and distributed by these committees. Exceptions were NGO
assistance distributed through preexisting community-based organizations created by the NGO.

In the small sample of villages visited, traditional leaders appeared to have significant
influence over the recovery committees. Village administrators did have some say in selecting
community members for committees, but in the villages visited, the committees ultimately took
direction from the senior monk in the village along with village elders and respected persons.

There are risks of social tension over perceived aid inequity. The experience of previous
disasters in Myanmar suggests that an influx of post-disaster aid can create social tension—and
undermine existing social capital and capacity for collective action—if community members feel left
out of decision making and perceive that the benefits of aid are going to some groups and not
others.177 Assessments to date have focused almost exclusively on quantifying the level of damage
across the country and the response by government and development partners. However, experience
from previous disasters shows that to minimize risks of social tension, it is important to focus not only
on the levels of aid, but also on the way in which aid is delivered.

MYANMAR POST-DISASTER NEEDS ASSESSMENT
OF FLOODS AND LANDSLIDES JULY–SEPTEMBER 2015



                  Field research identified some complaints relating to the distribution of aid. These occurred
                  primarily in areas that were more heavily affected by the floods and, as a result, were both more
                  dependent on aid and in receipt of large enough amounts of aid to generate competition over how the
                  aid was allocated. The types of grievances could broadly be categorized along two lines: intravillage
                  grievances about the distribution of aid, and village grievances with external actors about aid delivery
                  mechanisms.

                  Prominent in the first category were tensions between those who thought aid should be
                  distributed to the whole community and those who saw this approach as inequitable. In
                  all three states and regions visited, field researchers found examples where targeted aid had been
                  redistributed to the community more broadly. Village administrators justified equal distribution on the
                  basis of eliminating potential communal tension. This was particularly evident in the dry zone, where all
                  food aid was distributed equally to all households, independent of need or vulnerability. Interviewees
                  in Sagaing reported an antipathy toward aid targeting, with one (male) respondent saying “we should
                  all get pregnant” when the prospect of aid specifically for pregnant women was discussed.

                  Vulnerable populations did, however, voice some dissatisfaction with distribution systems
                  at the village level. When asked directly, vulnerable populations, particularly small farmers with
                  high debt and landless laborers, expressed dissatisfaction with equal distribution. Although they
                  understood village leaders’ wish to prevent social tension, they perceived it as unfair that rich farmers
                  were receiving the same level of food aid as more vulnerable households.

                  Also at the village level, aid can create competition between village elites that exacerbates
                  social tensions. This has been well documented in previous research on aid following Cyclone
                  Nargis178 and on general development assistance in rural Myanmar.179 The only evidence of this
                  competition following the flood response was in the establishment of new village-level committees to
                  administer aid and the reaction of existing authorities to these committees. A result observed in one
                  village was that village administrators felt discouraged from assisting in the recovery efforts and took
                  on a more passive role.

                  In order to minimize grievances between villages and external actors, villagers expressed
                  a preference for open, participatory approaches to aid delivery. Some village leaders
                  expressed concern that they were given little information about external assistance and were unable
                  to participate in and influence how aid was delivered to their communities. As the examples above
                  suggest, recovery efforts that do not actively engage communities run the risk that communities will
                  act on their own to alter how the aid is delivered. Field research also highlighted the importance of
                  establishing effective mechanisms for voicing complaints so as to minimize the risk of escalation
                  when disagreements arise.


                  VI. RELIEF AND RESPONSE ACTIVITIES: SOCIAL PROTECTION

                  Support from development partners
                  Before the floods, development partners provided social assistance through unconditional food and
                  cash transfers, and through cash/food for work programs for vulnerable populations (Figure 53).
                  Among development partners, the World Food Programme (WFP) and LIFT are the biggest financers
                  and are active in the dry zone, the delta, northern Rakhine, Shan, and Chin. Emergency support (cash
                  and in-kind aid) has largely focused on the border states.180

                  As part of the recent flood response, development partners have adapted their operations
                  to focus on food distribution and essential nonfood items.181 Food support has been channeled

                  protection services, including child protection and gender based violence” (OCHA 2015b).

largely through the WFP and has reached nearly half a million people,182 covering one-third of the
people displaced by the floods. Several agencies, including OCHA and its partners, PACT Myanmar
and Network Activities Group, have also provided food and non-food items. The Myanmar Red Cross
Society (MCRS), International Organization for Migration, and Plan International have distributed
reconstruction/shelter kits to more than 20,000 beneficiaries, while UNICEF and others have provided
psychosocial support to affected households.  

Cash support has been more limited, with some regional variations.183 Cash accounts for 98
percent of the response provided in Rakhine, 49 percent in Magway, and 42 percent in Chin, while it
makes up less than 4 percent in Ayeyarwady, Yangon, and Kayin. Adventist Development and Relief
Agency (ADRA) and MCRS have provided cash for agricultural inputs, WASH (water, sanitation, and
hygiene), food, and shelter, as well as cash for work in selected areas in Ayeyarwady, Chin, Magway,
Rakhine, and Sagaing.

Cash support is expected to become more prominent in the near future as part of early
recovery activities. CARE has plans to introduce a two-month cash support program for
agricultural inputs in Rakhine, while WFP plans to provide unconditional cash or food transfers to
170,000 people in Ayeyarwady, Chin, Magway, Rakhine, and Sagaing before the end of 2015.184 For
an expected period of six months, the International Committee of the Red Cross and MCRS plan to
offer cash grants for rebuilding livelihoods as well as cash for work to clean debris and enable use of
basic infrastructure.185 In the coming three months, WFP will also support 40,000 people and their
households by providing daily labor opportunities under cash-for-work projects.

Psychosocial support and awareness raising about protection issues have been part of the
response. The Department of Social Welfare (DSW), with support by UNICEF, deployed its existing
cadre of nearly 100 case managers to provide psychosocial support in Chin, Rakhine, Sagaing,
and Magway States and Regions.186 UNICEF and local nongovernmental and community-based
organizations have offered psychosocial support through 50 temporary child-friendly spaces in
temporary evacuation centers, and have sent 30 mobile psychosocial support teams to hard-to-
reach areas; so far they have reached 9,350 boys and girls. In total, the child protection subsector
has reached around 15,000 children. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) also provides
psychosocial support to women and girls in these states and regions, with gender-based violence
case workers operating out of mobile medical clinics. In addition to these activities, International

                  Rescue Committee creates awareness of protection issues such as gender-based violence in Sittwe
                  Township, Rakhine State, while Halo raises awareness about landmines moved by floods in Hpa An,
                  Kayin State.

                  The majority of people who were temporarily displaced by floods and landslides have since
                  been able to return to their homes, as flood waters have receded in most areas;187 but people
                  living in temporary camps have special vulnerabilities that may call for additional and/or
                  tailored support. It may take internally displaced persons longer to restore their livelihoods, and they
                  may need additional assistance in accessing services, as well as additional food and/or cash relief. For
                  instance, in Chin camps 67 percent of IDPs said that the support they were currently receiving was
                  insufficient.188 The need may be particularly great for special groups such a pregnant and lactating
                  women—present among Chin IDPs in large numbers—who lack access to supplementary feeding to
                  cover their nutritional needs. In addition, many of the IDPs currently in camps may stay there for more
                  than three months, since their houses were either severely damaged or else located in a hazardous
                  area to which they cannot return. Longer stays mean changing needs that would have to be catered
                  for during an early recovery phase, and potentially, beyond (e.g., temperature drops in the winter may
                  call for winter clothes distribution). Longer stays may also strain available resources for IDP support
                  and increase vulnerability to future shocks, as evidence from IDPs in Rakhine suggests.189

Geographic coverage
Relief and Resettlement Department spending by township shows, for the most part, higher
levels of response in townships with larger numbers of affected residents.190 For instance,
Pwintbyu, Magway, has the highest number of affected people (115,478), as well as the highest level
of response, among townships (K 137.3 million). Kalay in Sagaing region comes second in terms of
population affected (85,124) with a response of K 47.2 million However, challenges remain in terms of
coverage of highly affected townships and hard-to-reach areas (e.g., Chin and Rakhine); for instance,
Kyaunggon in Ayeyarwady had an estimated 55,140 people affected but only received K 1.1 million
of support.

VII. USING SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMS FOR RECOVERY191

Social protection programs are used around the world, including in the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region, to help those affected by emergencies to
cope with shocks, and to support them in meeting their basic needs and recovering and
protecting their livelihoods. Having social protection programs and delivery mechanisms in place
can help households cope with and recover from disasters in the short, medium, and long term.

                    Existing programs and delivery systems can enable quick response and help reduce the
                    impact of natural hazards. In the Philippines, the government scaled up its existing conditional
                    cash transfer program and used the same delivery mechanisms to channel food and cash transfers to
                    affected households in the program and to identify households for cash-for-work and cash-for-asset-
                    rebuilding programs. The conditional cash transfer program was modified to make unconditional
                    transfers available to help support disaster-affected families.

                    Social protection programs can provide a common platform for pooling development
                    partner funds to respond to disaster. This is demonstrated by Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net
                    Program, where the risk financing mechanism ensured financial commitments from donors were put
                    in place before any crises occurred. In the Philippines, the government used the conditional cash
                    transfer program to channel donor funding for emergency response efforts when Cyclone Haiyan hit.

                    Social transfer programs can provide multi-year and predictable assistance that can
                    help people accumulate assets to buffer disaster losses and can reduce the long-term
                    economic impact of disasters. Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net Program shows how an ad hoc
                    emergency response can be transformed into a comprehensive, sustainable, and scalable social
                    protection and disaster risk management program. The reforms have helped reduce response
                    time from eight to two months and reduced the need for emergency response and human losses.
                    Ethiopia’s program consists of cash-for-work projects to improve environmental assets (60 percent of
                    projects in soil and water conservation); unconditional food/cash transfers for the poorest 10 percent;
                    an insurance-for-work scheme in a particularly disaster-prone area; a contingency budget to respond
                    to sudden emergency needs; and a risk financing mechanism for use when the contingency fund
                    is insufficient (see Figure 56). The program provides long-term support to chronically food-insecure
                    rural households to help them cope with shocks, reduce disaster risk through asset creation and
                    rehabilitation of their natural environment, and build household resilience. The financing mechanisms
                    allow the program to scale up to provide assistance to risk-prone households when necessary. Long-
                    term support offered by the program has helped reverse the trend of deteriorating livelihoods despite
                    climatic shocks. Timely and predictable assistance has enabled households to manage risk more
                    effectively and avoid negative coping strategies and food insecurity.

Community-driven development (CDD) programs have also provided platforms for rapid
response in short- and long-term resilience building by directly involving communities (see
Box 1). For example, following the Pakistan earthquake in 2005, the Pakistan Poverty Alleviation
Fund was able to set up disaster relief centers and provide support in 2,000 communities within
one day, and US$220 million in cash transfers was delivered to households.192 Indonesia’s PNPM
Mandiri CDD program was used to provide unconditional cash transfers to the poorest and most-
affected households as part of response and recovery efforts after the 2004 tsunami in Aceh and
other disaster events between 2005 and 2010.

      CDD approaches provide a common platform at local level: CDD structures can be the                               post-disaster
      main decision-making structures for support provided, which saves time and effort for both                       recovery
      implementers and villagers.

      They strengthen social cohesion through participatory planning mechanisms, for instance in
      the identification of vulnerable groups or infrastructure needs: this is particularly important for
      cash-for-work schemes that sometimes use community-based targeting to ensure vulnerable
      households are reached by the program. Projects to be developed through cash for work can
      be more pro-poor when selected in a participatory and inclusive manner.

      They enable greater distributional equity across villages: by minimizing the risk of leaving
      similar villages left underserved and providing a common platform to channel support to
      neighboring villages, CDD approaches can minimize intervillage rivalry after disasters.

      They serve as information channels: CDD platforms can facilitate information sharing about
      local recovery efforts (beneficiaries, financial information) and keep communities updated
      about recovery efforts and decisions taken at more centralized levels.

Description
The President’s Instructions and the National Action Plan accordingly outline a variety of categorical
benefits that would be delivered to specific vulnerable groups that were identified in the Strategy
Plan, along with a household benefit that would be delivered to the poorest within the most-affected
households (see Figure 57).

                   Financing proposal and justification
                   The government has identified roughly K 5 billion equivalent in (preliminary) financing sources for the
                   categorical benefits listed above, and the need for another K 6.25 billion equivalent in financing for
                   the household benefit. This preliminary financing has not been fully secured or agreed on. Limiting
                   financing to these levels would raise significant issues of equity and exclusion. A detailed economic
                   and demographic assessment  demonstrates that financing at these levels would reach only about
                   10 percent of those in the affected categories, with the household benefit reaching at most 6.5
                   percent of affected households. This means that very large numbers of affected households will be
                   excluded from support, given the high levels of preexisting income poverty experienced by a large
                   majority of the affected population and the significant damage that was incurred in these areas. This
                   problem is significantly ameliorated by higher levels of financing.

                   Table 92 presents four financing options and their implications for overall population coverage and
                   expenditure level. The four options are as follows:

                      •	 Option A (preferred):  Option A covers the full range of beneficiaries in the Action Plan in all 43
                         affected townships, with roughly 75 percent of affected categorical groups covered (with the
                         additional household benefit covering up to 6.5 percent of households), leading to a high level
                         of equity and inclusion in the delivery of assistance.

    •	 Option B: Option B covers all of the groups in the President’s Instructions, but for fiscal
       reasons changes the eligibility criteria, and drops benefits for people with disabilities (who are
       listed in the Action Plan but not the Instructions).  This option covers 65–70 percent of affected
       categorical groups, and the same level of households under the household benefit.
    •	 Option C:  Option C shows the fiscal impact of reducing the geographic scope of benefit to 20
       townships. These can be selected from the 43 by direct economic losses and per capita GDP.
       While significant cost reductions can be achieved with high coverage, this option may not be
       attractive, as the 43 townships have already been identified as priority areas for engagement.
    •	 Option D: Option D outlines the implications of moving forward at current funding levels.

It would not be fiscally feasible to offer all households in these affected areas a blanket benefit
(estimated at approximately K 1,300 million to K 1,400 million equivalent over six months if each
household receives the equivalent of a minimum food basket, or approximately K 13,000 per person
per month).

                  Medium- to long-term continuation of these benefits would cost roughly K 110 million per year for
                  Option A, K 65 million per year for Option B, K 50 million per year for Option C, and K 22.5 million
                  per year for Option D. The medium-term needs include the development and capacity building of
                  MSWRR/DSW offices in each of the affected townships. This deployment would establish the ability of
                  the MSWRR/DSW to support its social protection and emergency relief mandates over the long term,
                  and would be consistent with the measures outlined in the Strategy Plan. The related infrastructure
                  and equipment costs are estimated at roughly K 712.5 million in the flood-affected townships.  
                  Staffing costs are estimated at roughly K 570 million per year for all of the offices. Operational costs
                  would be approximately K 56.25 million per year for all of the offices, with total staffing/operational
                  costs accordingly at roughly K 625 million per year (or roughly 1 percent of program costs under
                  Option A).


                  Operational arrangements: Flood recovery cash transfer
                  Detailed operational guidance has been developed to guide the implementation of the flood recovery
                  cash transfers by the government.195

                  The Department of Social Welfare has the oversight of the overall program, and is responsible for
                  the following key tasks: overall program coordination; budget management in coordination with the
                  Ministry of Finance; training of all stakeholders involved in the implementation of the program at
                  national and subnational levels; ensuring that beneficiaries, including those in remote areas, have
                  access to benefit; preparation of communication materials for effective beneficiary mobilization; and
                  monitoring and learning to improve efficiency in the delivery of the program as well as facilitate the
                  transition into longer-term social protection programming.

                  The General Administration Department at township and village tract levels will play a lead role in
                  the following areas: mobilization, identification, and registration of beneficiaries; consolidation and
                  adjustment of beneficiary lists; and cash transit from state/region to village tract level and support to
                  cash distributions.

                  The Myanmar Maternal and Child Welfare Association in close coordination with village leaders in all
                  targeted townships will perform the following tasks: information dissemination at the village level and
                  support to beneficiary identification and registration; cash distributions and records; and facilitation of
                  local-level complaint mechanisms.

                  Description
                  Cash/food for work programs serve two objectives: (i) creation of jobs for persons facing
                  temporary or seasonal unemployment, and (ii) creation and maintenance of small-scale
                  community infrastructure. They provide temporary employment at low wages mainly
                  to unskilled workers in rural areas. Both the Social Protection Strategic Plan and the Rural
                  Development Strategic Framework call for the introduction of a cash/food for work program in
                  Myanmar.

                  There is considerable experience of cash/food for work programs in Myanmar, with
                  variations depending on local context. In the dry zone, these programs focus on ensuring
                  seasonal food and livelihood security (especially during the agricultural lean season); in the delta

they focus mainly on post-disaster recovery; and in conflict-affected areas in the border states they
respond to multiple needs of communities, such as post-disaster recovery after Cyclone Giri (Rakhine)
and reconciliation and social cohesion (Tanintharyi). These experiences yield important lessons in
designing a government-led flood recovery cash-for-work program.197 See Table 93 for the proposed

Source: Design draws upon lessons from the experience of implementing cash/food for work programs in Myanmar (Infante Villarroel
2015b); Cash for Work Guidelines developed by the Cash Working Group after the floods; minutes of the Cash Working Group meetings
September–October (CWG 2015); and estimates of damage to rural infrastructure and estimated needs (from DRD).
Note: Average cash benefit based on minimum wage of K 3,600 for unskilled labor, with a 70:30 ratio of unskilled to skilled workers; lower
benefits would be considered based on market wages for unskilled labor, minimizing distortions to local labor markets. Workday is defined
as 5–6 hours/day.

                    Assumptions and implementation
                          •	 Wage setting. Minimum wage in Myanmar is K 3,600 per workday (8 hours). In the calculations,
                             this rate was integrated as the base wage for unskilled labor, while 30 percent more was added
                             for skilled labor (i.e., approximately K 5,000 per day). As the program will require both skilled
                             and unskilled labor, the average daily wage is set to be K 4,000 per day (accounting for 70
                             percent of unskilled workers and 30 of skilled workers). This is consistent with reports on the
                             average market wage (for men; women typically receive less, according to the Cash Working
                             Group October 9 minutes). These amounts may need to be readjusted at the onset of the
                             program depending on (i) local market rates for daily wages and average cost of the food
                             basket (to avoid disrupting the labor market, wages should be set to ensure minimum income
                             security without destroying regular job opportunities); and (ii) working time in the program
                             (whether 8 hours or 5–6 hours).
                          •	 Take-up rate. The number of people who would take up the program is estimated at 15
                             percent of the affected active age population for the medium-term scenario, representing
                             191,471 people. At this first stage, though all affected townships would be targeted, not all

                                                                                                                                    annexes




         villages would be covered by the program, depending on the extent to which villages were
         affected/the extent of damages and food insecurity. The number of people who would take up
         the program is estimated to increase up to 3.2 percent of the whole rural active age population
         for the long-term scenario, which is in line with international practice.198 The program should
         be implemented progressively, focusing on the most food-insecure areas.
      •	 Projections.199 Sources of data include population projections from United Nations Department
         of Economic and Social Affairs, government expenditure from International Monetary Fund,
         GDP and inflation forecasts, and poverty data from the IHLCA-2.


Other costs:

      •	 Equipment and material costs. In Myanmar, these costs are already covered by reallocations
         to the reconstruction budgets. In the medium-term scenario, a part of this reconstruction
         budget can be reallocated for labor costs under the cash-for-work program. In the long-term
         scenario, the government would need to assess the budget already allocated to infrastructure
         work that can be delivered through the cash-for-work program. If the program is based on the
         CDD platforms, budget allocation for equipment and material is already there.
      •	 Administrative costs. In Myanmar, government social protection programs have
         administrative costs of 15–30 percent on average. These costs vary depending on whether
         existing government structures are used, and they will fall as new technologies (i.e., mobile
         money) emerge. The Department of Rural Development (DRD) already has an established
         presence on the ground that is integrated into the government budget.
      •	 Child care and training components. The long-term scenario integrates child care facilities
         and vocation training, which respectively can enhance women’s participation and foster
         graduation from poverty. These options would need to be further developed at the onset of
         the program.

In the medium-term, implementation through DRD structures can follow a scaled-down version of
the model followed for the CDD program, where DRD structures at union and township levels are
supported by union technical advisers and local implementing partners such as NGOs. Union-level
technical advisers support DRD with procurement, financial management, training, and administration
roles, if need be. At township level, technical advisory teams provided by implementing partners
assist DRD township officers with planning, operations, training, and monitoring. These teams also
support communities in project planning and implementation, and they work directly with villages and
village tract–level structures.

In summary, DRD would be responsible for overall program management, oversight, grievance redress,
and monitoring, with or without the support of union-level advisers. Implementing partners would
support implementation of program processes at the local level by generating awareness, mobilizing
the community for project selection, managing the work site (including beneficiary management and
payments), and providing technical advice. In the long term, implementation of the cash/food for work
program could be embedded in the CDD program. The role of private sector banks would also grow
as cash payments evolve into electronic payments in the long term.
