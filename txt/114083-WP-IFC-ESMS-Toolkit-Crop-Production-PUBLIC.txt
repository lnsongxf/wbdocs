Welcome & How to Use This ESMS
Toolkit and Case Studies
                             Environmental and social responsibility is becoming more and
                             more important in today’s global economy. There are thousands
                             of environmental and social codes and standards in the world
                             today. The codes and standards define the rules and the
                             objectives. But the challenge is in the implementation. An
                             environmental and social management system helps companies
                             to integrate the rules and objectives into core business
                             operations, through a set of clearly defined, repeatable
                             processes.

                             In the following pages, we provide tools to build or enhance your
                             environmental and social management system (ESMS). Section I is
                             the Toolkit – sample documents, blank forms, flowcharts,
                             checklists and templates. There are tools for each of the nine
                             elements in your ESMS. Section II is the Case Studies – examples
                             of how two different companies used the tools and developed
                             and implemented an ESMS appropriate to the size and nature of
                             their business.

                             As you go through the Toolkit and Case Studies, you may want to
                             refer back to the companion publication, the ESMS
                             Implementation Handbook, which gives more background on
                             each of the nine ESMS elements.

                             It is important to remember that simply creating a book of
                             policies and procedures is not the end - just the beginning. They
                             need to be implemented and turned into consistent processes.
                             Continual improvement requires people that are committed to
                             the effort. It requires trained people that have the right attitude,
                             skills and knowledge. It requires leadership. Our hope is that,
                             with this in mind, a company can use our ESMS tools to help
                             accelerate the journey of continual improvement, for its own
                             benefit and that of its employees and stakeholders.

 Policies
 Introduction

                              Policies are the foundation of your Environmental and Social
                              Management System (ESMS). They are the rules that you expect
                              your people to follow and the public statement you make about
                              what your company believes in and how you strive to conduct
                              your business.

                              The process of adopting environmental and social policies
                              provides a company with an opportunity to think about and
                              discuss what is important. Ultimately, it also enables you to gain
                              the commitment and support of senior management as they
                              approve and communicate the policies.

Sample CEO Letter announcing the ESMS - Internal
To all employees of our company:
Our vision for our company is to become one of the most respected and admired crop production
companies in our area. We aspire to conduct ourselves in an ethical and responsible manner. Corporate
social responsibility, which spans environmental, human rights, labor and social issues, is a growing concern
to investors, consumers and to all of us as people.
To integrate corporate social responsibility into our day-to-day business activities, we are developing and
implementing an environmental and social management system (ESMS). A management system is trained,
committed people routinely following procedures and continually improving.
I ask for your full cooperation in this important initiative. We believe that corporate social responsibility
must be a foundation of our long-term growth and profitability. Not only is it an integral part of our overall
business strategy, but it is also the right thing to do. It is the right thing for our customers, our suppliers, our
shareholders, our communities and for you, as a core part of this company.
As we strive to successfully implement our ESMS, we will train and involve you throughout the process.
[Person’s name and title] is in charge of this corporate social responsibility initiative. Each of you has a direct
line of communication with [person] for any suggestions or concerns. I thank you for your efforts and your
continued dedication to our success.

Identification of Risks and Impacts
Introduction

                             Identifying your risks can seem like a daunting task, but don’t be
                             overwhelmed. Scale your program as appropriate for the size and
                             complexity of your company. But remember, small companies
                             can have the same risks and potentially severe environmental and
                             social impacts as large companies.

                             Think of your risk identification and assessment as a value-added
                             activity, an opportunity to gather information that will help to
                             effectively improve your operations. A risk identification and
                             assessment is an ongoing process; situations change over time, so
                             it should be repeated at regular intervals.

                             When identifying your risks, be mindful of the different risks that
                             women and men may encounter. Also, consider the risks to
                             people outside your company – your external stakeholders.

Risk Identification Worksheet
Instructions:
Complete the worksheet to help you focus on the areas where your company might have potential risks.
This is not designed to tell you whether your company actually has this problem; it is just used to point you
to areas where problems are more likely to happen, allowing you to pay more attention to those areas.
Consult with appropriate people inside and outside your company to complete the worksheet. For each
line, circle the appropriate answer.

Process Mapping Tool
Instructions:
A process map or flowchart visually describes the flow of activities of a process, from beginning to end. Below
is an example of a blank process map.
Please look at the case study for company ABC , a pineapple plantation in the Philippines in Section II of this
Toolkit to see how this map can be completed and followed through.
While developing the process map, you need to identify all activities and processes; and the inputs
(seeds/saplings, water, agrochemicals, energy inputs) and outputs (agrochemical residues, water run-offs,
etc.) from each of these activities.
Process maps are particularly useful in identifying environmental risks, occupational health and safety
hazards and areas for process improvement. They are also helpful to identify whether you can improve the
work flow, which can benefit the workers and improve operational efficiency.
After you write down your process map, look at each activity and think of:
     •    the occupational health and safety hazards;
     •    the environmental, social and community risks; and
     •    the opportunities for waste reduction and resource conservation (water, energy, agrochemical,
          manpower, etc.)
It is very important that people at all levels in your company participate in the identification of risks,
opportunities and possible solutions. Supervisors and workers are a valuable resource in helping you learn
about the way things actually work in the plantation or farm. If you can’t have all the necessary people in a
room, you can ask supervisors consult with the workers in their area and provide you with information about
the activities they oversee.
After you have identified the risks and opportunities for each step, you can think of the possible solutions.
These can range from revising your crop practices (such as crop rotation and increased mechanization) to
better control the risks, to improving the use of personal protective equipment by your workers and
converting to organic practices or reducing the use of hazardous agrichemicals. This will form the basis of
the Action Plan you will prepare in the Management Program chapter.

Physical Mapping Tool
Instructions
Prepare a map of the layout of your plantation/agriculture farm. The map should include storage sheds for
agrochemicals and farm equipment, security guard posts, planted areas, packaging depots, first aid huts and
watering systems. You can use this map again later when you develop your emergency preparedness plan.
Once you have the physical map, do a walk-through to observe existing or potential problems.
Whenever you encounter a problem, write it down and mark it on the map (see example for case study XYZ ,
a sugar plantation in Nicaragua in Section II of this Toolkit). The walk-through should be conducted during
working hours with a team that includes supervisors and workers, since they often know what the problems
are and have ideas about necessary improvements.

                                               HERE ARE SOME THINGS TO LOOK FOR:

     •     Where and how are people most likely to become injured (from falls, cuts, strains, etc.)?
           Identify trip, slip and fall hazards (falling objects or fall from elevated places) and injury from
           plantation vehicles and chemical spillages?
     •     Are the plantation equipment, tools and machinery designed and maintained efficiently to
           reduce worker strain and operate safely?
     •     Where could the accidental release of hazardous materials occur? Is there adequate and
           appropriate response equipment close to those areas?
     •     Are chemicals labeled and safely stored with compatible materials? What is the likelihood and
           consequence of an accidental spillage?
     •     Are there existing or potential leakages from gaskets and drums (of, for example, pesticides and
           fertilizers)?
     •     Where are there high levels of water consumption or discharge? Identify all potential water
           consumption and discharge sources (e.g. flood irrigation, surface run-offs, workers’ residential
           facilities, etc.)?
     •     Where is most of the waste produced and what is done with it?
     •     Are input materials (e.g. seeds, saplings, agrochemicals, fuel for machinery, etc.) being used
           efficiently? Where are materials being wasted?
     •     Where are workers exposed to hazardous chemicals (pesticides, fertilizers and other
           agricultural agents), excessive dust, sun and extreme high temperatures, and humidity? Do
           workers have appropriate personal protective equipment (PPEs)? Are they using it correctly?
     •     Has the land use by the plantation negatively affected nearby residents either through emission
           of air pollutants (burning of crops), water pollutants (agrochemicals) or land encroachment?
     •     In general, are there places or work processes where it is clear there are bad habits?



After the walk-through, meet with the team and discuss what has been observed. Also, talk about previous
incidents or accidents that have occurred in the plant and what have been the consequences.
The information you collect in the walk-through will form the basis of the action plans you will prepare (see
Chapter 3. Management Programs – Toolkit).

Risk Assessment Form
Instructions
It might not be feasible or practical to address every risk. Where it is necessary to prioritize your actions, try
to avoid or minimize the most potentially severe risks.
Complete this form based on the risks that you identified using the previous tools. Identify the probability
that a certain risk will occur, and the potential severity of the impacts. For example, a major flood or
earthquake may be unlikely to occur (low probability), but the damage to your people and facility could be
extremely high (high impact).
When prioritizing issues to be addressed, consider opportunities for cost reduction through reduced water
and energy consumption, reduced waste generation and other similar considerations.

 Introduction

                              A management program is centered on the action plans and
                              improved procedures to help you to avoid, minimize or
                              compensate for the risks and impacts you’ve identified.

                              We present three tools related to this element:

                                      •    Action Plan Chart

                                      •    Outline of Procedure

                                      •    Sample Procedure - Flowchart

                              Refer to case ABC and case XYZ in Section II of this Toolkit for
                              an illustration of how these tools can be put to use.

Action Plan Chart
Instructions
Use the Action Plan Chart to identify the actions you will take to address risks and how those actions will be managed. List each risk that you identified and
prioritized in the previous section. Write down the actions that you could take to avoid, minimize or compensate/offset the risk. Assign a responsible party and a
deadline. Identify the resources required and the operational procedures you will need to adopt.

Outline of Procedure
As you implement the Action Plan, it is helpful to define procedures that clearly systematize the actions into
routine, daily processes and practices. Procedures can be text, flowcharts, pictograms – whatever you find to
be the most effective communication tool for your company. Below is an outline of the important
components of a well-defined procedure.

Introduction

                             A well-implemented ESMS is ultimately about trained, committed
                             people. Senior management commitment is critical, but beyond
                             that you need people throughout the company who take
                             responsibility for the ESMS. This does not mean that the ESMS
                             becomes everyone’s full-time job. You should scale the system to
                             meet your company’s size and structure.

                             Remember that there needs to be a progression from awareness
                             to commitment to implementation. Think about this as you plan
                             the relevant training. For each training module, think about
                             whether the goal is to raise awareness, gain commitment or give
                             people the knowledge and skills they need to implement.

                             We present two tools related to this element:

                                     •    Training Plan Worksheet

                                          Implementing an ESMS

                             Think about ways to adapt these for your company.

Emergency Preparedness and Response
Introduction

                             Even with good systems in place, emergencies can and do
                             happen. The key is to plan in advance – try to prevent as much as
                             you can, and train your employees to know what to do in case
                             something does happen. Don’t be overwhelmed by the thought
                             of planning for every single possible accident or emergency. Look
                             at your risk assessment and focus on the areas where
                             emergencies are most likely to happen or cause significant harm.
                             Develop and implement a suitable “emergency preparedness and
                             management plan” for the identified emergency situation.

                             As part of the plan, you need detailed procedures on the steps to
                             prepare and respond to an emergency. Here we provide samples
                             of procedures for responding to two common emergencies in
                             crop production - natural disasters (typhoons, hurricanes,
                             tornadoes, earthquakes, landslides, flooding and droughts) and
                             chemical spillages and contamination (pesticides).

                             We present two tools related to this element:

Typhoon Response and Preparedness Procedure
Title: Typhoon Response Procedure
Procedure number: EM001
Number of pages: 5 pages


1.0 Purpose and Scope:
     1.1. Purpose: Set out responsibilities and activities in order to respond to emergency
           resulting from the typhoon. Identify the roles, responsibilities and authorities to
           effectively facilitate the farm/plantation’s emergency preparedness and response.
     1.2. Scope: This procedure applies to all activities at [Name of Company].
2.0 Definitions:
     2.1. EMERGENCY: Situation that poses immediate threat of:
          a.      injuries and damage to health;
          b.      fatalities;
          c.      damage to property; or
          d.      damage to environment.
     2.2. TYPHOON EMERGENCY: Situation that poses or signals immediate threat in the form of:
          a.      uncontrolled flooding or imminent threat of uncontrolled flooding;
          b.      wind causing property damage;
          c.      collateral damage caused by typhoon such as uncontrolled release or spillage of
                  flammable or combustible substance(s); or
          d.      sounding of typhoon or windstorm alarm.
3.0 Responsibility and Authority: This procedure is the responsibility of the operations
     manager or designate. The operations manager shall report to the president in matters
     related to emergency preparedness, and shall have total authority during emergency
     situations. The operations manager shall have the authority to declare a state of emergency.
     In the absence of the operations manager, these authorities shall revert to the president.
4.0 Work Instructions: The Emergency Response Centre (ERC) shall monitor the weather
     condition for typhoon and rainstorm. The ERC shall keep track of weather conditions for the
     approach of a typhoon and alert the ERT members when typhoon signal number 1 or 3 is
     hoisted.


     The ERC shall make a public announcement via the P/A system when a No. 8 typhoon warning
     signal has been confirmed (both during and after office hours). Upon notification of a number
     8 typhoon or a black rainstorm warning, all personnel shall be advised to return indoors as
     soon as possible.

TYPHOON RESPONSE PROCEDURE

Pre-typhoon Planning

     •     Staff and train an emergency response team (ERT), whose members are willing to stay on site
           during a typhoon (if safe to do so). Ask for volunteers. Arrange for support/assistance during the
           storm for families of those who will remain at the facility. Also, notify local emergency
           preparedness authorities about your plans to have personnel on site.
     •     Designate a weather monitor, who will report weather conditions and keep the ERT leader up to
           date on conditions before, during and after a windstorm. Involve local government and liaise with
           other businesses.
     •     Give the ERT leader the authority to implement the plan, based on predetermined checkpoints (e.g.,
           when a storm is within a certain distance from the farm/plantation). This responsibility includes
           shutting down operations and sending personnel home.

     •     The ERT leader shall ensure that the farm/plantation manager(s) carry out predetermined tasks at
           each warning stage of the storm. To guarantee this, task checklists should be distributed to all those
           involved, completed and returned to the ERT leader.

     •     Assess levels of insurance coverage for storm, typhoon and flood damage.

     •     Install appropriate system to warn employees in real-time.

     •     Provide safe shelters or structures that can protect employees and designate a safe evacuation
           route to them.

     •     Provide radio and communication systems and appropriate PPE.

Advance preparedness steps
     •     Identify all critical areas of a facility, and make sure someone on all shifts knows the proper
           shutdown procedures and is authorized to implement them.

     •     Maintain an updated list of the telephone numbers and contacts for local offices for emergency
           preparedness and your local FM Global office. Contact local authorities to plan and coordinate
           activities before the need for emergency action. That way, both you and they will be better
           prepared.

     •     Arrange backup communications, such as two-way radios or cellular phones, and have spare
           batteries and a diesel-driven emergency generator on site.

     •     Arrange an off-site emergency communications control center, such as a hotel meeting room, just
           outside the typhoon area, in case it becomes too dangerous to remain on site.

     •     Determine which company records are vital, and make plans to protect/relocate them.

     •     Identify a hot site (an off-site data processing location where you can continue business
           immediately).

     •     Maintain ongoing agreements with contractors for supplies and repairs that may be needed after a
           typhoon. If possible, use contractors who are from outside potential typhoon areas. Local
           contractors may be over-committed.

     •     Order emergency supplies and maintain them throughout the typhoon season.

     •     Have straps or other means on hand to brace/anchor yard storage, signs, plantation vehicles and
           roof-mounted equipment.

     •     Inspect and repair roof coverings and edges a few months before typhoon season.

     •     Provide pre-fitted windstorm shutters and/or plywood for windows and doorways where practical.
     •     Prepare for typhoon-related flooding with sandbags and an ample supply of brooms, squeegees and
           absorbents.

     •     Identify key equipment that must be protected with tarpaulins or waterproof covers.
     •     Identify and consider removal of any large trees that could fall and damage buildings or power and
           communication lines.

     •     Have plans in place for site security after a typhoon.

Impending Windstorm
Your country’s weather service will provide advance warning to those in areas likely to be in the path of
an approaching storm. The warning stages differ from country to country, and you should be familiar with
the system applied where your facilities are located. Typhoons also can be tracked on the internet.

     •     Map the typhoon front and stay up-to-date on the storm’s progress.

     •     Begin implementing your typhoon emergency action plan. Take specific actions based on the
           predetermined checkpoints outlined in your plan (you have, for example, already determined that you will
           begin shutting down processes when a storm is a certain distance away).

     •     Shut down operations that require outside power sources (for example, packaging and packing houses, HR
           offices) in an orderly manner, following established procedures.

     •     Inspect and make emergency repairs to drains, gutters and flashing.

     •     Check/maintain all necessary backup equipment, such as emergency generators and communication
           devices.

     •     Protect/relocate vital records.

     •     Install typhoon shutters/plywood over windows and doors.

     •     Take the following steps to ensure that items outdoors will not blow away or cause damage: remove all
           loose debris, anchor or relocate all nonessential equipment to a safe indoor location, secure storage of
           flammable liquid drums, or move them to a sheltered area, anchor all portable buildings (e.g. trailers) to the
           ground.

     •     Inspect all fire protection equipment, such as sprinkler control valves and fire pumps.

     •     Ensure that the ERT members who volunteer to stay on site have proper supplies and equipment
           (drinkable water, nonperishable food, medical, flashlights, and walkie-talkies).

     •     Have cash on hand for post-typhoon needs, such as buying food and supplies, or paying employees and
           contractors.
     •     Repair and fill above-ground tanks with water.

     •     Fill fuel tanks of generators, fire pumps and all company-owned vehicles.

     •     Protect computer and machinery with tarpaulins and waterproof covers.

     •     Isolate, neutralize or remove from the site any chemicals that can react violently with each other.

     •     Shut off gas to minimize fire loss.

     •     Shut down all noncritical and nonessential electrical equipment.

During the Windstorm
     •     Emergency response personnel should stay at the facility only if safe to do so.

     •     Patrol the property continuously and watch for roof leaks, pipe breakage, fire or structural damage. During
           the height of a windstorm, personnel should remain in a place that has been identified as safe from winds
           and flooding.

     •     During power failure, turn off electrical switches to prevent reactivation before necessary checks are
           completed.

After the Windstorm
     •     Secure the site.
     •     Survey for damage.

     •     Survey for safety hazards such as live wires, leaking gas or flammable liquids, and damage to foundations or
           underground piping.
     •     Call in key personnel and notify contractors to start repairs. Make sure safety systems are fully
           implemented before work is allowed to begin.

     •     Begin salvage processes as soon as possible to prevent further damage: cover broken windows and torn
           roof coverings, make safe fallen trees.

     •     Clean roof drains and remove debris from roof to prevent drainage problems.

     •     Visually check any conductors and exposed insulators before restarting main electrical distribution
           systems.


5.0 First Aid and Rescue Operation
     In case of an injury, call the ERC. Call for local Government Emergency Services directly if the
     situation is urgent or serious and inform ERC subsequently as soon as practicable.

     •     Do not conduct rescue operations unless you are trained to perform a proper rescue or the situation is safe
           for conducting a rescue operation.

     •     Do not move an injured person, especially when there are signs of spinal injury or bone fracture, unless it is
           absolutely necessary to do so for safety reasons.

     •     Keep the injured or ill person comfortable, warm, and lying down.

     •     First aid treatment should be given, preferably by trained persons.
6.0 Emergency Response Team:
The purpose of the Emergency Response Team is to deal with Typhoon, Rainstorm and other catastrophic
accidents. The team should meet immediately when an emergency situation is reported to determine the
course of action.

Stakeholder Engagement
Introduction

                             Your company interacts with many different groups of
                             stakeholders. A stakeholder is any person or organization that
                             has an interest in or is affected (or perceives to be affected) by
                             your company. Engaging with stakeholders will help you
                             understand how to avoid or minimize any negative impact and
                             reduce the risks to your business from anti-company sentiments
                             and negative campaigns that could affect your company’s
                             reputation.

                             We present three tools related to this element:

Stakeholder Mapping Tool – Identification and analysis
Instructions
1. Ensure you have a cross-functional/departmental team to start the exercise.
2. List relevant stakeholders for your company (e.g., those directly and indirectly affected by your
   company, those that have an interest in your company operations, those that have an ongoing
   relationship with the company, and those that have the ability to influence your company
   operations). Provide as much detail as possible (i.e. name your main suppliers independently;
   disaggregate communities by identifying local leaders or other relevant actors).
3. Next to each stakeholder group, discuss and list their key concerns, issues, interests.

                        STAKEHOLDER                                      ISSUES/CONCERNS/INTERESTS




4. Place these stakeholders on the stakeholder map according to the degree to which they are impacted
   by your operations and their capacity to influence your company operations.

5. Classify stakeholders according to their current relationship with the company: supportive,
   supportive with conditions, neutral, negative. The purpose of stakeholder engagement is to
   keep supportive stakeholders happy and help address the concerns of less-supportive stakeholders.
   Remember that stakeholders’ relationships with the company may change over time. We
   recommend that you analyze their current position to the company and continue to do it on
   periodic basis.

6. Identify the groups that represent a high priority for engagement.

7. Define strategies to engage with the prioritized stakeholders. When defining engagement
   strategies, keep in mind current initiatives of the company. Engagement strategies should be
   differentiated, based on where stakeholders are located on the map:
     •     Quadrant 1: Involve them as needed
     •     Quadrant 2: Proactively approach and support them
     •     Quadrant 3: Keep them informed
     •     Quadrant 4: Respond to their concerns
8. Review the stakeholder map at regular intervals and when there are major changes. It is advisable
   to review the stakeholder map with external groups to get their feedback.

Impact Zoning Tool for Identifying Affected Communities
Instructions
The term “affected communities” includes any individuals or communities that are located in proximity to
the company’s facilities and are directly exposed to actual or potential adverse impacts on their
environment, health and livelihood due to company activities.
A quick and practical technique for identifying affected communities is the “impact zoning map” (see box
below). By mapping the sphere of influence of different types of environmental and social impacts, the
company can begin to identify distinct groups by impact area, and can then prioritize the stakeholders for
consultation.
While priority should be given to individuals and groups who are directly and adversely affected, drawing a
line between who is affected and who is not can be challenging. Communities lying just outside of the
designated impact area can perceive impacts or feel they have been arbitrarily excluded from the
engagement process.


                                HOW TO IDENTIFY STAKEHOLDERS THROUGH IMPACT ZONING
               1.   Draw a sketch map (see sketch below and case study ABC in Section II as an example) of the
                    key design components of the project, both on- and off-site, that may give rise to local
                    environmental and social impacts (e.g. the project (plantation) site; ancillary infrastructure
                    such as roads, power lines and canals; sources of air, water and land pollution). This may be
                    performed more efficiently by using aerial photographs or satellite images.
               2.   Identify the broad impact zones for each of these components (e.g. the area of land, air and
                    water pollution receptors, etc.).
               3.   After identifying and mapping broad stakeholder groups, overlay those groups with the impact
                    zones.
               4.   Through consultation with relevant stakeholder representatives, verify which groups are
                    potentially affected by which impacts.

Stakeholder Engagement Plan Worksheet
Instructions
After the identification of your most important stakeholders, the next step is to develop a plan for how to
engage with the groups that you listed. Engagement should be stronger and more frequent with those
groups that are most affected and those that have a greater ability to influence your business.
At a minimum, you should always implement an external communication procedure to receive
communications from the public and accordingly adjust your management program. In the presence of
adversely affected stakeholders, you should implement a grievance mechanism and actively engage them in
consultation, regularly disclosing clear and meaningful information and providing communities with
opportunities to express their concerns and suggestions. Finally, you should report back to them on the
actions your company has put in place to address the issues identified during the process of consultation.
The table below provides example of some stakeholders that may be associated with your operations. Once
you have done the stakeholder mapping and identified their concerns, you may start looking at the other
necessary information, such as: engagement method, information to be disclosed or reported back to your
stakeholders, and the key information you would like to obtain.

External Communication and Grievance
Mechanism
Introduction
                             Grievance Mechanism

                             The purpose of a Grievance Mechanism is to establish a way for
                             an individual or a group within communities affected by your
                             business to contact you if they have an inquiry, a concern or a
                             formal complaint. It provides people with an alternative way of
                             communicating with your company as part of your formal
                             stakeholder engagement process.
                             External Communication

                             Even if affected communities per se are not identified, you should
                             always establish and maintain a publicly available and easily
                             accessible channel for members of the public to contact you (e.g.,
                             phone number, website, email address, etc.). External
                             stakeholders can provide valuable information such as:
                             suggestions on product improvement; feedback on customers’
                             interaction with your employees; comments from regulators,
                             NGOs and individuals regarding your company’s environmental
                             and social performance.

Reporting Back to Affected Communities
Introduction

                             Affected stakeholders will want to know what actions your
                             company has put in place to resolve the issues identified when
                             communicating with them. Keeping them informed of what you
                             are doing is the final critical piece in building and maintaining a
                             good relationship.

Monitoring and Management Review
Introduction

                             Monitoring and review are critical components of the ESMS
                             because they enable you to check and adjust your system. You
                             need to monitor whether your action plans are being
                             implemented and procedures are followed, as well as whether
                             your ESMS is addressing the relevant risks and ensuring lasting
                             improvements. The goal of the ESMS is to shift from corrective
                             actions to preventive actions. Monitoring and management
                             review provide you with the necessary information to make that
                             shift.

                             We present two tools for this element:

Auditing Guidance
Instructions
Go through all the areas highlighted in the Auditing Guidance – this will help you to get a broad view of all
potential risk areas and elements of the ESMS beyond those that you may have targeted in your initial risk
assessment.

                                                            A. PREPARATION

       Collect audit reports for the farm/plantation on environmental performance, labor standards performance and
       community stakeholder engagement for the previous two years.

       Collect corrective action plans generated from previous audits and review the status of each action item that was
       agreed upon. Are all closed out? Focus review on open items and the underlying reason(s) for incomplete status, and
       ensure that the audit considers the underlying issues for the upcoming audit. Focus should be on the underlying
       limiting factors that prevent completion.

       Ascertain the general level of PPE use on the farm/plantation. Ensure that auditors wear the same PPE as employees
       are required to wear: head, hearing, eye, skin protection, protective boots, clothing, etc. Do not allow any auditor to
       enter work areas without the clothing/gear required for the operations activity and that employees are required to
       wear.

       Obtain farm/plantation site plans designating cultivated areas, break areas, equipment shed, irrigation sources,
       security guard posts, principal water outlets and drains, any non-potable water outlet. Ensure auditing team has a
       working knowledge of the farm/plantation operation to be evaluated.

       Research and refer to current local environmental and labor laws and regulations.
       Basic labor code issues: (i) regular weekly work hours, (ii) labor contract provisions, (iii) rest periods, lunch, etc., (iv)
       overtime requirements, limits and exceptions, (v) hour averaging and banking hours, (vi) minimum wage, (vii) social
       system payment liability, (viii) annual leave, (ix) laws to protect disadvantaged workers, (x) severance pay.
       Basic environmental code issues: (i) wastewater, (ii) storm water, (iii) spill prevention and response, (iv)cultivation and
       land use and ownership, (v) hazardous materials, (vi) hazardous waste, (vii) toxic chemical release, (viii) air emissions,
       (ix) solid waste.

       Review regulatory permit(s) conditions and specific requirements along with most recent review and corrective action
       reports.

       Review certification(s) audit reports (e.g. Good Agricultural Practices, HACCP) for nonconformance, mandatory
       remedial actions, recommendations, etc. Summarize status of items (open or closed).

       Review any government inspection reports, third-party audit reports, etc.


       Review the stakeholder engagement plan and records of grievances by external stakeholders. Pay attention to
       emergency preparedness and response capability to include the community if necessary; use of pesticides and drift to
       communities; accidental releases of hazardous materials, e.g. chlorine; discharges of wastewater or other wastes to
       areas affecting local communities; exacerbation of flooding; limits of water availability use and physical access;
       diminution of quality of life due to the operation.

       Pay special attention in observation/document review/interviews to issues identified in previous reports.


       Research and understand the national and local context of labor union rights and activity, local environmental groups
       and community activist organizations.

       Schedule sufficient time to conduct the scope of the audit. Announce the availability of confidential meeting schedules
       with employees; schedule, arrange and conduct while protecting employee confidentiality.

         9. Monitoring and Management Review

                                           B. INTRODUCTORY MEETING WITH MANAGEMENT

       Meet with the senior farm or plantation management and local farm or plantation supervisors before conducting audit
       activities to review ESMS issues and the purpose of the audit.

       Share an agenda for the meeting and itinerary with senior management and local supervisors.

       With local supervisors, review the prior audit reports and performance to date in meeting corrective actions.

       Discuss non-retaliation against cooperating workers; inform management that future audits will include reviews of the
       continued employment of workers interviewed.




                                                     C. OPERATIONAL WALK-THROUGH
       Conduct operational walk-through following the flow of crop production from cultivation and planting to packaging
       and shipment. Refer to previous relevant physical walk-through assessments of the farm/plantation; determine if all
       previous nonconformance/action items are closed out; if not, why not?

       Minimize the number of managers and supervisors that accompany you on the walk-through. One or two escorts
       based on knowledge/responsibilities are usually sufficient.

       During the walk-through, be aware of your body language and the message this sends to workers; ensure that you are
       equipped with/wearing the same PPE required of employees.

       Take note of all things observed that require attention:
           1. water used indiscriminately for irrigation/watering as well as washing and cleaning crop;
           2. energy wasted through use of farm machinery or plantation vehicles;
           3. evidence of spillages;
           4. dry cleanup and collection of organic solids;
           5. harborage or other unorganized storage of materials;
           6. wastes and discards;
           7. workplace availability of data on hazards or banned agrichemicals in use (MSDS/ICSC);
           8. movement of materials by farm machinery or plantation vehicles. Are the roads safe, paved and clearly
                marked;
           9. obvious hazards for heads, hearing, sight, life and limb: Workplace hazards attenuated; employee
                awareness?;
           10. PPE used as prescribed, available, replaced at no cost; employee awareness;
           11. Are employees able to explain jobs and responsibilities?; and
           12. Evidence of QA team activity.

       Verify that fire exits in buildings (e.g. storage or maintenance areas, administrative buildings, etc.) exist and open on
       demand; no means to prevent exit; panic bars in good working order; clear egress once exit opened; emergency exits
       clearly marked; nearest exits clearly marked; hose cabinets equipped with hoses, nozzles, etc.; prohibited areas clearly
       marked; electrical cabinets closed and sealed; lockout tag out procedures and tools (tags, locks, warning labels and
       signs) clearly available near electrical cabinets; first aid cabinets and equipment; emergency lighting; emergency
       preparedness and evacuation plans in place; and that employees are trained on using these.

       Indoor working conditions should be verified for adequacy if there is potential for risks such as heat, light, noise and
       dust. Use measuring devices to determine air quality, noise level, temperature. This is a good/easy thing to do.

       Following the farm/plantation walk around, conduct a walk-through of the dormitory facilities, canteens, washrooms,
       changing rooms if relevant. Note the condition and adequacy of these areas.

       Suggest best practice to supervisors and managers during the walk-through; ensure that the suggestion is filtered by
       processes/operations practicalities.

       Give sufficient attention to all ESMS elements during the operation/dormitory walk-through. Knowledge of
       procedures, training using the procedures, awareness of complaints management and resolution procedure,
       employment rights, HR policy and provisions, etc.


IFC ESMS Toolkit and Case Studies – Crop Production               Version 1.1 September 12, 2014                                   60
         9. Monitoring and Management Review

       Identify all incidences of non-conformance with ESMS issues, both major and minor.


       Pay special attention to areas identified in previous corrective action requests. Focus on open non-conformances from
       previous audits: why did they occur? Elucidate the underlying cause and make an effort to diagnose and prescribe
       preventive and ameliorative measures. The individual who is responsible for the item is not as important as why it
       occurred and how the company can prevent non-conformances and unplanned events in the future.




                                                     D. INTERVIEWING WORKERS
       Select at least 5 percent of workers, max. 100 workers. Conduct individual and group interviews for balanced
       response.

       Select workers who are representative of the workforce population (gender, race, age, religion, functional
       departments, etc.).

       If the factory has contracted or migrant workers, make sure to include them as well.


       Do not allow supervisors or managers to influence the selection of workers for interviews or the interviews.


       Conduct on-site interviews in areas that protect worker confidentiality and where the worker would feel comfortable.
       Make sure supervisors or managers are not in or near the space where the interviews are conducted. Keep them away
       from the selection and interview process.

       Conduct interviews early in the audit to allow for follow-up.


       Make sure to tell the workers that everything they say is confidential and that management has been warned against
       retaliation.

       Be sensitive to cultural and gender issues.


       Plan for an average of fifteen minutes per interview; however, use common sense in terminating interviews that are
       becoming nonproductive and extending interviews with people who are candid or openly addressing critical issues.

       Formulate questions prior to the interviews to make sure you cover all specific areas of the ESMS review through the
       aggregated interviews. Always ask employees how processes may be improved, water use reduced, energy saved,
       waste reduced, etc.

       If you plan to take notes, ask the workers if it is OK and clearly explain reason for taking notes. Try to minimize note
       taking as much as possible during the interview. Finish writing your notes immediately after the interview, so you have
       accurate documentation.

       Have your worker representatives recommend a preferred approach to building rapport with workers.


       Ask workers specifically about follow up on previous corrective action plans. What non-conformances remain open;
       what issues presented through the complaints management and resolution mechanism remain open?

         9. Monitoring and Management Review

       Make sure your questions address the following:
       LABOR ISSUES
              Do workers know about and understand your policies related to labor and working conditions?
              Do workers understand their rights under the law related to freedom of association and collective
                 bargaining?
              Do workers understand how their wages are calculated, for base time, performance and overtime?
              Are workers aware of any dismissal, transfer, demotion or other punitive action against workers due to their
                 exercising their rights under either their contracts or local or national law?
              Ask workers about the status of trade unions, worker committees or other worker groups in the
                 farm/plantation and whether there is management interference.
              Ask questions to determine conformance to discrimination and sexual harassment policies.
              Do workers understand the company’s grievance mechanism, and do they feel it is operational and free from
                 retaliation?
       OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES
              Do workers feel safe and protected in their jobs? For example, are they provided with PPE that is appropriate
                 and works? Is their physical environment free of hazards? Are they expected to reduce physical hazards or
                 are engineering controls in place? Are there job hazards assessments done routinely and when the processes
                 or materials change? Have issues submitted through the complaints management and resolution mechanism
                 been addressed?
              Do they feel there is adequate safety equipment, such as extinguishers/hydrants and first aid kits? Are there
                 sufficient safety drills if an emergency, such as a typhoon, flood or wind storm, were to occur and necessitate
                 an evacuation from buildings? Witness the emergency mock drills and make note of shortcomings; ask an
                 employee to pretend he/she has just been injured and explain what to do next.
              Are they instructed and trained on these risks at regular intervals?
              Have any workers been involved in accidents at the facility and, if so, what happened afterwards?
              Is the environment comfortable to work in, in terms of exposure to heat and sun?
              Do they feel that chemicals, waste and other substances are stored or disposed of safely and appropriately at
                 the facility? Is there sufficient access to Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) and/or International Chemical
                 Safety Cards (ICSCs) and appropriate training in their use? What is the management’s response to any
                 expressed issues through the complaint management and resolution mechanism?
       If the organization employs contract workers, make sure to ask questions that address possible violations and areas of
       abuse, such as: Do you feel different from a permanent employee? Why?
       Conduct some worker interviews off-site if possible.

                              E. INTERVIEWING AFFECTED COMMUNITIES AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS
       The stakeholder mapping exercises and stakeholder consultation meetings should help identify the relevant population
       that is affected by the facility and its activities.

       Select a sample of individuals that represents the views of this affected community such as local villagers and small
       landowners. This group may include members of the public as well as NGOs, campaign groups, trade unions, local
       businesses and government authorities. If possible, target NGOs that are industry-specific. Seek out former employees
       if possible, but filter out disgruntled former employees or those with a personal agenda against the company.

       Gauge awareness of the grievance mechanism. Has it been tested? Does it work? Does the company utilize it in
       practice or ignore it? Is it taken seriously?

       Be sure to include representatives from indigenous or marginalized groups in these interviews.


       Make sure your questions address the following:
           How have the farm/plantation's operations affected the physical environment (air, water, land) near them?
           Has this resulted in either air, land or water contamination?
           Has wildlife been affected by the farm or plantation’s activities?
           Has the farm or plantation’s business impacted local livelihoods, land ownership, or access to traditional
               hunting/fishing/breeding/religious/other grounds due to natural habitat conversion?
           Have any health risks or deterioration to well-being been associated with the farm/plantation from exposure
               to pesticides, air emissions or noise pollution? Note any neighbors or employees with ill children, or
               significant abortion rates.
           Have any contagious illnesses been on the rise due to an influx of workers to the farm/plantation such as
               malaria or other local vector-borne diseases? Is the community aware of an increase in the rat/mouse or
               other vermin population?
           Have these affected groups had any clashes with security hired at the farm or plantation?
           Have any of these groups consumed produce from the farm/plantation that has had a deleterious effect on
               their health? Any level of awareness of company's refusal to replace questionable goods?
           Have any of these groups been approached or invited by the company running the farm/plantation to discuss
               their concerns at meetings? Have any of their grievances been addressed or investigated? Has the company
               followed up on questions?



                                                     F. ON-SITE DOCUMENT REVIEW
       LABOR ISSUES:

       Make sure you review the relevant documents for the following areas:
       1. Human resources: Management-worker committee meeting minutes, memos and letters, budgets related to
       implementing labor policy, training material, logs and curricula or written communications to workers that address all
       issues, training records and instructor qualifications.
       2. Working conditions: Contracts for all workers; policies and procedures related to wages, benefits, hours and leave;
       evidence of communication and training on wage calculation; personnel files; time cards; payroll records and pay stubs
       (selected without management interference); criteria used to set performance pay bonuses; and employment and
       termination records.
       2.1 Are employee payment methods secure? Are employees able to have payments deposited into an account? Are
       they paid in cash at the facility (which can lead to significant risks during the trip home)?
       3. Collective bargaining: Collective bargaining policy, agreement and documentation (such as minutes and records of
       collective bargaining sessions).
       4. Discrimination: Discrimination policy; related procedures; documentation handling discrimination issues; diversity
       training and attendance log; hiring, promotion and termination records; gender demographics in facility at worker and
       manager levels.
       5. Retrenchment: Policies and procedures for workforce reduction, severance and transition; documentation of prior
       workforce reductions; minutes of management meetings and communications to workers on this issue.
       6. Complaint management and resolution mechanism: Documented procedure, communications, records and logs of
       grievance handling.

         9. Monitoring and Management Review

       7. Child labor: Procedure for age verification, documentation of apprentice program, birth and medical records and
       school records of workers.
       8. Forced labor: Employment contracts (as well as for those workers hired through recruitment agencies), payroll
       records, timesheets and wage deduction, worker passports and IDs.
       9. Health and safety: Accident and medical treatment logs, equipment safety logs, logs of fire and safety drills, health
       and safety risk analyses, government health inspection reports, safety certificates and training curriculum and logs, and
       evidence of changes to all of this when company processes, methods, chemicals, materials are changed, reordered,
       etc.

       Select files and/or records at random to generate a representative sample of the workforce population and functional
       distribution on the farm/plantation. Seek some files to corroborate interviews conducted earlier.

       Balance your time and effort investigating all areas of labor standards at work. Document review is particularly critical
       for wages, working hours, health and safety, use of sub-contractors, hiring and termination.

       If the operation employs contract workers, address potential areas of abuse in the document review. Specifically
       review the contract with the workers.

       Identify all significant incidences of non-conformance in preparation for your management meeting.


       ENVIRONMENTAL AND OSH ISSUES:

       Make sure you review the relevant documents for the following areas:
       1. Emergency response and preparedness: Examine the facility's emergency response procedures and accident
       reports, as well as documents indicating that workers have been trained on these issues.
       Ask the employee to explain the kind of emergency situations that have been identified and if the employees are
       aware of those specific emergency management procedures (e.g. flood, hurricane, wind storm, pesticide leak, barn
       fire, etc.)
       2. Environmental management: Examine the company environmental policies and environmental management
       system policies and reports, including sustainability reports, energy consumption records, guidelines and monitoring,
       resource use and waste generation. Note the status of previously identified non-conformances.
       3. Insurance: Identify documents that indicate legal permits have been obtained, insurance policies are in place and
       the relevant legal authorities notified of the facility's activities.
       4. Technical: Documents on production processes, and storage, purchase and maintenance of facility equipment.
       Availability of MSDS/ICSCs and employee training and orientation to the specific risk posed by materials in use;
       response to submissions through the complaint management and resolution mechanism.
       5. Waste disposal: Policies, procedures and guidelines on elimination and recycling of waste emissions and effluents to
       air, water and land, including monitoring of the quantity and quality, treatment and disposal of all waste, including
       wastewater and solid waste; are employees/area supervisors queried for opinions on improvements?
       6. Hazardous material: The storage of chemicals and toxicology sheets (MSDS/ICSCs from ILO/WHO/EU/UNEP, etc.).
       Avoid total reliance upon manufacturer's statements. Does procurement mandate the furnishing of such materials?
       7. Health and safety: Check for the existence of logs of accident and fatality rates, health and safety guidelines or
       handbooks for workers and monitoring of these statistics, including the job hazard analyses and engineering
       corrections to eliminate hazards at the source, as opposed to requiring employees to mitigate environmental hazards;

ABC Case Study

ABC Fruit Company, The Philippines
ABC Fruit is a US-based company that has just bought a pineapple plantation in the Philippines. The company
wants to increase its product diversity by expanding into pineapples because there has been an exponential
increase in world demand for the fruit in the past ten years. As a leading exporter of fresh and processed
pineapple products next to Thailand, with 15% of world production, pineapples have been one of the
Philippines’ largest exports to Japan, and more recently, to China and South Korea. Other export markets for
fresh Philippine pineapple are the Middle East, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Canada, Russia and Germany.
According to a recent study from the Department of Agriculture’s Agribusiness Marketing Service, prospects
for the Philippine pineapple industry are bright, since domestic demand is also estimated to grow by an
average of 4 -7% every year over the next 10 years.
The pineapple export industry is therefore very competitive. Producers must contend with increasing
downward price pressures as they seek to fill limited shelf space in supermarket chains and big-box retailers
worldwide. This market pressure has motivated pineapple producers to find new ways to cut labor costs.
Pineapple suppliers have started to replace their regular workers with contract labor through a process
known as “labor flexibilization” and the use of subcontractors. By outsourcing their labor force, buyers,
suppliers and supermarket chains can remove themselves from the responsibilities of direct employers.
ABC is aware that this race to the bottom has increased amongst pineapple industry giants. Such companies
are increasingly driven to reduce labor costs by lowering wage standards in pineapple production. As ABC
enters this market, the company wants to avoid the pitfalls that have befallen larger multinationals and
ensure that it can meet the basic needs of its workforce and their internationally recognized human rights.
The corporate team has discovered the following information after conducting due diligence on the recently
acquired pineapple plantation:
         A large percentage of the field workers are temporary workers hired to harvest. ABC has determined
          that pineapples are harvested year-round in the Philippines. So, even though it is not seasonal work,
          many employers hire workers under part-time, temporary or seasonal contracts or through “labor
          cooperatives” or subcontractors. Many workers are wrongly classified as independent contractors so
          that they do not receive the protection and rights of employees. These workers are subject to
          unstable employment and more dangerous working conditions. They often work hours beyond the
          legal limit at substandard rates of pay. Workdays can exceed 12 hours and workers have reportedly
          worked for 3 weeks straight without a single day off. The workers have no more than half an hour
          rest during the day and work in full heat without access to drinking water. They have suffered
          dehydration but continue to work long hours to make enough money for their families. They rarely
          receive social benefits and are often denied the right to join a union. Even when they have the right
          to unionize, workers are scared to meet because they know they are easily replaceable. The small
          number of unionized workers also suffers, because they have less power at the bargaining table and
          less ability to grow their influence.
         The plantation owner, a large international corporation, has been given a permit to use banned
          chemicals because it is one of the few plantations which can afford to give Personal Protective
          Equipment (PPE) to its workers. The workers are therefore instructed to wear masks and gloves, but
          have complained that the PPEs are ill-fitting and difficult to use in the hot climate. They claim that
          the PPEs are substandard; the equipment does not last for more than two months but has not been
          replaced in the past year. ABC is concerned about this issue because of the extensive use of
          pesticides in pineapple production: as many as 16 different chemicals are required to grow the crop
          effectively. These chemicals are deemed necessary not only to protect the crop from pests and
          disease but also to maximize yield. Chemicals such as Diuron, Endosulfan and Paraquat are still used
          although they are carcinogens and are thought to have created numerous health problems

          (diarrhea, rashes, and gastric problems, including vomiting blood, headaches, and loss of vision)
          among the workers. This has led to high rates of absenteeism and turnover at the plantation.
         There is also a risk of chemicals leaching into the soil and contaminating ground water. Tests have
          shown that water supplies are contaminated with agrochemicals used in pineapple production in the
          area. Contamination of local drinking water resources has resulted in the increased dependence of
          local communities on government-provided water, which is delivered periodically by tanker trucks.
          However, deliveries can be erratic and are insufficient for the population. Most residents still rely on
          the contaminated piped water for washing and drinking, if they are unable to obtain water from the
          tanker. Over-intensive farming from excessive use of farm machinery and soil erosion has also been
          exacerbated by heavy rainfall and storms leading to sedimentation downstream.
         In light of the environmental risks, ABC has consulted with an organic pineapple farmer, who works
          on his own land with his family in the Philippines. The farmer switched from conventional
          production processes when his family became ill from the chemicals necessary for traditional
          pineapple production pest control. Instead, he rotates crops to improve the health of the soil and
          strengthen the plants’ ability to resist pests. However, business is tough. As prices of conventional
          pineapples are pushed down, demand for more expensive fair trade fruit has fallen dramatically.
          While consumers may be willing to pay an extra $.50 USD for more ethical production, they are
          much less likely to choose the ethical option when there is a larger price differential of $1.00 USD or
          more.
         ABC is aware that one of the most pressing labor issues in pineapple production is the restriction on
          freedom of association. At the plantation that the company plans to buy, only 5% of the workforce
          belongs to a union. There are many reasons for this low percentage. Firstly, some local employers
          have hired private security guards who have harassed and intimidated plantation workers who tried
          to organize. Union representation has also been significantly reduced due to a widespread increase
          in contract labor. Furthermore, a nearby plantation fired workers who tried to join a local union to
          demand higher pay after they were poisoned while spraying pineapples with Furadan (one of the
          most toxic carbamate pesticides). The company offered free transport to the nearby town so
          workers could renounce their union membership. Only those who participated were rehired. One
          worker who refused to leave the union found his house burned down shortly after. He suspects it
          was arson, though there has been no formal investigation. He was also beaten up one night on his
          way home from union work.
         Workers’ rights are further impeded by a governmental rural reform system that unintentionally
          favors large landlords, instead of empowering workers. Under the reform, large commercial
          plantation owners’ land was divided among their workers. However, the workers were granted
          nominal title only and prevented in law from controlling it. Instead, they must lease back their land
          to the plantation, and work on it as contract workers, instead of landlords.
         ABC is keen to address a common and devastating weather occurrence in the Philippines: hurricanes
          and cyclones. The Philippines has experienced some of the deadliest overall tropical cyclones in the
          past few years and has the highest exposure to tropical cyclones. ABC is committed to implementing
          proper emergency preparedness policies and procedures to address this risk and prevent significant
          negative impacts on the plantation workers or production processes.
To address all these issues, ABC Fruit has decided to establish a broad-based environmental and social
management system (ESMS) based on international standards by the end of current fiscal year.

ABC FRUIT COMPANY Action Plan
Based on its Risk Assessment Prioritization Form, ABC Pineapple prioritized the following five key risks:
     •     Chronic diseases among workers due to prolonged exposure to pesticides and other banned substances.
     •     Violation of workers’ rights to Freedom of Association (FOA).
     •     Pesticide/chemical contamination of local drinking water sources from leaching and surface runoffs.
     •     Violation of temporary workers’ rights due to wage payment practices, working hours and other working conditions
     •     Typhoon emergency
ABC then developed Action Plans to manage these five (5) risks below.

ABC FRUIT COMPANY Complaint Management and Resolution Procedure
Based on the Risk Identification Worksheet and Risk Assessment Prioritization Form, ABC was concerned
about the growing number of disputes between temporary workers and plantation supervisors due to
worker contract issues (see Risk 4). As a result, ABC developed an Action Plan to address the problem as
part of its Management Program. The Action Plan included developing policies and procedures that could
better protect temporary workers. Here we present the Complaint Management Resolution Procedure (or
Internal Grievance Procedure) that ABC created and adopted as a result of its Action Plan.


Title: Complaint Management and Resolution (Internal Grievance Procedure)
Procedure number: HR001
Number of pages: 2


1.0 Purpose and Scope:
    1.1. Purpose: Establish a transparent process for workers to express concerns and file complaints,
         including anonymous complaints. Ensure there is no retaliation or discrimination against
         those that express concerns or file complaints. Ensure good worker-manager communications
         to enable workers to raise concerns before they become serious grievances.
    1.2. Scope: Any complaint or dispute that may arise from a worker or worker organization.

           All individual complaints shall be initiated at Step 1 and shall, if necessary, proceed step by step
           to Step 5 where the resolution proposed shall be final and binding. Collective complaints and
           disputes will be handled in the same step-by-step approach as that for individual complaints,
           but shall begin at Step 2.

           Issues will inevitably arise from time to time, but since disputes are potentially harmful to the
           company, its workers, supervisors and managers at every level, all parties will be expected to
           resolve all but the most complex difficulties without recourse to Step 5 of this procedure.

           The worker organization filing the complaint or representing the worker filing the complaint
           shall have the right to be notified and be present at all steps of the procedure.

         Every effort should be made to settle the issue at each step and until this procedure has been
         completed there shall be no threats of “go-slows,” partial or general stoppages of work or other
         illegal action or lock-out.
2.0 Definitions:
    2.1. Grievance: Specific violation or feeling of having been wronged – the reason for filing a
         complaint.
    2.1 Complaint: The formal communication of a grievance to the appropriate parties.
3.0 Responsibilities:
    HR Department
4.0 Work Instructions:
    Step 1:
    4.1. The worker presents the complaint or grievance verbally to the most immediate supervisor,
         who has the authority to make adjustments in the matter, within 14 days. Explanations of
         responses to complaints, even if only to alert workers to a delay in the process, are key to
         ensuring workers understand their complaints are respected and taken seriously.

     4.2. The supervisor records the complaint or grievance and the action taken in the complaints log.
     Step 2:
     4.3. If a satisfactory settlement is not reached in Step 1 within three days, or if the worker fears
          making the complaint directly to the most immediate supervisor, then a worker representative
          may present the complaint verbally to the supervisor concerned. The worker may choose to
          remain anonymous.
     Step 3:
     4.4. If a satisfactory settlement is not reached in Step 2 within three days following its completion,
          the worker or his or her chosen representative for the case may present the complaint to the
          plantation manager. The complaint shall be in writing and shall state the complainant(s) or
          grievant(s) name(s).
     Step 4:
     4.5. If a satisfactory settlement is not reached in Step 3 within five days of the date of submission of
          the written complaint or grievance to the plantation manager, the worker or his or her chosen
          representative for the case may present the complaint or grievance to the head of the Human
          Resources.
     4.6. The head of the Human Resources or his/her designee shall schedule a meeting to be held
          within fourteen days of the receipt of the complaint or grievance with the worker or his or her
          chosen representative, for the purpose of attempting to resolve the complaint or grievance.
     4.7. The worker can bring one or two peers for support during this meeting; those workers will also
          be covered under the non-reprisal clause.
     4.8. The head of the Human Resources or his/her designee shall respond in writing within seven
          days of the date of the meeting.
     Step 5:
     4.9. If the complaint or grievance is not resolved at Step 4, and it is clear that resolution within the
          company is impossible, the worker or his or her chosen representative may refer the complaint
          or grievance to the Labor Ministry for resolution.
     Monitoring:
    4.10. The Human Resources Department will conduct a quarterly review of all complaints and
          actions taken. It will review the complaint logs of each supervisor and department head to
          evaluate the effectiveness of the grievance procedure and resolutions.
    4.11. As part of the quarterly review, the Human Resources Department will follow up directly with
          the worker or his or her chosen representative to make sure there has been no retaliation.
    4.12. The Human Resources Department will maintain a central record of all complaints and
          resolutions.

ABC 5. Emergency Preparedness and Response

Based on their Risk Prioritization Assessment, which identified tropical storm systems such as typhoons and
hurricanes as a severe-impact risk (Risk 5), ABC developed a Preparedness and Response Plan to respond to
typhoons. The procedure was documented so that it could be used by management to put in place an
evacuation plan for the company.

ABC FRUIT COMPANY Stakeholder Mapping – identification and analysis
An ABC cross-departmental team brainstormed and listed the stakeholders that are affected by or have an
interest in the plantation’s operations. The team then discussed and listed their key concerns, issues and
interests. To identify those, they looked back at the environmental and social key risks and impacts
previously identified and how these affect the surrounding communities.

Finally, they mapped the stakeholders on a matrix according to (a) the degree to which they are impacted
and (b) their ability to influence the company operations, and then (c) categorized them based on their
current relationship with the company: supportive, supportive with conditions, neutral, opposed. Based on
this, they define their engagement method with each group.

XYZ Case Study

XYZ Sugar Company, Nicaragua
With the opening of the European market to Central America, the sugar industry in Nicaragua has expanded
to become a major source of revenue for the country. Sugar activity generates more than 4% of GDP,
creating 130,000 jobs and generating 15% of energy consumed nationally. As a result, XYZ, one of the largest
sugar mills in the country, is now planning to increase its production. However, the company directors are
aware of the potential social and environmental pitfalls that may result from such growth, and intend to
address these risks in order to appeal to the international market.
A recent report by an international group of research journalists has denounced the working conditions of
sugar cane workers in many Central American countries. In addition to the challenging manual labor of
cutting and loading sugarcane for transport, the journalists found that within the past four years,
approximately 3,000 workers have died due to a disease called Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). According to
the report, more men die of this disease in Nicaragua than HIV/AIDS, diabetes and leukemia combined. So
many men have died in certain rural areas that a community called “La Isla” (the Island) is now known as
“The Island of the Widows.” The medical and scientific community believes that the epidemic is a result of
workers’ contact with an unidentified toxin that is likely found in the pesticides applied to sugarcane during
cultivation, as well as exposure to extreme heat, dehydration and long working hours.
Workers who are paid at a piece-rate for the amount of sugar collected (90 cents a ton) often work to the
point of dehydration and fainting, potentially damaging their kidneys on each shift. Some mills claim to have
protected workers by taking action to improve hydration in the fields, reduce working hours and provide
blood tests to monitor workers. However, companies also need to establish improved complaint and
management systems in order to prevent workers from being fired once they are identified as ill.
Furthermore, treatment options are limited since the high cost of kidney transplants rules out that option as
a cure for the workers affected with CKD in the region. The only feasible treatment for most of the workers
is peritoneal dialysis, which they must perform at home.
XYZ is eager to find a way to protect its workers from CKD. The company plans to put in place procedures to
reduce exposure of workers and the community to pesticides, such as: safe operating practices; use of
appropriate PPEs to protect from pesticides and the hazards of harvesting with sharp tools; and an
emergency preparedness plan for monitoring and dealing with pesticide leakage and contamination.
In addition, there has been an increase in abusive temporary recruitment practices and the use of
contractors during busy harvesting periods in the sector. Such contractors pay low wages, violate social
security obligations, and utilize high-risk transportation systems (such as trucks carrying workers standing
on boxes without any kind of supervision), which leaves workers vulnerable to abuse. The mills are unwilling
to hire staff directly for the harvest because they do not want to take responsibility their welfare. Local
human rights organizations also claim that children are employed when there are labor shortages on
sugarcane plantations during peak harvesting periods.
Sugarcane farming also has significant environmental impacts. It is a water intensive process (with an
average of 20 megalitres of water/hectare) and 80% of the water used is obtained from local groundwater.
The Central Ground Water Board of Nicaragua has discovered a decrease in groundwater stocks, especially
in North and Northwestern Nicaragua. As a result, producers of water intensive crops like sugarcane need to
utilize different strategies for growing the crop or obtaining water by implementing efficient irrigation
technologies or cultivating sugarcane varieties that require less water or drought-tolerant plant varieties.
XYZ is aware that it must work with the local communities to address future water shortages by identifying
ecofriendly and economically viable options and identifying areas (depending upon weather, soil and
suitable varieties) where it can harvest sufficient yields of sugarcane despite the depleting water resources
and without causing further negative impact.

XYZ Case Study

The practice of burning sugarcane also has significant environmental and health consequences. This
practice is utilized to facilitate the collection of sugar and is increasingly widespread in Nicaragua, especially
as international demand for sugarcane has increased. Burning sugarcane removes leaves with sharp edges,
drives out snakes, and prevents weed seeds from returning to the soil, while leaving cane stalks and roots
unharmed. However it also causes an uncontrolled emission of harmful gases such as carbon monoxide,
hydrocarbons and sulfur dioxide, which are known to increase cardiovascular disease, chronic bronchitis,
lung emphysema, and bronchial asthma in the local population, especially if there is exposure during
childhood.
Burning remains a popular practice at XYZ farms because it decreases volume of material to be processed by
factories, shortens harvest season by 10% and increases yield of sugar recovered per ton of sugarcane.
Workers can collect five times more sugarcane if it is burned. Reduction of smoke emissions could be
achieved through use of green harvesters. However, the uneven topography on XYZ farm may limit the
machines’ effectiveness.
XYZ cultivates 309,000 tons of sugar cane annually during the 155 day cropping season on 8,400 hectares. In
2000, when XYZ acquired the sugar mill’s land and assets, it also inherited land disputes with the local
community. Some of the company’s land is occupied by local households and farms. According to XYZ, the
previous owners tried to forcibly relocate owners of land near the mill, river and adjacent fields.
Furthermore, those who willingly sold their land plots to the previous owner were never provided with
proper land titles. Instead, they were issued “possession certificates.” There are also complications due to
the nationalization of industries in the 1980s and subsequent privatization of companies in the 1990s in
Nicaragua. As a result, it is not always clear who is the legal owner of specific areas of land. XYZ is aware of
these complex land tenure issues involving insecurity of possession, squatting, opportunistic settlers and
multiple titling, and plans to address them.
XYZ Company is an active member of the National Commission of Sugar Producers (NCSP) and participates in
various international business conferences about the sale of sugar and processed sugar products. During a
recent international trade fair organized in Managua, Nicaragua, the CEO met some potential European
customers who indicated that international certifications such as Fair-trade and other environmental
management system programs could help the company succeed in the international market. Therefore, XYZ
Company has decided to develop and implement an environmental and social management system and
training program, based on existing laws and regulations for labor rights and good agricultural practice.

XYZ 1. Policy

XYZ FRUIT COMPANY Policy Statement
XYZ had a long internal debate about adopting new policies, especially ones on labor and working
conditions. The company felt it would be very hard to meet these requirements, given the operating
environment. Finally, the CEO decided to proceed with the complete set of policies, because of the
company’s orientation towards international markets. The company created a three-year plan to try to
achieve compliance with the policies and gain some type of international certification or recognition.
Here is a shorter version of the company’s policy which summarizes the most relevant points:
     XYZ - Our product, our environment, our people
     Together we produce safe and high-quality sugar that creates value and confidence for our customers
     and consumers.
     We are committed to conducting our operations in accordance with the environmental and labor laws
     and regulations that apply to our industry.
     We recognize that energy and water are valuable resources, and we commit to use them more
     efficiently.
     We commit to reuse and recycle all our organic waste.
     We strive for an injury-free workplace where our workers are not exposed to dangerous situations or
     hazardous chemicals and use the appropriate personal protective equipment, when needed.
     We will work with our labor contractors to gradually eliminate the presence of child labor in our supply
     chain.
     We are all - managers, supervisors and workers – jointly responsible for making our policy a reality.

XYZ SUGAR COMPANY Action Plan
Based on its Risk Assessment Form, XYZ prioritized the following five key risks:
     •    High incidence of CKD or chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) amongst sugarcane plantation workers
     •    Community exposure to air pollution from pre-harvest burning
     •    High irrigation water consumption affecting local supplies
     •    Conflicts with community due to land acquisition practices and involuntary resettlement of community members
     •    Pesticide leakage and contamination
XYZ developed Action Plans to manage the five risks (see below).

Based on the identification of workers with CKD as a major issue, XYZ is concerned about the prevalence of
discrimination against this group in the region, especially for those who are newly diagnosed (see Risk 1).
Here we present the non-discrimination procedure that XYZ adopted to help protect these and other
workers.

XYZ FOOD COMPANY Non-Discrimination Procedure
Title: XYZ Non-Discrimination Procedure
Responsible Party: General Manager
Date Issued: February 15, 2013

     •    All workers will be given equal access to training, tools and opportunities for advancement.
     •    We will ensure that all workers are free from harassment by management or other workers.

Procedure Checklist
Application Process
     •    When hiring any worker, keep the original application and a photocopy of the original identification
          documents in the applicant’s file.
     •    If the applicant is hired, this will be transferred to his or her personnel file.
     •    Whether or not the applicant is hired, the application will be kept on file for a minimum of two
          years.
     •    Give all applicants a sheet explaining our company’s Non-Discrimination and Equal Opportunity
          Policy.
     •    The Human Resources Department staff person accepting an application will verbally explain the
          policy and go over the points on the cover sheet with the applicant.

          complaints through the company’s grievance mechanism.
Management Review
     •    General Manager will conduct a spot check of all application files processed during the previous
          quarter, to check for evidence of discrimination.
     •    Each quarter, the general manager will review the workplace demographics by department in
          comparison with the application and personnel promotion files, review any complaint records, and
          interview workers, in order to check for evidence of discrimination.
In addition, as identified in the risk assessment, and as a result of an Action Plan put in place to address this
issue, XYZ decided to tackle the problem of excessive consumption of water used in sugar production (see
Risk 3), by adopting the following field irrigation procedure.

XYZ 5. Emergency Preparedness and Response

Based on their risk assessment, which identified pesticide leakage and contamination as a common risk (Risk
5), XYZ developed a Preparedness and Response Plan to respond to such a situation. The procedure was
documented as a flowchart so that it could be posted at various workstations at the sugar farm and
understood easily.

XYZ SUGAR COMPANY Stakeholder Mapping – identification and analysis
XYZ listed the stakeholders that are affected by or have an interest in the company’s operations.
Next to each stakeholder group, the company listed key concerns, issues and interests. To identify those,
the company looked back at the environmental and social key risks and impacts previously identified and
how these affect the surrounding communities.

XYZ 7. External Communication and Grievance Mechanism

Key Aspects of XYZ SUGAR COMPANY’S Grievance Mechanism
As identified in the Stakeholder Engagement Plan, this grievance procedure was developed as one of the key
ways that external and internal stakeholders could communicate with XYZ on issues that concerned them.


  KEY ASPECTS OF EFFECTIVE GRIEVANCE MECHANISMS                                         XYZ’S METHOD
Provide ease of access to confidentially communicate or        XYZ has an email address and telephone hotline specifically
file complaints, including anonymous ones                      for complaints. Email is checked daily by the administrative
                                                               office.

Publicize the system so that stakeholders know it exists       XYZ has a written procedure that the general manager
and how to access it                                           explains during quarterly town hall meetings. The
                                                               procedure is posted on a banner outside the company’s
                                                               gate. The poster is in English and the local language.

Foster sense of legitimacy and trust; encourage dialogue       XYZ works with the local government ministries to ensure
and shared responsibility for outcomes                         that legal mechanisms are followed and consults with
                                                               various groups to refine its system as needed.

Be transparent about the process and outcomes                  The administrative office receives and records complaints
                                                               and reports back to the complainant about whether the
                                                               complaint is accepted or not and what is the process and
                                                               timeline for investigation and resolution.

Implement a predictable and defined process that includes      The administrative office receives and records the
assignment of responsibility, time limits and monitoring of    complaint and then works with relevant staff and external
outcomes                                                       stakeholders to investigate the complaint, determine
                                                               necessary actions and report back on outcomes.

Make the system a source of continual learning                 XYZ’s general manager and department heads meet
                                                               quarterly to review complaints and check for ways to
                                                               improve the mechanism and the overall company systems.
