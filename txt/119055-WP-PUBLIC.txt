1. Introduction
Middle-income countries (MICs) are critical drivers of the world economy and have
important knowledge and other resources to share. Inclusive and sustainable
growth and development in MICs would provide positive spillover effects to the
rest of the world, including by showcasing successful approaches to addressing
poverty reduction, shared prosperity, international financial stability, and cross-
border global issues. MICs are the largest group of World Bank Group clients—108
countries divided almost evenly into two large subgroups: lower-middle income
countries with a gross national income (GNI) per capita of $1,026–$4,035 (52
countries) and upper-middle-income countries (UMICs) with a GNI per capita of
$4,036–$12,475 (56 countries).

According to the 2017 “Forward Look: A Vision for the World Bank Group in 2030—
Progress and Challenges,” the World Bank Group must sustain and evolve its
engagement with MICs in order to meet its twin goals of eradicating extreme
poverty and ensuring shared prosperity sustainably. Areas identified for WBG
engagement with MICs include support in economic transformation, helping
identify drivers for growth, promoting policies to reduce inequality, assisting with
crises, and addressing global public goods. The “Forward Look” also acknowledges
that MICs have a high demand for financing, knowledge, and innovation in support
of projects that fight poverty and inequality, promote growth and sound
macroeconomic policies, address climate change issues, support the provision of
basic infrastructure, and build robust institutions. Without such assistance, some
MICs are at risk of losing their poverty-reduction gains.

The “Forward Look” emphasizes that the World Bank Group envisages a more
systematic effort to secure private participation in helping to meet the rapidly
growing infrastructure investment needs in UMICs—through the Cascade approach,
to help to create markets and leverage more private financing. To maximize the
impact of scarce public resources, the Cascade first seeks to mobilize commercial
finance, enabled by upstream reforms to address constraints to private sector
investment. Where risks remain high, the priority will be to apply guarantees and
risk-sharing instruments, and only where market solutions are not possible would
official and public resources be applied.

Many MICs have unfinished development agendas and risk remaining in middle-
income status if they do not further their own economic, social, and structural
transformation. As countries reach middle-income status, they encounter second-
generation or frontier reform challenges that reflect the more advanced stage of their

INTRODUCTION
development. Typical challenges include social inequality, lifestyle diseases, aging
populations, pension reform, improving quality of tertiary education, reforming
inadequate trade and tax policies, low financial literacy, the need for more attention
to green growth, and unplanned urbanization. These second-generation challenges
are much more evident and vividly reflected in the UMICs, which are the upper-tier
subset of MICs (as measured by income). Furthermore, UMICs play a critical role in
helping to address the full range of GPGs – related to environmental challenges,
climate change, macroeconomic shocks, pandemics, global displacement, and more.

UMICs are extremely diverse and have differing development needs. The World
Bank Group continues to have a substantial lending program in some UMICs
supporting the countries’ development goals, while in others lending is decreasing
along with simultaneous increase in demand for knowledge and advisory services.
Some UMICs have stopped borrowing from the World Bank Group altogether and
access only the World Bank Group’s knowledge and advisory services (on a
reimbursable basis in many instances) to meet ongoing challenges and to support
implementation of their own-financed programs.

This report synthesizes existing evaluative evidence on the outcomes and lessons
learned from the World Bank Group’s partnership with UMICs. The report focuses
mainly on Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) evaluations produced in 2007-16
(including relevant thematic, corporate, and country evaluations), along with select
project evaluations. The motivation for focusing on UMICs is the importance the
World Bank Group attributes to its continued engagement with this group of
countries in learning, ensuring financial sustainability and income generation, and
advancing on global issues. It is notable that the broader MIC group includes many
former and current International Development Association (IDA) borrowers and
recent arrivals to the MIC group, and the UMICs express MIC-specific issues much
more clearly.


Coverage and Methodology
This review of World Bank Group engagement with UMICs is based mainly on
available evaluative evidence combined with additional independent portfolio
review and meta-analysis, gearing evaluation questions toward UMIC-specific
characteristics and challenges. The report is organized along the World Bank
Group’s “three ways” approach to achieving its twin goals: working to accelerate
inclusive and sustainable economic growth; helping countries invest more
effectively in people; and fostering resilience to global shocks and threats.
Considering the broad nature of the “three ways” and their relevance to all

segments of World Bank Group client countries, this report focused on a select
group of second-generation developmental challenges facing most UMICs. The
report does not attempt to cover all possible areas of World Bank Group
engagement in UMICs across the three ways, but rather concentrates on selected
development challenges for which there is available evaluative evidence and on
which the World Bank Group has significant scope for contributions and learning in
UMICs. The report is not comprehensive in its coverage, inasmuch as it does not
cover all areas of World Bank Group engagement in UMICs, but only those where
sufficient and relevant evaluative information is available. 1 For each of the three
ways and the cross-cutting knowledge agenda, the report summarizes available
evidence on the World Bank Group’s performance in facing development challenges
in the following specific areas:

   •   Inclusive and sustainable economic growth

       ◦   Fiscal and financial sector resilience
       ◦   Public financial management, civil service reform, and anticorruption
       ◦   Industrial competitiveness, innovation, and investment climate reforms

   •   Public-private partnerships in infrastructure

       ◦   Social safety nets
       ◦   Quality of education and health, and pandemic response
       ◦   Employment creation programs
       ◦   Access to urban services
       ◦   Gender issues

   •   Fostering resilience to global shocks and threats

       ◦   Environmental sustainability, natural disaster risk reduction, and climate change
           mitigation and adaptation
       ◦   Fragility, conflict, violence, and forced displacement

   •   Knowledge agenda

       ◦   Building capacity for second-generation reforms.
       ◦   Reimbursable Advisory Services
       ◦   Promoting South-South knowledge exchange

The review team collected and classified all available recent (2007–16) evaluative
information using these thematic areas as the main organizing principles. The
review covers relevant thematic, corporate, and country evaluations; learning

products; select project evaluations; and other sources, including World Bank Group
and external reports. IEG reviewed 78 major evaluations and learning products
(appendix C lists all evaluations). 2 Of the 43 major evaluations, 20 evaluations were
categorized as highly relevant. Most of the highly relevant major evaluations (16 out
of 20) were produced after 2012. Coverage of each major evaluation varied – from 1–
2 to 8–10 years prior to the respective report.

For the purpose of in-depth review of country and project evaluations, the report
focused on a sample of 14 UMICs. The sample comprises countries that belonged in
the UMIC category for the last 6–8 years, with the majority of portfolio originating in
IBRD; and current high-income countries (HICs) that switched from UMIC to HIC
status within the last 6–8 years, and where the World Bank Group maintains
presence and/or continues dialogue. This resulting group of 30 countries is
identified as sample UMICs in the report. The evaluation team then selected 14 core
countries from the target group for in-depth review at the country and project levels,
accounting for regional representation (appendix B).


Report Structure
This report consists of six chapters, including chapter 1. Chapter 2 covers inclusive
and sustainable growth; chapter 3 covers human capital; chapter 4 includes
resilience (environment, fragility, and violence); chapter 5 covers the knowledge
agenda; and chapter 6 summarizes the main conclusions. The main appendices
cover methodology, the World Bank Group portfolio performance review (by
income groups across sectors and regions over time), and project-level evaluative
material.


1For example, the report does not cover whole sectors (agriculture) and is selective in its
coverage of various sub-sectors within larger sectors (primary education, health). In some
cases, the available evaluative material was related to lower middle-income countries
(Honduras and urban crime) and also omitted from the report.
2A total of 78 major evaluations and learning products were reviewed. This included 43
major evaluations delivered between 2008 and present, 28 learning products, six Results and
Performance Reports (RAPs), and one (external) Asian Development Bank evaluation of
middle-income countries (2016). Of the 43 major evaluations, 20 evaluations were
categorized as highly relevant from the upper middle-income countries angle.

2. Inclusive and Sustainable Growth

Highlights
    Upper-middle-income countries (UMICs) made significant progress on
     economic policy reform, but a significant gap still exists between UMICs
     and Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD)
     countries, particularly on quality of institutions and governance, and on
     technological readiness and innovation.
    The size of the institutional challenges that UMICs continue to face
     underscores the need for World Bank Group long-term engagement in
     those areas.
    Most UMICs with active public sector reform programs saw performance
     improvements, particularly evident in the public financial management
     area.
    Maintaining a strong knowledge base through a steady flow of diagnostic
     work was an essential condition for effective support during crises.
    World Bank Group support to improve competitiveness and innovation in
     UMICs was largely relevant, but its strong sectoral alignment often did not
     address systemic weaknesses at the country level.
    World Bank Group support for innovation in UMICs was heavily
     concentrated in the education and agriculture sectors, with limited
     coverage of manufacturing and supporting management capacity.
    World Bank Group support for investment climate reforms was relevant,
     but measuring its effectiveness and impact was often challenging. A
     division of labor between the World Bank and IFC in this area rarely
     generated synergies.
    World Bank Group engagement helped create a market and shape the
     regulatory environment for public-private partnerships in UMICs, often
     through demonstration effects.
    The World Bank Group infrastructure portfolio in UMICs triggered critical
     policy reforms and achieved sector-wide impact even with a modest
     amount of financing, but broad success across different infrastructure
     sectors remained relatively rare.

INCLUSIVE AND SUSTAINABLE GROWTH

Economic Management and Institutions
Among the distinctive features of upper-middle-income countries (UMICs) since the
1990s have been their rapid opening to international trade and capital flows, while
governments and financial sectors saw the emergence of new opportunities of
financing. Concurrently, recurring upswings in public spending and downturns in
economic activity revealed second-generation challenges in economic management,
particularly those related to enhancing fiscal and financial sector resilience. 1

Success in implementing policies that address second-generation challenges requires
a concomitant strengthening of institutions that translate policies into outcomes.
However, progress in institutional development typically lags the pace of policy
reform. The Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) illustrate this most strikingly,
showing a substantial difference between established Organisation for Economic Co-
Operation and Development (OECD) member countries and UMICs as a group for
all indicators (appendix F, figure F.1). The WGI also shows that institutional reform
generally occurs slowly. During the observed period (2006–14), the World Bank
helped UMICs strengthen economic management and build resilience to crises by
moderating output fluctuations both directly and indirectly (directly through its
assistance and indirectly through improving the institutional underpinnings of
resilience) and by strengthening public sector institutions for better governance.

EVALUATION FINDINGS
Economic Management: Building Fiscal and Financial Sector Resilience

Fiscal management. The World Bank Group’s support to UMICs during the global
economic crisis attenuated a more contractionary response that would otherwise
have occurred. The World Bank, through its fiscal management–focused
development policy loans (DPLs), 2 intervened mostly in countries characterized by
moderate or low fiscal stress (two-thirds of commitments), 3 and provided nearly 90
percent of financing to International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(IBRD) borrowers (World Bank 2012). Although budget support allowed a less
contractionary response to the crisis everywhere, financing of countercyclical
programs was possible in countries with low or moderate fiscal stress either through
the action of automatic stabilizers in the budget (as in Mexico and Uruguay) or
through proactive stimulus packages (as in Mauritius and Peru). DPLs in countries
with adequate fiscal space more frequently included measures to protect or scale up
social expenditures, and priorities were reset for public investment programs to
maintain key growth-promoting investments.

                                                         INCLUSIVE AND SUSTAINABLE GROWTH
Several client countries that received fiscal management–focused DPLs emerged
from the crisis with weaker fiscal positions. The 2012 IEG evaluation of the World
Bank’s response to the global crisis shows some DPLs paid insufficient attention to
the available space for fiscal stimulus, the reversibility of stimulus measures, and
forward-looking measures to attain fiscal sustainability. Where such weaknesses
were present in the DPLs’ design, the deterioration in fiscal positions after the crisis
was noticeable. 4 In some cases, this partly reflected insufficient measures of fiscal
consolidation and underestimation of the fiscal impact of the crisis or a combination
of these factors, as illustrated by UMICs such as Poland, Romania, and Serbia. In
some UMICs that did not face high fiscal stress (Mauritius, Peru, and Uruguay), the
World Bank designed instruments for precautionary purposes, such as development
policy loans with a contingent component (deferred drawdown option, DDO),
providing useful flexibility and a signal to markets. The modifications introduced to
DDOs in 2007 allowed significant flexibility at a time of volatility in global capital
markets and contagion.

In contrast to IBRD, IFC support to numerous UMICs before and during the
financial crisis happened to be largely procyclical. IEG’s evaluation of the World
Bank’s response to the global crisis showed that IFC’s new business increased in
low-income countries (LICs), but decreased in UMICs and in middle-income
countries (MICs) in general. Although IFC’s response to the crisis was relevant and
its crisis initiatives showed creativity and strategic positioning in asking for funds
from external partners, its catalytic effects and additionality were lower than
expected. IFC reduced its investments in larger UMICs, such as the Russian
Federation and Turkey, intending to lessen portfolio losses and focus on short-term
trade financing. IFC loan pricing rose substantially because of the crisis as perceived
country risk increased, often working against efforts to help first-tier companies in
distress. However, the IEG evaluations also acknowledged IFC and MIGA’s positive
contributions to broad international rescue consortium efforts, particularly through
the Joint International Financial Institution (IFI) Action Plan for the Europe and
Central Asia Region, known as the Vienna Initiative. MIGA, in particular, supported
several key financial institutions in Eastern Europe through guarantees.

The World Bank’s knowledge base in public finance was generally weaker in
countries where lending had declined before the crisis. IEG evaluations emphasized
that maintaining a strong knowledge base in public finance through a steady flow of
diagnostic work is a condition for effective support, especially in countries with
fiscal positions vulnerable to crises.

The 2014 evaluation of the World Bank Group’s engagement in resource-rich
developing countries emphasized that gradually developing strong fiscal and


                                                                                       7

INCLUSIVE AND SUSTAINABLE GROWTH
structural deficit rules that allow saving out of commodity booms or other windfalls
from trade gains can be highly effective in controlling procyclical behavior. The
report examined the management of revenues from nonrenewable natural resources
in a group of countries, including two UMICs (Chile and Kazakhstan). It drew
lessons from Chile and assessed World Bank support to Kazakhstan in developing
mechanisms and setting rules to immunize fiscal policy against fluctuations in
commodity prices. The evaluation highlighted the importance of work that
strengthens institutions that foster fiscal resilience, for the World Bank to help
countries respond to external shocks effectively, and noted the clear comparative
advantages the World Bank has in this area.

Financial systems. IEG evaluations of World Bank Group Response to the Global
Crisis noted that structural weaknesses in financial sector institutions contributed to
procyclical borrowing during the boom years in UMICs affected most acutely by the
global economic crisis, such as Latvia and Ukraine. 5 Credit growth recovered by
2010 in most UMICs, but recessions were deeper and more protracted in countries
where the crisis was transmitted through the capital account, and it took longer for
credit growth to recover. Except for the most-affected UMICs (Ukraine) and some
recent graduates in Europe and Central Asia (Hungary and Latvia), most countries
did not experience a banking crisis, and manifestations of the crisis varied.6,7 The
World Bank Group provided considerable and multiproduct support to several
UMICs (such as Kazakhstan and Mexico) to address the most critical vulnerabilities
of the countries’ financial sector, including those related to access to finance and
regulatory weaknesses. 8 In most cases, it helped to mitigate the crisis impact and
facilitate post-crisis recovery in the sector.

The World Bank response was channeled through DPLs (often as part of a larger
international rescue consortium) targeting specific measures related to bank
restructuring, stress testing, and major regulatory measures. In most cases, DPLs
were small elements of the overall aid package, but the World Bank Group
participation provided positive signals to markets. However, according to the 2012
IEG evaluation of the World Bank’s response to the global crisis, sustainability
issues persisted in the sector. 9 The evaluation, The World Bank Group’s Response to the
Global Economic Crisis: Phase II, recognized IFC’s and MIGA’s positive contribution,
particularly for the Joint (IFI) Action Plan for Europe and Central Asia, known as the
“Vienna Initiative.”

World Bank Group support to more severely financially stressed countries
emphasized short-term issues, especially related to liquidity and credit shortages.10
The World Bank Group program in countries with lower stress levels (Mexico and
Turkey) addressed longer-term financial sector issues and was balanced

                                                        INCLUSIVE AND SUSTAINABLE GROWTH
appropriately across sectors. 11 World Bank Group support to countries’ financial
sectors during the crisis also depended on the quality of its engagement, especially
through advisory services before the crisis. Much of it took the form of Financial
Sector Assessment Programs (FSAPs) undertaken as joint exercises with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF). 12 Overall, several IEG evaluations—the World
Bank’s response to the global crisis, FSAP, and country program evaluations
(CPEs)—stressed that FSAPs helped many countries work on shortcomings and thus
develop more resilient financial systems. 13

According to the 2016 IEG evaluation, The World Bank Group’s Support to Capital
Market Development, the World Bank Group had a pioneering role in facilitating
capital market upgrades in several UMICs by reforming market regulations,
promoting modernization of payment systems, and providing innovative support to
development of local currency government bond markets.14 IFC was pivotal in the
development of mortgage-backed securities and establishing a secondary mortgage
market in several UMICs, including Colombia and Russia, according to the IEG
learning product, World Bank Group Support for Housing Finance. Support for capital
markets reforms in Colombia is often seen as best practice reflecting sustained
World Bank Group effort over an extended period, good integration of IFC and
World Bank programs, and effective alignment of World Bank Advisory Services
and Analytics (ASA) and lending programs.

The World Bank Group’s role in the development of new capital markets
instruments was constrained by the existing level of development of client countries’
markets. Therefore, the World Bank Group’s interventions in this area were heavily
concentrated in UMICs. Even there, sometimes these interventions were ahead of
their time and were not consistent with the achieved level of macroeconomic
stability and available national regulatory capability. This was one of the key lessons
from the evaluation of IFC support to the Sofoles (Sociedad Financiera de Objeto
Limitado), or specialized private financial intermediaries in Mexico, in the period
leading to the global financial crisis of 2008–09. 15

The 2014 evaluation of World Bank Group’s experience with targeted support to
small and medium-size businesses identified several challenges in terms of the
relevance of the support provided to MICs. The World Bank Group portfolio of
small and medium enterprise support was unnecessarily concentrated in MICs (in
clients) and in credit lines (in products), raising concerns about the program’s
relevance. Support through credit lines is considered less relevant in MICs
compared with LICs because on average, the MICs’ banking sectors are more
developed.

CHAPTER 2
INCLUSIVE AND SUSTAINABLE GROWTH
A special challenge for World Bank Group support to the financial sector in UMICs
relates to the difficulty in making its projects beneficial to the poor during times of
crisis. For example, the World Bank helped prevent the slowdown of the Mexican
housing market in the aftermath of the crisis, but the expansion of products toward
lower-income segments was modest because market stabilization and strengthening
the financial position of the housing development bank—Sociedad Hipotecaria
Federal (SHF)—was the priority.16 However, the World Bank met this challenge
successfully in several rural finance operations. 17

Strengthening Public Sector Institutions

Improving public sector institutions enhances the quality and impact of economic
policies, including the capacity to address second-generation challenges and quality
of governance. The Worldwide Governance Indicators show a substantial difference
between high-income countries (HICs) and UMICs for all indicators (appendix F,
figure F.1). 18, 19 This is a consequence of the lag between the pace of policy reform
and institutional reform. It also highlights the size of the institutional challenges that
UMICs continue to face as they aspire to high-income status and the need for World
Bank long-term engagement and support to UMICs in this area.

Major evaluations of the World Bank’s role in helping countries strengthen public
sector institutions are scarce, and none focused on public sector reform (PSR)
specifically in UMICs. 20 The 2008 evaluation, Public Sector Reform: What Works and
Why, measures changes in public sector governance in countries that received PSR
lending during 1999–2006 compared with those that did not by examining the
change in the average of Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA)
indicators 13–16 (the governance CPIA). 21 The analysis of PSR in the aggregate
found that four-fifths of IBRD countries with PSR projects saw improvements in the
governance CPIA measure compared with a little more than half in countries that
did not. 22 Across World Bank regions, Europe and Central Asia (a predominantly
middle-income region) had the highest rate of improvement for countries receiving
PSR lending (90 percent). 23

While countries with relatively high governance CPIA ratings had few World Bank
PSR projects, they continued to demand World Bank support on analytical work.
Countries with initial governance CPIA ratings of 4.0 or above (11 countries
including several UMICs) had only three projects in the PSR area. However, all but
one had at least some ASA activities. This shows that even when UMICs no longer
perceive much need for World Bank PSR lending, the governments still place at least
some value on the World Bank’s advice on PSR through analytics. The evaluation’s

                                                        INCLUSIVE AND SUSTAINABLE GROWTH
case studies verified this (four of the studies were in UMICs), and the case studies
found that analytical work was largely demand-driven.

Public financial management. Public financial managemetn (PFM) and tax
administration proved to be convenient points of entry in strengthening public
sector institutions in UMICs—for example, helping countries to meet the required
standards for European Union (EU) membership (Bulgaria) or coping with the
aftermath of a fiscal crisis (Argentina, Colombia, and Russia). 24 Case studies
conducted for IEG evaluations support the desirability of starting with the basic
aspects of PFM (such as introducing a unique taxpayer identification system and a
one-year budgeting framework, as in Bulgaria) before moving to more complex
aspects of PFM. The 2008 evaluation of public sector reform found that 60–70
percent of all countries with PFM projects saw improvements in their CPIA scores
for criteria 13 (quality of budget and financial management) and that the scores were
similar for IBRD and IDA borrowers. 25

PFM reforms were a key focus area of World Bank DPLs provided as part of the
response to the global economic crisis. 26 Although some PFM reforms would not
have an immediate impact from a countercyclical perspective, strengthened PFM
and revenue administration had potential to improve fiscal outcomes for any given
fiscal measures in place. The 2012 evaluation of the World Bank’s response to the
global crisis noted that stand-alone crisis response operations were not the most
effective design to support these structural reform agendas because PFM reforms
typically require follow-up actions over an extended period to attain the expected
results. 27

Working with other partners such as the IMF was essential in many of the tax
administration reform cases studied. However, the World Bank’s expertise was
particularly crucial in helping to design and manage the actual projects. A pilot
approach to tax administration proved successful in several cases. 28 The 2012
evaluation found that two-thirds of IBRD countries that received tax administration
projects saw improvements in CPIA scores for criteria 14 (efficiency of resource
mobilization) compared with 46 percent that did not receive such projects.

The 2013 Country Program Evaluation for Brazil provided lessons in the context of a
federal state. Select subnational governments received a large part of World Bank
assistance in Brazil. The report noted that subnational DPLs were ideal vehicles to
address major fiscal-institution reforms that cut across sectors, particularly those
requiring difficult actions and consensus across agencies. The World Bank’s
convening role in providing a platform for cross-sectoral discussions was widely




                                                                                       11
CHAPTER 2
INCLUSIVE AND SUSTAINABLE GROWTH
acknowledged, but replication and demonstration activities across states was a
major challenge.

Civil service and administrative (CSA) reforms are still a relatively difficult and
often unsuccessful area of World Bank assistance. The World Bank used to
emphasize retrenchment and salary decompression among CSA reforms despite
scant evidence on how this would affect performance and accountability, and it had
little success. The 2008 IEG public sector reform evaluation noted that the overall
track record on CSA is disappointing. Using CPIA criteria 15 (quality of public
administration), the evaluation found that 44 percent of IBRD countries that
received CSA reform projects experienced improvements in their CPIA scores
compared with 41 percent that did not have such projects. This implies that whether
an IBRD country had a CSA reform project had only a marginal impact on its
governance ratings. Despite these challenges, the evaluation found several examples
of well-received diagnostic pilots and successfully implemented World Bank–
supported CSA reforms in UMICs (Albania, Bulgaria, and Russia). 29

Anti-corruption and transparency. Reducing opportunities for “petty” or
bureaucratic corruption by simplifying procedures and regulations and getting
incentives right were systemic approaches that have been incorporated in Bank
support to PFM, tax administration, and civil service reform. According to the PSR
evaluation, over 60 percent of IBRD countries receiving PSR lending showed
improvement in CPIA (16)—corruption, transparency and accountability—
compared to 38 percent of countries that did not - almost as good as for PFM. Thus,
many of the previously mentioned reforms were important indirect ways to
improve transparency and target bureaucratic corruption. The evaluation noted that
the World Bank’s country strategies and major operations addressed grand
corruption (also known as state capture) quite infrequently, and direct attempts to
address corruption through anticorruption laws and commissions rarely succeeded.
The available evidence suggests that corruption can be substantially reduced only
when supply-side reforms (PFM legislation, public procurement systems, and CSA)
are complemented by demand-side approaches, such as systematic efforts to
increase citizens’ capability to monitor and challenge abuses of the system and to
inform citizens about their rights and entitlements.

CONCLUSIONS
World Bank lending in the UMICs was especially important in fostering
countercyclical policies and strengthening public sector institutions, particularly in
the area of public finance. Several evaluations recognized the need to keep lending
space at the country level to respond credibly to future crises. 30 The magnitude of
the institutional challenges that UMICs continue to face as they aspire to high-

income status underscores the need for World Bank long-term engagement and
support in this area.

The World Bank’s analytical work is highly valued and needs protection even when
lending volumes are comparatively modest. One of the most robust conclusions
emerging from the IEG 2012 World Bank Response to the Global Crisis evaluations is
the importance of ASA in shaping the quality of the overall assistance, particularly
quality at entry of DPLs. The evaluation cautioned that the World Bank needs to
guard against the risk of ASA being crowded out going forward.


Competitiveness and Productivity
Broad trends in cross-country comparative competitiveness performance show
significant gaps in average competitiveness indicators between HICs and UMICs,
especially for technological readiness and innovation. These gaps have been rather
stable during the period reviewed, 2006–14 (appendix G). The core challenge facing
many UMICs in competitiveness and productivity is associated with a need to shift
to a new developmental model that would rely on a different set of growth drivers.
As soon as countries reach middle-income levels, the pool of underemployed rural
workers drains and wages begin to rise, thus eroding their earlier competitive
advantages (Agénor and Canuto 2012).

Many established UMICs have seen their competitiveness space squeezed. UMICs
have been challenged by rising productivity in dynamic lower-income countries and
by their inability to compete with the developed economies in new market niches
that largely rely on higher skills and product innovation (Lin and Treichel 2012).
The switch from product imitation to broad-based product innovation represents a
significant development challenge, mainly because it requires improvements in the
functioning of key markets and enhanced internal competition (Agénor and Dinh
2013).

EVALUATION FINDINGS
During the reviewed period (2004–16), UMICs as a group attracted a significant part
of World Bank Group project support for improving competitiveness through
furthering innovation, improving the investment climate, promoting public-private
partnerships, and other related activities (appendix E, table E.3). Instruments used to
promote competitiveness in UMICs were highly country-specific and reflected the
client governments’ priorities. For example, the World Bank Group program in
Mauritius relied primarily on a development policy loan series to enhance
competitiveness, and a similar program in South Africa included a large IFC



                                                                                     13

program and broad advisory support through RAS (but very limited World Bank
lending). Development outcomes of similarly designed projects implemented in
different countries (for example, in the housing finance area), varied significantly
mainly because of the differences in client ownership.

Industrial Competitiveness and Innovation

World Bank Group support for innovation was broad in coverage and helped
address various bottlenecks in the countries’ innovation ecosystems, including in the
UMICs. The 2013 IEG evaluation, World Bank Group Support for Innovation and
Entrepreneurship, concludes (based on an analysis of economic growth sources) that
the biggest differences between developed and developing economies are in
innovation performances. However, the World Bank often designed and
implemented interventions at the sector level with strong alignment to local
institutional experiences. These efforts usually failed to address the systemic
weaknesses of innovation ecosystems that hinder competitiveness at the country
level. Furthermore, the evaluation suggested that World Bank lending to support
innovation and entrepreneurship was heavily concentrated in the education and
agriculture sectors, which are not usually the main source of product and process
innovations.

The World Bank Group’s industry-specific interventions to enhance competitiveness
in UMICs focused on introducing new products or systems, or new ways of
processing. Overall, World Bank Group support was relevant, according to the 2016
IEG evaluation, Industry Competitiveness and Jobs: An Evaluation of World Bank Group
Industry-Specific Support to Promote Industrial Competitiveness and its Implications for
Jobs. The evaluation also noted that the World Bank Group’s long-term engagement
made significant contributions to successful transformation in several HICs and
UMICs, including countries such as Chile, China, Korea, Peru, and Poland. 31
However, the evaluation noted that World Bank Group support underemphasized
developing management capacity and manufacturing, despite the importance of
manufacturing as an innovation and employment driver. Instead, the share of
agricultural projects in the portfolio remained high regardless of the client countries’
development stage. Evaluations find that the majority of World Bank Group support
to manufacturing is through IFC’s firm-level projects, and most of these are in the
MICs, but the overall level of IFC investments in the manufacturing sector has been
declining recently.

Investment Climate Reforms

Nearly all country partnership strategies in UMICs see investment climate reforms
as a policy priority, and the World Bank Group portfolio contains many

                                                       INCLUSIVE AND SUSTAINABLE GROWTH
interventions aimed at easing new entry and strengthening competition. The 2015
IEG evaluation of investment climate reforms noted that World Bank Group support
was highly relevant and comprehensive. However, measuring the effectiveness of
World Bank Group interventions and attributing the impact on investment, jobs,
business formation, and growth to World Bank Group support was somewhat
challenging. Furthermore, typical investment climate interventions have focused
mainly on cutting business costs and have not well reflected the social consequences
of proposed reforms.

The portfolio analysis suggests that the share of successful World Bank Group
investment climate projects increases with the level of a client country’s income.
However, it is difficult to make firm conclusions regarding UMICs because the 2015
evaluation of investment climate reforms did not systemically analyze the
differences in program effectiveness by country income level, and the sample of 25
country case studies vastly underrepresented UMICs. However, individual UMICs’
CPEs and case studies seem to show that the World Bank Group has faced
difficulties in helping its higher-income clients alleviate binding constraints in
business environments, often because of political economy constraints. This is
especially relevant to the IFC experience in UMICs, which partly reflects the
prevailing IFC business model of implementing its investment climate projects
through stand-alone advisory services. Consequently, in many instances the
emphasis was on streamlining administrative procedures, but not addressing the
core underlying policy issues. 32

Investment climate reform is an area in which close cooperation across the World
Bank Group might generate particular development benefits. The 2015 IEG
investment climate evaluation noted evidence of a division of labor between IFC and
the World Bank. The World Bank focuses more on higher-level reforms (such as
revising and harmonizing laws and codes, reforming institutions, and developing
strategies) while IFC focuses mostly on streamlining and simplifying procedures
and processes. However, the current division of labor rarely generates synergy and
enhances effectiveness. Available evidence shows some positive examples of
successful collaboration across the World Bank Group in UMICs in this area, but not
many. 33

Public-Private Partnerships and Infrastructure

The 2014 IEG Evaluation of public-private partnerships (PPPs) found that countries
must be sufficiently mature to apply the PPP concept successfully. It is unsurprising
that MICs have captured much of the recent growth in PPP projects and mainly in
two regions: Latin America and the Caribbean and East Asia and Pacific. The


                                                                                    15
CHAPTER 2
INCLUSIVE AND SUSTAINABLE GROWTH
concentration of PPP investments is also quite evident at the country level. The top
five countries combined (Brazil, China, India, Malaysia, and Mexico) represent 60
percent of the World Bank Group’s PPP investment portfolio during 2002–11.

World Bank Group–supported transactions in UMICs often created a market for
PPPs through their demonstration effects and, at times, helped shape the regulatory
environment for PPPs. Demonstration and replication effects of individual PPP
projects were often considered as important as the actual transaction. IFC
investments added value to PPPs during due diligence and implementation stages,
along with providing finance and catalyzing other financiers. IFC’s potentially
unique value proposition to its clients’ lies in its capacity to provide support along
the entire PPP cycle.

World Bank Group–supported PPPs in the UMICs were largely successful in
achieving their development outcomes, though data are scarce on their effects on the
poor. PPP projects’ development outcome ratings tend to be better in countries with
a higher level of readiness in handling PPPs—that is, those countries with better
established frameworks for preparing and approving PPPs and a longer track record
of executing actual transactions. Therefore, UMICs on average tend to overperform
lower-income groups. The 2014 evaluation of PPPs also noted that IFC’s financial
support for actual PPP projects too often reached already-developed PPP countries
and suggested that IFC should identify avenues to invest increasingly in PPPs in
countries and markets that do not yet have a well-developed enabling
environment. 34 Similarly, the 2013 Brazil CPE encouraged expanding IFC work on
PPPs in the country. 35

Regarding more traditional infrastructure investment projects, evaluations of the
World Bank Group portfolio in UMICs contain many examples of triggering critical
policy reforms and achieving significant sector-wide impact even with modest
financing. 36 For example, World Bank Group support in the transport sector for
performance-based road maintenance contracts helped the governments strengthen
the policy and institutional environment for managing their entire road network.37
The 2013 IEG evaluation Improving Institutional Capability and Financial Viability to
Sustain Transport: An Evaluation of World Bank Group Support since 2002 concluded
that World Bank Group engagement in transport is more likely sustained in UMICs
than in other income groups. It also concluded that two subsectors—intercity
highways and ports—more likely sustain engagement in transport than other
subsectors. The same evaluation also noted that IFC transport investments and
MIGA guarantees tend to support projects in UMICs, while the World Bank’s
support is spread more evenly across income groups. 38 Outside the transport sector,
the World Bank was successful in accelerating critical infrastructure reforms in the

information and communication technology (ICT) and power sectors (in Mauritius
and Romania for ICT and in Brazil for power, for example). In the new EU member
countries in the Europe and Central Asia Region, the World Bank Group’s
interventions were instrumental in helping to improve the use of EU structural
funds that expanded the pool of public funding for infrastructure upgrades. In the
telecommunications sector (which the private sector dominates globally), the World
Bank Group’s careful selection of its interventions led to achievement of a
considerable demonstration effect, according to the 2011 IEG evaluation, World Bank
Group Activities in Information and Communication Technologies, Volume 1. 39
Additionality from IFC’s participation in infrastructure projects, including in ICT,
was associated more strongly with its perceived capacity to mitigate political and
regulatory risks than with its financial contributions. 40 The evaluation noted that IFC
investments in the ICT sector were concentrated in IDA-eligible countries and IFC
additionality was more limited in UMICs. 41

Overall, broad success across different infrastructure sectors has remained relatively
rare in the World Bank Group’s operational experience in UMICs. More often than
not, the degree of success varied within a single country depending on the specific
circumstances of particular infrastructure segments. 42

CONCLUSIONS
A comprehensive set of market reforms in UMICs backed by World Bank Group
assistance can provide credible incentives to private investors. In this context, World
Bank Group support to improve UMICs’ competitiveness was largely relevant, and
its comparative advantage in the UMIC context is as a knowledge provider, an
independent broker, and a regulatory risk mitigator. The World Bank Group helped
identify key growth bottlenecks and shape the governments’ policy response. In
several cases, World Bank Group interventions were innovative and had a catalytic
role in helping client countries to establish new sectoral markets. However, IEG
evaluations noted that more efforts could have been made in scaling up, including
more effective replication of successful projects across the countries and
encouraging more South-South learning and exchange.

The UMICs lending portfolio shows significant variation in effectiveness across
various sectors within the same country, which might reflect the World Bank
Group’s limited ability to address political economy constraints in countries that do
not rely on its funding. The World Bank Group provided high quality advisory
support in this area, but its effectiveness is often unclear because of a need for more
systematic efforts to evaluate ASA products’ impact on changes in government
policies.

CHAPTER 2
INCLUSIVE AND SUSTAINABLE GROWTH
The effectiveness of integrating programs to support competitiveness in UMICs
across the World Bank Group showed mixed results—complementarity in industry-
specific support was broadly satisfactory, but it was less so in other areas. A de facto
division of labor between IFC and the World Bank in the investment climate area
did not produce much synergy in the UMICs this review covered.


1Fiscal resilience includes prevention of unsustainable public spending increases and
excessive borrowing during boom times and adaptation—the ability to conduct
countercyclical fiscal policy while preserving debt sustainability—in the face of negative
exogenous shocks. Financial sector resilience includes prevention of procyclical behavior
during upswings and adaptation—the ability to maintain financial intermediation during
systemic bank distress and declining external flows.
2The three most prominent subthemes in these development policy loans were measures to
strengthen macroeconomic management and ensure fiscal sustainability; structural reforms
aimed at improving the cost-effectiveness of public expenditures; and public financial
management reforms.
3 The indicator of fiscal stress is the average of two rankings of recipient countries by the
level of fiscal deficit-to-gross domestic product (GDP) and the level of gross public debt-to-
GDP in 2007–08, reflecting the countries’ precrisis situation. Countries were divided into
three zones: low, moderate, or high fiscal stress.
4This discussion applies to countries in which the deterioration in the fiscal position was
noticeable. This is because the analysis in the 2012 IEG evaluation of Crisis Response
acknowledges that it does not rely on cyclically adjusted fiscal deficits, which are available
for only a few emerging economies, thus precluding an assessment of whether the
deterioration of fiscal positions was commensurate with the growth contraction that
resulted from the crisis or reflected some lingering effect of fiscal stimulus.
5 Credit growth exceeded 50 percent per year in Ukraine, leading to high leverage (more
than 140 percent in Ukraine to more than 240 percent in Latvia) and dependence on foreign
currency funding to finance the credit expansion, with problems of mismatch of duration
and currency. This led to sharp liquidity withdrawals that precipitated runs on banks, the
threat of systemic banking sector collapse, or collapse of other financial institutions. The
banking sector of upper-middle-income countries in the Europe and Central Asia Region
(such as Latvia and Ukraine) was dominated by subsidiaries of major western European
financial institutions, which brought substantial benefits, including in products and best
practices. However, these subsidiaries, which had enhanced access to cross-border funding
(and were also supported by the World Bank Group and other international financial
institutions), also contributed to the very rapid and procyclical credit growth, which in turn
helped fuel very large current account deficits and a build-up of substantial balance of
payment risks.
6A banking crisis is defined as experiencing a threat of bank failure or systemic financial
system failure.




18
7For example, Peru was not particularly credit-constrained, but the country experienced
stock market volatility. However, the opposite was true of Mexico and Venezuela.
8In Kazakhstan, the World Bank’s development policy loans (DPLs) supported reforms in
the financial sector through DPLs that allowed the government to restructure and capitalize
the troubled banks. It also provided technical assistance and policy advice to design and
implement the financial sector reform programs. World Bank policy advice was sound, but
the problem of nonperforming loans continues to linger.
9IFC’s response to the crisis was global initiatives, for example, the Global Trade Finance
Program, the Global Trade Liquidity Program, the Bank Recapitalization Fund, the Debt
and Asset Recovery Program, and the Microfinance Enhancement Fund. MIGA’s crisis
response was concentrated in Europe and Central Asia.
10The indicator of composite financial sector stress is defined as an average of indicators on
deposit decline, credit contraction, and stock market declines, and an increase in Emerging
Market Bond Index spreads. Ranking countries by financial sector stress, 70 percent of
financial sector lending went to countries in the middle tier of financial stress and 23 percent
went to countries facing high financial stress. Sixteen of 43 recipient countries had high
levels of financial stress and received about one-third of commitments; another 27 had
moderate to low levels of stress and received about two-thirds of commitments.
11In Mexico and Turkey, which faced moderate financial stress, a slowdown in credit and
market volatility and difficulties in some loan markets were the main manifestations of the
crisis. Both countries received large development policy loans providing fiscal resources,
which were accompanied by reforms to improve supervision. Directly relevant to the crisis
in Mexico was the World Bank’s investment loan to a second-tier development bank,
promoting the development of the residential mortgage market together with reforms of
housing finance. In Croatia and Turkey, the authorities preferred financial intermediation
loans—lines of credit from financial intermediaries to private borrowers through
participating financial institutions. In Colombia (a moderate-stress country) and Uruguay (a
low-stress country), where reforms had been taken in the sector during previous years with
World Bank assistance, DPLs focused on supervisory issues and further reforms in the
overall capital markets.
12The 12 Financial Sector Assessment Programs (FSAPs) completed no more than three
years before the onset of the crisis (2005 and later) in 18 reviewed country cases were fairly
successful in identifying strengths and weaknesses and provided a good basis for later
interventions. More recent FSAPs in countries facing high financial stress (Croatia, Latvia,
and Ukraine) focused more on liquidity risks, external funding, and crisis preparedness and
identified the vulnerabilities. In moderate- and low-stress UMICs (Colombia, Mexico,
Turkey, Uruguay), FSAPs identified macroeconomic and structural vulnerabilities.
13A joint World Bank–IMF review found that about 60 percent of FSAP recommendations
are typically implemented.
14Examples of successful regulatory reforms include support to Morocco and Turkey to
create mortgage laws and facilitate securitization.
15Mexico’s banking and securities regulator did not regulate the Sofoles as it was believed
that the market could regulate them given their dependence on capital market finance. The


                                                                                              19
lack of prudential regulation was an important factor in the demise of the Sofoles. IFC
missed the warning signs, such as the fast growth and increasingly risky lending of the
Sofoles it supported in Mexico. The Sofoles collapsed when the capital markets closed
during the global crisis, leading to losses in several IFC investments.
16Before the financial crisis in 2008, the World Bank had been supporting the transformation
and funding of Sociedad Hipotecaria Federal (SHF), the housing development bank. SHF
supported many nonbank financial institutions that provided mortgage lending, a
significant majority of which targeted the low-income population segment (such as Su
Casita, one of the two largest nonbank financial institutions before the crisis). Most Su
Casita mortgage finance customers were from the low-income housing sector. Before the
crisis, Su Casita was considered a highly successful model for low-income housing finance.
An IEG Learning Product on Housing Finance (World Bank 2016d) cites Morocco as one of the
successful examples: “In Morocco, appropriate World Bank–supported institutional
consolidation support led to the rise of a strong government counterpart that was key to the
sustained success of the low-income program.”
17
  For example, Romania provided funds to microfinance institutions that stimulated the
delivery of financial services to smallholders while transforming these intermediaries from
informal entities into profitable, regulated firms under central bank supervision.
18The Worldwide Governance Indicators cover voice and accountability, political stability
and the absence of violence or terrorism, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule
of law, and control of corruption.
19The charts in figure F.1 (appendix F) use established Organisation for Economic Co-
Operation and Development member countries (western Europe, the United States, Canada,
Japan, and Australasia) and UMICs as they are defined in this study.
20The lack of major evaluations in these areas could be because lending for public sector
reform (PSR) is more frequent in IDA countries due to a greater need for PSR and stronger
pressure to conduct it. For example, IEG’s 2012 evaluation World Bank Country-Level
Engagement on Governance and Anticorruption does not include any case studies of UMICs.
21The 2008 evaluation of Public Sector Reform covered World Bank support on PSR to all
countries in four subsectors: public financial management, civil service and administrative
reform, tax administration, and anticorruption and transparency.
22This finding needs cautious interpretation. A higher degree of self-selection by IBRD
borrowers that had PSR lending programs probably contributed to the difference, implying
that IBRD countries that are more enthusiastic about PSR and would have improved
somewhat anyway were more likely to get World Bank support. In IBRD countries, the
government usually has more financial freedom and in-house technical capacity to decide
whether it will borrow for a PSR project, when to borrow, and for what purpose. World
Bank strategy then tends to be more tailored to country circumstances compared with IDA
Poverty Reduction Support Credit countries, where the World Bank and donors more often
insist on a full array of public sector reforms.
23The rate of improvement for nonborrowers—86 percent—was almost as high. This is
partly because nearly all the countries in Europe and Central Asia that did not borrow for
PSR in 1999–2006 were among the first from Central and Eastern Europe to join the EU and


                                                                                           20
had already implemented a lot of reforms with World Bank support before 1999. However,
the momentum of public sector reform was not confined to EU accession countries because
much of the region was engaged in an historic move from a command economy to a market
economy—a task that called for comprehensive institutional reform.
24Public financial management (PFM) systems are budget institutions that include budget
formulation, preparation, approval, execution, and evaluation.
 However, the public sector reform evaluation does not distinguish upper- and lower-
25

middle-income IBRD borrowers, thus precluding a more granular assessment.
26Reforms were part of an integrated approach to strengthening PFM systems and
institutions in Poland and Serbia. The World Bank supported the rollout of medium-term
expenditure frameworks in Georgia (for the public investment program), Mexico, Poland,
Romania, and Serbia, but progress in this direction varied across countries. It also supported
the introduction or implementation of fiscal rules limiting the increase in public spending or
the level of the fiscal deficit in some countries, notably Peru and Poland.
27 The implementation of public expenditure evaluation systems in Mexico is an example of
such stand-alone crisis response operation. By contrast, the World Bank initiated a crisis
response operation in Romania in 2009 as part of a programmatic DPL series, knowing that
it would take time to implement structural fiscal reforms to bring the fiscal position to a
sustainable footing.
28Implementation of a value added tax was used as a pilot to introduce a modern taxpayer
identification system and tax collection in Albania. The establishment of large taxpayer units
served the same purpose in Bulgaria and Russia.
29To help the political leadership identify tangible benefits of civil service administration
reform, the World Bank supported the development of measurable progress indicators in
Albania, such as the percentage of recruitment by merit (which reportedly the government
regularly tracks). Russia is an example of achieving positive results by designing reform
measures that tried to shift existing practice instead of advocating for a complete change.
Bulgaria made little progress with downsizing, but it successfully implemented
compensation reform and human resource management reform.
30Countries such as Mexico were able to borrow from the World Bank during the global
economic crisis because their effective fiscal and debt management in better times before the
crisis had allowed them to prepay the World Bank. In other cases, such as Ukraine, World
Bank exposure was increased even when private capital flows were abundant.
31In several advanced economies in the Europe and Central Asia Region, the World Bank is
credited with making critical initial contributions to the formulation of countries’
developmental strategies through research and technical assistance to introduce basic
economic reforms, modern management practices, and the like. It later shifted its assistance
to facilitate institutional reforms and knowledge transfer. In China, World Bank Group
financing represents a small share of China’s total financing needs, but it is significant in
bringing ideas, knowledge, and best-practice experience to help the country improve firm
and sector competitiveness. In Chile, the World Bank Group contributed to enhancing the
innovation system’s effectiveness through two highly innovative investment projects to
stimulate cross-sector cooperation between research and industry. In Peru, the World Bank


                                                                                            21
Group was instrumental in a major economic transformation related to improvements in
country competitiveness, diversification, and sustainable growth. IFC investments in
agribusiness and tourism were catalytic to building a momentum in these sectors when they
were considered too risky. In Mauritius, reforms to enhance competitiveness were the core
of the World Bank Group’s partnership strategy. It provided support largely through DPLs
complemented by analytics and technical assistance for capacity building. However, this
effort was only moderately successful. World Bank Group interventions helped to increase
foreign direct investment inflows and enhance export diversification, but the country’s
competitiveness is still constrained by skilled labor shortages and inadequate quality of
infrastructure services.
32 The investment climate program in Peru is typical in this respect. The World Bank Group
undertook a relevant set of diagnostic work, but the program intended to address only a
narrow set of investment climate constraints. It succeeded in catalyzing some reforms to
reduce regulatory obstacles (including simplifying business registration), but it did not
engage in more critical and politically sensitive areas, such as high tax rates and a restrictive
labor code. Compared with this type of average UMIC experience, the World Bank’s
investment climate program in Mauritius was unusually ambitious and successful. Along
with streamlining business registration, it made a crucial contribution to liberalizing the
labor market (including hiring skilled foreign labor) and accelerating the business
liquidation process. However, the government’s lack of interest in further reforms since
2011 put the sustainability of some of these achievements at risk. The World Bank Group’s
more positive experience with similar investment climate reforms in transition economies in
Europe and Central Asia could be linked largely to strong government ownership that
reflected the political consensus regarding longer-term national priorities aimed at EU
membership. This helped maintain the reform momentum even when national governments
were replaced. The World Bank support in countries such as Bulgaria, Poland, and Romania
(though significantly varied) helped the governments identify binding investment climate
constraints and make the right choices regarding setting priorities for necessary reforms.
This group of clients especially appreciate the good quality analytical and advisory
products. By contrast, the World Bank Group was unable to make a significant impact in
reducing the costs of doing business in Brazil, where local political interests are more
fragmented, and this area is still a critical constraint to the country’s growth. Brazil’s tax
burden has been high, nontransparent, and complex, and the trade regime was quite
distortive. The World Bank did not give either of these areas enough attention. A pilot IFC
Doing Business in Brazil report (2006) highlighted large differences in the costs of doing
business across the states and thus established an important set of benchmarks. However,
the report had limited follow-up (beyond the state of São Paulo).
33One of the most profound success stories is in Serbia, where IFC, the World Bank, and the
World Bank Institute collaborated on the Regulatory Impact Analysis Project. The project
had a clear division of tasks and continuous communication between task team leaders,
especially before endorsing any action and requirement with the client. Another example is
in the Latin America and the Caribbean Region, where the World Bank and IFC have jointly
managed the investment climate work. Joint management helped improve client
management and ensure that project development was more collaborative, though at a high
administrative cost.


                                                                                              22
34IFC’s public-private partnership (PPP) portfolio has been overconcentrated in the select
group of UMICs, which creates at least two problems. It limits the demonstration effect of
IFC operations, and it reduces business opportunities for IFC Investment Services because
commercial banks increasingly become more prominent financiers of PPPs, especially in the
established sectors of UMICs.
35One of the Brazil country program evaluation’s recommendations is to expand more IFC
work on PPPs in the country. The evaluation states, “IFC has added significant value in its
support for PPP project structuring, and demand remains high for innovative projects that
can be replicated and scaled up elsewhere in Brazil. Further expansion of the PPP
collaboration with the National Bank for Economic and Social Development should be
pursued. As the expansion of PPP projects in Brazil depends critically on the enabling
regulatory environment and its predictability, this is an area for close collaboration between
the IFC and the World Bank, as noted earlier. IFC should also increase direct investments in
infrastructure projects and project sponsors that have the potential to transfer IFC’s
knowledge on project financing as well as social and environmental standards
36Peru is a best-practice example of the World Bank’s support for infrastructure
development in the UMIC’s context and cooperation across the World Bank Group. IBRD
helped introduce best practices in sustainable infrastructure development and financed
highly relevant projects to expand rural and urban infrastructure, while IFC and MIGA
supported several PPPs that helped relieve the investment burden on the public sector. IFC
and MIGA helped arrange several private concessions in Peru—some were highly visible
(such as private management of Lima’s international airport) and had an important
signaling role. IEG rated the outcome of this infrastructure support program as highly
satisfactory.
37In Chile, Kazakhstan, and Poland, World Bank projects helped set new road-management
standards. Resource-rich Kazakhstan decided to proceed with World Bank loans of $3
billion to ensure sound investment planning and execution of the program to expand its
road network. World Bank involvement helped introduce stronger fiduciary and
governance standards, upgrade local contractors’ capacity, and launch modern contract-
outsourcing practices.
38According to IEG 2013 Transport evaluation, projects supported by IDA and IBRD are
evenly divided between upper-middle-income and lower-middle-income countries) about
35–38 percent each), and low-income countries receive 22 percent of the total projects. The
majority of IFC projects are in upper-middle-income countries (62 percent), followed by
lower-middle-income (22 percent) and low-income (8 percent) countries. Upper-middle-
income countries dominate MIGA’s transport guarantees (a pattern similar to IFC’s),
receiving 80 percent of total guarantees, followed by lower-middle-income (13 percent) and
low-income (7 percent) countries (IEG 2013).
39Examples include Bulgaria Revenue Administration Reform Projects, which promoted
information and communication technology (ICT) applications in the public sector, and the
Russia E-Learning Support Project, which provided support for ICT skills development.
World Bank projects also helped expand access to ICT services for the poor in several
UMICs, such as Chile and Romania.

40Other prominent examples of UMIC where the World Bank infrastructure interventions
had a catalytic role include Turkey (power), where the World Bank was successful in
supporting policy reforms to encourage private sector investment in power generation and
integrating principles of environmental sustainability in the key sectoral policies; Mauritius
(ICT), where the World Bank Group combined support for regulatory reforms in ICT with
investments in critical infrastructure to improve broadband connectivity—as a result, the
prices of ICT services fell, the sector expanded strongly, and the share of ICT services in
total services exports more than doubled between 2007 and 2013; and Russia (airports),
where the World Bank, through Reimbursable Advisory Services, successfully supported
arrangements for a public-private partnership for Pulkovo Airport in St. Petersburg—one of
the first PPPs of such scale in Russia.
41IDA-eligible countries represented 61 percent of total ICT investments out of a total
commitment of $2.7 billion with 100 approved projects during FY03–10.
42 The notable example is Tunisia, where a failure to improve cost recovery in railway
services was accompanied by a major breakthrough in seaport commercialization. In
Mauritius, the success of World Bank–supported reforms in ICT and IFC’s failure to
improve port operations contrasted greatly and was a critical development constraint for the
island’s economy.

3. Investing in People
    Highlights
     The evaluative evidence suggests that World Bank Group engagement in
      projects that support investments in people added value in upper-middle-
      income countries (UMICs).
     World Bank support for education in UMICs focused on second-generation
      issues such as early childhood education and enhanced quality outcomes.
     Health financing was a major focus of World Bank support for the health
      sector in UMICs.
     Support to improve the quality of life in urban areas included core urban
      services such as electricity, water and sanitation, transport, and housing for
      the poor.
     Conditional cash transfers to enhance the quality of life of the poor and
      vulnerable seem to be among the most successful and transformative
      programs supported by the World Bank.
     Social safety nets (SSNs) were important in mitigating the impact of crises
      on the poor and most vulnerable strata of population, and middle-income
      countries showed strong demand for World Bank support in this area.
     World Bank lending for social protection increased during the global
      financial crisis to nearly four times its pre-crisis levels, and the largest
      increase was for poverty-targeted SSN programs.
     Outcomes in social sectors in UMICs were generally positive, but the urban
      sector had mixed outcomes, reflecting both the complexity of the
      multisectoral operations and capacity issues at the local level.

Interventions aimed at investing in people include the social sectors (education,
health, and social protection) and enhancements in urban living conditions. The
World Bank’s strategic assessment of where progress was slow and needed to be
accelerated drove the program in some upper-middle-income countries (UMICs),
but it mostly reflected the areas in which governments wanted World Bank support.
In those areas, countries in the Latin America and the Caribbean Region dominated
World Bank support to UMICs (appendix E, figure E.11). Human capital and quality
of life issues featured strongly in these countries’ internal political dialogue, and
governments saw the World Bank as able to contribute to and validate government-
sponsored programs. The World Bank had little or no lending in this area in UMICs
in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. 1 It provided some support to Europe and Central
Asia (Bulgaria, Poland, and Romania), but these countries had relatively well-


                                                                                   25
CHAPTER 3
INVESTING IN PEOPLE
developed health and education sectors, so support tended to be in niche areas, such
as helping with the needs of the Roma community. 2 Tunisia and Turkey were the
only countries with significant programs in this area outside of Latin America.


Evaluation Findings
The World Bank Group had a substantial portfolio in quality of life–related issues in
the UMICs during the period under review. Countries with more limited access to
resources are often reluctant to borrow from international financial institutions for
the social sectors because these sectors do not generate the financial returns needed
to service the loans. However, this is a lesser issue for some UMICs where the
borrowing is likely to be a smaller proportion of overall financing. The issue for
UMICs tends to be whether to borrow at all (South Africa and Thailand) instead of
whether to borrow for the social sectors.

Most of reviewed IEG project evaluations of health and education in UMICs
reflected generally positive outcomes. Evaluations suggest that these countries
decision to borrow represents a judgment that such borrowing adds value to their
own programs in these areas. However, the urban sector had mixed outcomes,
reflecting both the complexity of the multisectoral operations supported and
capacity issues of city and regional client governments.

SOCIAL SAFETY NETS
Social safety nets (SSNs) were important in mitigating the impact of crises on the
poor and most vulnerable strata of the population, particularly in the aftermath of
economic contractions in UMICs such as Colombia, Mexico, and Turkey. IEG 2011
evaluation, Social Safety Nets: An Evaluation of World Bank Support, shows that
stronger demand for SSN support in MICs led to significantly stronger engagement
than in low-income countries. Both country demand for SSN support and the supply
of World Bank support drove the stronger engagement in middle-income countries
(MICs). On the demand side, MICs have a higher capacity to borrow and spend and
can invest in more costly institutional development and scale-up programs rather
than short-term relief programs and pilots, which low-income countries typically
use. Furthermore, the capacity to do so could be expected a fortiori to be stronger on
average in UMICs. On the supply side, the World Bank (during the evaluation
period) moved from a project-level approach that emphasized delivery of social
assistance benefits to an approach focused on helping countries build SSN systems
and institutions—particularly concentrated in MICs—to respond more effectively to
poverty, risk, and vulnerability.

                                                                      INVESTING IN PEOPLE
CONDITIONAL CASH TRANSFERS
Conditional cash transfers (CCTs) to enhance the quality of life of the poor and
vulnerable seem to be among the most successful and transformative programs the
World Bank supported. Many IEG project level evaluations emphasize that these
programs tend to take a holistic view of coverage of health, education, and SSNs. In
Brazil and Mexico, governments saw a comparative advantage for the World Bank
in its ability to support programs that required coordination across ministries and to
support the core ministries in managing these projects. 3 In particular:

   •   The World Bank sought to increase capacities in health, nutrition, and
       education of poor families in Mexico through human capital investment by
       promoting regular health checkups, improving health status, and raising
       school enrollment and attendance fees.
   •   Brazil’s Bolsa Familia CCT program transformed the country’s social
       assistance program by providing adequate incentives for desired changes in
       behavior among targeted beneficiaries (for example, vaccinations and school
       attendance). The World Bank has supported the program from early in its
       inception, and the authorities credit it with contributing to the design and
       implementation and providing a sounding board for the officials in charge.

According to the 2012 IEG evaluation of The World Bank Group's Response to the Global
Economic Crisis: Phase 2 and the portfolio review conducted for this synthesis, World
Bank lending for social protection increased during the crisis to nearly four times its
pre-crisis levels. Although social protection includes SSNs, active labor market
programs, and social insurance and pensions, the evaluation reported that the
largest increase was for poverty-targeted SSN programs. Most lending was
concentrated in the Europe and Central Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean
Regions in a handful of UMICs that experienced contractions in the formal and
informal labor markets, jobs, and earnings. 4 This sharp increase was possible partly
due to the World Bank’s longer-term engagement in this area through both
analytical work and lending. 5

EDUCATION
World Bank support for education in UMICs focused on second-generation issues,
such as early childhood education 6 and enhanced quality outcomes, 7 because many
UMICs made major progress in resolving the first-generation education issues of
access for all and gender equality.8 World Bank support for the quality of primary
and secondary education covered three main program areas: increasing community
participation in decisions affecting education, improving pedagogy, and reducing
dropouts and increasing school completion rates. Some specific examples are:



                                                                                      27
CHAPTER 3
INVESTING IN PEOPLE
     •   In Mexico, the World Bank provided support intended to improve the
         learning outcomes of children in the most marginalized municipalities. The
         Programa Escuelas de Calidad, established in 2001, has been successful in
         introducing school autonomy and improving local participation in education.
         The World Bank supported Turkey in its efforts to enhance the quality of
         education through projects and analytics on secondary education and
         vocational training. However, supporting better quality education generally
         had mixed outcomes.
     •   In Colombia, IEG project evaluation noted that although indicators on
         student enrollment for the education objective were all nearly achieved, the
         challenge is not only to increase enrollments but to focus on improving
         education quality. The Programme for International Student Assessment
         (PISA) results in Colombia show that the percentage of students who test at
         the lowest levels in math, reading, and science has increased recently.
     •   In Argentina, the World Bank focused on education inequalities and sought
         to improve completion rates for students in lower secondary rural education.
         However, the IEG project evaluation notes that this should be seen against an
         apparent stagnation in educational attainments, according to the 2013 PISA
         showing Argentina ranked as 59 out of 65 nations and with no apparent
         improvement since the year 2000.

HEALTH
The World Bank’s support for the health sector focused on enabling the poor to
access health services, improving the quality of health services, and pandemic
response. Health financing was a major focus of World Bank support in the UMICs,
including support for risk pooling to increase the poor’s participation and
concurrent steps to subsidize their enrollment. 9, 10, 11 Furthermore, progress in
addressing communicable diseases in most UMICs and rising life expectancy shifted
the focus to noncommunicable diseases. Instead of supporting programs focused on
addressing particular disease vectors, the World Bank supported building the
quality of the health care system to address noncommunicable diseases.

The World Bank tended toward a broad view of upgrading health services in UMICs
through better facilities and institutional restructuring, often in support of a
comprehensive, government-led reform effort. The World Bank also provided
support to UMICs in coping with pandemics, particularly avian influenza. The 2013
Brazil country program evaluation (CPE) noted IFC’s involvement as crucial in
structuring the Hospital do Subúrbio project, the first public-private partnership (PPP)
hospital transaction in Brazil. IFC provided international expertise in project finance,

                                                                    INVESTING IN PEOPLE
assisted in promoting private sector financing, and helped set performance
standards for the hospital. 12

SUPPORT FOR EMPLOYMENT CREATION
Evaluative evidence to assess the effectiveness of World Bank support to MICs for
job creation is insufficient. A 2009 IEG evaluation, Earnings Growth and Employment
Creation: An Assessment of World Bank Support in Three Middle-Income Countries,
concluded that despite notable progress in economic growth, earnings, and poverty
reduction, unemployment rates remained high in these countries. This is at least
partly attributable to the lack of sufficient focus on the binding constraints on the
functioning of labor markets and lack of attention to related political economy
issues. The employment-related objectives were not always formulated and
unbundled into more proximate objectives. However, the experience of these three
countries shows how ASA can be the main instrument of support in the areas where
reform progress is difficult and the need for consensus building is critical (labor
regulations, for example). Although delivered ASA products were relevant and
technically competent, the actual impact was unclear. Labor rigidity and labor taxes
remained a constraint to employment in all three countries and particularly to
formal employment, and there are persistent difficulties for setting up
unemployment insurance systems.

There is limited evidence on the impact of World Bank Group support on youth
employment. The conclusions of the 2012 IEG evaluation Youth Employment
Programs: An Evaluation of World Bank and International Finance Corporation Support
are broadly consistent with the 2009 report on earnings growth and employment
creation. The evaluation recognized that high youth unemployment is an important
issue for many MICs. World Bank support to youth employment between 2001 and
2011 was mainly to MICs with large lending programs, and most of the actual
lending went to the Europe and Central Asia region for vocational training, school-
to-work transition, and investment climate. The evaluation found that the impact of
World Bank Group support on youth employment (for example, wage subsidies,
public works programs, vocational training, and the like) remains largely unknown.
Youth employment is not a strategic issue in World Bank Group country strategies.
The majority of World Bank projects provide no information on youth as a
beneficiary group. The scarcity of project data severely constrains the ability to
assess the impact of the World Bank Group’s support on labor market outcomes.
The 2012 evaluation of youth employment programs recommended taking a
strategic approach to youth employment in country programs by addressing the
issue comprehensively, working across sectors and with other donors.

CHAPTER 3
INVESTING IN PEOPLE
URBAN SERVICES
The pace of urbanization in most UMICs is rapid. The World Bank supported a wide
range of interventions designed to improve the quality of life in urban areas. These
included support for core urban services such as electricity, water and sanitation,
and transport; housing for the poor and lower-middle-income groups; and even
urban amenities and crime prevention in some cases. A key issue for the World Bank
was whether to use a vertical approach based on support (often multi-sectoral) for
particular cities or adopt a horizontal approach to support better water and
sanitation. IFC also contributed in this area through its investment in PPPs or
privately owned urban service providers.

Case study evidence on UMICs suggest that the World Bank has achieved positive
results in the water sector. The Tunisia CPE noted that the World Bank contributed
to articulating and supporting sectoral reform issues. Six World Bank–financed
water projects were active during the review period and covered a wide range of
activities. Water and sanitation infrastructure improved because of these projects,
which helped expand the reach of these services in rural and urban areas. World
Bank support in Argentina aimed to improve the quality of basic municipal services
through the provision of water supply and sanitation, urban drainage, and roads
infrastructure in an equitable and fiscally sustainable way. IEG found that the
project objective was substantially achieved because the infrastructure investments
improved the quality of life through access to safe water and reliable water
resources, sanitation services, reduced losses and travel time through improved
road networks, and reduced costs from floods.

GENDER
There is considerable scope to examine gender-related issues further in MICs and
UMICs. A review of IEG’s evaluative evidence on the World Bank’s gender-related
work in MICs found a lack of specific discussion of its performance in MICs or
UMICs as income categories. However, the review found several interesting
findings at the country level, though they are limited to the Latin America and
Caribbean Region (Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Colombia).

Many MICs incorporated gender into country strategies, but outcomes were not
assessed. The Results and Performance Report (RAP) 2015 highlights gender
integration in World Bank Group operations and country strategies as a key theme.
The report reviews all 58 country strategies that closed in FY12–14 (including many
for MICs) to assess whether gender issues are integrated into country strategies. The
report noted IDA and IBRD projects do not identify gender relevance or articulate a

                                                                             CHAPTER 3
                                                                    INVESTING IN PEOPLE
results chain but it does not discuss the difference between IDA and IBRD. The
previous RAPs mainly discuss gender issues in IDA countries.

Analytical work conducted by the World Bank was highly valued and provided a
strong foundation for partnerships. Perhaps the strongest explicit statement of this
for UMICs—which are among the most demanding of the World Bank’s clients—
appears in the 2011 evaluation of Social Safety Nets, which states that UMICs found
the World Bank’s ASA highly relevant and sought to borrow from the World Bank
to secure its support. Through its analytic work, the World Bank maintained a policy
dialogue with governments that contributed to informing health financing reforms
in countries such as Mexico, Poland, and Turkey. The World Bank has consistently
warned against excessive fragmentation of risk pooling arrangements that can lead
to systems being financially unsustainable (Mexico, Poland, and Turkey). 13
Analytical work also informed World Bank advice on managing or protecting public
revenues for health. 14 Technical assistance and lending helped governments develop
new laws and administration to strengthen social insurance management, mainly in
middle-income countries.

Good analytic work is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for effective support
for better policies. The 2014 Tunisia CPE reports that although the country
continued to make good progress on health outcomes overall, the World Bank’s role
in the health sector was modest during the evaluation period. Its contribution was
through analytical work on health sector issues and technical assistance to
strengthen institutional capacities and hospital accreditation. The World Bank’s ASA
was relevant and of good quality, but it had very little impact on actual policies. A
good example of how the World Bank can use its analytic work to produce a
significant impact is seen it its support for improved pedagogy and learning
outcomes in Brazil. Major works on the interaction between students and teachers
observed at the classroom level have been written and disseminated across Brazil.
This work helped to identify incentives and bonus systems to improve students’
outcomes.


Conclusions
The evaluative evidence suggests that World Bank engagement in investing in
people has added value to UMICs. In some cases, the World Bank helped countries
adopt new or innovative programs that might not be in place without World Bank
support (for example, the use of conditional cash transfers in Turkey for supporting
education and health programs). The World Bank also helped countries to adapt and
fine-tune existing programs to enhance their effectiveness. Furthermore, it enabled



                                                                                    31
CHAPTER 3
INVESTING IN PEOPLE
knowledge transfer in this area, bringing teams from countries on study tours,
organizing workshops and seminars, and producing relevant publications. The
evaluative evidence is particularly strong on the finding that the World Bank’s
participation in these programs helped countries provide access and benefits to
more of the poor and vulnerable than would have received them without such
participation.

The evaluations are consistent in highlighting the key role of the World Bank’s
analytic work in supporting reforms in the MICs. This is particularly the case where
there is commitment to reforms and interest in what the World Bank can offer to the
program’s technical soundness. However, evidence suggests that the World Bank’s
analytic work also helped build the constituency and support for the reforms.

The more successful programs the World Bank supported were generally long in
duration and went well beyond the scope of a single project. The World Bank’s
willingness to sustain its engagement and build close relationships at the technical
level contributed to successful outcomes.

While there are many reforms that can be implemented at a micro-level, the most
impressive programs tended to be national in scale. Even when programs are
undertaken in particular places, anchoring them in broader national efforts has
value. This can leverage the program that the World Bank is supporting and
contribute to its sustainability.


1In Malaysia, South Africa, and Thailand, the World Bank had very limited lending
programs. In Mauritius, the government was reluctant to borrow for health and education.
2World Bank support for the Roma community in Romania was a major part of its activities
in that country. Approaches that the World Bank supported have had considerable impact
on what was often regarded as an intractable problem. In Romania, the Social Inclusion
Project (FY06) helped build and rehabilitate kindergartens in 27 Roma communities, and
develop an early childhood education curriculum and train staff. It also experimented with
alternative community-based solutions for early childhood education. The project contained
subcomponents aimed at improved access to rural infrastructure, roads, and water supply
in targeted Roma communities. The gap in the living conditions index between targeted
Roma settlements and neighboring communities was reduced by more than 40 percent
between 2008 and 2013. The World Bank continues to support the government with advice
on developing national policies and identifying cost-effective programs to integrate the
Roma.
3In Mexico, the World Bank sought to increase capacities in health, nutrition and education
of poor families through human capital investment by promoting regular health checkups,
improving health status, and raising school enrollment and attendance fees. With the World
Bank’s support to the Oportunidades conditional cash transfer (CCT) program and


32
additional financing (FY09 and FY11), the number of families participating increased from
5.2 million to 5.8 million in December 2012 (three years later), and the target of 3 million
more children participating in the program was surpassed. Brazil’s Bolsa Familia CCT
program transformed the country’s social assistance program by providing adequate
incentives for desired changes in behavior among targeted beneficiaries (for example,
vaccinations and school attendance). The program is addressing the poor’s significant gap in
access to education and health services compared with the national average. The World
Bank has supported the program from early in its inception and is credited by the
authorities with contributing to the design and implementation and providing a sounding
board for the officials in charge. The program was designed to cover 32 percent of the
population, including the poor and extremely poor. The program has been key to the
reduction in poverty and equity, accounting for about one-fifth of the reduction in the Gini
coefficient. It ensures that beneficiaries understand the expectations for changes in behavior.
The conditions under which cash transfers will be made have been widely publicized in
Brazil.
4Mexico received the largest share, and other important recipients were Brazil, Colombia,
the Dominican Republic, Poland, and Uruguay.
5 In Bulgaria, Latvia, and Romania, World Bank support allowed an expansion of either
temporary public works programs or guaranteed minimum income programs. These
programs Where programs could be scaled up quickly where they were well structured and
where sufficient information was available (Brazil, Bulgaria, Colombia, and Mexico.)
Targeting groups specifically affected by the crisis was implemented better if updated
household surveys existed and impact studies were in place, as in Latvia, Mexico, and
Poland. In countries with weak systems, the World Bank focused more on consolidation of
programs and longer-term reforms.
6Mexico was a pioneer in early childhood education. In 2014, nearly 70 percent of 3-year-
olds and 100 percent of 4-year-olds were in some form of preschooling. Cash transfers were
an important part of enabling the participation of the poor. The World Bank supported this
program at the Mexican government’s request to help insure that the resources devoted to
the program were having the intended impact. World Bank support helped strengthen
parental involvement in the program and build stronger links with health and nutrition
programs. Although the World Bank made a positive contribution, its participation might
have been even more important in enabling the World Bank Group to gain a firsthand
understanding of the potentials and pitfalls of programs in this area.
7 The World Bank Group supported Turkey in its efforts to enhance the quality of education
through the Basic Education Adaptable Program Loan, the Secondary Education Project,
and Advisory Services and Analytics activities on secondary education and vocational
training. The 2012 completion and learning report review (CLRR) notes that secondary
enrollment increased from 57 percent to 69 percent during the country partnership strategy
period, and graduation rates increased from 45 to 51 percent. Furthermore, educational
quality improved according to the Programme for International Student Assessment scores
(the average reading score rose from 447 in 2006 to 464 in 2009—the latest available year;
math scores rose from 424 to 445, and science scores increased from 424 to 454).
8   During the evaluation period, a few UMICs still had access issues to address.


                                                                                            33
9Interventions in the UMICs were in six countries: Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, Poland,
Romania, and Turkey (appendix I).
10The share of poor included in risk pools increased in countries where the World Bank
helped governments subsidize their enrollment. In Turkey, insurance coverage for the
poorest increased more than fourfold between 2003 and 2011, generating a coverage rate of
85 percent for the poorest. The public health insurance has recently incorporated the Green
Card Program, which subsidizes health care for the poorest income group and is funded by
general government revenues. World Bank–supported insurance reform in Turkey
contributed to improved equity in health financing across income groups and substantially
reduced catastrophic expenditures for the poor while increasing their service use. Similarly,
the World Bank’s development policy operation in Colombia helped increase the enrollment
of low-income groups in government-subsidized insurance from 10.7 million in 2002 to 18.2
million in 2007. By March 2014, about 43 million people (90 percent of the population) was
insured in Colombia. Colombia’s health insurance for the poor lowers the mean inpatient
spending for patients and is associated with the use of preventive series and health gains for
children.
11World Bank support strengthened management and information systems in Poland,
where the case-based payment (supported by World Bank policy lending) contributes to
transparency and improved data availability in the social health insurance fund. Similarly,
in Argentina (among others), supervision of health facilities, information and reporting
systems, and routine data validity improved. The World Bank also helped increase revenues
for health by subsidizing contributions to various insurance institutions for low-income
groups. This type of World Bank support was implemented through lending and policy
dialogue in countries such as Mexico and Turkey. The World Bank supported the explicit
targeting of subsidies to finance contributions for low-income groups through means testing
in Turkey. IEG’s review of project completion reports found that in Colombia, the World
Bank’s Public Sector and Health teams (mainly through development policy operations)
supported improvements in tax collection from employers and employees, which increased
revenue transfers from the tax authority to social health insurance. In Eastern Europe
(including Turkey), the World Bank recommended budgetary caps on spending to manage
spending growth. In Argentina, World Bank lending and policy advice ensured that the
government financed and protected basic and cost-effective health programs, including the
availability of reproductive health care services for low-income groups in public facilities.
The World Bank, through development policy operations, recommended introducing
copayments with exemptions for lower-income groups in Romania.
12The hospital in Brazil operates more efficiently than public hospitals. It has flexibility and
speed in hiring employees and procuring medical equipment, and has maintained the high
standards a private hospital operator needs to meet a set of performance standards. Hospital
do Subúrbio serves the poor community of Salvador in Bahia and provides high-quality care
to the community. This innovative PPP hospital project was replicated in at least seven other
states and municipalities in Brazil. In 2011, the project was selected as one of KPMG’s 100
most innovative projects. IEG’s review of this project notes that IFC brought transparency
and independence during the project’s structuring and financial closure and played the
honest broker role for a road show presentation. Furthermore, Brazil’s stock exchange
oversaw the bidding for higher transparency—another IFC value added.

13In Mexico, a World Bank study found that government-subsidized risk pooling among the
poor through Seguro Popular incentivized informality. Although Seguro Popular improved
access to care, it was associated with a 3.1 percentage point fall in the flow of workers into
formality. Members could avoid having to contribute to the formal social health insurance
program by moving to the informal sector and receiving services under Seguro Popular.
However, the government chose not to consolidate Seguro Popular with the formal SHI
program to reduce fragmentation.
14The World Bank contributed to the process of conceiving, developing, and implementing
Turkey’s Health Transformation Program through extensive informal brainstorming
sessions and timely, targeted technical advice. A key output was a health sector report
produced in 2003 that developed the roadmap for reform. Important lending activities
included two policy loans in 2004 and 2009, which were vehicles for providing technical
support for the Health Transformation Program. The program’s outcomes have been
positive (out-of-pocket payments fell from 22 percent of total health expenditures to 16
percent, access to care reached 97 percent of the population, and all the major health
indicators have improved, for example). In Romania, the World Bank’s technical advice
sought to rationalize medical service provision. The World Bank diagnostic found that the
provision of health services was quite irrational because there were too many hospitals with
too many beds, and very few facilities for outpatient services and secondary ambulatory
care. It also found that primary care physicians were underused. In the functional review of
the Health Ministry (FY11), the World Bank made recommendations to streamline health
service delivery and establish health service delivery networks that would optimize the
supply of services. These recommendations were reflected in the National Strategy for
Hospital and Sanitary System Rationalization, and all hospitals were reclassified according
to this strategy by the end of 2011.

Environment
The environment is a major World Bank Group engagement area in upper-middle-
income countries (UMICs) because many of these countries have experienced rapid
growth that creates pressures on the physical environment. Several countries turned
to the World Bank Group to take a catalytic role in mobilizing the necessary funds
and helping build institutional capacity. Most World Bank member countries
became signatories to international climate change treaties, and many have looked
to the World Bank Group to help them to meet those commitments. World Bank
Group support to the environment covers three major areas: environmental
sustainability, natural disaster risk reduction, and climate change mitigation and
adaptation. 1

The review examined several evaluations conducted by IEG on environmental
topics. At the thematic level, a three-phased evaluation examined World Bank

support for climate change. An IEG learning product examined the use of
environmental development policy loans that support environmental sustainability,
which are sometimes used to provide budgetary support after natural disasters and
help build resilience in the medium and longer term (World Bank, 2016b). The
learning product drew lessons on how to implement environmental policy lending
successfully. 2

EVALUATION FINDINGS
The evaluative evidence suggests that the World Bank was instrumental in
supporting countries in addressing their commitments under various international
agreements that provide much of the framework in this area. However, IEG ratings
for the achievement of outcomes in this thematic area were lower than for most
other Global Practices (appendix E, figure E.6). 3 IEG’s review of project evaluations
suggests a systemic issue in the weak design and monitoring of results frameworks
in the environment sector and to the efficacy of environmental policy loans, which
middle-income countries (MICs) mainly undertake.4 Several World Bank operations
were broadly defined regarding promotion of sustainable development. The
evaluative evidence suggests that it is very difficult to develop a meaningful results
framework in such situations.

The World Bank provided support for environmental sustainability in every UMIC
where it had an active lending program.5 A considerable part of the World Bank’s
focus in UMICs has been in trying to create incentives for communities or the
private sector to maintain and protect the environment. 6 The selection of priorities in
the UMICs generally aligns closely with the government’s own priorities, but in
some cases, the World Bank assigned more priority to programs in this area than the
government did. 7 The following are cases of successful World Bank engagements in
UMICs in this area:

   •   The World Bank supported programs in UMICs with major forest reserves
       designed to reduce the incentive to cut down forests to expand agricultural
       production (in Brazil, for example). 8
   •   Land and watershed management were also key areas of World Bank support
       in the UMICs. Experience in Tunisia shows the potential in this area and the
       difficulties in building institutions and incentives to promote sustainability,
       even in UMICs. 9
   •   The UMIC sample includes only one air pollution project, but the World Bank
       embedded support for reduced air pollution in several urban projects, for
       example in Chile. 10
   •   Biodiversity was a large part of the World Bank’s portfolio of support in the
       environment pillar in UMICs because of the availability of Global


                                                                                     37

         Environment Facility (GEF) funding. In Mexico, the Indigenous and
         Community Biodiversity Project succeeded in establishing institutional
         arrangements at the state level that support communities in conservation
         planning and sustainable land use activities. It also gave legitimacy to
         community conservation efforts.
     •   World Bank support in Colombia helped launch a conservation trust fund
         that supported the consolidation of the country’s National Protected Areas
         system. At a systemic level, World Bank support was particularly effective in
         Argentina and South Africa in helping to establish a national framework for
         biodiversity conservation. 11

Relatively few UMICs are disaster hotspots, and therefore World Bank involvement
in disaster response and risk management is limited compared with its major
support programs in many parts of the world. 12 The Disaster Vulnerability
Reduction Project Adaptable Program Loan in Colombia was a major support
program, and IEG rated the component on disaster risk management capacity
strengthening as substantial.

The World Bank provided considerable support for climate change mitigation and
adaptation in UMICs. World Bank support covered three broad areas: general
systemic support in pursuing climate change adaptation, clean energy (including
renewables), and support to UMICs under the Montreal Protocol. 13 The following
specific examples are illustrative of the type of support provided by the World Bank
in this area:

     •   An adaptation to climate change project in Mexico was particularly
         interesting because it examined environmental impacts in the context of their
         impact on the poor.
     •   An important and valuable contribution of the World Bank’s support for the
         Integrated National Adaptation Program in Colombia was to institutional
         collaboration between institutions and various stakeholders within Colombia.
     •   IEG rated the outcome of renewable energy support to Turkey as highly
         satisfactory (the only one in the sample that had received this rating), and the
         approach was adopted by other institutions and international financial
         institutions. 14
     •   In the energy sector, IEG concluded that the Low-Carbon development policy
         loan in Mexico had a substantial impact through contributing to an increased
         renewable energy supply and reduced gas flaring, including promotion of
         energy-efficient housing. 15
     •   A large number of UMICs were included under World Bank support for
         ozone-depleting substances phase-out under the Montreal Protocol, including

                                                                             RESILIENCE
       Malaysia and Thailand where these were the only financial transfers the
       World Bank provided (no lending or even GEF funding).

World Bank analytical services in support of lending were often catalytic in
promoting important environmental issues in UMICs. The following are illustrative
examples.

   •   In Mexico’s Environmental Services Project, the World Bank team provided a
       forum for exchanging experiences across various interventions the project
       supported.
   •   IEG concluded that the Air Pollution project in Chile showed that even in
       countries with relatively sophisticated institutional set-up, the World Bank
       could contribute by impartially discussing politically sensitive issues.
   •   The World Bank’s ASA in Tunisia provided the necessary analytical
       underpinning for reforms and sought to enhance local institutional capacity
       to mainstream environmental factors and improve implementation of
       resource management practices. Its contribution was small but useful, largely
       provided through projects for rural development, and integrated natural
       resource management in parts of the country that were especially vulnerable
       to resource degradation.

The World Bank was instrumental in brokering the trust funding available to the
UMICs for environment, natural disasters, and climate change. The World Bank also
supported UMICs in achieving compliance with the objectives of the various trust
funds linked to global environmental targets. The World Bank performs the
secretariat functions for the GEF—the most significant of these trust funded sources.

CONCLUSIONS
The World Bank could consider how it can promote a more systemic approach to all
three areas that this review covers—environmental sustainability, natural disaster
risk reduction, and climate change mitigation and adaptation. Even in places where
a one-off intervention confined to a particular district or catchment area succeeds in
the short term, sustainability issues could arise without scaling up and embedding it
in a broader administrative framework for effective environmental management.

The World Bank needs to consider carefully how it can support better outcome
monitoring in environmental projects. Guidance is necessary on the design of results
frameworks for environmental projects, especially on indicators that do not relate
directly to the environment and are difficult for environmental agencies to monitor.
Monitoring needs to align to the ongoing statistical and data collection activities in
the country, but if this is not possible, the World Bank should consider using


                                                                                    39

RESILIENCE
geospatial data (as in the Mexico Environmental Services Project) or mobile phone–
based surveys to collect proxies for detailed field surveys at lower costs.

The World Bank may need to reconsider its guidance on environmental policy loans.
Some of these are one-off loans used as quick response operations in the context of
natural disasters or as a way of providing major lending support in the near term.
The desire to provide emergency financial support through projects designed and
disbursed quickly may not be consistent with the goal of carefully designing policy
reform programs that can help support medium- to longer-term environmental
sustainability and build resilience. The World Bank may need to explore whether
these two objectives require different instruments to achieve them.


Fragility, Conflict, Violence, and Displacement
The development community has often linked fragility and conflict with a country’s
lack of development progress. However, instances of conflict in MICs have recently
exceeded those in low-income countries (LICs), suggesting that conflict and violence
are no longer primarily a LIC problem. According to the 2016 IEG evaluation, World
Bank Group Engagement in Situations of Fragility, Conflict, and Violence, violence or the
imminent threat of violence affect development outcomes for almost 2 billion
people, of which 37 percent live in UMICs and 37 percent in lower-MICs. The 2011
World Development Report on Conflict, Security, and Development suggests that the high
road to peace and prosperity is best approached through a consensual form of
politics featuring inclusive political coalitions, credible signals of intent, and the
development of accountable institutions—all of which are more applicable in
UMICs, which generally have more advanced institutions and higher capacity
supported by the middle class.

Many of the conflicts in UMICs are subnational in nature and driven by grievances
based on ethnic or religious identity. The governments are typically reluctant to
engage in dialogue on these conflicts given their ability to contain subnational
violence and to manage the fiscal consequences of such violence. The World Bank
Group has little leverage to push such engagement because of its limited lending to
these countries, thus placing a greater premium on World Bank Group diplomatic
skills, creativity, and appreciation of the local political economy in finding entry
points that do not undermine political sensitivities.

EVALUATION FINDINGS

conflict, and violence focused on middle-income countries, a few of which were

UMICs (Colombia, Jordan, and Lebanon). The evaluation emphasized that the
World Bank Group’s strategic comparative advantage is in helping these countries
address essential, longer-term developmental challenges. Breaking recurrent cycles
of violent conflict requires time, patience, and the contributions of multiple actors.
The World Bank Group is often not the major player in these efforts (particularly in
the UMICs), but even so it can have an important role.

Among the cases reviewed in the 2016 evaluation, Colombia offers an emblematic
experience. The country was coping with a decades-long internal conflict deeply
intertwined with politics, crime, and the international drug trade. Protracted
violence led to widespread population displacement—according to the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the cumulative number of internally
displaced people reached about 5 million by 2015, the highest of any country in the
world. World Bank interventions generally aimed at mitigating the impact of
conflict and violence on households, farmers, and communities, and at addressing
some conflict drivers. During the period reviewed, the World Bank started with
mitigation activities at the local level (supporting communities under extreme
duress) and, as the security situation gradually improved, began working with local
institutions (with emphasis on supporting the education sector). 16, 17 Eventually, the
World Bank moved to facilitating broader regional or national-level policies with
emphasis on land titling and restitution, and expanding social safety nets to cover
internally displaced people. 18

Overall, the 2016 evaluation World Bank Group Engagement in Situations of Fragility,
Conflict, and Violence concludes that World Bank Group interventions made useful
contributions to the Colombian authorities’ peace and reconciliation agenda. The
World Bank had a successful catalytic role and a consistent vision for many years,
and it could build up slowly from small opportunistic interventions to activities that
have national impact. The World Bank had an important convening role and was
successful in disseminating knowledge. It helped create new partnerships with
nongovernmental organizations and donors, and it facilitated government agency
involvement. More important, it facilitated and built on existing partnerships with
the critical input of the World Bank’s national staff in Colombia.

Jordan and Lebanon were not involved in armed conflicts internally or externally,
but civil wars in Syria and Iraq (and the consequent influx of refugees) affected both
countries, causing immense pressure on state systems and resources. The issue in
these cases is not internal fragility by itself, but rather the compounding effects of
external pressure and the impossibility of addressing the hosting problem without
significant external support. Jordan and Lebanon have the highest proportion of
refugees to native population in the world: Lebanon hosts 232 refugees per 1,000 of


                                                                                     41
CHAPTER 4
RESILIENCE
its native population and Jordan hosts 87 per 1,000 (World Bank 2016c). Both
countries contend that they are providing a global public good by hosting the
refugees, and that they may not be able to survive this shock indefinitely if they do
not receive more adequate support.

Overall, IEG’s evaluation concludes that World Bank emergency assistance to Jordan
and Lebanon included relevant, timely analytical work that the governments and
partners used extensively, and flexible financial instruments that attracted
additional donor financing, though far from the identified needs. The choice of
strategic areas was relevant in both countries—helping the stressed and
overcrowded health and education systems at the national level, and building
capacity and improving resilience of local authorities to face increased demand for
services at the municipal level. 19

However, the World Bank’s financial response to the crisis was inadequately small.
One of its main challenges in Jordan and Lebanon was finding appropriate financing
instruments. IBRD loans were the only readily available instruments, but they were
better choices—IBRD loans can take time to prepare and disburse, and the two
countries (which are already highly indebted) considered them relatively expensive.
This option was exhausted quickly in Jordan by providing a $150 million emergency
loan. In Lebanon, an internal political crisis and a stalemate in the parliament and
the cabinet (a parliamentary vote is required for loan approval) complicated the
situation.

CONCLUSIONS
The experiences in Lebanon and Jordan show that the World Bank needs to develop
financial mechanisms or fast-response facilities to use in similar situations in UMICs.
It also needs to use its global convening power more effectively and encourage
others to do so.

Another lesson relates to the importance of focusing on long-term developmental
challenges. Although the World Bank’s emergency assistance was appropriate for
the short-term crisis, it is not likely to alter the fragility profile of most UMICs
fundamentally. Colombia made important progress on reconciliation (though many
questions remain), but in Jordan and Lebanon, it is highly likely that most Syrians
will stay for a long time. The refugee inflow exacerbated many already existing and
well-known fundamental systemic challenges in both countries, such as
unsustainable public sector expenditures and high unemployment. Therefore, the
probability of a short-term crisis becoming a serious long-term development
challenge is high, which future World Bank strategies should reflect.

Experience with FCV in UMICs points to the importance of maintaining a credible
and robust macroeconomic framework to withstand impacts from unforeseen crises.
The World Bank will likely be an important institution (along with the IMF) to
provide financial support when a crisis occurs. However, without a sustainable
macro framework, the World Bank’s ability to increase its support will be limited.
Jordan and Lebanon will continue to be vulnerable to events like the Syrian crisis
without more drastic structural reforms.


1Environmental sustainability includes reducing air and water pollution, protecting
watersheds, and dealing with soil erosion, reducing coastal and marine pollution, and
protecting biodiversity and natural habitats. A second area of World Bank support relates to
managing natural disasters through effective response and building resilience to future
disasters. The third area is mitigating climate change through reducing carbon emissions
and adapting to its effects, such as rising sea levels. Although the categorization of World
Bank support is helpful in clarifying the objectives and approaches it took in the UMICs,
World Bank operations cut across these categories in many cases and addressed a range of
environmental priorities.
2This synthesis conducted a review of IEG Project Performance Assessment Reports and
Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) Reviews of environmental projects in
the UMIC sample and used ICR Reviews for 35 projects in this sample that supported this
thematic area.
3Of the 36 ICR Reviews in the UMIC sample, 25 were rated in the satisfactory range and 11
were rated in the unsatisfactory range.
4IEG lowered the ICR ratings from satisfactory (S) to moderately satisfactory (MS) or from
MS to moderately unsatisfactory (MU) in about 40 percent of the cases. In several cases, the
reasons for lowering the ratings reflected issues related to the results framework design, in
which outcomes were only loosely related to project outputs and the causal links were
difficult to establish. In other cases, IEG ‘s opinion is that the data did not provide an
adequate basis for assessing whether outcomes had been achieved or for attributing them to
the project. These failures are puzzling given the relatively high capacity levels in the
UMICs. Several projects included broad poverty reduction objectives along with the specific
environmental objectives, and project implementation units (often housed in the ministry of
environment) had no capacity or interest in monitoring general poverty outcomes.
Therefore, satisfactory biodiversity protection projects (in South Africa, for example) saw
positive results in employment creation because of tourism and conservation activities, but
did not include provisions for monitoring poverty, which led IEG to downgrade these
projects’ ratings from S to MS. In some cases, environmental policy loans are designed as a
programmatic series of operations, but in the UMICs, they were designed as one-off
instruments to provide general budget support for broad environmental sustainability
objectives or in the aftermath of a disaster. However, as one-off instruments, they do not
provide the necessary follow-up for the medium- and longer-term measures often included
in the prior actions and triggers. IEG noted in several cases that the results framework
defined actions that could not be completed within the project time frame.

5 Several World Bank strategy documents identified a pillar relating to environmental
sustainability. For example, the Argentina country assistance strategy (CAS) of 2009–14
identified sustainable use of natural resources as an objective and defined specific medium-
term progress benchmarks in this area, such as reduced rates of land degradation,
technologies, air and toxic pollution data, and compliance with international environmental
treaties and timetables.
6Two operations in Bulgaria helped ensure that the environmental damage caused by state-
owned enterprises was handled during the privatization process in ways that did not hinder
the privatization, but still made sure that the new owners would be responsible for
conducting remediation and compliance plans.
7For example, in Turkey in environmental management, the FY04 CAS had hoped to
engage Turkish authorities in a broader dialogue on investment priorities and move beyond
specific interventions at the regional level supported by World Bank lending. The intent was
to build on the National Environmental Action Plan prepared before the CAS period and
provide a link between the plan and the EU dialogue on environmental standards. IEG’s
review of the Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report concluded, “In practice, there
does not seem to have been much take-up in this area. The World Bank did not undertake
major analytic work during the period, and overall the World Bank’s instruments do not
seem to be very strategic in relation to this objective. This said, the Turkish authorities were
engaged in the task of preparing the ground for meeting specific EU directives so that some
progress was made against this outcome, though with more limited input by the World
Bank than had been intended. Indeed, the Turkish authorities indicated at one point that
they were not interested in having the World Bank’s involvement in this area, but were
advised by the EU that in other cases the World Bank had played a helpful role in this
regard.”
8IEG’s 2016 Learning Product Transformational Engagements: Accelerating Progress to Achieve
Development Goals assessed the pilot program for the Conservation of the Amazon Forests
administered largely by the World Bank) as perhaps the most successful environmental
program the World Bank has supported. Project interventions helped to successfully reverse
the trajectory of Amazon deforestation from an unsustainable trend to sustainable. Data
show that the rate of deforestation in Brazil has slowed significantly since the mid-2000s,
though this is only partially attributable to the program (1994–2012). The Pilot Program for
the Conservation of the Brazilian Rain Forest (PPG-7) supported numerous scientific
research activities, strategy studies, capacity building, and pilot and demonstration projects,
which prepared the necessary knowledge base for transforming Brazil’s policy and
institutional framework for forest protection and management. It also helped prepare
numerous follow-up projects that helped strengthen Brazil’s protected areas framework and
consolidate the open agricultural frontier.
9Despite decades of government efforts in Tunisia, overexploitation and inadequate land
management have led to significant resource degradation—particularly severe in the
northwest, central-west, and southern parts of the country—caused by a combination of
natural and artificial factors. The World Bank’s Advisory Services and Analytics provided
the necessary analytical underpinning for reforms and sought to enhance local institutional
capacity to mainstream environmental factors and improve implementation of resource
management practices.

found that the project’s construction of 40 kilometers of bikeways was successful, and the
project had made some progress in reducing harmful emissions.
11 The Argentina National Forests and Protected Areas Project led to the preparation of the
first National Forest Inventory and was instrumental in the passage and implementation of
a new Native Forest Law and Fund in 2007. The Biodiversity Conservation Project
succeeded in expanding and diversifying the protected areas system to include some of the
most threatened and underrepresented ecoregions in the country. A substantial part of the
World Bank’s program in South Africa was successful in achieving biodiversity goals.
However, because of the difficulty in substantiating the biodiversity projects’ poverty-
reduction impact, the ratings were lower than if the objectives had been limited to
biodiversity.
12Some Caribbean and Pacific Islands that are disaster hotspots have income levels in the
UMIC range, but most receive IDA funding because of their overall vulnerability and were
not considered as UMICs for this synthesis.
13This section does not cover energy-efficiency projects with a primary objective of
increased access to reliable energy supplies on a financially sustainable basis.
14The renewable energy support project was designed to increase privately owned and
operated power generation from renewable sources without the need for government
guarantees and within the market-based framework of the new Turkish Electricity Market
Law. The World Bank loaned $200 million for financing a Special Purpose Debt Facility for
generation using renewable energy resources. IEG found that the project’s objectives were
fully achieved.
15The $400 million Low-Carbon DPL aimed at increasing renewable energy supply,
promoting energy efficiency, reducing gas flaring and venting, improving the efficiency of
the vehicle fleet and road transport operations; promoting efficient housing, and sustainable
forestry development.
16 The World Bank supported cohesion of communities under stress through the Magdalena
Medio and Peace and Development projects. The community-driven development model,
through a series of relatively small and experimental operations, was one of the few possible
points of entry for World Bank assistance that could have been scaled-up and replicated.
The approach was to help create collective decision making and problem solving–capacity
within the communities. In some regions, demand-driven projects had already been
initiated by Colombian civil society. The World Bank joined and supported those efforts.
The definition of community varied widely, often including an entire municipality. The
model preserved and stabilized a minimum standard of living and rebuilt social and human
capital in a context of no local-level government institutions. The subprojects were
particularly successful when incentives were created for participants to invest their own
resources, join a productive chain, and achieve some minimum economies of scale. Land
titling was crucial because it allowed farmers to borrow using land as collateral for
investment.
 The World Bank showed significant commitment to supporting education in Colombia
17

under very difficult circumstances. The conflict magnified the limitations of a highly

                                                                                             45
centralized education system that had limited local-level capacity. Teachers and social
leaders were often targets of violent attacks. The flow of internally displaced people put
pressure on local education systems, mostly at the basic level. To respond to these
challenges, in 1997 the World Bank approved the Pasto Education Project ($7.2 million) and
the Antioquia Basic Education Project ($40 million). The goal was to enhance
decentralization by improving local education authorities’ institutional capacity to continue
the education process despite the conflict.
18The World Bank provided significant financial and technical assistance to Colombia’s
main conditional cash transfer program Familias en Acción from its inception in 2001. The
Second Social Safety Net project ($636 million), approved in 2008 amid the global financial
crisis, was disbursed against the expansion of cash transfers. A major development was
waiving the means testing requirements for internally displaced people. The coverage of
displaced households increased from 40,000 in 2005 to 350,000 in 2010, and to 500,000 in
2013. The share of these households in Familias en Acción almost doubled, reaching 20
percent of the total. Familias en Acción may now reach about one-third of the total displaced
population. An in-depth impact evaluation found positive results on education and health
outcomes and empowerment of women.
19In both countries, the World Bank does not provide assistance directly to refugees (shelter,
food, or jobs), which is a prerogative of the UN agencies and nongovernmental
organizations because the governments of Jordan and Lebanon explicitly refuse to borrow
funds for humanitarian assistance. Instead, World Bank assistance is directed to mitigate the
impact of the refugee inflow on country systems and in the Lebanese and Jordanian
communities in which the crisis affected livelihoods.

 Highlights
     Since early 2000s, World Bank Group programs in upper-middle-income
      countries (UMICs) have shifted toward more intensive delivery of lending-
      related knowledge services.
     Lending is a powerful driver of results for World Bank Group knowledge
      services in UMICs. Knowledge services are more likely to succeed when
      used in the design of lending operations.
     Sectoral focus and client ownership are the main factors in the success of
      World Bank Group knowledge services.
     The World Bank’s main strengths in this area are its ability to fulfill client
      requests for cutting-edge advice promptly and its role as knowledge
      connector.
     The World Bank Group could do more to facilitate South-South exchanges
      and policy dialogue.
     Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS) is an important mechanism to
      expand World Bank services, ensure the sustainability of the World Bank’s
      business model in UMICs, and generate new knowledge to transfer to low-
      income countries.
     A tension exists between the World Bank Group mission as a global
      development agency and the consultant firm model that it increasingly
      applies to deliver knowledge services through RAS.
     Monitoring the impact of the World Bank Group ASA remains weak, and
      only a small share of knowledge activities has at least a partial results
      framework.

World Bank Group programs in upper-middle-income countries (UMICs) have
shifted since the early 2000s toward more intensive delivery of knowledge services
relative to lending. Past IEG evaluations of knowledge services in various areas
beyond lending operations built on the knowledge services assessment
methodology used by the World Bank’s Quality Assurance Group. IEG tested this
methodology in several thematic evaluations. 1


Evaluation Findings
The IEG evaluation of World Bank Group knowledge-based country programs
(World Bank 2016a) sought to learn lessons from practices in a group of selected


                                                                                     47

KNOWLEDGE AGENDA
high-income and upper-middle-income countries that have World Bank Group
knowledge-based programs. 2 The evaluation concluded that 47 percent of the
knowledge activities reviewed fully achieved or were likely to achieve the intended
outcomes, and another 37 percent partly achieved the outcomes. The World Bank
Group was more effective when it worked on specific sectors instead of broad
topics, designed tasks to address specific client concerns, customized international
best practice to local conditions, generated data to support policy making, and
formulated actionable recommendations that fit local administrative and political
economy constraints. Client participation and good monitoring and evaluation
(M&E) systems were key to good results, regardless of the level of government that
operated as counterpart (central or local).

Outcomes were more likely achieved when the knowledge services focused on
specific sectors, such as agriculture and rural development, education and health,
and the financial sector. Reaching outcomes proved more difficult in broader
thematic areas, including an ambitious reform agenda or when the achievement of
results required multisector efforts (such as private sector development, economic
policy, and public sector governance). In such complex areas, results of knowledge
services often suffered when new legislation was necessary to implement the
recommended reforms.

IEG evaluations noted that knowledge services in UMICs used in the design of
lending operations were more likely to succeed than freestanding knowledge
services. Although lending was limited in most of the reviewed UMICs, it remained
a powerful driver of results for the World Bank’s knowledge services—at least
partial achievement of expected outcomes was observed more often when
knowledge services were used for the design of lending operations. Possible
explanations are that the World Bank has more leverage in this instance than with
freestanding knowledge services, and that the knowledge services are, by definition,
supporting a program that expects to be implemented. Freestanding knowledge
services contributed many times to policy discussions where the authorities had not
yet taken a position.

Knowledge services requested by the client and designed specifically to achieve
client objectives were more likely to achieve outcomes than more generic knowledge
services. 3 Furthermore, knowledge services with fully or partly achieved outcomes
were more likely to use local expertise. Using local experts and counterpart
participation seem to help modify global best practices to fit local conditions,
formulate recommendations that account for capacity constraints, and improve
stakeholder ownership of findings and suggested actions. Client participation in the
various stages of knowledge services was also associated with results achievement.

                                                                      KNOWLEDGE AGENDA
Knowledge services that achieved results have more often contributed to
strengthening institutions and the recipients’ analytical and policy formulation
capacity. 4

The evaluation of knowledge-based country programs (World Bank 2016a) found
that the outcomes of about 75 percent of World Bank knowledge services and IFC
advisory services were likely to be sustained at least partly. That is, knowledge
services were likely to have at least partial lasting impacts on policies, capacity, or
institutions. The majority of these knowledge products conveyed international best
practice and relevant examples, generated new evidence to inform policymaking,
and formulated actionable recommendations consistent with the findings.
Sustainability of outcomes was observed more often when knowledge services were
complemented by other World Bank activities (lending, other economic and sector
work, or technical assistance). In most cases where sustainability of outcomes was
likely, knowledge services contributed to strengthening institutions or the
recipients’ analytical and policy formulation capacity. About 60 percent of World
Bank knowledge services contributed at least partly to developing or strengthening
institutions, but the frequency of IFC advisory services was much lower. Similarly, a
majority of World Bank knowledge services and a significant part of IFC advisory
services contributed to strengthening recipients’ analytical or policy formulation
capacity.

The World Bank’s main strength was its ability to fulfill client requests for cutting-
edge advice promptly—this reflected recommendations from previous IEG
knowledge services evaluations. Another key strength was its role as knowledge
connector. The World Bank often used its convening power to mobilize top
international experts for brainstorming sessions and seminars with high-level
government officials or for technical assistance and working sessions with
government agencies. Several IEG evaluations noted good examples of where the
World Bank’s knowledge activities facilitated South-South exchanges and policy
dialogue in the focus countries, but the World Bank could do more because the
geographic, thematic, and organizational fragmentation prevents realizing the full
potential of such exchanges. 5

The frequency of full dissemination of World Bank knowledge services— conducted
in slightly more than half of knowledge activities reviewed—was relatively low. In
many cases, disseminating the report internally and externally with the participation
of civil society organizations helped promote broader consensus on the reform
agenda. A good example is the knowledge activity conducted in Bulgaria. 6 By
contrast, broad dissemination has been a weak point of the World Bank’s
engagement in Kazakhstan, reflecting the authorities’ preference to some extent.7


                                                                                         49
CHAPTER 5
KNOWLEDGE AGENDA
The confidentiality often imposed on World Bank knowledge services cofinanced by
clients or through Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS) largely explained the
lower dissemination rate of World Bank knowledge services. IEG evaluations noted
that monitoring the impact of World Bank ASA remains weak. According to the
knowledge-based country programs evaluation (World Bank 2016a), only 17 percent
of knowledge activities assessed had at least a partial results framework.

The 2014 IEG Country Program Evaluation (CPE) for Kazakhstan offers an example
of the Bank’s experience with RAS programs. The CPE emphasized that the RAS
program did not use the depth and coverage of the World Bank’s analysis to inform
the public and to generate more support for necessary reforms. The wider disclosure
of the World Bank Group and Kazakhstan government’s Joint Economic Research
Program (JERP) products could have had a positive impact on the program’s overall
effectiveness, reform ownership, and sustainability, along with better utilization of
the World Bank’s analytical insights. 8 The evaluation noted that almost a decade of
JERP implementation has seen surprisingly little participation in program delivery
by local institutional partners. Therefore, the JERP contribution to the build-up of
local analytical capacity at the time of evaluation was minimal.

The World Bank’s ability to customize knowledge services to the local context and to
deliver multisectoral solutions is at risk of eroding in places where country
knowledge is too shallow or narrow. This risk arises mainly when the World Bank
works through RAS and does not maintain a local presence. The World Bank’s
strengths may also be challenged by its increasing tendency to deliver knowledge
services through the consultant firm model, with insufficient follow-up and lack of
emphasis on important issues for the medium-term development agenda. A tension
exists between the World Bank as a development agency (focusing on important
medium-term development issues) and the World Bank providing specific solutions
to narrower problems suggested by the main counterpart in the country—generally
a unit within the ministry of finance.

Several evaluations conclude that monitoring of World Bank knowledge services
results was weak—both for individual activities and for country programs.
According to the knowledge-based country programs evaluation (World Bank
2016a), only 17 percent of the knowledge activities assessed had at least a partial
results framework in the country partnership strategy (CPS), allowing tracking of
the activity’s contribution to the broader development outcomes the CPS sought.
Similarly, the Kazakhstan CPE noted that the World Bank’s analytical work funded
under the JERP did not have an explicit results framework at the time of the
evaluation, which diluted the program’s focus on the development outcomes.

                                                                            KNOWLEDGE AGENDA

Conclusions
IEG evaluations noted that the World Bank Group remained a strategic partner in
UMICs by providing knowledge services, but they also noted the need to emphasize
“how-to” options rather than diagnostics and “what-to-do” recommendations. The
World Bank Group was more effective when it worked on specific sectors instead of
broad topics, designed tasks to address specific client concerns, customized
international best practice to local conditions, generated data to support policy
making, and formulated actionable recommendations that fit local administrative
and political economy constraints. The World Bank Group was less effective when it
did not address issues that were relevant to the client or could not follow up
consistently with the client on the implementation of advisory activities.

IEG evaluations recommended that the World Bank strengthen learning from
UMICs and the intermediation of this knowledge to other countries. UMICs
provided ample opportunities for learning from development experiences (for
example, the development trajectory from a low-income to an upper-middle-income
economy in Malaysia, or the World Bank’s extensive work in China on regional
approaches to investment promotion). This can be accomplished internally through
enhanced knowledge exchanges within the World Bank (communities of practice)
and externally through practitioner networks or knowledge hubs; easing the
confidentiality of knowledge activities conducted through RAS; and leveraging the
technical capacity developed by UMICs to other countries.


1IEG conducted an evaluation of World Bank economic and sector work and technical
assistance in 2008 (Using Knowledge to Improve Development Effectiveness: An Evaluation of
World Bank Economic and Sector Work and Technical Assistance, 2000–06. An evaluation of
growth diagnostics in Africa was conducted in 2010 (Performance Assessment Review, World
Bank Economic Reports on Growth Diagnostics in Four African Countries: Ghana, Mauritius,
Nigeria, and Uganda), followed by an evaluation of Advisory Services and Analytics on
revenue policy (World Bank Support for Revenue Policy Reform in Eastern Europe and Central
Asia: Performance Assessment Reports of Economic and Sector Work in Georgia, Kazakhstan, and
the Kyrgyz Republic) and a clustered evaluation of investment climate assessments in
emerging economies (Performance Assessment Review of Investment Climate Assessments in Five
Transforming Economies: the Arab Republic of Egypt, Bangladesh, Guatemala, Kenya, and
Vietnam).
2The selected countries were Bulgaria, Chile, China, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Malaysia, Russia,
South Africa, and Thailand.
3For example, in China there is evidence that recommendations from the report Reducing
Inequality for Shared Growth in China: Strategy and Policy Options for in Guangdong Province (a
high-profile study conducted jointly with the provincial authorities) are being implemented
gradually with concrete results in declining inequality. In Thailand, unlike other


                                                                                             51
development agencies, counterparts see the World Bank as having the capacity to properly
customize international best practice to the Thai context because of its knowledge of local
institutions that comes mainly from staff expertise in the regional country office in Bangkok
(Knowledge-Based Country Programs: An Evaluation of World Bank Group Experience). The Thai
report The Economics of Effective AIDS Treatment is a good example of customization to
country context.
4The China Preparation of Capital Market Development report is an example of detailed
coverage of the institutional and policy context and reliance on a local team of experts to
draft the report in Chinese using existing data. The report contributed to capacity building
at the China Securities Regulatory Commission’s Research Center and to raising its profile
and role as the capital markets regulator.
5For example, the World Bank mostly used its informal networks through task team leaders
and network management to convey knowledge acquired in Chile to other countries in the
Latin America and the Caribbean Region and elsewhere. In Kazakhstan, some government
agencies have already shared their experiences with other countries in the region.
6The 2007 Country Economic Memorandum, which focused strongly on education, was
disseminated in a session with the Bulgarian parliament, organized jointly with a think
tank. The series of reports on regulatory reform were disseminated through public hearings
organized by the ministry of economy with the participation of think tanks and professional
associations.
7For example, brainstorming sessions are confidential, so lessons learned or a summary of
the discussions are not disseminated to a wider audience, and little (if any) of the World
Bank’s knowledge services is discussed openly with representatives of business associations
and other stakeholders.
8For example, according to the 2014 Kazakhstan Country Program Evaluation, the demand-
driven nature of the World Bank’s program in Kazakhstan imposed limitations on the
World Bank in defining priorities in its advisory work program, reflecting the lack of
government interest in the analysis of several sensitive policy issues. The most important
gaps in the program relate to poverty analysis, governance and anticorruption, and the role
of the state-owned enterprises sector in the economy. The evaluation noted that in an
environment in which the client-driven Advisory Services and Analytics program defines
the country partnership, the World Bank needs to maintain space and capacity for its own
selection and preparation of specific analytical products in line with its global development
mandate.

6. Conclusions
This synthesis review concludes that the World Bank Group’s engagement with
upper-middle-income countries (UMICs) and its support to them remains highly
relevant from two perspectives: helping these countries address their specific
developmental challenges, and potentially having a valuable demonstration effect
for other lower-income groups of World Bank Group clients. Regarding inclusive
and sustainable growth, the World Bank Group had a positive role in helping
address the remaining large gaps in the quality of UMICs’ public sector institutions,
accelerate growth in private sector productivity and innovation, and increase private
financing of infrastructure. Similarly, with regard to investments in people, the
World Bank Group supported UMICs’ increasing shift from focusing primarily on
access to ensuring improved quality of basic health, education, and urban services.
The World Bank was also instrumental in building safety net systems, including the
highly successful experience with conditional cash transfers. Support for enhanced
resilience to environmental and security shocks was highly relevant because UMICs
have an increasingly important role in addressing global threats in these areas.

Despite the high relevance of the World Bank Group’s engagements in UMICs,
important challenges remain in fully addressing some of the structural issues that
underlie UMICs’ vulnerability to various shocks and in making progress that is
more significant and sustained in several important development areas. Although
individual interventions to improve public sector institutions and private sector
competitiveness have had positive results, broad systemic improvements were less
common, and UMICs still exhibit very large gaps in those areas compared with their
higher-income peers. Similarly, despite noticeable individual project and country
achievements, significant challenges persist for achieving large and sustained
improvements in the quality of basic public services and for strengthening national
natural resource management institutions.

The World Bank Group had a positive role in supporting UMICs in the aftermath of
the global financial and economic crisis and in the context of dealing with internal
and cross-border displacement, but important challenges remain for effectively
dealing with the longer-term problems facing the respective countries. Although the
World Bank’s emergency assistance was appropriate for the short-term crisis, it is
unlikely to alter the profile of most stressed UMICs fundamentally. In these
countries, external shocks exacerbated many already existing and well-known
fundamental systemic challenges, such as unsustainable public sector expenditures
and high unemployment. Therefore, future World Bank Group strategies should



                                                                                  53
CHAPTER 6
CONCLUSIONS
consider complementing crisis-response support with longer-term engagements to
address the underlying structural drivers of vulnerability to economic and security
shocks. Furthermore, the World Bank can potentially be an important source of
financial support when a crisis occurs. However, lacking a sustainable macro
framework, the World Bank’s ability to increase its support will be limited.

The World Bank Group’s main comparative advantage in the UMIC context is as a
provider of knowledge coupled with financing. This unique role has few, if any,
alternatives for the clients. The volume of World Bank Group financing in UMICs
does not carry critical mass for most of these countries (except during crises), but it
is fully capable of sending proper signals to the markets, providing credible
incentives to private investors, leading innovative and catalytic initiatives, and
adapting and fine-tuning existing programs to enhance their effectiveness.

The potential for fruitful South-South knowledge transfer is very often underused,
and the World Bank Group needs to find better mechanisms for facilitating
knowledge transfer. IEG evaluations note that the World Bank Group could have
done more in scaling up, including more effective replication of successful projects
within and across countries and encouraging more South-South learning and
exchange.

The more successful programs the World Bank Group supported were generally
long duration and went well beyond the scope of a single investment loan or
development policy loan. The World Bank Group’s willingness to sustain its
engagement and build close relationships at the technical level contributed to
successful outcomes. While there are many results that can be achieved at a more
micro-level, the most impressive programs tended to be national in scale. Even
when programs are undertaken in particular localities, anchoring them in broader
national efforts has value. This can leverage the program that the World Bank Group
is supporting and contribute to its sustainability.

The World Bank Group portfolio in UMICs performed consistently higher than in
other client country groups, but effectiveness across various sectors showed
significant variation, even within the same countries. The World Bank Group’s
limited ability to address political economy constraints in countries that do not rely
on its funding could explain this, at least partially. The World Bank was largely
effective in helping willing clients accelerate crucial reforms, but it often struggled
with consolidating national ownership for reforms. In this respect, it is worth
investing more time and effort to understand the political economy constraints for
key reforms in the UMIC context, and in expanding support to strengthen pro-
reform coalitions.

                                                                          CONCLUSIONS
The general perception is that World Bank Group financing is diminishing in
UMICs, but the World Bank continues its important dialogue and engagement with
UMICs despite this perception, covering a wide range of issues from fostering
countercyclical policies, to building resilience, to financing large infrastructure
projects, to catalyzing private sector participation. World Bank Group lending
commitments to the UMICs increased significantly during the review period
(though mainly because of the global financial crisis), but the trend reversed after
2010 and is now closer to pre-crisis levels. Several evaluations recognized the need
to keep lending space at the country level to respond credibly to future crises.
However, experience from several countries and sectors shows the need to review
existing financial mechanisms and develop new mechanisms (such as fast-response
facilities) to use in various situations.

IEG evaluations consistently emphasized the high relevance of the World Bank’s
analytic work in supporting reforms in UMICs and the high value that country
stakeholders in UMICs assigned to its analytical work and technical assistance. This
was particularly true where there was commitment to reforms and interest in what
the World Bank could offer to enhance the government programs’ technical
soundness. However, evidence suggests that the World Bank’s analytic work also
helped build the constituency and support for reforms. In some cases, UMIC
governments even sought to borrow from the World Bank to secure its support
through ASA. One of the most robust conclusions emerging from several
evaluations is the importance of ASA in shaping the quality of the overall assistance,
in particularly quality at entry of development policy financing—one of the main
engagement instruments with the UMIC group. However, despite the high quality
of World Bank Group advisory support, its effectiveness often remained unclear
because of the lack of systematic efforts to evaluate the real impact of ASA products.

One of the most robust conclusions from several IEG evaluations referred to the
need to strengthen knowledge transfer from UMICs to other countries, possibly by
enhancing knowledge exchanges through communities of practice, networks of
practitioners, or knowledge hubs. Several IEG reports suggested easing the
confidentiality of many knowledge activities conducted through Reimbursable
Advisory Services (RAS) and leveraging the technical capacity developed by UMICs
to other countries. IEG stressed the importance of continuing to use RAS to expand
the feasible set of World Bank services, ensure the sustainability of its business
model in UMICs, and generate new knowledge that the World Bank can then
intermediate to low-income countries. However, several IEG evaluations noted a
tension between the World Bank Group’s mandate as a global development agency
and the consultant firm model that it increasingly applies to deliver knowledge



                                                                                    55
CHAPTER 6
CONCLUSIONS
services through RAS. This tension often manifests itself in lack of coverage of
important but potentially sensitive areas, such as poverty diagnostics or governance.

The lack of analytic material on World Bank Group activities in UMICs as a group
was a visible constraint for this report—many World Bank reports often do not
distinguish between categories of client countries by income levels. Going forward,
there is scope for further work on analyzing World Bank Group performance across
various groups and subgroups of clients, including within narrower technical areas.

Appendix A. Methodology and Country
Selection
Methods, Sources, and Steps
1.       All available recent (10–12 years) evaluative information was collected and
classified by mapping out relevant Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) evaluations
at all levels using the analytical framework described above as the main organizing
principle. The following reports were reviewed and classified according to their
relevance to the topic and the suggested analytical framework: relevant thematic
and corporate evaluations (including case studies on upper-middle-income
countries (UMICs); country evaluations, including country program evaluations
(CPEs) and completion and learning report reviews (CLRR) for UMICs; select
project evaluations—including Project Performance Assessment Reports (PPARs),
Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) Reviews, and International
Finance Corporation (IFC) EvNotes; and other sources, including World Bank
Group and external reports.

2.     A total of 78 major evaluations and learning products were reviewed. This
included 43 major evaluations delivered between 2008-present, 28 learning
products, six Results and Performance Reports (RAPs), one (external) Asian
Development Bank (ADB) evaluation of middle-income countries (MICs) (2016). Of
the 42 major evaluations, 20 evaluations were categorized as highly relevant from
the MICs angle. These reports refer to MICs or International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development (IBRD) as an income category, some contain highly relevant
content and messages for MICs from both the main report and country case studies,
and others have lessons that may have broader applicability and utility for World
Bank Group engagement in MICs. Most of the highly relevant major evaluations (16
out of 20) were produced after 2012. Coverage of each major evaluation varied –
from 1-2 to 8-10 years.

3.     Fifteen reports were categorized as moderately relevant. Some of these
reports had some useful comparisons of performance and lending by income groups
(MIC, International Development Association (IDA), IBRD), but the majority did not
discuss UMICs (or MICs) as a distinct client group. However, these reports are
useful from a thematic standpoint (fragility, conflict, and violence; decentralization;
housing finance; climate change; and so on) as these are issues across the income per
capita spectrum—from low through lower-middle-income, to upper-middle-income



                                                                                     59

METHODOLOGY AND COUNTRY SELECTION
countries. Moreover, some of these reports reference relevant projects in MICs or
contained useful country case studies.

4.    Several learning products and CPEs (including those that were part of the
Clustered CPEs on small states and resource-rich countries) contained substantive
discussions on MIC-relevant issues such as resilience (macro-fiscal, climate, social)
and competitiveness.

5.      This synthesis also reviewed 6 IEG Results and Performance Reports (RAPs)
(2010-2015). Two (2010, 2011) out of the six RAPs were found highly relevant and
the four were moderately relevant. The two highly relevant RAPs used the
categories of UMICs and discussed some trends and issues. The 2010 RAP assessed
crisis and non-crisis lending performance and highlights a few key MICs, while
showing outcomes by income groups. In addition, the team reviewed 24 completion
and learning reports (CLRs). Only a few CLRs (Colombia, Mexico, Turkey, and
Romania) mentioned MICs as an income category.

Case Study Selection
6.     From the full MIC universe (108 countries, of which 52 are lower MICs and 56
are upper MICs) the following categories were selected for this review: (i) UMICs
that belonged in that category for the last 6–8 years, with the majority of portfolio
originating in IBRD; and (ii) high-income countries (HICs) that acquired HIC status
within the last 6–8 years, and where the World Bank Group maintains presence,
continues dialogue, or both. This group included 30 countries. The team then
selected 14 core countries for in-depth coverage at the country review stage
(excluding small states) and taking into account regional representation.

7.     In terms of income and regional distribution of IEG’s fieldwork (figure 1),
more than 70 percent of IEG field missions conducted between 2012 and 2017 have
been to MICs. UMICs account for 27 percent while lower-middle-income countries
account for 46 percent of the total. Therefore, IEG missions have been concentrated
in the Latin America and the Caribbean and Europe and Central Asia Regions,
which together account for 78 percent (appendix B contains the full list and
additional data tables). The most visited countries are Colombia, Mexico, and
Turkey.

Appendix E. World Bank Group Portfolio
1.    Overall performance traditionally, middle-income countries (MICs) (IBRD
borrowers) used to perform better than low-income countries (LICs), (IDA
borrowers) across the World Bank Group. However, more recent results from IEG
Results and Performance Reports (RAPs) during 2010–16 show a more mixed
picture, with MICs higher performance less evident. RAPs are not specific, however,
on the reasons behind this trend – whether it is improved performance or increased
risk aversion in IDA, of decline in IBRD performance and more risk taking, or both.

2.    Commitments. The period under review witnessed significant increase in World
Bank commitments to upper-middle-income countries (UMICs), mainly due to and
during the global financial crisis, from $6billion to $7 billion before the crisis (FY05–
08) to $16.8 in FY09 and $24.9 in FY10 (figure E.1). The share of the UMICs
commitments to the total increased from about 30 to 40 percent. After 2010 the share
of UMICs declined back to precrisis levels. The number of projects per year incrased
moderately, a trend attibutable to a growing presense of large-volume projects
(figure E.3). The trend then reversed and lending levels returned closer to the
precrisis period. The share of IFC commitments for investment projects in UMICs to
the World Bank Group total accounted for 33 percent on average during FY2005–16.

3.   Instruments. Development policy financing (DPF) has been a key instrument for
the UMICs with its relatively large share of the total lending as compared with other
income groups. Over the FY05–16 period, the World Bank approved 180 DPF
projects for UMICs ($ 64.7 billion), which accounted for 48 percent of the total World
Bank Group lending. The share of DPF in the total lending to the rest of MICs
accounted for 26 percent during the same period. DPF led the overall increase of
lending commitment to UMICs during FY09–10. The World Bank approved nine
DPF projects with commitment of $1 billion or more in UMICs during FY09-10,
compared to no loans of similar size during FY05-08 (Figures E.7 and E.8).

4.    Sector Distribution. The top five Global Practices in terms of share of lending
(commitments) to UMICs (covering more than 70 percent of total lending to UMICs)
during FY05-16 were Macroeconomics and Fiscal Management, Transport and
Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), Energy and Extractives,
Finance and Market, and Social Protection and Labor (Table E.3). Poverty and
Equity (P&E) and Environment and Natural Resources Global Practices (GPs) had
the largest share of number of operations in UMICs in FY05-16 (although P&E had a
much smaller overall number and amount of commitments compared to others—16
total), 80.9 percent and 54.6 percent respectively, followed by Finance and Markets

Electric Power, Transportation and Warehousing, and Oil, Gas and Mining (between
5-8 percent).

5.   Analytical Services. The number of advisory services and analytics (ASA)
products in UMICs increased from 177 in FY05 to 327 in FY16 at faster speed than
the World Bank Group average. The number of AAA to UMICs has increased by 1.8
times, while the World Bank Group average increased by 1.6 times. The share of
technical assistance to UMICs accounted for 20.5 percent of the total, while that of
economic and sector work accounted for 14.9 percent (Table E.4). The top five GPs in
terms of share of ASA production (number of products) in UMICs to the World
Bank Group total during FY05-16 include Social Protection and Labor (24.2 percent),
Education (22.6 percent), Governance (21.5 percent), Finance and Markets (19.9
percent), and Trade and Competitiveness (19.4 percent) (Table E.5).

6.    Country-Level Performance (based on IEG completion and learning report review
(CLRR) rating data, 177 country partnership strategies (CPSs) and country assistance
strategies (CASs) covering FY07-16, for 97 countries, including 26 UMICs). While
Bank-wide country outcomes remain below the corporate target of 70 percent,
country outcome ratings have exceeded the target in UMICs. Across the Bank
Group, IEG rated 66 percent of country programs moderately satisfactory or above
(MS+) during FY13-16 (RAP 2016). In UMICs, IEG rated 84 percent of country
programs MS+. The rest of MICs and LICs continue to perform below the target.
High performance of IBRD countries reported in RAP 2016 can be largely attributed
to high performance in UMICs (Figure E.4).

7.    The most frequently observed thematic objective (per this report’s
classification) in country strategies is economic management and institutions,
accounting for 32 percent of objectives in country programs in UMICs, followed by
objectives related to improving the quality of life (31 percent). About 65 percent of
objectives related to economic management and institutions were rated moderately
satisfactory or above (MS+). The share of MS+ ratings for objectives related to jobs,
competitiveness, and productivity was the highest at 74 percent.

8.    Project-Level Performance. The overall performance of UMIC projects (75 percent
with outcome ratings of Moderately Satisfactory (MS) or above for FY13-15, Figure
E.5) has been higher than Bank-wide average and other income groups. Projects
under Finance and Markets and Macro Economics and Fiscal Management GPs were
the highest performers among UMICs during FY10-15, with 100 percent and 90

percent of projects rated MS+ on outcome (Figure E.6). Projects under other GPs
with outcome rating exceeding the corporate target of 75 percent include Transport
and ICT, Governance, Social Protection and Labor, and Energy and Extractives.
Notably, the UMIC performance of Finance and Markets and Governance GP
projects has been above the Bank-wide average by 27 and 18 percentage points
respectively. However, in Water and Agriculture GPs projects in UMICs were rated
much lower than Bank average. The success rate of IFC investment projects, defined
as development outcome ratings of moderately satisfactory or above, has been on a
downward trend overall, including in UMICs (albeit still higher than IFC average)—
it declined from 82 percent in 2009 to 59 percent in 2015.

10.    While the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) has been
scaling up its support to lower-income countries (IDA eligible countries) and fragile
countries in recent years, it has maintained its business in UMICs. In terms of the
number of projects, IDA and IDA blend countries represent on average a close to 50
per cent of MIGA projects during the 7-year period from FY10–16. In FY16, 62.1 per
cent of MIGA projects (18 projects out of 29 approved projects) were in IDA and IDA
blend countries. Regarding gross exposure, IDA and IDA blend countries represent
48.6 per cent of gross exposure with $7.9 billion for FY14–16, while UMICs
accounted for 38.9 per cent of MIGA’s gross exposure with $6.3 billion. 1

11.    The success rate of IFC investment projects, defined as development outcome
ratings of MS or above, have been on a declining for UMICs – similar to IFC-wide
trend. Although the success rate of IFC investment projects in UMICs have been
above the IFC average, it declined significantly, from 82 percent in 2009 to 59 percent
in 2015.

Appendix G. Dynamics of Competitiveness
Indicators
Selected Competitiveness Indicators
     1. The 2016 IEG Competitiveness Evaluation concluded that the best source of
        data to track the changes in competitiveness across a large number of
        countries is the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) database, compiled by
        the World Economic Forum for almost 140 economies. 1
     2. The current GCI structure was established in 2007. Thus, by now nine years
        of data are available for analysis, 2007-15. The GCI dataset before 2007 had
        quite a different format that looks unusable for the purposes of this review.
     3. The current CGI dataset consists of 12 pillars. Those include the pillars that
        the World Bank would normally consider part of the private sector
        development agenda, as well as those that reflect governance and HD
        dimensions of development. In our analysis below, the use of GCI data is
        limited to six pillars related to private sector development. Others were
        dropped to avoid duplicating the analysis done within other parts of the
        review.
     4. Six CGI pillars used here are as follows:

     •   6th pillar: Goods market efficiency
     •   7th pillar: Labor market efficiency
     •   8th pillar: Financial market development
     •   9th pillar: Technological readiness
     •   11th pillar: Business sophistication
     •   12th pillar: Innovation

Selected country groups
     5. We compared competitiveness trends across the following five country
        groups:
      • Upper-middle-income countries (UMICs), 38 countries in the GCI database 2
         (vs. 53 countries for which systematic governance data are available)
      • Established lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) that had been in that
         group since at least FY06, 16 countries (vs. 22 countries with governance
         data)
      • New arrival LMICs (countries that became LMICs after 2006), 17 countries
         (vs. 25)

    •   High-income countries (HICs), 31 countries (all of which belong to OECD)
    •   New Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD)
        members, 4 countries (Chile, Estonia, Korea, and Poland); this is a subset of
        the previous group, HICs
The results
   6. The main findings from the data analysis could be summarized as follows:
    • The trends in the group averages are mostly flat, at best (except for P9,
       technological readiness). This is a bit different from the analysis of
       governance indicators, which has shown a robust growing trend for new
       OECD countries, and respectively a widening gap between them and other
       middle-income countries (MICs) groups.
    • Labor market efficiency (P7) shows the declining trend across all groups.
    • There are significant gaps between HICs/new OECD on one side and the
       remaining (MICs) subgroups on the other, especially for technological
       readiness (P9) and innovation (P12). These gaps have been rather stable
       during the review period. Some gap closing has taken place in just two cases
       – P6 (goods market efficiency) and P8 (financial market development). The
       latter is entirely due to the deterioration in the ratings for OECD countries
       after the financial crisis of 2008-09.
    • Regarding the differences between various subgroups within the MIC
       universe, in many cases they do not look statistically significant. The
       differences are nontrivial in just three cases listed below.
    • P9 (technological readiness): This is the case “as expected.” Both UMICs and
       traditional LMICs significantly overperform the new arrivals, with these
       performance gaps have been widening recently. In turn, the average ratings
       for UMICs have been higher than for traditional LMICs. This is the case
       similar to what the analysis of governance indicators suggests.
    • P8 (financial development): In this case, the picture is very similar to the
       previous one (new arrivals significantly underperform), but the ratings for
       two remaining MICs subgroups are almost identical.
    • P7 (labor markets): Unexpected case. It shows that the collective
       performance of traditional LMICs has been weaker than of two other MICs
       subgroups, with a significant deterioration in their average ratings since
       2008-09. Respectively, the gap between them and the UMICs has widened.

Appendix H. IFC and MIGA Contribution
Industry Specific Support by IFC and MIGA

IEG’s Industry Competitiveness and Jobs Evaluation (2016) found that majority of
the World Bank Group’s support to the manufacturing sector are IFC’s firm-level
projects and most of these IFC projects are in the middle-income countries
(MICs). The evaluation also notes that the level of IFC support in the manufacturing
sector has been declining in recent years. The portfolio review carried out by this
evaluation notes that a total of 418 IFC and MIGA projects for the period from 2008
to 2014 had contained some elements of industry-specific support (165 IFC
investment projects, 190 IFC Advisory Services engagements, and 63 MIGA
guarantee projects).

The main reason for the concentration of project portfolio in MICs is that it is
challenging for IFC to find strong project sponsors in the manufacturing sector in
low-income countries. A 2015 IEG internal review found that manufacturing
investments mainly supported large markets. China, India, Russia, and Turkey
constituted about 30 percent of IFC Investment Services’ industry competitiveness
manufacturing portfolio. Except in these large markets, potential investments are too
small in many developing economies (especially in many small markets), with
sponsor issues, costly transaction processes, and little incentive for IFC investment
officers to conclude these deals.

In terms of the sector, IFC supported four industries: manufacturing (including
agribusiness), information and communication technology (ICT), tourism, and
agriculture. IFC investment projects’ success rates were at the average in these four
industries, and MIGA projects were above the average. Thirty-six evaluated
investment operations supported competitiveness in the four industries under
review. Out of 36 projects, 67 percent achieved high development outcomes, which
is in line with the rest of the IFC portfolio. The analysis of 35 Expanded Project
Supervision Reports shows that 57 percent of projects under review had successful
or excellent project business performance (in line with the rest of the portfolio), so
the financial outcomes of IFC’s competitiveness projects are comparable to the rest
of the portfolio. Similarly, the projects under review were as successful as the rest of
the portfolio on investment outcome, which is essential for IFC’s sustainability and
achieving its mission. For the upper-middle-income countries (UMICs), IFC’s
advisory service project in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia illustrates
how IFC can support to improve the business environment (Box H.1).

 Box H.1 FYR Macedonia—IFC’s Industry Specific Support in Upper-Middle-Income Countries
 In FYR Macedonia, IFC assisted in improving the business environment as a part of
 regional advisory service project with the goal of attracting and supporting FDI. In overall
 objective of this project is to introduce International Standards and Technical Regulations
 (ISTR) in the six countries in the Europe and Central Asia Region to facilitate exports and
 stimulate economic growth. ISTRs are important, as individual country standards can
 vary from country to country, and having too many different standards makes life
 difficult for producers and exporters. Furthermore, if the standards are set arbitrarily,
 they could be used as an excuse for protection-ism and individual country standards can
 become obstacles to trade. IFC project in FYR Macedonia had the following 3 main
 objectives:
 1. Build broader awareness about, and capacity building for, European Union (EU)
 technical regulation and standards to increase exports;
 2. Build a sustainable local consultancy network, and implement company-level
 standards for medium to large companies in the region, to increase overall sales and
 exports, through in-depth advisory with a target of 6 companies to help them acquire
 adequate standards and become compliant with relevant technical regulations in the food
 processing and general manufacturing sector; and
 3. Address knowledge gaps at sector level and on regulatory framework issues through
 a Food Safety Toolkit and Food Safety System Assessment that would generate a set of
 recommendations at the policy and regulatory level, resulting in at least one follow-on
 IFC project.
 For the Development Effectiveness of this advisory service project, IEG assigned Mostly
 Successful rating. The project seems to have raised awareness on the ISTR standards,
 helped some Macedonian companies implement ISTRs, despite some shortcomings in
 M&E and results reporting in the project.

 validation of projects (EvNotes).


Across income levels, performance was the highest in lower-middle-income
countries, followed by upper-middle-income countries. This is mostly in line with
the rest of the IFC portfolio’s performance ratings. Within a small sample of 12
projects, MIGA projects were more successful (75 percent success rate) than the rest
of MIGA’s portfolio (59 percent success rate). Industry competitiveness projects also
outperformed the rest of MIGA’s portfolio in another area for which IEG evaluates
and validates ratings. Eighty-three percent of competitiveness projects were
successful regarding economic sustainability (compared with 67 percent in the rest
of the portfolio).

IEG’s Industry Competitiveness evaluation found that the main contribution of
IFC (most IFC projects were in MICs) is its efforts toward improving working



                                                                                                                97

conditions. According to previous IEG studies, including annual reviews of IFC’s
Environmental and Social performance by IEG, IFC’s monitoring of its performance
standards on working conditions is an important contribution in the manufacturing
sector. One internal IEG assessment found that client compliance with labor and
working conditions improved from the approval stage to the evaluation stage (67
percent to 78 percent), implying that IFC’s role in helping clients improve these
standards is important (IEG FY14). Of the industry competitiveness projects with ex
post data on standards compliance, 75 percent complied with IFC’s performance
standards on labor and working conditions compared with 75 percent for other IFC
projects.

Investment Climate Operations of IFC

Over the period FY07–13, IFC supported 476 projects with multiple investment
climate interventions (a project may contain several interventions) with $350
million. Across interventions, licensing, permits, and administrative barriers; trade;
and investment promotion account for almost half. A division of labor exists
between the two World Bank Group institutions. The World Bank does
interventions in trade and property rights almost exclusively (more than 80 percent
of all), as well as majority of interventions on investment promotion. IFC, in
contrast, undertakes more (60 percent) licensing and registration efforts. In terms of
value, investment climate interventions are small, particularly for IFC with the
average value of one intervention is less than $1 million. The World Bank focuses
more on higher-level reforms, such as revising and harmonizing laws and codes,
reforming institutions, developing strategies, and coordinating government agencies
and ministries. IFC, in contrast, mostly focuses on streamlining and simplifying
procedures and processes, providing technical assistance, and automating systems.

Regardless of the income status of the countries, one of the key findings of the
evaluation is that the IFC business model is implemented through stand-alone
advisory services. The evaluation also points out IFC’s weakness to deal with the
political economy of its client countries. IFC projects are based on standardized,
focused, short-term, and rapid interventions. As per consultations with stakeholders
carried out by the evaluation team, IFC’s ability to handle the political economy was
not as strong, nor was its ability to move beyond standardized products.
Unsuccessful efforts in regulatory reforms supported by the Bank Group institutions
often focus on improving the technical quality of legislation but ignore the
importance of the process to move a bill through the parliamentary process.
Although the World Bank and IFC cannot and should not be engaged in these
processes, the evaluation argues that successful regulatory reform requires

understanding this part of the policy-making process and engaging relevant
stakeholders.

The evaluation, however, does not present any evidence on IFC’s project
examples in UMICs and to what extent IFC’s political economy consideration by
IFC has affected the development outcome of IFC’s investment climate operation.
Further assessments of IFC’s political economy analysis and its project development
outcomes in UMICs are recommended for the upcoming MICs evaluation. In the
Chapter 5 of the Investment Climate evaluation, it presents the example of Kenya,
Rwanda, Bangladesh, Nepal as well as the summary of key lessons from past IFC
investment climate projects in FCS countries. In Kenya, evaluation found that IFC
did not carry any formal stakeholder analysis during the project preparation,
although the bill affected many different groups with conflicting interests. Due to
the lack of political economy consideration, the Business Regulatory Act supported
by IFC has been stalled in the Parliament for some time in Kenya. Despite these
examples in IDA and FCS countries, the evaluation does not present any examples
of IFC’s engagement with UMICs.

In terms of development effectiveness, IEG’s Investment Climate Evaluation
notes that the success rate of IFC projects is significantly lower in lower-middle-
income countries compared to upper-middle income countries and low-income
countries. This is explained by the pattern of interventions—the fact that in lower-
middle-income countries IFC implements fewer interventions on trade, licensing,
and administrative barriers that tend to have relatively higher ratings and more
interventions on tax, property, and investments promotions, which tend to have
lower rates of success. One of the successful examples of investment climate
operation in UMICs is IFC’s advisory operation in Serbia and the project is also a
good example of the Bank Group collaboration as discussed in details in Box G.2.

 Box H.2. Serbia: IFC’s Investment Climate Operation in Upper-Middle-Income Countries
 IFC’s advisory service projects in Serbia presents a useful lesson how the Bank and IFC
 can collaborate at the strategic and project level to achieve results to the clients. For
 Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) in Serbia, IFC brought experience from related IFC
 projects in the region, a network of technical experts and a network of peers for clients
 and counterparts in the government of Serbia. IFC collaborated with the World Bank and
 World Bank Institute on this project through inter-related components and technical
 assistance.
 Unlike the World Bank, IFC undertakes its advisory service operation with client in kind
 and in cash contribution, based on legally binding agreements. The variation in pricing
 and implementation requires ex ante collaboration and synergy between all the Bank
 Group parties before approaching the client with a single voice. Studies by the World
 Bank (ICA survey and ICAS Administrative Barriers Study) showed that the regulatory
 burden was one of the key constraints to long-run growth and competitiveness in Serbia.
 In 2010, a Regulatory Reform Conference was held in Belgrade in 2010. It was organized
 by the government of Serbia, the World Bank, the World Bank Institute (WBI), and IFC, in
 cooperation with the Balkan Center for Regulatory Reform. A full cooperation of three
 Bank Group institutions (IBRD, IFC, and WBI) was crucial for a successful delivery of the
 Project, even though each Bank institution has different modus operandi with either field
 presence (IBRD and IFC) or acting from Headquarters (WBI). The most efficient approach
 of this coordination was the permanent communication of TTLs, especially before
 endorsing with the client any action and requirement.

IFC Capital Market Operations
IEG evaluation of The World Bank Group’s Support to Capital Market
Development (2016) concludes that IFC was pivotal in the development of
mortgage-backed securities in upper-middle-income countries (UMICs). In
Colombia and Russia, where its interventions were well-designed, mutually
reinforcing, progressive, and sustained. IFC’s investments to support securitization
in Brazil made limited headway. IFC also had positive contributions toward the
development of mortgage-backed securities in Mexico, though the institutions
proved unsustainable when faced with the global crisis. IEG Learning Product on
World Bank Group’s Support to Housing Finance (2016) summarizes experiences
and lessons from the Bank Group engagement in the housing finance sector and
capital market development in Mexico as presented in Box G.3.


 Box H.3. Lessons from World Bank Group Engagement in the Housing Finance Sector in Mexico
 In Mexico, both the Bank and IFC supported the development of the housing finance
 market in number of areas. Bank Group’s experience in Mexico presents important
 lessons of its support to nonbank financial institution (NBFIs) and development of
 securitization market.
 Interventions to support NBFI mortgage lenders have been relevant to country
 development needs when banks have been unable or unwilling to lend. In Mexico,
 legislation created specialized nondepository lenders, the Sofoles (Sociedad Financiera de
 Objeto Limitado) at a time when the banks had withdrawn from the market following a
 Mexican financial crisis started in 1994. IFC invested in several Sofoles, including the
 largest one, funded by the state-owned Federal Mortgage Corporation that provided
 liquidity and long-term loans and subsequently access to the capital markets through
 securitization. Although things did not turn out so positively in the end after the global
 financial crisis in 2008, the Sofoles became major players achieving a peak market share of
 22 percent by loan amount (12 percent by number of loans) in 2008.
 The Bank Group support to liquidity facilities has been relevant in countries with
 shallow bond markets. In Mexico, the World Bank supported the transformation of
 FOVI, a central bank lending window, into Sociedad Hipotecaria Federal (SHF), which
 initially operated as a liquidity facility and funded the Sofoles, specialized financial
 intermediaries, the main private sector lenders at the time. SHF was structured as a
 development bank and its debt was fully guaranteed by the Mexican government,
 ensuring its credibility as an issuer. The intervention was timely as the country was
 emerging from a financial crisis in which the banks had left the mortgage market and
 government lenders were meeting only a fraction of market demand.
 Leading up to the global financial crisis in 2008-9, both the World Bank and IFC
 supported further development of mortgage securitization market in Mexico. The
 World Bank supported SHF on several initiatives moving its funding model from that of a
 liquidity facility to partial guarantees of mortgage-backed securities issued by Sofoles.



                                                                                                      101
APPENDIX H
IFC AND MIGA CONTRIBUTION
 The IFC supported the development of securitization by investing in several Sofoles with
 equity and providing technical assistance on all aspects of the mortgage lending process
 to build high quality securitizable portfolios. Before the crisis, these interventions were
 successful. Mortgage refinancing and securitization began in Mexico under the FOVI
 Project and expanded under three development policy loans. Well-structured packages
 were launched, and securitization mobilized $4.3 billion in financing from 2004 to 2008,
 equivalent to nearly all SHF/Sofoles mortgage funding over that period.
 In Mexico, the crisis exposed the weakness of a monoline business model like NBFIs
 and its overdependence on the capital markets. The Sofoles were able to issue MBS at
 competitive rates with issuance increasing year on year up to 2008 —in fact proceeds
 were in part used to replace SHF funding. However, the securitization market collapsed
 in 2008–09 when several Sofoles, including the largest, experienced significant financial
 distress at the time when the subprime housing finance crisis in the United States was in
 full force. Investors lost confidence in the securities and the Sofoles were unable to access
 the capital markets for funding. A business model largely dependent on the capital
 markets for funding, both short term through commercial paper and long term through
 securitization proved to be vulnerable to severe disruptions in the capital markets. The
 Sofoles collapsed when the capital markets closed during the crisis, leading to losses in
 several IFC investments.
 The lack of prudential regulation was also a factor in the demise of the Sofoles. The
 banking and securities regulator did not regulate the Sofoles as it was believed that the
 market could regulate them given their dependence on capital market finance. In an
 environment of intense competition and lax oversight, some Sofoles were not applying
 basic prudential lending norms or even contacting the borrowers. Moreover, the business
 model included providing bridge loans to developers that would refer clients for
 permanent loans, a risky form of lending. Developers presented groups or packages of
 loans to the institutions to be approved in bulk. Loan underwriting, approval and
 collection processes in the Sofoles were generally subpar and needed to be adjusted to
 best practices.
 One of the key lessons is that IFC missed warning signs such as the fast growth and
 increasingly risky lending, including a growing maturity mismatch, of its Sofoles it
 supported in Mexico. Though one of these IFC’s supported Sofoles had an initial good
 start and became a leader in the industry and was considered the model successful case
 for the mortgage lending via NBFI, these factors exacerbated by the global financial crisis
 adversely affected the company’s performance leading to its demise.

IFC Operation in Public Private Partnership
IEG evaluation on World Bank Group support to public-private partnerships

MICs or UMICs, with 65 percent and 72 percent in MICs and UMICs, respectively.
This reflects the flow of foreign direct investment (FDI) for PPPs, which also has
been directed toward MICs in 2007-16 and indicates the demand-driven nature of
IFC’s investments and MIGA guarantees.

As one of the successful IFC engagements in PPP in UMICs, Brazil Country
Program Evaluation (CPE) recognizes that IFC’s contributions through its
advisory services on PPP were widely recognized in the country. Most of these
PPP projects were supported by the Brazil Private Sector Partnership Program
established by IFC, the National Bank for Economic and Social Development
(BNDES), and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). This program provides
advisory services to structure private concession projects with emphasis on
establishing new standards and introducing innovative models for private sector
participation in Brazil. During the period evaluated, the Program successfully
structured projects in transport, health, and education. One of such projects is
Hospital do Subúrbio, in which IFC supported the transaction with its global
expertise in the health sector PPPs (box 4). With the success of its PPP program with
BNDES and the IDB, IFC started a similar program at the state level by working
with Banco de Desenvolvimento de Minas Gerais, a state development bank in
Minas Gerais. Building on IBRD’s experience in supporting improvement in
regulatory frameworks in infrastructure finance in Brazil, the report suggests to
increase synergies of Bank Group collaboration between the upstream regulatory
work by IBRD and the downstream transaction supports of IFC’s expertise in PPP
project financing and structuring as well as MIGA’s ability to offer guarantees.


 Box H.4. Brazil: IFC’s Health Sector PPP Project—Hospital do Subúrbio
 IFC’s involvement was crucial in structuring the Hospital do Subúrbio project, the first
 PPP hospital transaction in Brazil. IFC provided international expertise in project finance,
 assisted in promoting private sector financing, and helped set performance standards for
 the hospital.
 The hospital operates more efficiently than public hospitals. It has flexibility and speed in
 hiring employees and procuring medical equipment, and has maintained the high
 standards a private hospital operator needs to meet a set of performance standards.
 Hospital do Subúrbio serves the poor community of Salvador in Bahia and provides high-
 quality care to the community. This innovative PPP hospital project was replicated in at
 least seven other states and municipalities in Brazil. In 2011, the project was selected as
 one of KPMG’s 100 most innovative projects.
 IEG’s review of this project notes that IFC brought in transparency and independence
 during the project’s structuring and financial closure and played the honest broker role

Chapter 2: Inclusive and Sustainable Growth
FISCAL MANAGEMENT

      •   Several client countries that received fiscal management–focused DPLs
          emerged from the crisis with weaker fiscal positions. IEG’s reviews show
          that the Bank’s DPLs often paid insufficient attention to the available space
          for fiscal stimulus, to the reversibility of stimulus measures, and to forward-
          looking measures to attain fiscal sustainability. Where such weaknesses in
          the design of the Bank’s DPLs were present, the deterioration in fiscal
          positions after the crisis was noticeable. In some cases, this partly reflected
          insufficient measures of fiscal consolidation and underestimation of the fiscal
          impact of the crisis, as exemplified by upper-middle-income countries
          (UMICs) such as Poland, Romania, and Serbia, or a combination of these
          factors.
      •   Gradually developing strong fiscal and structural deficit rules that allow
          saving out of commodity booms or other windfalls from trade gains can be
          highly effective in controlling procyclical behavior. With a few exceptions,
          IEG evaluations have not assessed the progress made by UMICs in this area.
          The clustered country program evaluation (CPE) on Resource-Rich
          Developing Countries, examines the management of natural resources in a
          group of countries, including two UMICs, namely Chile and Kazakhstan:
          how much to save and spend, manage trends and fluctuations, and design
          governance structures needed to implement transparent and accountable
          structural fiscal rules and sovereign funds. It elicits lessons from Chile and
          assesses Bank support to Kazakhstan in developing sovereign wealth funds
          to immunize fiscal policy against fluctuations in energy prices. This kind of
          work is critical for the Bank to intervene effectively in preparing countries
          respond to external shocks. Drawing on the Crisis evaluation II, Section 3
          notes that the introduction or implementation of fiscal rules was part of the
          Bank-supported PFM agenda.
      •   Several DPLs were designed for precautionary purposes (DPL/DDOs) with
          a contingent component, providing flexibility as well as a signal to markets
          in UMICs such as Mauritius, Peru, and Uruguay, none of which faced high
          fiscal stress.

FINANCIAL SYSTEMS

      •   When countries are ranked by level of financial stress, it is evident that short-
          term issues received greater emphasis in World Bank support to more
          severely stressed countries, especially related to liquidity and credit
          shortages. The focus in countries with low levels of stress was relatively more
          on longer-term issues with the understanding that the three-zone
          classification spans a continuum. Mexico and Turkey, both of which faced
          moderate financial stress, each suffered declines in gross domestic product of
          more than 10 percentage points during the crisis on a peak-to-trough basis,
          and bank credit growth stagnated. In both countries, a slowdown in credit,
          market volatility, and (in Mexico) difficulties in some loan markets—housing
          finance and consumer credit markets-- were the main manifestations of the
          crisis. World Bank operations were appropriately balanced across sectors in
          Mexico and Turkey. Both countries had large DPLs providing fiscal
          resources, which were accompanied by reforms to improve supervision. In
          Turkey and Croatia, where the latter country faced high financial stress, the
          authorities preferred financial intermediation loans which are lines of credit
          from financial intermediaries to private borrowers via participating financial
          institutions. In Colombia (a moderate stress country) and Uruguay (a low
          stress country), where reforms had been taken in the sector during previous
          years with the assistance of the Bank, DPLs focused on supervisory issues
          and further reforms in the overall capital markets.
      •   The Bank’s support to countries’ financial sectors during the crisis depended
          also on the quality of its engagement, especially through advisory services
          before the crisis. Much of it took the form of Financial Sector Assessment
          Programs (FSAPs) undertaken as joint exercises with the International
          Monetary Fund (IMF). Broadly speaking, the 12 FSAPs completed no more
          than three years before the onset of the crisis (2005 and later) out of the 18 in-
          depth sample countries reviewed by IEG, were fairly successful in identifying
          strengths and weakness and provided a good basis for intervention.
          However, they were not uniform in their coverage, either overall or for the
          issues that proved to be of most importance in the crisis. More recent FSAPs,
          including in Croatia, Latvia, and Ukraine, all of which faced high financial
          stress, focused more on liquidity risks, external funding, and crisis
          preparedness and, as in Hungary, which experienced moderate financial
          stress, identified the vulnerabilities created by the high level of short-
          maturity, external borrowing by domestic financial institutions, high
          leverage, and currency mismatch. In UMICs such as Colombia, Mexico, and
          Turkey (all moderate stress countries) and Uruguay (a low stress country),

       FSAPs identified macroeconomic and structural vulnerabilities. The crisis
       evaluation reports that after previous FSAPs, many countries worked on
       shortcomings and, as a result, had more resilient financial systems in the
       crisis.

SOCIAL SAFETY NETS

   •   Phase II of IEG’s evaluation of World Bank Group’s response to the global
       economic crisis reports that World Bank lending for social protection
       increased during the crisis to nearly four times its pre-crisis levels. Although
       social protection includes social safety nets (SSNs), active labor market
       programs, and social insurance and pensions, the evaluation reports that the
       largest increase was for poverty-targeted SSN programs. Most lending was
       concentrated in a handful of middle-income countries in Latin America and
       the Caribbean and Europe and Central Asia that experienced contractions in
       the formal and informal labor markets, jobs, and earnings. Mexico was the
       country that received the largest share, and other important recipients were
       Brazil, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Poland, and Uruguay. This sharp
       increase was also possible partly due to the World Bank’s longer-term
       engagement in this area through both analytical work and lending. In
       Bulgaria, Latvia, and Romania, World Bank support allowed an expansion of
       either temporary public works programs or guaranteed minimum income
       programs. These programs could be scaled up quickly where they were well
       structured and where sufficient information was available (Brazil, Bulgaria,
       Colombia, and Mexico.) Targeting groups specifically affected by the crisis
       was implemented better if updated household surveys existed and impact
       studies were in place, as in Latvia, Mexico and Poland. In countries with
       weak systems, the World Bank focused more on consolidation of programs
       and longer-term reforms.
   •   In a few UMICs such as Colombia and Mexico, Bank-supported SSN
       programs throughout the decade 2000—2010 have gone to the national scale,
       and there are concerns about pressure on national budgets and questions of
       fiscal sustainability. Argentina offers an example after several years of effort
       (and Bank support), the country successfully wound down the program
       designed for crisis response while continuing to strengthen its permanent
       SSN. It is therefore important for countries to be aware that expansion of
       safety nets under crisis can become permanent and some may become
       difficult to scale back once the crisis is over.

APPENDIX I
SPECIFIC COUNTRY- AND PROJECT-LEVEL EXAMPLES
PUBLIC SECTOR REFORM

      •   Public financial management (PFM) systems are budget institutions that
          encompass budget formulation, budget preparation, budget approval, budget
          execution and budget evaluation. Both PFM and tax administration have
          proved to be convenient points of entry in strengthening public sector
          institutions. Improving basic PFM was an important part of the agenda in
          Bulgaria, which was preparing to meet the standards needed to join the
          European Union. The experience of a fiscal crisis can also lead to PFM and tax
          administration becoming entry points for the Bank, as in Argentina,
          Colombia, and Russia. Case studies done for the evaluation, of which
          Bulgaria is an example, support the desirability of getting the basics right
          before moving to more complex aspects of public financial management.
          Thus, Bank projects in Bulgaria focused on the basics, such as introducing a
          unique taxpayer identification system and a one-year budgeting framework.
          A more demanding type of PFM innovation introduced in developed
          countries and subsequently promoted by the Bank among its borrowers, is a
          multiyear perspective in fiscal planning, expenditure policy, and budgeting.
          Despite concerns about achieving such transparency in multiyear budgeting
          and notwithstanding challenges evident in developed countries in making
          effective use of this instrument, Albania and South Africa are examples of
          countries that adopted well-functioning medium term expenditure
          frameworks (MTEFs) with Bank support.
      •   A more up-to-date account of Bank-supported PFM reforms is provided by
          IEG’s Phase II evaluation of World Bank Group’s response to the Global
          Economic Crisis, which notes that PFM reforms, including measures to
          improve budget planning, execution, comprehensiveness and transparency,
          were a key focus area of DPLs provided by the Bank in response to the global
          economic crisis. Poland and Serbia present examples where reforms were
          part of an integrated approach to strengthening PFM systems and
          institutions. Rolling out of medium-term expenditure frameworks was
          supported in Georgia (for the public investment program), Mexico, Poland,
          Romania, and Serbia, but progress in this direction varied across countries.
          The introduction or implementation of fiscal rules, limiting the increase in
          public spending or the level of the fiscal deficit, was supported in some
          countries, notably in Peru and Poland. Although some PFM reforms would
          not have an immediate impact from a countercyclical perspective,
          strengthened public financial management and revenue administration had
          the potential to improve fiscal outcomes for any given fiscal measures in
          place. Promoting the results orientation of the budget, supported by the DPLs

                                         SPECIFIC COUNTRY- AND PROJECT-LEVEL EXAMPLES
    in UMICs such as Georgia, Peru, and Poland, was expected to help generate
    fiscal space for priority expenditures by increasing attention to spending
    outcomes in the formulation of the budget. In as much as PFM reforms
    typically require follow-up actions over an extended period to attain the
    expected results, stand-alone crisis response operations were probably not an
    appropriate design to support these structural reform agendas. This was the
    case for the implementation of public expenditure evaluation systems in
    Mexico. By contrast, Romania is an example of a country where the Bank
    initiated a crisis response operation in 2009 as part of a programmatic DPL
    series, cognizant that the implementation of the structural fiscal reforms to
    bring the fiscal position to a sustainable footing would require time.
•   Notwithstanding these challenges, however, several examples of well-
    received diagnostic pilots, as well as successfully implemented civil service
    and administration (CSA) reforms supported by the Bank in UMICs deserve
    mention. There were a few diagnostic pilots, for instance in Albania and FYR
    Macedonia. The Bank had provided good quality analysis and advice on CSA
    reforms in Russia that was well received and that helped support the
    country’s reform agenda. Bank support for CSA reform implementation
    exemplifies different approaches tailored to country situations. To help the
    political leadership, identify tangible benefits of CSA reform, the Bank
    supported the development of measurable indicators of progress in Albania,
    such as the percentage of recruitment done by merit, which the government is
    reported to be tracking on a regular basis. Reforms in human resource
    management and compensation, which cover merit-based promotion, pay
    structures, and pensions, among others, were successfully implemented in
    Albania. Russia offers an example of positive results being achieved by
    designing reform measures that tried to shift existing practice rather than
    advocating all-or-nothing change. With a realization at the political level that
    lack of CSA capacity was holding back other reforms, there was growing
    acceptance of the need for civil service reform during the evaluation. The
    government had started to require that new hires meet certain minimum
    qualifications, even if the final selection is politicized, to keep track of
    absentees, and to make it easier to fire them. While Bulgaria made little
    headway with regard to downsizing, it successfully implemented
    compensation reform and human resource management reform. In an
    example of effective donor coordination, the Bank provided a roadmap of
    reform, but other donors provided technical assistance for specific reforms.
•   Tax administration reforms usually aim to increase voluntary compliance.
    The typical entry point for the Bank’s policy dialogue has been the
    government’s need for additional revenue. Other objectives, as in Bulgaria,


                                                                                  109
APPENDIX I

          have included preparation for accession to the European Union, adapting tax
          administration to a free-market economy as in Russia and other countries in
          Eastern Europe, and increasing transparency and efficiency to improve the
          image of tax administration with voters and the business sector. A pilot
          approach to tax administration proved successful in several cases. Thus,
          implementation of a value added tax was used as a pilot to introduce a
          modern taxpayer identification system and tax collection in Albania. The
          establishment of large taxpayer units served the same purpose in Bulgaria
          and Russia.
      •   Working with other donors was important in most of the cases of tax
          administration reform that were studied. The IMF often helped with the
          diagnosis and strategy, as in Albania and Bulgaria. The European Union was
          a powerful external anchor for reforms in countries in Central and Eastern
          Europe that were preparing for EU accession. Still, the role of Bank expertise
          was important; even when the IMF was providing a lot of technical advice,
          having the Bank help design and manage the actual project was essential,
          according to interviews with country counterparts. And the IMF was not
          always available; in those cases, the in-house expertise and consultant roster
          of the Bank become even more important.
      •   Reducing opportunities for petty or bureaucratic corruption by simplifying
          procedures and regulations and getting incentives right through, for instance,
          personnel payment programs, are systemic approaches that have been
          incorporated in Bank support to PFM, tax administration, and civil service
          reform. Thus, many of the previously mentioned reforms in PFM, civil
          service, in particular recruitment and pay reform, and tax administration in
          UMICs, such as Albania, Bulgaria and Russia, were important indirect ways
          to improve transparency and target bureaucratic corruption by reducing
          opportunities and incentives for corrupt actions during the evaluation. The
          Bank’s country strategies and major operations address “grand” corruption,
          also known as State capture, quite infrequently. Furthermore, the evaluation
          notes that direct attempts to address either petty or grand corruption through
          measures such as anticorruption laws and commissions succeeded rarely.
      •   In Ukraine, the Bank supported a program called Voices of the People, which
          sought to improve municipal-level integrity by strengthening the voice of
          citizen groups as they demand better services and governance.

Chapter 3: Investing in People
SUPPORT TO PROMOTE INDUSTRIAL COMPETITIVENESS AND INNOVATION

   •   There have been at least two subgroups of middle-income countries (MICs),
       where it is broadly accepted that long-term engagement of the World Bank
       Group made a significant contribution to a broad successful transformation of
       these countries, led by improvements in their competitiveness and growth
       acceleration: a) major development success stories of the last 40 years,
       including Chile, China, and Korea, and b) the most advanced transition
       economies in Europe and Central Asia, such as Poland. In the former case,
       the Bank is credited (IEG, 2016) with making critical initial contributions to
       the countries’ developmental strategies through research and technical
       assistance to introduce basic economic reforms, modern project management
       practices, new technologies, and so on, and then later shifted its assistance to
       help with institutional reforms and knowledge transfer.
   •   Specifically, in China, Bank Group financing represents a small share of
       China’s investment and financing needs, but it plays a prominent role in
       bringing ideas, knowledge, and best-practice experience to help the country
       improve firm and sector competitiveness. In addition, the Bank delivered at
       least three investment projects with a focus on accelerating the pace of
       innovation by helping Chinese firms take part in global R&D networks. This
       was complemented by various IFC’s interventions at the firm level to
       upgrade products and processes. Moreover, IFC was instrumental to help
       address a major financing constraint in the innovation finance: in 2006 IFC
       made an equity investment of $20 million in a 10-year closed-end venture
       capital fund, which helped an indigenous fund manager raise its first venture
       capital fund. This created a major demonstration effect and catalyzed the
       development of China’s venture capital industry.
   •   In Chile, the World Bank made important contributions to enhancing the
       effectiveness of the innovation system though two highly innovative
       investment projects to stimulate cross-sector cooperation between research
       and industry. The projects also helped to improve the design of the country’s
       innovation strategy and policies and increase the stock of human capital in
       the S&T sector.
   •   In Poland, the evaluative evidence suggests that the World Bank Group,
       together with its partners, played an important role in Poland’s post-socialist
       transformation through its lending and advisory work. In particular, the
       World Bank Group was instrumental in helping Poland initiate and sustain
       economic growth driven by the private sector. Bank loans in the energy,
       agriculture, and transport sectors helped support both design and

      implementation of quite radical sectoral reforms, which were well aligned
      with the structural reform agenda for EU accession. Today, the Bank program
      in Poland is largely based on knowledge products that are in part reimbursed
      by the government.
   • In contrast, in Romania, another recent EU entrant, World Bank Group
      interventions to accelerate private sector development–driven transformation
      were relatively less effective, largely because of weaker government
      ownership. For instance, despite various World Bank Group efforts in the last
      25 years, Romania’s state-owned enterprises sector remains relatively large.
   • Peru qualifies as another MIC, in which the World Bank Group, through
      long-term engagement, has been instrumental in bringing about a major
      economic transformation in terms of improvements in country
      competitiveness, diversification, and sustainable growth. Specifically, IFC
      investments in the emerging sectors, such as agribusiness and tourism, were
      catalytic as they helped build a momentum in these sectors at a time when
      they considered to be too risky and were not served by the banking sector.
      Currently, Peruvian government seems to have valued most the convening
      role and know-how capacity of the Bank -- much more than its financing
      contribution.
   • In Mauritius, reforms to enhance competitiveness and promote private sector
      development represented the core of World Bank Group partnership strategy.
      Support was provided largely in the form of development policy loans
      (DPLs), complemented by analytic work and technical assistance for capacity
      building in various parts of the government. This effort was only moderately
      successful. World Bank Group interventions helped to increase FDI inflows
      and enhance export diversification. However, Mauritius’ competitiveness
      remains constrained by skilled labor shortages and inadequate quality of
      infrastructure services (in ports, for example), the areas that did not attract
      much of World Bank Group support.
SUPPORT FOR INVESTMENT CLIMATE REFORMS

      •   The Bank Group’s investment climate program in Peru, rated Moderately
          Satisfactory, may be seen typical in this respect. Although the World Bank
          Group undertook a relevant set of diagnostic work in Peru, the program
          aimed to address only a narrow set of constraints. It succeeded in catalyzing
          some reforms to reduce regulatory obstacles, including simplification of
          business registration. But it did not engage in more critical and politically
          sensitive areas, such as high tax rates and a restrictive labor code that
          discourages formal sector employment.

                                         SPECIFIC COUNTRY- AND PROJECT-LEVEL EXAMPLES
•   When compared to this “average UMIC experience,” the Bank investment
    climate program in Mauritius in the 1st decade of this century was both
    unusually ambitious and successful. In addition to the streamlining business
    registration, it made critical contribution to liberalizing labor market
    (including hiring of skilled foreign labor) and accelerating the process of
    closing down unviable firms. However, the lack of government’s appetite for
    further reforms since 2011 put the sustainability of some of these
    achievements at risk, pointing once again to criticality of domestic ownership
    and political economy considerations.
•   Positive experience of the World Bank Group with similar investment climate
    reforms in transition economies in Europe and Central Asia could be linked,
    to a large extent, to strong government ownership, which was a reflection of
    elite consensus regarding longer-term national strategies aimed at the EU
    membership that helped to maintain the reform momentum even when
    national governments were replaced. The Bank support in countries such as
    Poland, Bulgaria, and Romania (albeit with a significant degree of variation
    in terms of quality and timeliness of the outcome) helped the governments
    identify the binding business environment constraints to growth and
    development and make right choices regarding prioritization of necessary
    reforms. Good-quality analytical and advisory products were especially
    appreciated by this group of clients.
•   In contrast, in Brazil, where local political interests are more fragmented, the
    Bank Group was not able to make significant impact in reducing cost of doing
    business, and this area (the infamous Custu Brazil). remains a critical
    constraint to the country’s growth and a key government concern. Brazil’s tax
    burden has been quite high, nontransparent, and complex, while the trade
    regime was quite distortive. Both areas did not get adequate attention from
    the Bank, while these problems have been widely acknowledged by Brazilian
    think tanks. A pilot Doing Business in Brazil report by IFC (2006) examined
    large differences in the cost of doing business across 13 states and thus
    established an important set of benchmarks. But the report had a very limited
    follow-up (beyond the state of São Paulo). And there has been a significant
    gap between advisory support on investment climate reforms and lending.
•   Available evidence does not contain many examples of successful
    collaboration across the World Bank Group in UMICs. One of the most
    profound success stories comes from Serbia, where IFC, the World Bank, and
    the World Bank Institute collaborated on the Regulatory Impact Analysis
    Project. All parties had different modus operandi, but there was a clear
    division of tasks, accompanied by continuous communication between task
    team leaders, especially before endorsing with the client any action and

       requirement. Another example comes from the LAC region, where
       investment climate work has been jointly managed by the Bank and IFC,
       which helped to improve client management and ensure more collaborative
       project development, though at a high administrative cost. More recently this
       joint management experience became a common model across the World
       Bank Group.
PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS AND INFRASTRUCTURE

      •   The IEG evaluation (2014) pointed out that IFC’s financial support for actual
          public-private partnership (PPP) projects too often reached already
          “developed” PPP countries. In fact, the PPP portfolio of IFC has been
          overconcentrated in the selected group of UMICs, which creates at least two
          problems. First, it limits both demonstration effect and market impact of IFC
          operations. Second, it reduces business opportunities for IFC Investment
          Services as commercial banks increasingly become more prominent financiers
          of PPPs, especially in the established sectors of UMICs, such as Brazil.
          However, the evaluative evidence suggests that the World Bank Group,
          especially IFC and MIGA, could take more risk and push harder in
          promoting private participation in infrastructure in “less developed” PPP
          countries, such as Mauritius and Kazakhstan.
      •   In general, as the CPE suggests, Brazil could be seen as a case of missed
          opportunity for the Bank to maximize its catalytic impact on infrastructure
          development: a lot of Bank lending recently went to finance large metro and
          rail expansion in rich urban areas, where the private sector could have
          provided most of project financing (as cost recovery would have been
          possible). IFC was not forceful in encouraging PPPs in these sectors, neither
          the Bank helped to improve the regulatory framework that would have
          encouraged private sector participation. Instead, IFC has been pushing for
          more traditional PPP projects, where it was facing strong competition from
          local banks. Overall, the Bank engagement in Brazil brought only limited
          results in addressing the country’s infrastructure bottlenecks, particularly in
          logistics.
      •   In terms of more traditional infrastructure investment projects, the World
          Bank Group project portfolio in UMICs contains numerous examples of
          triggering critical policy reforms and achieving significant sector-wide impact
          with modest amount of financing. For instance, in the road sector the Bank
          project support for performance-based road maintenance contracts helped the
          client governments to strengthen policy and institutional environment for
          managing their entire road network. This was the case, in particular, of Chile,
          Poland and Kazakhstan, where the World Bank projects assisted in setting

                                          SPECIFIC COUNTRY- AND PROJECT-LEVEL EXAMPLES
    the new road management standards. In Kazakhstan, although the country
    has ample resources of its own to finance an expansion of its road network, it
    borrowed $3 billion from the Bank to ensure sound investment program
    planning and execution. Bank involvement helped introduce stronger
    fiduciary and governance standards, upgrade the capacity of local
    contractors, and launch the modern practice of maintenance contract
    outsourcing. Outside the transport sector, the Bank was also successful in
    accelerating critical infrastructure reforms in the information and
    communication technology (ICT) (Mauritius, Romania) and power (Brazil)
    sectors. In the new EU member countries in the Europe and Central Asia
    Region World Bank Group interventions were instrumental in helping the
    clients to improve their utilization of EU structural funds that greatly
    increased the scale of public funding available for infrastructure upgrades.

•   In the telecom sector, which globally has been dominated by private
    commercial players, the Bank Group has been playing largely a catalytic role
    through a careful selection of its interventions. It allowed the World Bank
    Group to achieve a considerable demonstration effect, such as with the
    Bulgaria Revenue Administration Reform Projects (promotion of ICT
    applications in the public sector) and the Russia E-Learning Support Project
    (support for ICT skills development). Generally, ICT skills development has
    received little attention in Bank Group operations, and this is seen as an
    important constraint to ICT diffusion and applications in several countries.
    The Bank interventions also helped to expand access to ICT services for the
    poor in several countries, including Chile and Romania. Additionality from
    IFC’s participation in infrastructure projects, including in ICT, was associated
    more strongly with its perceived capacity to mitigate political and regulatory
    risks than with its financial contributions.

•   Turkey (power): The Bank was successful in supporting (though the DPL
    series) policy reforms to encourage private sector investment in electricity
    generation and integrating principles of environmental sustainability in key
    sectoral policies and programs.
•   Mauritius (ICT): The World Bank Group combined support for regulatory
    reforms in ICT with investments in critical infrastructure to improve
    broadband connectivity. As a result, the prices of ICT services have fallen, the
    sector has expanded strongly, and the share of ICT services in total services
    exports has more than doubled between 2007 and 2013.
•   Russia (airports): The World Bank, through the use of Reimbursable
    Advisory Services, successfully supported the arrangements for a public-

          private partnership for Pulkovo Airport in the city of St. Petersburg. This was
          one of the first PPPs of such scale in Russia.
      •   Peru comes across as an example of best practice of Bank support for
          infrastructure development in the UMIC’s context, including through good
          cooperation across the entire World Bank Group. IBRD helped introduce
          some best practices in sustainable infrastructure development and financed
          highly relevant projects to expand rural and urban infrastructure, while IFC
          and MIGA supported several PPPs that helped relieve the investment burden
          on the public sector. Among several private concessions, IFC and MIGA
          helped to arrange in Peru, some were highly visible, such as private
          management of Lima’s international airport, and played an important
          signaling role. IEG rated the outcome of this infrastructure support program
          as highly satisfactory due to substantial progress across its ambitious agenda.
      •   But such a broad success across different infrastructure sectors has remained
          relatively rare in the World Bank Group’s operational experience in UMICs.
          More often than not, the degree of success has varied within the single
          country depending upon specific circumstances of particular infrastructure
          segment. The noticeable example comes from Tunisia, where failure to
          improve cost recovery in railway services was accompanied by a major
          breakthrough in sea port commercialization: The implementation of the
          landlord model, achieved with the Bank support, has opened up port services
          in Tunisia to private operators and has led to more competition conducive to
          cost reductions for port users. In Mauritius too, there has been a great
          contrast between success of Bank-supported reforms in ICT and IFC’s failure
          to improve port operations (which is a critical development constraint for the
          island economy) by bringing in an experienced private sector partner. These
          examples once again underline importance of government commitment and
          other political economy considerations for success of World Bank Group
          interventions in UMICs.

Chapter 4: Resilience
CONDITIONAL CASH TRANSFERS

      •   In Mexico, the Bank sought to increase capacities in health, nutrition and
          education of poor families through human capital investment by promoting
          regular health checkups, improving health status, and raising school
          enrollment and attendance fees. With the Bank’s Support to Oportunidades
          and additional financing (FY09 and FY11), the number of families
          participating in the successful conditional cash transfer program increased
          from 5.2 million to 5.8 million in December 2012 (three years later), while the

    target of having 3 million more children participating in the program was
    surpassed.
•   In Colombia, IEG found that support from the Second Social Safety Net
    Project (FY09) and its Additional Financing, programmatic knowledge
    services to improve the performance of social services, and a reimbursable
    advisory service to strengthen the National Health Superintendence helped
    the government improve coverage and monitoring, particularly in education,
    health, and early childhood development. The number of households covered
    by the Unidos Program increased to nearly 2 million as of June 2015,
    exceeding the program target of 1.5 million.
•   Brazil’s Bolsa Familia conditional cash transfer (CCT) program transformed
    the country’s social assistance program by providing adequate incentives for
    desired changes in behavior (for example, vaccinations and school
    attendance) among targeted beneficiaries. The program is addressing the
    significant gap in access of the poor to education and health services
    compared with the national average. The Bank has supported the program
    from early in its inception and is credited by the authorities with contributing
    to the design and implementation and providing a sounding board for the
    officials in charge. It was designed to cover 32 percent of the population,
    including the poor and extremely poor. The program has been key to the
    reduction in poverty and equity, accounting for about one-fifth of the
    reduction in the Gini coefficient. It ensures that beneficiaries understand the
    expectations for changes in behavior. The conditions under which cash
    transfers will be made have been widely publicized in Brazil.
•   Bank support for the Roma community in Romania has been a major part of
    its activities in that country. The approaches supported by the Bank have had
    considerable impact on what has often been regarded as an intractable
    problem. In Romania the Social Inclusion Project (FY06) helped construct and
    rehabilitate kindergartens in 27 Roma communities, developed an early
    childhood education curriculum, trained staff, and experimented with
    alternative community-based solutions for early childhood education. The
    project contained subcomponents aimed at improved access to rural
    infrastructure, roads, and water supply in targeted Roma communities. The
    gap in the living conditions index between targeted Roma settlements and
    neighboring communities was reduced by more than 40 percent between 2008
    and 2013. The Bank has continued to support the government with advice on
    developing national policies and identifying cost-effective programs to
    integrate the Roma.

EDUCATION

      •   Mexico was a pioneer in early childhood education. In 2014, nearly 70 percent
          of 3-year-olds and 100 percent of 4-year-olds were in some form of
          preschooling. Cash transfers were an important part of enabling the
          participation of the poor. The World Bank supported this program at the
          Mexican government’s request to help insure that the resources devoted to
          the program were having the intended impact. World Bank support helped
          strengthen parental involvement in the program and build stronger links
          with health and nutrition programs. Although the World Bank made a
          positive contribution, its participation might have been even more important
          in enabling the World Bank Group to gain a firsthand understanding of the
          potentials and pitfalls of programs in this area.
      •   In Mexico, the Bank also provided support intended to improve learning
          outcomes of children in the most marginalized municipalities. The Programa
          Escuelas de Calidad (PEC) was established in 2001 and has been successful in
          introducing school autonomy and improving local participation in education.
          The completion and learning report review (CLRR) found that the Bank’s
          School-Based Management Project I and II helped expand public schools in
          the PEC, especially those in marginalized and indigenous areas, and
          strengthened the program. Learning results from the Ministry of Education’s
          ENLACE test in 5 pilot municipalities increased significantly for both 6th
          grade primary (from average 469.15 in 2009 to 517.13 in 2010-11) and 3rd of
          secondary (from 498.6 in 2009 to 514.4 in 2010-11)
      •   The World Bank Group supported Turkey in its efforts to enhance the quality
          of education through the Basic Education Adaptable Program Loan (APL),
          the Secondary Education Project, and advisory services and analytics
          activities in secondary education and vocational training. The 2012 CLRR
          notes that secondary enrollment increased from 57 percent to 69 percent
          during the country partnership strategy (CPS) period, and graduation rates
          increased from 45 to 51 percent. Furthermore, educational quality improved
          according to the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)
          scores (the average reading score rose from 447 in 2006 to 464 in 2009—the
          latest available year; math scores rose from 424 to 445, and science scores
          increased from 424 to 454).
      •   In general, however, outcomes have been mixed in supporting better quality
          education. In Colombia the CLRR of 2017 notes that while indicators on
          student enrollment for the education objective were all virtually achieved, the
          challenge is not only to increase enrollments but to focus on improving
          education quality. Student achievement (based on PISA scores) has been

         declining in Colombia recently. PISA results show that the percentage of
         students that test at the lowest levels in math, reading, and science has
         increased recently. In addition, only about 1 percent of students from a poor
         socioeconomic background get good results in math, perhaps reflecting that
         the fast pace of increased enrollments under the Bank-supported program has
         not been accompanied by a commensurate increase in education quality.
   •     In Argentina, the Bank focused on education inequalities and sought to
         improve completion rates for students in lower secondary rural education
         (grades 7-9). This objective which was supported by Rural Education
         Improvement project was achieved. The promotion rate in rural areas from
         grades 1-3 to grades 4-6 improved from 76 percent to 86 percent and the
         number of students completing the 7th grade and moving to the 8th grade of
         schooling in rural areas rose from 73 percent to 84 percent. The CLRR notes
         however that this should be seen against an apparent stagnation in
         educational attainments as per the 2013 PISA showing Argentina ranking as
         the 59th out of 65 nations and with no apparent improvement since the year
         2000.

HEALTH

   •     Risk pooling to enable better coverage of the poor was a major focus of World
         Bank support for the UMICs, and six UMICs had interventions: Argentina,
         Colombia, Mexico, Poland, Romania, and Turkey.
   •     World Bank support strengthened management and information systems in
         Poland, where the case-based payment (supported by World Bank policy
         lending) contributes to transparency and improved data availability in the
         social health insurance fund. Similarly, in Argentina (among others),
         supervision of health facilities, information and reporting systems. and
         routine data validity improved.
   •     The World Bank also helped increase revenues for health by subsidizing
         contributions to various insurance institutions for low-income groups. This
         type of World Bank support was implemented through lending and policy
         dialogue in countries such as Mexico and Turkey. The World Bank supported
         the explicit targeting of subsidies to finance contributions for low-income
         groups through means testing in Turkey.
   •     IEG’s review of project completion reports found that in Colombia, the World
         Bank’s Public Sector and Health teams (mainly through development policy
         operations) supported improvements in tax collection from employers and
         employees, which increased revenue transfers from the tax authority to social
         health insurance. In Eastern Europe (including Turkey), the World Bank



                                                                                      119

          recommended budgetary caps on spending to manage spending growth. In
          Argentina, World Bank lending and policy advice ensured that the
          government financed and protected basic and cost-effective health programs,
          including the availability of reproductive health care services for low-income
          groups in public facilities. The World Bank, through development policy
          operations, recommended introducing copayments with exemptions for
          lower-income groups in Romania.
      •   The share of poor included in risk pools increased where the World Bank
          helped governments subsidize their enrollment. In Turkey, insurance
          coverage for the poorest increased more than fourfold between 2003 and
          2011, generating a coverage rate of 85 percent for the poorest. The public
          health insurance has recently incorporated the Green Card Program, which
          subsidizes health care for the poorest income group and is funded by general
          government revenues. The World Bank–supported insurance reform in
          Turkey contributed to improved equity in health financing across income
          groups and substantially reduced catastrophic expenditures for the poor
          while increasing their service use. Similarly, the World Bank’s development
          policy operation in Colombia helped increase the enrollment of low-income
          groups in government-subsidized insurance from 10.7 million in 2002 to 18.2
          million in 2007. By March 2014, about 43 million people (90 percent of the
          population) was insured in Colombia. Colombia’s health insurance for the
          poor lowers the mean inpatient spending for patients and is associated with
          the use of preventive series and health gains for children.
      •   Argentina’s Plan Nacer had an impact both on access to health care and on
          quality. Plan Nacer transformed the health system by changing incentives to
          provide coverage for the poor and vulnerable—who had not been covered by
          the comprehensive health insurance reform. The program was supported
          through World Bank policy and investment lending, was the first results-
          based financing operation in a Bank-supported health sector project. Policy
          lending supported the government’s 10-year health sector reform program,
          which emphasized health service delivery for the poor with special attention
          to the design of an incentive framework to improve access to basic health care
          for uninsured mothers and children. Phased investment lending supported
          implementation of the program. Plan Nacer had strong and comprehensive
          incentives. Recognizing the central role of the provinces in providing health
          services, federal funding to the provinces was increased. Provincial
          governments received payments based on the number of individuals enrolled
          in Plan Nacer. Additional funding was contingent on attaining health
          outcome targets. IEG’s evaluation found that linking funding to outcomes
          increased competition among health services providers, creating an incentive

    to increase the number of services provided and to increase the number of
    individuals enrolled in the Plan. Patients benefited from improved quality of
    services and a cash subsidy for enrollment. Coverage under Plan Nacer
    increased rapidly. By 2010, the plan covered 84 percent of the target
    population in Argentina’s poorest provinces in the north (558,000 members).
    The plan was scaled up to the national level, covering 56 percent of the
    population in the remaining provinces. The enrollment rate was 100 percent
    among eligible children and 63 percent among eligible women at the end of
    the project. By 2010 more than 1.3 million individuals who previously had no
    health insurance were covered under Plan Nacer.
•   In Poland, the CLRR of 2013 noted as an important outcome the improved
    efficiency in allocation and use of resources in the health sector. The CPS
    emphasis was on improved efficiency of hospitals and rationalized service
    delivery to allow allocation of resources toward primary and preventive care.
    This would be measured by increasing the percentage of hospitals covered by
    diagnostically related groups systems and the number of hospitals
    corporatized under the Commercial Code by the end of 2010. Although no
    baselines were established, the targets were met and/or widely surpassed.
    Financial incentives were given to local governments that decided to convert
    their poorly performing public hospitals into corporate entities operating
    under the Commercial Code. In IEG’s view the World Bank Group helped to
    formulate and implement these reforms through the DPL2 and DPL3 and
    through technical assistance.
•   The Turkey CLRR of 2012 indicates major improvements in health indicators.
    Maternal mortality fell from 28.5 deaths per 100 thousand in 2005 to 16.4 in
    2010, while infant mortality declined from 18.0 per thousand in 2007 to 13.7.
    However, the occupancy rate of hospitals remains at 63 percent, with the
    CPS’s expected increase not taking place. Public spending on preventive and
    primary health care services increased by less than expected in the CPS, from
    25 percent of total public spending to 27 percent (against a targeted 30
    percent). This increase helped finance the extension of family and community
    health services to the entire country. Under the reform of the social security
    and universal health insurance system health insurance coverage increased
    from 86 percent in 2005 to 96 percent in 2010, because of obligatory insurance
    and targeted government programs for the poor. These outcomes reflected
    the government’s Health Transformation Program, which was supported by
    IBRD’s Health Sector Transition APL (FY04), the Avian Influenza APL (FY06)
    the Health Transformation and Social Security Reform APL (FY09) and AAA.

      •   In Romania, the World Bank Group sought to improve the efficiency and
          quality of health services. The idea was to significantly reduce the rate of
          admission of acute care facilities, increase the share of generic drug use,
          reduce maternal mortality, and reduce the death rate among emergency
          patients. The Health Sector Reform APL (FY05) helped increase access to and
          improve of maternal, rural, and emergency health care services, prepare
          Romania’s Primary Health Care Strategy and review the content and listing
          processes for the Romanian basic package of health services and technologies.
          IEG’s review noted that the annual rate of admission to acute care facilities
          was below 170 per 1,000 as of 2011 compared to a baseline of 229 per 1,000 in
          2008, the share of generic drug use had increased in line with CPS target, the
          maternal mortality and the 24-hour death rate among patients treated in the
          emergency room declined by 10 percent compared to the 2007 baseline. IFC
          made two investments in a health care operator and mobilized € 28 million in
          a syndicated loan. The operator has become the leading player in the private
          health care market providing integrated medical services for corporate clients
          and individuals. Moreover, it supported bank onlending for small health
          enterprises and individual health care professionals to expand and modernize
          their operations.
      •   In Mexico, the Bank supported a program to strengthen the capacity of the
          health system to control epidemic waves. The Bank intended to support this
          objective through the Influenza Prevention and Control project (FY10).
          However, after three extensions of the original February 2010 deadline, the
          loan lapsed in 2011 without becoming effective. Without Bank assistance, the
          government implemented several actions that strengthened the country’s
          capacity to monitor effectively, distribute vaccines, medicines, and medical
          supplies, and expand the country’s strategic reserves of these supplies. The
          Bank provided technical assistance to the National System for
          Epidemiological Surveillance through a performance assessment, which
          identified areas in need of improvement in the system, and an Avian and
          Human Influenza grant (FY10-FY12) to develop comprehensive risk
          communication strategies at the local level in nine states. IFC invested in
          three hospitals, including one through PPP, which helped to expand the
          capacity of the relevant localities to deal with epidemics. The completion and
          learning report concludes that overall there is little evidence of a strong
          World Bank Group contribution to improving Mexican health system’s
          capacity to control epidemic waves.

   •   In March 2006, the Government of Romania requested support from the
       World Bank and an emergency project under the Global Program for Avian
       Influenza Control (GPAI) was approved in the same year. The Romania
       project was part of a horizontal Adaptable Program Loan to help countries
       around the world prepare for and contribute to prevention of a global avian
       influenza pandemic. With a loan of EUR 29.6 million, the project
       development objective was to reduce the threat posed to humans and the
       poultry sector by HPAI [Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza] and other
       zoonosis, and preparing for, controlling and responding to influenza
       pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies. The project outcome
       was unsatisfactory. The Animal Health Safety agency did not carry out its
       role and this key component was dropped. The Project Performance
       Assessment Report (PPAR) argues that the focus of the Bank in pandemics in
       high capacity countries such as the UMICs should be on preparedness for
       pandemics rather than on crisis response.

URBAN DEVELOPMENT (QUALITY OF LIFE)

   •   In Colombia, the Bank provided support from a large number of projects to
       improving access to sustainable urban services in transport, housing and
       water. The Bogota Urban Services project (FY03), the National Macro-projects,
       Social Interest project (FY11), Integrated Mass Transit System project (FY04),
       Rio Bogota Environmental Infrastructure project (FY11), Productive and
       Sustainable Cities DPLs (FY13, FY15) helped the government improve access
       to urban transport, housing, and water services. The indicator for increased
       population benefitting for improved population services was achieved for
       large cities but not achieved for medium-size cities, owing to delays in the
       execution of projects as the budget did not allocate resources for this purpose
       in a timely fashion. IFC supported the delivery of new safe and affordable
       homes enabled for low-income families.
   •   In Tunisia the Bank played a leading role in articulating and supporting
       sectoral reform issues. Six water projects financed by the Bank were active
       during the review period and covered a wide range of activities (four are still
       underway). Because of these projects: Water and sanitation infrastructure was
       usefully augmented, which helped to expand the reach of these services in
       rural and urban areas. Some institutional measures were also implemented to
       improve water management, and the capacity of state agencies was enhanced
       through training. However, for most of the review period, there were sharp
       differences in views between the government and the Bank on reform
       priorities, including the role of the private sector, and the pace of tariff

          adjustments. These differences slowed down the implementation of water
          projects, diminishing the relevance of the interventions. In the electricity
          sector the Bank and the IMF provided technical assistance to help design an
          effective cash compensation program for the poor to protect them from
          proposed energy price increases.
      •   In Brazil the Bank funded a series of integrated urban development and
          municipal projects supporting city specific programs in many states and
          metropolitan areas. In some the emphasis was on slums upgrading, in others
          in supporting basic infrastructure such as water and sanitation. Questions
          have been raised whether a proliferation of many of these very city specific
          projects have had sufficient demonstration effects. At the federal level the
          Bank implemented a policy-based operation accompanied with technical
          assistance and AAA activities. It suggested up-front transparent budgetary
          subsidies for social housing instead of subsidized interest rates, but progress
          in this area has been limited.
      •   World Bank support for Argentina’s Basic Municipal Services Project (2006–
          15) aimed to improve the quality of basic municipal services through the
          provision of water supply and sanitation, urban drainage, and roads
          infrastructure in an equitable and fiscally sustainable way. IEG found that the
          project objective was substantially achieved because the infrastructure
          investments improved the quality of life through access to safe water and
          reliable water resources, sanitation services, reduced losses and travel time
          through improved road networks, and reduced costs from floods.
      •   The Istanbul Municipal Infrastructure Project (2007-13) in Turkey, illustrates
          some of the potential pitfalls of the Bank working directly with
          municipalities. The project aimed to improve the municipality’s solid waste
          management capacity, and its capacity to mitigate earthquakes, by retrofitting
          key facilities and infrastructure and upgrading the institutions and their
          procedures to help them respond to emergencies. $320 million was provided
          for this purpose. In the event 93 percent of the loan was canceled, and IEG
          rated the outcomes as highly unsatisfactory with negligible achievement of
          the indicators. It seems the project went forward without a clear endorsement
          from the State Planning Office and without even an assurance that it formed
          part of the city’s own financing plans.
      •   Between 2004 and 2008 the Bank supported the objective of affordable
          housing for low and middle-income households in Mexico, through a series
          of three DPLs. IEG found that the policies supported by the Bank increased
          housing availability for those in the 40th to the 70th deciles of the population,
          but did not provide for increased housing supply for the poorest groups. The
          PPAR found the project outcomes unsatisfactory and pointed out that

       Experience in Mexico shows that poorer households below the 40th percentile
       of the income distribution cannot afford the cheapest formal housing unit
       through a market-based mortgage loan without a subsidy.”

Chapter 5: Knowledge Agenda
ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY

   •   The Bank has focused its support for managing natural disaster risks on hot
       spots. In countries such as Colombia and Turkey which are natural disaster
       hot spots, the Bank has sought to play a role in helping to respond to the
       disasters when they occur and to build resilience through better
       infrastructure, zoning, planning, early warning systems, and so on.
   •   The Argentina country assistance strategy (CAS) of 2009-14 for example
       identified Sustainable Use of Natural Resources as an objective and defined
       specific medium-term progress benchmarks in this area such as reduced rates
       of land degradation, adoption of new fisheries policies, technologies, and
       management practices, improved public disclosure of water, air and toxics
       pollution data and levels of compliance, and compliance with international
       environment treaties and timetables.
   •   While in general in the UMICs the selection of priorities is closely aligned
       with the government’s own priorities, there were some cases where it is
       apparent that the Bank attached higher weight to programs in this area than
       the government. In Turkey for example, in the area of environmental
       management the FY04 CAS had hoped to engage the Turkish authorities in a
       broader dialogue on investment priorities and move beyond specific
       interventions at the regional level supported by Bank lending. The intention
       was to build on the National Environmental Action Plan prepared before the
       CAS period and provide a link between this and the EU dialogue on
       environmental standards. IEG’s CASCR review concluded that “In practice
       there does not seem to have been much take-up in this area. The Bank did not
       undertake major analytic work during the period, and overall the Bank’s
       instruments do not seem to be very strategic in relation to this objective. This
       said, the Turkish authorities were engaged in the task of preparing the
       ground for meeting specific EU directives so that some progress was made
       against this outcome though with more limited input by the Bank than had
       been intended. Indeed, the Turkish authorities indicated at one point that
       they were not interested in having the Bank’s involvement in this area, but
       were advised by the EU that in other cases the Bank had played a helpful role
       in this regard.

      •   Several Bank operations have been very broadly defined in terms of
          promoting sustainable development. The evaluative evidence suggests that it
          is very difficult to set out a meaningful results framework in such situations.
          The Bank lent $17 million to Colombia in to support the design and
          implementation of policy reforms and related investments in line with the
          framework of the DPL for Sustainable Development. IEG’s review of this
          after it closed in 2015 states that “As it is unclear what the project outcomes
          actually were, it is very difficult to specifically identify the risk to them. The
          project was appraised as a typical, small technical assistance and investment
          loan to support the DPL program. It was appraised on a small budget in just
          more than 5 weeks. There was no economic appraisal of the investment
          envisaged. Costs of the inputs required were woefully underestimated. The
          results chain was very weakly defined and the project activities were
          scattered across several sectors. There were only general proposals for inter-
          sectoral coordination. The RF was very complex and poorly designed with no
          consistent results chain. Not surprisingly IEG rated the project as
          Unsatisfactory.
      •   A considerable part of the Bank’s focus in the UMICs as opposed to lower-
          income borrowers, has been to try to create incentives for communities or the
          private sector to maintain and protect the environment. The evaluative
          evidence suggests a mixed experience in this regard. On the positive side for
          example two operations in Bulgaria, rated satisfactory by IEG, helped to
          ensure that the environmental damage caused by state-owned enterprises
          was handled during the privatization process in ways that did not hinder the
          privatization but still ensured that the new owners would be responsible for
          carrying out remediation and compliance plans.
      •   In Brazil, a Pilot Program for the Conservation of the Amazon Forests (PPG-
          7) established and funded by the G-7 and administered in large part by the
          World Bank. An IEG evaluation of transformational projects assessed this as
          perhaps the most successful environmental program supported by the Bank
          is the PPG-7. Although only partially attributable to the program (1994–2012),
          data show that the rate of deforestation in Brazil has slowed significantly
          since the mid-2000s. PPG-7 supported numerous scientific research activities,
          strategy studies, capacity building, and piloting and demonstration projects,
          which prepared the necessary knowledge base for the transformation of
          Brazil’s policy and institutional framework for forest protection and
          management. It also helped prepare numerous follow-up projects that helped
          strengthen Brazil’s protected areas framework and consolidate the open
          agricultural frontier. All together, these interventions have helped to
          successfully reverse the trajectory of Amazon deforestation from an

    unsustainable to a sustainable trend. The main driver of this transformation
    was the self-interest of private companies to meet the consumer demand for
    sustainably produced oil, which BACP helped demonstrate. Certified
    Sustainable Palm Oil sales grew to 5.4 million tons, about 18 percent of the
    global supply in 2014.
•   By contrast the evaluative evidence suggests that a similar initiative in
    Indonesia has not been successful. Although Indonesia is not a UMIC, the
    experience has important lessons. The program for Sustaining Indonesia’s
    Forests addressed the destruction of tropical forests and the attendant
    impacts on biodiversity loss and greenhouse gas emissions. Deforestation in
    Indonesia has continued to increase in the last decade. The program in
    Indonesia received only weak support at the national level; as a result, little
    government capacity and though some policy reforms were enacted, they
    were not seriously implemented, and most sustainable forestry activities
    remain dependent on donor funding. As of 2012, the intended transformation
    was still a work in progress.
•   The Bank’s experience in Tunisia illustrates both the potentials in this area,
    but also the difficulties in building institutions and incentives to promote
    sustainability even in UMICs. In Tunisia, despite decades of government
    efforts, overexploitation and inadequate land management have led to
    significant resource degradation (particularly severe in some parts of the
    country such as the northwest, central-west, and the south) caused by a
    combination of natural and artificial factors. The Bank’s AAA provided the
    necessary analytical underpinning for reforms and sought to enhance local
    institutional capacity to mainstream environmental factors and improve
    implementation of resource management practices. The Bank’s contribution
    was small but useful, and was largely provided in the form of projects for
    rural development and integrated natural resource management in parts of
    the country that were especially vulnerable to resource degradation. Support
    for water resources management was also provided through water sector
    investment loans. Vegetation and forest coverage in project areas was
    increased, and there was a significant expansion of land treated for soil
    erosion and conservation. Investments were made to protect soil and water
    quality. Associations of ultimate beneficiaries were given more responsibility
    in managing the use of water and land, and were helped by Bank technical
    assistance in strengthening their capacity. However, there is insufficient data
    to assess the extent to which measures have actually reduced the rate of
    natural resource degradation through, for example, slowing down soil
    erosion or dam salinization. Moreover, the sustainability of some of the gains
    achieved is in question as local institutions remain weak and financially

      •   Two projects in the sample were part of the Bank’s efforts to support better
          land and water management in Tunisia. The Natural Resource Management
          project was a $27 million pilot to test the feasibility of implementing the
          integrated participatory approach within the Ministry of Agriculture’s
          regional offices as a first step toward mainstreaming participation throughout
          the country. The objectives were to assist in sustaining natural resource
          management, particularly on crop and range land, and improving
          productivity through a greater involvement of resource users in development
          programs. The project met most of its targets for the construction of soil and
          water conservation works, aimed to stabilize and reverse erosion, restore soil
          fertility and contribute to water conservation, but did not measure actual
          results such as changes in soil erosion, and so on. Targets for the
          establishment of pastoral plantations were not met and reported agricultural
          productivity gains were below expectations due to four consecutive years of
          drought. The project approach facilitated the development of partnerships
          between local communities and government line agencies. However, a
          durable mechanism to engage resource users in these programs has not yet
          been established. The project-driven entities do not have formal legal status
          and many ceased to operate after project closure. The Northwest
          Mountainous and Forestry area development project was provided with a $34
          million loan to enhance livelihoods in the region through ensuring
          sustainable management of natural resources through the improvement and
          diversification of the agricultural and pastoral production systems and the
          promotion of off-farm income-generating activities. The project also
          employed a participatory approach to achieve its objectives. The project
          succeeded in meeting many of its output targets for soil and water
          conservation investments, but the project fell short in measuring results from
          these activities. While indicators for the region as a whole improved, there
          was no control group so attribution is difficult given that the period included
          recovery from droughts.
      •   Four projects in the sample related specifically to watershed management,
          two in Kazakhstan, one in Turkey, and the fourth, the support provided to
          the Mekong River Commission by the Global Environment Facility (GEF).
          While the results in Kazakhstan were generally positive which the IEG
          evaluation attributes to strong government ownership, IEG downgraded both
          the other projects, in the first case because of the lack of clear evidence on the
          attribution of achievements to the Bank-supported project, and in the second
          case because of the underlying assumption that the political problems of

    allocating the use of the Mekong waters could be resolved by a purely
    technical approach.
•   The Bank provided a loan of $13 million to Chile including $7m. of GEF
    funds to help reduce Greenhouse Gas emissions from ground transport in
    Santiago. As an important component of this, the project funded the
    construction of 40 km. of bikeways. IEG found that the bikeways had been
    successful and some headway had been made in reducing harmful emissions.
    But the objectives framed for the project were too broad. The project was
    downgraded from MS in the ICR because the evidence supporting efficacy
    and efficiency was insufficient.
•   According to IEG’s PPAR, the Argentina National Forests and Protected
    Areas Project resulted in the preparation of the first National Forest
    Inventory, which altered public opinion and the debate over forest policy. It
    was instrumental in the passage and implementation of a new Native Forest
    Law and Fund in 2007 aimed at countering the financial incentives driving
    the conversion of native forests to agriculture and cattle-ranching in areas
    with poor soils and climatic conditions for such land uses. Improved
    management increased the level of environmentally sustainable tourism at
    four selected national parks in Patagonia through investments to improve
    tourism infrastructure, concessionary services, and park management. The
    Argentina Biodiversity Conservation Project succeeded in expanding and
    diversifying the protected areas system to include some of the most
    threatened and underrepresented ecoregions in the country by establishing
    five new protected areas and national parks. This was done in a scientifically
    defensible way, and using internationally accepted selection methods, criteria
    and protocols. The project also helped establish conditions for effective
    management of these parks through introduction of sustainable land-use
    activities in park buffer zones, using refined mechanisms of consultation and
    participation, and improved access to biodiversity information management.
•   A substantial part of the Bank’s program in South Africa has been support
    for biodiversity. These were in three very clearly defined geographic zones
    and IEG evaluated them as broadly successful in achieving their biodiversity
    objectives. In addition, poverty reduction objectives were also part of these
    programs, though clearly secondary to the environmental purposes. Because
    of the difficulty of substantiating the poverty reduction impact of the
    biodiversity projects, the ratings were lower than would have been the case if
    the objectives had been limited to biodiversity. IEG’s review of the South
    Africa CAS completion report, also notes that the program of biodiversity
    support did not take a broader systemic approach and that there were few
    synergies from the three projects.

DISASTER RESPONSE AND RISK MANAGEMENT

      •   The Colombia Disaster Vulnerability Reduction project was an APL which
          aimed in the first operation to assist in the strengthening of national capacity
          for reducing the fiscal vulnerability to natural disasters and to mitigate the
          negative impact of possible effects deriving from such disasters. Of the total
          $300 m. was for financing of critical imports required due to a disaster as
          identified in a recovery plan up to six months after the declaration of a
          national emergency. The second APL aimed to strengthening capacity to
          manage disaster risk and reduce vulnerability in key sectors. The project
          supported the retrofitting of schools, kindergartens and fire stations, and in
          revisions of the original design, hospitals to make them resilient. IEG rated
          DRM capacity strengthening as substantial – for example, training teachers to
          act as safety wardens in schools.
      •   The Bank’s response to flooding in Poland in 1997 was also indicative of how
          disaster response can be used to put in place a framework for disaster
          management. In IEG’s view “The main objective of the project was the
          restoration of the municipal and rural infrastructure and this exceeded the
          scope of works identified during project preparation by 20 percent. Though
          an extension of the closing date of the loan was needed to complete the
          vulnerability reduction aspects of the project, this objective was substantially
          achieved through the successful completion of the flood management and
          hazard reduction component. Poland now has one of the most modern flood
          forecasting and warning systems in the world. The project had an unintended
          positive impact on institutional development. Though not a direct objective,
          significant gains were made through the creation of: The Office of Natural
          Disaster Recovery in the Chancellery of the Prime Minister, crisis
          management centers within each administrative region, and flood risk
          reduction planning and management at the community level.”

CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION

      •   The project in Mexico was particularly interesting since it looked at
          environmental impacts – climate change, natural disasters and deforestation –
          through the lens of their impact on the poor. The project attempted to
          strengthen social resilience through policies that directly and indirectly
          benefited the poor by improving a) adaptation planning oriented to the state
          level; b) disaster risk reduction and territorial development actions oriented
          to the municipal level; c) sustainable community forest management at the
          community level. A DPL in Mexico provided support for mainstreaming

                                         SPECIFIC COUNTRY- AND PROJECT-LEVEL EXAMPLES
    adaptation to climate change in the water sector through strengthening the
    institutional framework and monitoring capacity in integrated water
    management.
•   The Bank’s support for the Integrated National Adaptation Program in
    Colombia aimed to support efforts to define and implement specific pilot
    adaptation measures and policy options to meet the anticipated impacts of
    climate change. Components included making climate change information
    available; design and implementation of an adaptation program and
    responses to increased exposure to malaria and dengue. IEG found that
    except in relation to exposure to malaria and dengue the outcomes were
    substantial. A particularly important and valuable contribution of the
    Program was the contribution to institutional collaboration within Colombia
    between institutions and various stakeholders. Essentially the project led to a
    new model for working synergistically across institutions at all levels, and
    with stakeholders and beneficiaries.
•   The renewable energy in Turkey was the only one in the sample whose
    outcome was rated by IEG as Highly Satisfactory. The project was designed
    to increase privately owned and operated power generation from renewable
    sources without the need for government guarantees, and within the market-
    based framework of the new Turkish Electricity Market Law. The Bank made
    a loan of $200 million for financing a Special Purpose Debt Facility for
    generation using renewable energy resources. IEG found that the project’s
    objectives had been fully achieved and the approach had been adopted by
    other institutions and international financial institutions. Increased
    generating capacity of privately owned renewable plans; increased volume of
    electricity produced from private renewable generating facilities; decrease in
    carbon dioxide equivalent emissions—all these were above the original
    targets. The IERR was about 20 percent.
•   Mexico was an important recipient of Bank support in the energy sector with
    a series of operations designed to provide policy and investment support. The
    $400 million Low-Carbon DPL aimed at increasing renewable energy supply,
    promoting energy efficiency, reducing gas flaring and venting, improving the
    efficiency of the vehicle fleet and road transport operations; promoting
    efficient housing, and sustainable forestry development. IEG concluded that
    the project had a substantial impact through contributing to an increased
    renewable energy supply and reduced gas flaring, including promotion of
    energy-efficient housing.
