1. When projects to reduce disaster risk are assessed on the basis of the value of damages that can be avoided, analyses favor
projects that will protect or support richer areas or people. Imagine two flood protection projects with similar costs. The first would
cover a wealthy neighborhood in a capital city. Because of the density of high-value assets, it would avert on average US$10 million
a year in losses. The second project would target poorer areas in a second-tier city and prevent just US$5 million a year in losses.
A traditional analysis would unambiguously select the first project. But a US$5 million loss may matter more to poor people than a
US$10 million loss to richer people. If the second project benefits very poor people, it may generate greater benefits for well-being.
And because well-being is the ultimate goal of public policy, the second project may be more attractive (Hallegatte et al. 2017).

FIGURE 3. THE ELEMENTS OF AN EFFECTIVE APPROACH TO DISASTER
PREPAREDNESS AND CRISIS RESPONSE

  COORDINATED PLAN FOR POST-DISASTER ACTION AGREED IN ADVANCE
  •	   Consists of a single, credible plan for disaster response
  •	   Defines explicit responsibilities and liabilities of all stakeholders (who or what will be protected, against
       what, and who will pay for what)
  •	   Establishes clear decision process
  •	   Clarifies what risks the national/local government will take on, and what risks have to be shared with
       households and firms, as well as the role of international partners


  FAST, EVIDENCE-BASED DECISION-MAKING PROCESS
  •	   Identifies ahead of time objective and transparent rules to guide decision making
  •	   Requires investing in early warning systems and better data/information (ground data on loss of human
       life, building damage, area average index data on damage and losses, parametric indexes), including the
       human and technological capacity to collect data in a timely manner
  •	   Define rules and triggers that result in pre-agreed interventions to promote decisive, timely action



  PRE-PLANNED FINANCING FOR EARLY ACTION
  •	   Ensures that funds are available quickly when—and only when—they are required
  •	   Binds partners to pre-agreed objectives, decision processes, and implementation modalities
  •	   Promotes greater discipline, transparency, and predictability in post-disaster spending
  •	   Ensures rapid mobilization of funds, reducing humanitarian costs and potentially saving money

   Beyond sovereign catastrophe risk pools that
   can assist governments in accessing rapid (but
   limited) post-disaster financing, governments
   can also promote the development of
   domestic catastrophe risk pools to transfer
   disaster risks from households and small
   and medium enterprises to the private
   insurance and reinsurance markets. Since
   the establishment of the Turkish Catastrophe
   Insurance Pool (TCIP) in 1999 (see Box 5),
   very few developing and emerging countries
   have implemented such pools. (Indonesia
   and Romania are among the few exceptions
   in emerging economies.) The role of the
   government is essential in such endeavors,
   which must align incentives and generate
   a sustainable demand for catastrophe risk
   insurance, especially where insurance literacy
   and penetration are low.

30           SOVEREIGN CATASTROPHE RISK POOLS
For     governments       defining      cost-effective
combinations of financial instruments, risk
transfer solutions can be implemented in various
forms, including direct access to the reinsurance
and capital markets or indirect access through a
dedicated vehicle such as a catastrophe risk pool.
Catastrophe risk pools create a platform that allows
governments to (i) take a collective and standard
approach to quantitative analysis and modeling;
(ii) improve information sharing; (iii) coordinate
response; (iv) lower costs of coverage (through
pooling of diverse exposures, retention of some
risk, and transfer of excess risks to the capital and
reinsurance market); and (v) strengthen regional/
subregional cooperation and policy dialogue.

In the Caribbean, for example, the World Bank
Group has supported 16 countries that decided
to join efforts through the Caribbean Catastrophe
Risk Insurance Facility, which pools hurricane,
earthquake, and excess rainfall risks. The purpose
of this regional approach was to enable countries
to access rapid (but limited) response financing
—with payouts disbursed within two or three
weeks after a disaster. The sovereign mechanism
CCRIF set up in 2007 in the Caribbean was the
first of its kind. Since then, the concept has been
replicated in two other regions, in the Pacific          Risk pools also entail certain risks and costs that

losses presented here represent AIR Worldwide’s upper-bound estimates of economic losses for low- and middle-income countries
on an aggregate basis. The income categories and regional country classifications adopted are as defined by the World Bank (see
note a). While AIR models losses in over 90 countries, assumptions were made regarding losses from perils and countries that
AIR does not currently model; assumptions were also made concerning the nature of the scaling factor between insured/insurable
and economic losses. These assumptions are based on AIR’s current understanding of historical losses and relative hazard levels.
Numbers presented should therefore be interpreted as estimates.
a. World Bank income classifications were used, with high-income countries removed from the analysis. Where data were not available
for in-scope countries, AIR Worldwide used an extrapolation methodology to make estimates. See World Bank, “World Bank Country
and Lending Groups,” https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups.

partners. Pool members represent the vast
majority of developing countries that have
purchased sovereign catastrophe risk insurance.
Opportunities for one or more supranational pools
may arise in Asia, and large countries across
the world are exploring national level solutions,
following the example of Mexico.

EXISTING SOVEREIGN CATASTROPHE
RISK POOLS

The three existing sovereign catastrophe risk pools
could potentially cover more than 50 countries
in Africa, the Pacific, and the Caribbean and
Central America, for multiple perils. Many current
members are among the world’s most vulnerable
nations (see Figure 5). Since its launch in 2007,
CCRIF has been restructured as a segregated
portfolio company to be able to expanded to
gradually include countries of Central America (as
of December 2016 only Nicaragua has joined).
ARC was launched by the African Union in 2012
and issued its first insurance contracts in 2014.
