Economic growth and urbanization are complementary and critical to poverty

expected between 2010 and 2040, the typical African city will double its population
and many new cities will be built1. For many developing countries this presents an
opportunity to leapfrog development cycles, catch up and even surpass some of the
21st-Century hubs of high-income nations.

The World Bank has been using big data to track and study changes in urbanization
in low- and middle-income countries, to help ensure that it is sustainable, equitable
and supports economic growth. As the world’s population becomes more urbanized,
reducing unemployment and promoting sustainability and resilience in urban
economies is vital. However, much urbanization is not well planned or managed in
developing countries, resulting in cities which have grown rapidly but lack critical
infrastructure and are unable to take advantage of economies of scale. For citizens,
this means poor transport and services, weak links between job opportunities and the
workforce, increased inequality, low resilience to shocks and a lack of sustainability.

Successful urbanization depends on the                                 or Earth observation (EO) data can deliver

  consuming. However, crowd-sourcing platforms

  the labeling method and to construct larger and

  was designed to detect the boundaries between
  built-up areas and their periphery. The majority
  of the labeled examples were sampled from
  highly populated areas and from their adjacent,
  low-population environs. This approach may

The United Nations estimates that the global urban population will grow by 2.5 billion
by 2050, either through migration or the urbanization of rural areas. Ninety percent of
this increase will occur in Asia and Africa, bringing the total global population living
in urban areas to 66 percent6. Such population growth adds to the already significant
challenges policymakers face to provide critical infrastructure and key services to
urban populations. This is especially so in low- and middle-income countries, where
urban development is frequently informal and incremental, and where cities struggle
to keep up with infrastructure needs.

Crime and violence are now a key development issue in many lower-income
countries worldwide. Beyond the trauma and suffering of individual victims, they
carry staggering economic costs at both local and national levels. Accounting for
expenditures on citizen security, law enforcement and health care, experts estimate
that crime costs close to 8 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in some Central
American countries. Crime and violence also undermine economic growth, not just
through the loss of victims’ wages and labor, but by polluting the investment climate
and diverting scarce government resources from supporting economic activity to
strengthening law enforcement. Some estimates suggest that a 10 percent reduction
in violence in Central American countries with the highest murder rates could boost
annual economic growth per capita by as much as one percent.12

Informed, considered and coordinated urban planning is needed to build sustainable,
resilient, equitable and livable cities. To plan effectively, stakeholders need detailed
descriptive and predictive information on both macro and micro levels – from large-
scale trends such as the nature and pace of urbanization, to the needs of individual
communities and citizens. The cities of the future must raise real incomes of the
poorest people, be resilient to shocks and stresses, protect environmental resources

This solutions brief is one of several sector focused big data knowledge products delivered
through the “Innovations in Big Data Analytics” program which resides in the Global Operations
and Knowledge Management Unit (GOKMU). It has been prepared jointly in cooperation with
the Social, Urban, Rural and Resilience Global Practice and Booz Allen Hamilton. Trevor Monroe
(GOKMO), Andrew Whitby (DECDG), and Luda Bujoreanu (GTIDR) coordinated the publication.
A number of WBG staff provided valuable contributions to make this publication possible,
including peer reviewers Ellen Hamilton, Nancy Lozano Gracia, Katherine Kelm, and Kai Kaiser.


The Innovations in Big Data Analytics program works to accelerate the effective use of
big data analytics across the World Bank, and to position the World Bank as a leader
in the big data for development community.
