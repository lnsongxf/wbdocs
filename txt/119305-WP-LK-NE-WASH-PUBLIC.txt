                    HIGHLIGHT
                ADDRESSING GENDER
                AND DISABILITY ISSUES
The project, at every stage from design to implementation, is taking into consideration
gender and social inclusion by focusing not only on lagging regions of Sri Lanka but
also on the most vulnerable minority groups within these areas. Women interviewed in
the project area revealed that they spent an average of 3 to 4 hours a day fetching
water. Having reliable and easily accessible piped water would drastically reduce the
amount of time dedicated to collecting water. The time freed up can be then allo-
cated to more productive activities. This is a critical aspect in the post-conflict areas of
the North and East that have a substantial incidence of women-headed households.
Women-headed households comprise arguably the most vulnerable group of re-
turnees and are among the priority groups targeted by development schemes.
A survey conducted in September 2010 by the Jaffna based NGO Center for Wom-
en and Development* revealed that the post-conflict northern region had approxi-
mately 40,000 female-headed households. Over 50 percent of the women heads of
the households surveyed were single parents under 30 years of age supporting their
own and extended families. Although up to date statistics are hard to come by due
to the number of displaced people, NGOs and government officials estimate that
the northern and eastern regions combined are home to some 89,000 war widows, a
very high number considering that the conflict displaced more than 280,000 people.
As the main users of water in households and initiators of change in hygiene practices,
the central role of women in WASH is fundamental for the success of the project. Wom-
en hold at least one of the three key positions (Chairperson, Secretary or Treasurer) in
the WUA and at least 50% of the executive committee is female. To better monitor and
evaluate the gender related benefits of the project, gender disaggregated data is be-
ing collected. At the initial stage of the project, a baseline survey was done and it indi-
cated that at least 15% of the households in the project area were headed by women.
Addressing disability issues is equally important for the social inclusion agenda. In a post-
conflict situation there will be larger proportion of disabled people within households
whose needs will need to be taken into account. Poverty and disability are intrinsically
linked. People with disabilities are more likely to be poor, and this not only increases their
social and economic vulnerability, it also limits their access to basic services. Traditional
water supply, sanitation and hygiene schemes have marginalized the needs of different-
ly-abled people. Policies to address these needs are also lacking. As a result, disabled
people face many challenges as they attempt to access WASH services, which have
severe health and economic consequences and also impacts their dignity and ability
to be self-reliant. The participation of disabled people is necessary for the success of the
project. Data has been collected on the number of disabled people in the project com-
munities in order to design WSS schemes that address their specific needs. The baseline
survey found that 5.5% of all households in the project area included disabled residents.
The design of the project has ensured that women headed house-holds form 15% and
households with disabled members form 5.4% of the targeted beneficiaries. See Table 1.

Provision of Water and Sanitation
All 9 water supply sub-projects, covering 16 villages, 10 in Mannar and 6 in Trincomalee district, have been
contracted out and are under construction. The sub-projects were reduced from 12 to 9 since one commu-
nity did not have a water source that could be easily accessed, another joined an ADB funded program,
and yet another opted out. The sub-projects will provide access to 2,303 households. However, given the
continuing migration into the area, which is expected to accelerate as water supply improves, the scheme
also has built-in extra capacity. Looking at the population growth rate and new resettlement in the region, it
is expected that the schemes will in the final analysis cover 4,488 households. This is a 50% increase over the
figure of 3,000 set out in the Concept Note. The project is also providing toilets in the sub-project areas to
households and to local schools.

The Sanitation Revolving Fund is disbursing well. The amount of grant and loan per household has been in-
creased from Rs 12,000 to Rs 18,000 after extensive consultations with beneficiaries as the original amount
was found to be inadequate to build a quality toilet. The $90,000 in the fund has been topped up by another
$19, 166 from the government to meet the additional costs. Two villages that were dropped from the water
supply schemes were included in the sanitation program, as they were a part of the initial social mobilization
and their expectations for assistance had already been raised. A baseline survey has been conducted to
identify the potential beneficiaries. Water User Associations are registered in all subproject areas and they
all have accounts opened in commercial banks to allow for the transfer of sanitation grants to WUAs. Out
of the 2,809 households covered under the sanitation program, 14.7% are female-headed households and
5.4% have disabled members. The sanitation program also covers 27 sanitation facilities in 11 schools in the
scheme area that are being constructed by the School Development Society.

        Technical Assistance and Capacity Building
        The capacity constraints of PSs and communities have been identified and steps are being taken to strengthen
        capacity at all levels. The lack of capacity within the communities is being addressed through the creation
        of specialized WUAs that work closely with the community and provide guidance for operation and mainte-
        nance of the water supply schemes. Eleven Water Users Associations have been formed and registered with
        the NWSDB in all sub-project areas including two that are only for sanitation. Over 83% of the households to be
        covered have already paid for membership of their WUA. This is an impressive result, demonstrating the huge
        demand for safe water. This number is expected to increase, as more families learn about the social, economic
        and health benefits of safe drinking water at their doorstep and with growth in population over time.

Hygiene, education, and awareness programs are at the heart of the success of any water and sanitation
project. This aspect is however, often ignored in projects with more attention being paid to the construction
of the hard infrastructure. The project has undertaken an intensive hygiene promotion program to educate
communities on the socio-economic costs of lack of sanitation and benefits of good hygiene and improved
sanitation. Many innovative learning materials have been prepared. Schools in particular, are being targeted
to enhance their hygiene education programs. Families have reported that these programs are very useful
for them and for their children. The program includes orientation, preparing an action plan to address hy-
giene issues, programs for hygiene promotion and education, posters and materials for hygiene awareness,
and discussions/education at community and school levels. The innovative training methods used include
street plays for the community and arts competitions in schools. Until January 2013, a total of 39 trainings were
organized. A total of 2,300 students (of which 50% are girls) attended 13 hygiene education programs in both
districts (6 in Trincomalee and 7 Mannar). Art competitions were also held in 5 schools. The training at school
level covered different grade levels, from 3-5, 6-8, and 9-11 grades. At the community level training programs
covered 890 people (55% female). There were 12 community awareness programs and training conducted, 6
in each district. In addition, a Training of Trainers (ToT) program for the PS staff and CBOs, and a street play on
the importance of sanitation and hygiene were organized. Finally, 7 general training programs covering orien-
tation for partners and social mobilization were conducted. These awareness programs will continue to provide
a lasting impact resulting in better sanitation and health. See Table 2 for details of the 39 training programs.


Project Managament
Under this component, two Rural Water Supply (RWS) offices have been set up in the two project districts
by NWDSB. These will be permanent offices that will continue to help communities after the pilot is over. Ad-
equate staffing has been provided and these units are functional. In order to monitor and evaluate progress
against indicators, a Management Information System (MIS) has been created and all progress reports are
being generated from this. The progress of water supply schemes and construction of sanitation facilities and
all aspects of hygiene awareness and education programs are being captured in the MIS. A results frame-
work was also developed for the project at the concept stage. See Annex Section - Results Framework. The
baseline survey has been completed. The PMU is now working to include water quality data and to strength-
en the documentation process as recommended by the MTR.

The project is closely monitored by the Bank. The Bank is supervising the project through desk reviews of prog-
ress reports that are sent by the government every two months. In addition, the World Bank team conducts
field visits every six months and continues to work closely with the PMU. Two missions, including an MTR, have
already taken place and the next mission is planned for May, 2013.

    SUMMARY
1.4.1 - ALLOCATIONS
The entire grant amount of $2.01 million that was to be received by government has already been trans-
ferred to GoSL. Allocations have been made against this for construction of the water supply schemes (WS),
sanitation incentive grants (SIGs), training (TRG), and incremental operating costs (OC). See Figure 3 for the
percentage allocated to each activity. The SIGs are over budget by $19,161. This shortfall is being met by the
government as explained above.

1.4.2 - DISBURSEMENTS AND COMMITMENTS
This is a recipient executed project and every two months the Bank task team receives a progress update
from GoSL. As per the last report in January 2013, 24% of the funds have been disbursed. Table 3 provides
details by component. Only 1% of the funds remain uncommitted with more than a year remaining for the
project to close. All 9 water supply contracts have been awarded and disbursement is expected to acceler-
ate during the next few months as construction picks up.

     1.5 PARTNERSHIP WITH AUSAID
     AusAID as the sole funder of the pilot has participat-                   informed GoSL that this scale up will not take place
     ed in all phases of the project, from concept design                     as originally anticipated due to funding constraints.
     to the ongoing implementation. Staff from the Co-                        Given the positive results achieved by the pilot in
     lombo Post also participated in the recent MTR of the                    providing access to WASH facilities in post-conflict
     project. In addition, the Task Team Leader has con-                      communities within a short time frame, the extent of
     ducted face-to-face briefings for the staff at the Co-                   community participation generated it is important to
     lombo Post to report on progress after every mission.                    scale up the project without losing the momentum
     In addition, AusAID has leveraged the Bank’s resourc-                    that has already generated in these post conflict
     es, including the expertise of its staff and its long-term               communities. The Bank is currently in discussions with
     relationship with GoSL in the water supply and sani-                     the government regarding a potential WSS project in
     tation sector, at little cost. It has also leveraged the                 Sri Lanka. The partnership between AusAID and the
