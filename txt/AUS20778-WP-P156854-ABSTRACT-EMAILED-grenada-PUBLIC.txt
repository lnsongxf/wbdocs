Grenada is 19 km long with a coastline of 121 km and an exclusive economic
zone (EEZ) in the sea of 26,000 km2. We have committed to conserve at least
20% of our nearshore marine resources and rebuild natural capital.




Properly planned, the carrying capacity of these ecosystems can generate blue
growth exports and / or jobs in a range of sectors, including: coastal and marine pro-
tection, watershed, sewage and waste management, organic agriculture, waterfront
wellness services and retirement properties, coastal eco-tourism, dive tourism, sport
fishing, yachting and marina services, traditional boat building, fisheries, aquacul-
ture, ocean energy, climate resilient coastal infrastructure, blue biotechnology and
international education in marine science and policy.

transportation projects:                                                                                    PETITE MARTINIQUE

DUMFRIES AIRORT
The current airport runway in Carriacou does not allow for larger commer-                       CARRIACOU
cial jets to land and take-off. The relocation of the airport to Dumfries will
allow for direct commercial flights to Carriacou, which will increase tour-
ism and also open up land for the development of other economic activi-
ties including a Commercial Center, Fishing Village, Aquaculture Center and
Marine Housing.

WEST COAST FERRY SERVICE
The Blue Growth Master Plan promotes the expansion of the current Ferry
Service from St. George’s to Hillsborough, Carriacou, and on to Town Dock
in Petite Martinique to include Sandals, Gouyave, Victoria, and Sauteurs.

EAST COAST HIGHWAY
With the relocation of the port to Grenville, a new East Coast Highway will
be built to move goods and services to St. George. This would also open
up additional land along the Southeast Coast for the development of addi-
tional marine residential communities on the numerous peninsulas. A sec-
ond phase of an East Coast Highway may include a Northeast Highway
from Grenville to Sauteurs.

ST GEORGE’S HARBOR WATER TAXI SERVICE
As St. George’s Harbor is developed, a new market for regular scheduled
water taxis would connect the Cruise Ship Esplanade, with Portofino, the
                                                                                      GRENADA
Carenage, the proposed Central Harbor Development, the Lagoon , Port
Louis Marina, and finally around the corner to the Port Louis Phase 2 de-
velopment project.

INTER-ISLAND FERRY SERVICE
An Inter-Island Ferry Service might also be developed to include Trinidad,
Union Island, St. Vincent, St. Lucia, Martinique, Dominica, and Barbados.


                                                                                 20

 New Port (relocated from St. George’s Harbor)
 Free Trade/Industrial Development
 Port/Industrial Housing
 Regional Cargo Air Terminal
 Waste to Energy Plant



Additional Due Diligence Studies are required to determine the best loca-
tion for the relocation of the St. George’s Port.
The Grenville location is convenient to the major shipping lane between
Grenada and Trinidad Tobago. A Brazilian sponsored Free Trade Zone and                         GRENADA
Industrial Development would potentially lead to increased shipping to/
from South America.                                                                        5
The Halifax location would offer calmer waters and could be combined
                                                                                 Halifax

                                            PROJECT DESCRIPTION
                                            Levera is a 400-acre site with sweeping views of the Eastern Caribbean Sea and Southern Grenadine Islands.
                                            The site contains a spectacular white-sand beach fringed by palm trees, and dramatic natural topography
                                            that reaches an elevation of 800 feet.
                                            Located on Grenada’s relatively undeveloped northeast coast, the location is ideal for a secluded, intimate
                                            getaway, yet easily accessible from the islands international airport, 90 minutes drive away.
                                            Adjacent to the property is the Levera National Park, an important wildlife habitat with an extensive man-
                                            grove swamp. The beach at Levera is an important breeding ground for marine turtles which travel thou-
                                            sands of miles to return to their place of birth to lay their eggs.

                                           PROJECT DESCRIPTION
                                           The Blue Growth Development Zone for this specialty marina includes reclaimed land adjacent to Sauteurs
                                           and below Caribs leap. The marina project will include 65 slips and accommodate a Ferry Terminal for the
                                           new ferry stop.
                                           The strategic location on the north coast of Grenada would provide protected slips and immediate access to
                                           the Grenadines. A 40 room specialty Yacht Charter Hotel with restaurant would occupy the reclaimed land
                                           opposite the marina. 8 Resort Villas would ring the perimeter of the land mass with views to Ronde Island.
                                           Two commercial buildings opposite the ferry stop would house a Ferry Terminal as well as other commercial
                                           and/or retail businesses.
                                           An extension of the south shore would provide additional protection for the new harbor. The space would be

Victoria Eco Tourism Center

  The Blue Growth Development Zone
  for Eco-Tourism includes the open
  land south of the St. Catherine River
  in Victoria. This gateway site to Vic-
  toria would lend itself to the promo-
  tion of the area as a major Eco-
  Tourism destination.
  Hikers would be able to use this site
  as their base for the steep climb to
  the top of Mount St. Catherine, the
  highest mountain peak in Grenada.
  From here they would also pick up
  guided tours to Tufton Hall Water-
  fall, the largest waterfall on the is-
  land. Reaching nearly one-hundred
  feet long, this massive waterfall falls
  in a series of cascades that creates a
  site of immense beauty and a sound
  that emanates the beauty of the sur-           VICTORIA
  roundings. Tucked away in jagged
  terrain and forests, Tufton Hall Falls
  is surrounded by green trees and
  covered with grey and brown rocks.
  The ground takes after the moun-

                                                The creation of a fishing fleet marina will allow the existing fish market to expand processing and transporting

  continued Blue Growth development.
  An expanded Sports Center is planned
  to include new facilities for Tennis,
  Gymnastics, Aquatics, as well as a
  Sports Resort and Sports Housing.
  Three major “Anchor Projects” are                      G6d           G6e

  provide opportunities for accommo-
  dating a large-scale conference venue
  as well as additional family oriented                        G6c

  Medical Tourism would dramatically
  increase the Tourism market in Grena-

THE TRANSFORMATION OF ST. GEORGE’S

The Blue Growth vision for St. George’s Harbor takes advantage of three
very prominent sites:

NORTH HARBOR                                                                                    CENTRAL HARBOR
This elevated site at the entrance to the harbor is currently occupied by
the National Hospital that will be relocated to a new Health and Wellness
Campus at Morne Rouge Bay. It would be ideal for the development of a                 NORTH HARBOR
five star hotel and casino along the cliff and terracing down to the harbor,
taking on a character reminiscent of Monaco.
                                                                                                      SOUTH HARBOR
CENTRAL HARBOR
The Central Harbor site is the heart of the harbor experience and would be
ideal for a high density mixed use marine project. The prominent site
should become the focus for St. George’s and a symbol for Grenada in the
global tourism market. A very “iconic” building is envisioned for this site as
a home for the Blue Growth and Ocean Governance Institute, a Five Star
Hotel, or perhaps a World Trade Center.

SOUTH HARBOR
This elevated site, together with the North Harbor cliffs, forms a “gateway”
into St. George’s Harbor. The site is being planned for the second phase in
the development of Port Louis as a Maritime Village Haven and Mega                                     GATEWAY TO ST. GEORGE’S HARBOR
Yacht Marina and will include a hotel, townhomes, apartments, villas and
private home sites.

The three anchor projects will transform St. George’s into one of the most
desirable destinations in the Caribbean. Their success are also expected to
create numerous spin-off development opportunities around The
Carenage for new commercial, retail and restaurants, as well as Cultural
Centers for Poetry, Dance, Music and Performance.

The Esplanade and Cruise Ship Terminal site could include new commercial
as well as a Cultural Event and Entertainment Center. A new Fishing Vil-
lage would also allow the fishing fleet to move from The Carenage harbor
to a dedicated fishing fleet marina near the current Fish Market.                            “ICONIC” SYMBOL FOR GRENADA

                                               The Blue Growth Development Zone for the St. George’s Fishing Village and Cruise Center includes vacant
                                               land along the Esplanade and potential reclaimed land to the north.
                                               The project will activate the Esplanade and new Waterfront Promenade by locating a Performance Pavilion
                                               on the unused land adjacent to the Cruise Ship Terminal and a new Fishing Marina Village and Fish Pro-
                                               cessing Plant on reclaimed land to the north. Additional Tourism Commercial and Retail opportunities will
                                               be developed along the enhanced promenade.
                                               The new Fishing Fleet Marina will allow the fishing boats to be relocated from the crowded Carenage dock-
                                               ing area to a new protected marina. In addition to the Cultural Event Pavilion and Grounds, the practice
                                               field for the Sports Center can also be utilized for Special Cultural Events.

                                              PROJECT DESCRIPTION
                                              A 300+ room, five-Star Resort Hotel and Casino would occupy the very prominent site of the existing hospital,
                                              creating a new iconic image to the entrance to St. George’s Harbor. An ocean walkway would link the Cruise
                                              Ship Esplanade to the Carnage.

                                              From the commanding high point, the facility is envisioned to terrace down the existing terrain towards the
                                              Harbor, allowing rooms and suites to have large terraces for lounging or private pools. The Casino levels would
                                              also have direct access to outdoor terraces facing the Caribbean Sea. Private Villas would be located on either
                                              side of the high-end resort.

                                              An additional Parking Deck, built into the hill of Fort George, could provide valet parking for the hotel on the

                                            The Blue Growth vision for The Carnage, one of the most picturesque harbors in the Caribbean, is to reani-
                                            mate the ring of buildings with cafes, shops, restaurants and cultural centers, transforming it into a recrea-
                                            tional space where tourists and locals alike can enjoy the natural harbor and beauty of the old town.
                                            The implementation of “Cultural Houses” along the Carnage aims to promote the development of culture
                                            nationally, while at the same time creating a vibrant link between visitors and locals. In addition to local art
                                            galleries, key projects include a House of Music, House of Dance, House of Performance, House of Art, and a
                                            Poetry Pavilion.

                                            The transformation of The Carnage also includes an expanded boardwalk, lined with trees, and a new Park-
                                            ing Deck that will allow the promenade and Wharf Road to become a more pedestrian space and experience.

Grand Anse Beach Tourism Center

There are a number of potential opportu-
nities for improving the Grand Anse
Beach experience.
The new Silver Sands Resort (Parcel A)
will anchor the north end of the beach,
while Mount Cinnamon and the Flamboy-
ant Hotel should continue to provide ex-
cellent anchor facilities on the south end.
The Master Plan looked primarily at Par-       Flamboyant
cel C and D for potential development
opportunities. The two land units could        Hotel
also be considered as one parcel, particu-
larly if the road between the two proper-
ties were converted to a pedestrian
                                                                                            Grand Anse
promenade. The two properties are being                                                     Beach Resort

Government is currently considering a
land exchange for Public Parks with beach                        Spice Island                 C

                                                 partially closed to create a pedestrian promenade that links the ocean to the Special Event Grounds.
                                                 The area north of Spiceland Mall might be considered for the development of a Family Entertainment Center

Grenville Port / Free Trade Industrial Park
 Grenville is being considered as a site
 for the new Cargo Container Port that
 would relocate from St. George’s Har-
 bor. The available land would allow
 the Port to greatly expand in size to
 take on a much larger role in the trans-
 shipping market.
 The Grenville location is convenient to
 the major shipping lane between Gre-
 nada and Trinidad Tobago. A Brazilian
 sponsored Free Trade Zone and Indus-
 trial Development would potentially
 lead to increased shipping to/from
 South America.
 This project would also create a signifi-
 cant economic boost to the entire east
 coast region.
 The restoration of several mangrove
 islands as well as coral reefs will be-
 come part of the overall project as
 well.




 Detailed Due Diligence Studies are re-
 quired to determine the final feasibility
 and cost of building a port on the East
 Coast of Grenada.

                                                  PROJECT DESCRIPTION
                                                  The Blue Growth Development Zone for the proposed relocation of the St. George’s Container Port is re-
                                                  claimed coastal land between Grenville and Telescope Point. The land north of Telescope Point is envisioned
                                                  for an adjoining Free Trade Industrial Park.

                                                  The new 100 Acre Port facility will have over 4,400 feet of dock with multiple shore cranes (The existing 14
                                                  acre St George’s Port is limited has less than 1,100 feet of dock and no shore cranes). The adjacent 100 Acre
                                                  Industrial Park will accommodate over 1,000,000 square feet of light industrial and warehouse space.
                                                  A new 3 mile truck bypass coastal highway will be located along the Grenville water frontage, along the Port
                                                  and Industrial Park, and reconnect with Cammel Road.
                                                  The reclaimed land in front of Grenville will also be used for a new Waterfront Park (with a tall sculpture that
           GRENVILLE, GRENADA                     will also function as a landmark for guiding ships into the channel) and a new 120 slip protected marina.
