laboration with development partners, to assist the government of Tanzania (GoT) in
assessing the implications of climate change for the country’s economic development.
The policy note was developed by a Tanzania-based team led by Ann Jeannette Glau-
ber (Senior Environmental Specialist, World Bank) and Magdalena Banasiak (U.K.
Department for International Development [DFID]) under the guidance of Magda
Lovei (Practice Manager for Environment and Natural Resources, World Bank), and
Philippe Dongier (Country Director, World Bank).

BACKGROUND

Climate change is a core development challenge in Tanzania, and the
potential costs of inaction are signiﬁcant. Current climate variability (includ-
ing extreme events such as droughts and ﬂoods) already leads to major economic costs
in mainland Tanzania and in Zanzibar. Individual annual events have economic costs
in excess of 1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and occur regularly, reduc-
ing long-term growth and aﬀecting millions of people and livelihoods. Future climate
change could lead to large economic costs, equivalent to a further 1 to 2 percent of
GDP per year by 2030 (GCAP 2011). Given this context, there is a clear need for
strong and sustained eﬀort by the government to help establish a growth path for the
country that is resilient to climate variability and able to adapt to future change, as well
as help Tanzania take advantage of external and domestic ﬁnance opportunities for
sustained action on climate risks.

Tanzania has responded to growing climate risks by adopting the
National Climate Change Strategy (NCCS), which is the guiding frame-
work for taking action on climate change. Zanzibar has also adopted its own
climate change strategy, the Zanzibar Climate Change Strategy (ZCCS). Together,
these documents set forth the strategic priorities for climate action and are a step
toward integrating climate change into development planning. These plans are rela-
tively new, and while some implementation is planned, there is still signiﬁcant need
for further clarifying priority investments to improve Tanzania’s resilience to climate
change and to assist in leveraging and channeling climate ﬁnance more strategically, to
deliver results on the ground.

In response to a request by the United Republic of Tanzania (URT) for
technical assistance in improving the impact of the national climate
change strategies, the Bank has developed a series of policy notes com-
plemented by targeted capacity building focused on key areas of vulner-

       (a) Financing Climate Resilient Growth. Outlines Tanzania’s experience and

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


TANZANIA IN 2050: CHANGING ECONOMY,
CHANGING CLIMATE
Tanzania will look dramatically diﬀerent by mid-century. Tanzania envisions
reaching middle-income status by 2025, with a modernized agriculture sector lifting
smallholder farmers out of poverty, increased energy connectivity, and GDP boosted
through power generation fueled largely by exploiting domestic natural gas and coal
resources. The population will nearly triple from 45 million in 2010 to 130 million in
2050—and for the ﬁrst time, more Tanzanians will live in cities than rural areas.

By 2050, Tanzania’s climate will also change. Temperatures are already rising
and rains are less predictable. Temperatures will likely increase by at least 1°C, pos-
sibly 3°C in some areas (see box ES.1). Projected rainfall reductions inland could make
water scarcer, and Tanzania will need to feed more people with less rainfall in some key
agricultural areas. On the coast, key to industry, the population is already swelling into
largely informal settlements in urban areas that cannot keep up with new migrants—
heavier rains are likely, aﬀecting settlements, infrastructure, and mobility. Key eco-
nomic sectors are already vulnerable to the climate; by 2050, the costs just to adapt to
climate change impacts could be in the order of US$1 billion per year (GCAP 2011).

Building resilience to climate variability and long-term climate change is
an urgent development issue for Tanzania, and the coming decades are
critical for the country’s planned economic transition. Tanzania’s diverse
landscapes and natural resources are already experiencing the impacts of climatic shifts
combined with current development challenges stemming from rapid population growth,
unsustainable resource use, and environmental degradation. The economic costs of
weather-related risks can ripple through the entire economy: for example, the 2005/06
drought aﬀected millions of people and imposed costs of at least 1 percent of GDP. By
2030 climate change could account for net economic costs of 2–3 percent of GDP per
year (GCAP 2011), threatening the goal of reaching middle income status. These poten-
tial costs represent a challenge that spans Tanzania’s core growth and poverty reduction
priorities, from agriculture to energy and from rural to urban development.

CHAPTER ONE
INTRODUCTION
Climate change is a core development challenge in Tanzania, and the
potential costs of inaction are signiﬁcant. Current climate variability (includ-
ing extreme events such as droughts and ﬂoods), already leads to major economic costs
in mainland Tanzania and in Zanzibar. Individual annual events have economic costs
in excess of 1 percent of GDP and occur regularly, reducing long-term growth and
aﬀecting millions of people and livelihoods. Future climate change could lead to large
economic costs, equivalent to a further 1 to 2 percent of GDP per year by 2030 (GCAP
2011). Given this context, there is a clear need for strong and sustained eﬀort by the
government to help establish a growth path for the country that is resilient to climate
variability and able to adapt to future change, as well as help Tanzania take advantage
of external and domestic ﬁnance opportunities for sustained action on climate risks.

Tanzania has responded to growing climate risks by adopting the NCCS,
which is the guiding framework for taking action on climate change. Zan-
zibar has also adopted its own climate change strategy, the ZCCS. Together, these
documents set forth the strategic priorities for climate action and are a step toward
integrating climate change into development planning. However, there has been little
implementation of these plans to date and it is unclear how they will guide investments
toward climate-resilient economic development.

Both mainland Tanzania and Zanzibar are exploring options for eﬀec-
tively implementation of strategic plans. Mainland Tanzania has begun to
scope the possibility of a dedicated climate change fund, as well as options to improve
management of climate ﬁnance. The Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar has
also signaled interest in designing a climate change fund.

This policy note responds to a request by the United Republic of Tanza-
nia for technical assistance on next steps for implementing the NCCS and
ZCCS. With strategies in hand, both mainland Tanzania and Zanzibar are at a cross-
roads where strategic actions have been identiﬁed but not yet supported with resources
or adequate frameworks for implementation (see box 1.1). Development partners are
active in ﬁnancing and supporting climate change activities in general, but more than

CHAPTER TWO
THE CHALLENGE: CLIMATE
RISKS TO KEY GROWTH AREAS
Historic climate trends as well as projections point to shifts in temperature
and precipitation that will fundamentally alter Tanzania’s weather pat-
terns. Tanzania’s climate is driven by tropical processes, the Inter-Tropical Conver-
gence Zone (ITCZ), which inﬂuences rainy and dry season patterns. El Niño and La
Niña years are associated with extreme ﬂood and drought events. Although annual
seasonal temperature variation for locations is fairly small (approximately 3–4°C),
variability for rainfall is much higher both geographically and seasonally, with extreme
dry and wet conditions over the course of the year. Alternating dry conditions with
heavy rainfall combine with inadequate land management in many areas, which exac-
erbates land degradation and increases vulnerability to weather-related shocks (Enfors
and Gordon 2007).

Tanzania is growing hotter. The evidence is clear from climate trends that
monthly temperatures across Tanzania have steadily increased over the past thirty
years (URT 2007), with the average temperature rising by 1°C between 1960 and 2006
(McSweeney et al. 2010). Mean maximum and minimum temperatures, for January
and July, have increased in almost all zones between 1961 and 2005 (Munishi 2009).
This is consistent with the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
report for Africa, which provides strong evidence of a warming trend across Africa
and predicts likely mean annual temperature rise of over 2°C by 2100 (IPCC 2014).1
Climate models for Tanzania indicate future increases in average annual temperatures
between 1°C to 3°C above the baseline period (1961–1999) from a range of models
and emission scenarios by the 2050s (see ﬁgure 2.1), with the latest projections indicat-
ing a high certainty of a 1°C rise across the country (Wambura et al. 2014).2

THE CURRENT STATE OF CLIMATE
PLANNING AND FINANCE
The impacts of climate change in Tanzania are already signiﬁcant, but what are the
risks and how is Tanzania currently responding to them? The following section out-
lines the existing strategic planning framework for climate change in Tanzania as well
as the current situation with climate ﬁnance.7 Because climate change is a broad issue
with policy and planning implications across the government, this section only sum-
marizes climate change at the highest level of strategic planning. This is not intended
as a comprehensive policy or institutional review, which can be found in complemen-
tary work,8 but instead it highlights key aspects to consider when mobilizing and man-
aging climate ﬁnance and delivering results on strategic planning frameworks.

STRATEGIC PLANNING
Tanzania’s strategic development plans indicate a growing recognition
that climate change is a threat to both growth and poverty reduction.
Tanzania’s overall development policy is outlined in Vision 2025, which sets future
development objectives for the country. This vision is operationalized through
medium-term plans, including the National Strategy for Poverty Reduction and
Economic Growth (MKUKUTA-I and II) and more recently, the Five Year Develop-
ment Plan (FYDP) for 2011/12 to 2015/16. The FYDP, led by the President’s Oﬃce
Planning Commission (POPC), aims to unleash Tanzania’s economic growth potential
and transform Tanzania into a middle-income country, as envisioned by the Tanzania
Development Vision 2025 (URT President’s Oﬃce Planning Commission 2011).

Both programs recognize climate change as a threat to growth and
poverty reduction. The FYDP emphasizes risks to key growth sectors such as agri-
culture and water and includes two key outputs by 2015 for addressing climate change
(see table 3.1): ﬁrst, to develop a climate change strategy and second, to develop an

CHAPTER FOUR
REDUCING TOMORROW’S RISKS
THROUGH TODAY’S DECISIONS
A pathway to climate-resilient economic growth will take more than
having plans in place. Past experience has shown that implementation and ﬁnanc-
ing of strategic plans is a long-term and resource-intensive process. Adopting plans
is merely a ﬁrst step, with many decisions to come. Tanzania has signaled what is
needed to scale up and better manage climate ﬁnance and work toward transforming
strategic plans into concrete actions. The following section outlines key considerations
for implementing and ﬁnancing climate action in Tanzania, taking into account the
current context for Tanzania’s institutional and policy framework for climate change
as well as the climate ﬁnance landscape.17 This section provides recommendations for
decision making for four key areas that can help enhance what Tanzania has achieved
on climate change and address the identiﬁed challenges, drawing from international
case studies and Tanzania’s experience so far (ﬁgure 4.1).

LEADERSHIP
CHAMPIONS TO ADVANCE CLIMATE GOALS
Countries with advanced institutional arrangements on climate change and which
have made most progress on ﬁnancing climate change activities are those with a high-

not been such a senior political champion in Tanzania, promoting climate action at

promising indication of leadership, but strong follow-up will be key to sustainability.

Case studies show that high-level support is also critical to overcoming potential barriers
and delivering institutional and ﬁnance structures in an eﬀective and timely manner.
Successful regional examples include Rwanda, where presidential support was key,

CHAPTER FIVE
WORKING WITH TANZANIA
TO SUPPORT RESILIENT GROWTH
The Bank, DFID, and other development partners are committed to supporting the
implementation of Tanzania’s development and climate change plans as well as its
ﬁnancing strategies. As discussed in section 2, local development partners are the larg-
est source of ﬁnance for climate change activities in Tanzania, with signiﬁcant resources
in the pipeline. With strategies in place in Mainland Tanzania and Zanzibar, Tanzania
is well placed to leverage donor and other outside support to implement strategies and
promote a growth path that is resilient to climate change and encourages low-carbon
development and also use domestic revenues more strategically to ensure that eco-
nomic growth mitigates rather than exacerbates the risks of a changing climate.

To do so, Tanzania can work with development partners to signal what support would
be most appropriate to meet strategic objectives. Development partners, including the
Bank and DFID, have a range of instruments that are already accessible in Tanzania
or used elsewhere in the Africa region to support climate change activities (ﬁgure 5.1):
    » Financial services to support investments and policy reform that mainstream climate
       change, target speciﬁc climate risks and vulnerabilities, and support policy and
       institutional reforms, through various forms of investment and policy opera-
       tions, mobilizing a variety of resources, including climate ﬁnance
    » Technical assistance and knowledge services to provide policy advice and analyses on
       speciﬁc knowledge gaps, support knowledge exchange globally and across sec-
       tors, and provide quality training and capacity building
    » Convening and coordination to build partnerships between stakeholders, including
       cross-government, joint programming with development partners to align sup-
       port, and building relationships with international and local practitioners

Recognizing the scale and complexity of addressing climate change in a country with
a rich climatic and geographic diversity such as Tanzania, these instruments can be
tailored to suit diﬀerent contexts and a variety of actors, including central coordi-
nation ministries (for example, the MoF, Vice President’s Oﬃce, and PMO-RALG);
line sectors (for example, agriculture, transport, water, and energy); and subnational

CHAPTER SIX
KEY MESSAGES FOR FINANCING
RESILIENT GROWTH
Tanzania is recognizing the threat of climate change and taking important initial steps
toward building resiliency into economic growth plans and investments. These include
actions on strategic planning through development of climate change strategies as well
as on the ground, with investment projects targeting adaptation and mitigation. How-
ever, these two elements have not yet been aligned, and important gaps exist in direct-
ing ﬁnance toward priority investments that address risks, having a strong evidence
base for investments, and coordination across stakeholders who are instrumental for
implementation.

Local development partners have been the source of the majority of climate funds
resourced by Tanzania and can play an even greater role in supporting the develop-
ment of a comprehensive climate policy, planning, and investment framework that can
take the NCCS and ZCCS forward. These represent an opportunity to strategically
mobilize investment ﬁnancing and knowledge services and build strong partnerships
so that climate resiliency is more eﬀectively promoted to reach Tanzania’s develop-
ment objectives.

Building upon the NCCS and ZCCS, which set forth general priority
themes for climate action, Tanzania must put in place processes and
ﬁnancing structures that meet the considerable challenges of ﬁnancing
and implementation. Strategic decisions must be taken to leverage and use scarce
resources to convert plans into transformational action, learning from past challenges
to deliver large-scale resilience results that will safeguard livelihoods, the economy, and
the environment. This note recommends the following as Tanzania moves forward:
    1. Approach an NCF with realistic expectations. Although Mainland Tanzania and Zan-
        zibar are in the process of establishing dedicated climate change funds, expec-
        tations should be realistic, taking into account the costs of establishing and
        managing such funds, as well as the scope of expected funding sources. Experi-
        ence shows that the time and resources needed to create new funds are high,
        and operational management costs can be substantial. If Tanzania does choose

        of programs developed to support climate action.                that may diﬀer from central government plans.
     2. Build resilience into sector programs for transformational      Although to date this work has been limited to ru-
        impacts. Rather than relying upon a single fund-                ral districts, there may be similar opportunities for

        to incorporate resilience elements into planned in-             priorities. Clearly, Tanzania’s ability to attract
        frastructure investments (for example, to promote               climate ﬁnance at scale will be contingent upon
        green infrastructure that builds urban resilience)              demonstration of results. Toward that aim, a ro-
