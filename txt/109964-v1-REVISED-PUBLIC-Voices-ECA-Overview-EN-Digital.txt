          multi-donor trust fund established in 2012 to strengthen awareness, knowledge,
          and capacity for gender-informed policy making. In addition, it builds on work
          financed by the Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) Trust Fund for FYR
Macedonia, as well as various other country-specific tasks from the Education, Poverty
and Equity and Social Protection and Labor Global Practices, including a task funded by
the Trust Fund for Environmentally and Socially Sustainable Development (TFESSD) on
‘Economic Mobility and Labor Markets in ECA’, a regional task on ‘The Political Economy of
Redistribution, Transfers and Taxes in ECA’, the ‘Gender in the Western Balkans’ Program-
matic Series, a Technical Assistance project on ‘Human Development’ in Kosovo, a ‘Skills
and Migration’ project in Central Asia, a ‘Jobs and Skills Development’ task in Central Asia,
and a task on ‘Meeting the Employment Challenge in the Western Balkans’.

The work was carried out by a multi-sectoral team from the Poverty and Equity and Social
Protection and Labor Global Practices. This report was written by María Eugenia Dávalos
(co-task team leader, Senior Economist, Poverty and Equity Global Practice), Giorgia De-
marchi (Social Scientist, Poverty and Equity Global Practice), Barbara Kits (Consultant),
Isil Oral (Consultant), and Indhira Santos (co-task team leader, Senior Economist, Social
Protection and Labor Global Practice). The team also includes Patti Petesch (Consultant)
who led the design of the data collection instruments as well as their implementation,
and who co-authored a background paper for this report (Petesch and Demarchi, 2015).
The team is grateful for support from Dariga Chukmaitova (Consultant) and Angelica
Thumala (Consultant), instrumental in the implementation of the data collection instru-
ment in Central Asia and in the coding of the qualitative data, respectively.

This report draws on primary qualitative research conducted in nine Europe and Central
Asia (ECA) countries. We are thankful to the authors of the country-specific reports and
local partners who prepared and/or contributed to each of the country reports: PRISM
(Bosnia and Herzegovina), Center for Research and Policy Making (FYR Macedonia), Gor-
bi (Georgia), Index Kosova (Kosovo), BISAM Central Asia (Kazakhstan), M-Vector (Kyrgyz
Republic), IPSOS (Serbia), M-Vector (Tajikistan), and A2F Consulting (Turkey).
