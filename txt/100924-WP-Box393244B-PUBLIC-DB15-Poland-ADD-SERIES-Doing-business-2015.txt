BOX 1.1: Reforming business start-up in Poland—six years in the making
Since 2009 Poland has introduced important changes with the objective of making it easier and less expensive to start a
business. The minimum capital requirement and registration fees were lowered and a one-stop shop for business registra-
tion was set up at the National Court Register (Krajowy Rejestr Sądowy, or KRS). In addition, an online system for registering
limited liability companies with standard articles of association is now available as another option for entrepreneurs (the
“S24” system).
The idea of the one-stop shop was for KRS not only to be in charge of company registration, but also to manage the process
for obtaining the statistical and tax identiﬁcation numbers on behalf of the entrepreneur and register the company with
the Social Insurance Oﬃce. However, the back-oﬃce start-up procedures were not re-engineered. As a result, KRS simply
played the role of a post-oﬃce: receiving paper applications from the entrepreneur and sending them on to the respective
agencies, which, in turn, returned the approved documents, still in paper format. While the reform looked good on paper,
the process continued to take approximately one month—the same as before the reform—casting doubt on whether the
entrepreneur was better oﬀ with the one-stop shop.
In 2012, the online “S24” platform was launched, allowing entrepreneurs to register limited liability companies with the
KRS using standard articles of association without requiring a notary deed. The system not only sharply reduced the cost
of starting a business, but also enabled the processing of applications by KRS in just 1-2 days. Even though entrepreneurs
had to register in person with the statistical, tax and social insurance oﬃces, these direct interactions were almost 3 weeks
faster than going through the one-stop shop. Currently, two years after the launch, approximately 30% of new limited li-
ability companies are set up through the “S24” system, although the uptake varies across cities.1 Challenges remain, which
may be limiting higher uptake. The system is not as user-friendly as it could be—for example, all company founders need
to be logged in simultaneously and applications cannot be saved in draft format. In addition, the registration process is not
fully electronic—applicants still have to pay the civil law transaction tax in-person.
Recent reforms seek to build on both systems and address their limitations (table 1.1).2 Eﬀective December 1, 2014, the new
law on the one-stop shop came into force. Entrepreneurs no longer need to submit separate applications for the tax oﬃce
and statistical oﬃce when registering with the KRS. Instead, the KRS shares information electronically with the National
Register of Taxpayers, which, in turn, shares it with the Statistical Oﬃce and the Social Insurance Oﬃce. The same infor-
mation submitted to KRS is used to generate the statistical and tax identiﬁcation numbers. Users of the “S24” system will
also be able to use the reformed one-stop shop. In addition, a recent legal amendment expands the “S24” system to regis-
tered partnerships and limited partnerships and reduces registration fees and the need to submit the specimen of board
members signatures among other changes to further encourage its use.
It is still too early to assess the impact of the recent reforms on the ease of starting a business across locations in Poland.
Achieving a signiﬁcant time reduction requires that the KRS local court divisions and the other agencies involved in the
start-up process have well-functioning electronic systems. In addition, to reduce delays, the review of applications at the
KRS court divisions will need to become more eﬃcient, as is already the case for the standard articles of association used
by the online “S24” system.

Consistent implementation across locations can be challenging, as the case of Italy illustrates. There, an electronic one-
stop shop connects ﬁve diﬀerent entities involved in business start-up. However, the time to start a business varies signiﬁ-
cantly across cities due to diﬀerent response times at the local level. Also, ensuring that electronic systems work well from
the outset is critical to ensure credibility. In Mexico, the electronic portal tuempresa.gob.mx for business start-up was oﬀ to
a good start, until a glitch suspended the platform for two months in 2012. Despite subsequent improvements to the portal,
the uptake has not recovered, as users favor alternative mechanisms—even if they involve more steps.

       BOX 2.1 Comparing regulations at the local level: subnational Doing Business studies
       The subnational Doing Business studies expand the Doing Business analysis beyond the largest business city of an econo-
       my. They measure variation in regulations or in the implementation of national laws across locations within an economy
       (as in Italy or Colombia) or a region (as in South East Europe or Central America). Projects are undertaken at the request
       and in collaboration with governments.
       Data collected by subnational reports over the past 2 years show that there can be substantial variation within an econ-
       omy. In Mexico in 2013, for example, transferring property took as few as 2 days in Colima and as many as 74 in Mexico

       the Arab Republic of Egypt, 13 cities in Italy and 31 states and Mexico City in Mexico. The worst score shown for each economy is that of the location with the most complex
       process for transferring property, and the best score that of the location with the most eﬃcient one. The 10th and 90th percentile values are based on economy-level scores
       for the 189 economies covered by Doing Business.

       The subnational Doing Business studies create disaggregated data on business regulations. But they go beyond a data
       collection exercise. They have proved to be strong motivators for regulatory reform at the city level:

        The data produced are comparable across locations within the economy and internationally, enabling locations to
         benchmark their results both locally and globally. Comparisons of locations that are within the same economy and
         therefore share the same legal and regulatory framework can be revealing: local oﬃcials ﬁnd it hard to explain why
         doing business is more diﬃcult in their jurisdiction than in a neighboring one.
        Pointing out good practices that exist in some locations but not others within an economy helps policy makers rec-
         ognize the potential for replicating these good practices. This can prompt discussions of regulatory reform across
         diﬀerent levels of government, providing opportunities for local governments and agencies to learn from one another
         and resulting in local ownership and capacity building.
       Since 2005 subnational reports have covered 367 cities in 55 economies, including Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Morocco
       and Pakistan. In 2014, subnational studies were completed in Mexico, Nigeria and more recently in the Central America
       region.

     They can improve the eﬃciency of tax
     administration by adopting the latest
     technologies to facilitate the prepara-
     tion, ﬁling and payment of taxes by
     businesses. And they can undertake
     court reforms to shorten delays in the
     enforcement of contracts. On the other
     hand, some Doing Business indicators
     capture costs that involve private
     sector participants, such as lawyers,
     notaries, architects, electricians or
     freight forwarders—costs over which
     governments may have little inﬂuence
     in the short run.

     are one element of a strategy aimed
     at improving competitiveness and

     are many other important goals to pur-

     public ﬁnances, adequate attention to
     education and training, adoption of the
     latest technologies to boost economic
     productivity and the quality of public
     services, and appropriate regard for air
     and water quality to safeguard people’s
     health. Governments have to decide
     what set of priorities best ﬁts the
     needs they face. To say that govern-

     set of rules for private sector activity
     does not suggest that doing so should
     come at the expense of other worthy
     economic and social goals.

determine the status of a property
in the zoning plan; yet when notaries
still ask for a separate document,
the client is often not informed in
advance about the available options.
Sometimes the client submits an
application for a full extract ﬁrst,
paying a higher fee—only to have to
apply again, this time for the brief
certiﬁcate of the property allocation in
case no spatial development plan has
been approved for the plot in question,
and thus a customized extract of the
Spatial Development Plan is not avail-
able. An added inconvenience is that
the price of the extract is calculated
on the basis of the number of pages.
The client pays an initial deposit of
PLN30 (EUR7) for 5 pages—but needs
to come back to pay the diﬀerence if
the extract is longer. The lack of clar-
ity about which type of document is
needed, as well as the lack of guidance,
can explain many delays.

A better-informed client could help
improve the eﬃciency of the process.
Customer feedback surveys are an
eﬀective way to evaluate overall sat-
isfaction with a public service.42 Once
customer satisfaction measurement
has been introduced, the results can
be used to highlight both areas of
good performance and areas in need
of improvement.43 Learning from cus-
tomers not only allows improvements
in overall satisfaction with the service
delivery, but also can ultimately re-
duce costs and delays.

   BOX 6.1 The makeover of the komornik
   Ten years ago, enforcing a judgment in Warsaw took 180 days—among Europe’s slowest.1 It now takes 145 days in
   Warsaw and 90 days in Olsztyn and Gorzów Wielkopolski. The average duration of enforcement proceedings in Poland is
   now 132 days, which is close to the EU average of 119 days. The liberalization of the bailiﬀ profession by the Polish govern-
   ment has been instrumental to this. The Polish bailiﬀs, the komorniks, have undergone an overhaul that started in 1997,
   when Poland went from a system of public enforcement agents to private bailiﬀs. In 2007, the Act on Court Bailiﬀs and
   Debt Collection introduced further fundamental changes.2

   A cornerstone of the 2007 act is what is known in Poland as the “right of choice.” Prior to this, a creditor was obliged to
   retain a bailiﬀ registered in the same region as the debtor’s assets. The 2007 act allowed for territorial competition: a
   creditor can choose the bailiﬀ irrespective of location.3 The profession was also rendered more competitive by reducing
   barriers to entry: the total number of registered bailiﬀs can now be increased by the Ministry of Justice without consulting
   the National Bailiﬀ Association. This resulted in a dramatic rise in the number of enforcement agents—a 65.5% increase
   between 2006 (prior to the 2007 Act) and 2012.4 The trend has continued, and as of August 2014 there are 1,296 bailiﬀs
   registered in Poland.5
   The Ministry of Justice closely monitors the bailiﬀs’ performance. If the backlog of cases of a particular bailiﬀ exceeds
   six months, the bailiﬀ cannot take cases outside of his or her region. Monitoring of timeframes, and fees to bailiﬀs being
   payable only upon successful liquidation of assets, constitute strong incentives for bailiﬀs to perform.
   And the future? Poland is currently committed to speeding up the execution of judgments. Additional measures to boost
   performance have recently been signed into law by the President. Bailiﬀs that handle more than 5,000 cases a year and
   that have low eﬃciency rates, as well as those handling more than 10,000 cases a year, have to decline to take new
   cases from outside their region.6 A bill currently before Parliament will allow for e-auctions of debtors’ movable assets
   through an electronic system provided by the district courts and the exchange of legal correspondence via electronic
   means. E-auctions are expected to reduce the need to hold multiple physical auctions by reaching out to a wider market
   of potential buyers.
