Executive Summary
Program Rationale
1. The overall objective of the SDGs is to overcome poverty and save the planet. To meet the
   SDGs, total incremental investment needs in developing countries through 2030 are
   estimated at US$1.5 to US$2.5 trillion per year, of which US$800 billion to US$ 1.4 trillion
   (or about 60%) from private sources. At US$ 22 trillion per year, the world has adequate
   savings to finance private investments in the SDGs, but to date private financing directed
   towards sustainable development remains vastly insufficient. This is particularly the case for
   achieving the SDGs of growth and employment (SDG8), resilient infrastructure (SDG9), and
   climate mitigation and adaptation (SDG13). This raises the critical challenge on how to
   mobilize financing for SMEs and infrastructure investments to support growth, job creation,
   and climate mitigation and adaptation in emerging markets and developing countries
   (EMDEs).

2. Globally, young SMEs are the primary source of job creation. Access of young patenting
   firms to seed and early stage venture capital is critical to finance innovation. Access by firms
   to private equity at all stages of their development from start-up through growth to pre-IPO
   has a major impact on innovation, productivity, employment creation and competitiveness.
   However to date the penetration of private equity and venture capital remains low across
   many EMDEs, and the private equity financing gap in EMDEs is estimated at US$ 270
   billion in 2014.

3. Globally, infrastructure investments have a strong impact on growth: a 1 percent increase in
   physical infrastructure stocks temporarily raises GDP growth by as much as 1-2 percentage
   points. Physical infrastructure in roads and telecommunications facilitates spatial access and
   information flows, raising labor productivity, boosting rural incomes and reducing poverty.
   Broad access to electricity leads to increased overall productivity, rising female employment,
   as well as more time to study and increased use of computers. Better transportation systems
   and safer roads raise school attendance. The investments in large infrastructure required to
   achieve the SDGs are estimated at US$ 900 billion to US$ 1.6 trillion per year through 2030.

4. Required investments in climate mitigation and adaptation are estimated at US$ 440 billion
   to US$ 780 billion per year over the same period. Adaptation investments are part of a
   broader set of resilience investments to be undertaken under comprehensive disaster risk
   management (DRM) strategies. These encompass a broad range of resilience infrastructure
   investments by governments, business investments by enterprises, and community and
   individual investments by households. Resilience investments yield a triple dividend,
   avoiding losses, unlocking suppressed economic potential, and generating co-benefit through
   increased employment opportunities in environmental services, value chain development in
   protected areas, and improved access to services through improved resilience of transport
   networks. Climate mitigation efforts face the challenge of designing more powerful incentive
   schemes to attract private capital, including investment funds, to clean energy research,

                                                 2
   development and deployment. In addition to environmental tax policy, this requires
   investment incentives that bring the risk-return trade-off for private investors within the
   commercial realm for a larger range of clean energy investments.

5. A significant part of large infrastructure investments for growth, climate mitigation and
   adaptation are expected to be undertaken on balance sheet by national and sub-national
   governments as part of their public investment programs, and financed through taxation or
   sovereign and sub-sovereign borrowing. However, due to fiscal constraints, about 55% of
   these investments will need to be undertaken through PPP projects and financed from private
   commercial sources, at a cost of US$ 591 billion to US$ 1.3 trillion per year through 2030.

6. Private equity and debt funds can play a critical role in mobilizing resources from
   international and domestic institutional investors for the financing of SMEs and resilient
   infrastructure, as well as for climate adaptation and mitigation investments in EMDEs.

7. Globally, private equity (PE) assets under management have grown rapidly over the last
   decade, reaching US$ 3.8 trillion in 2014, of which about 10 percent are invested in EMDEs.
   The investor base for PE funds is broad-based and includes public and private pension funds,
   insurance companies, high net-worth individuals and family offices, private foundations,
   government agencies and Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs). Following the international
   financial crisis, venture capital (VC) funds have rebounded sharply following the
   international financial crisis, with new fundraising reaching about US$ 50 billion in 2014.
   VC funds now finance a broad range of SMEs, from angel deals to various rounds of VC
   funding in a broad range of sectors including internet, healthcare, IT and clean technology. In
   recent years, private debt funds have also emerged to complement bank lending to enterprises
   that has been constrained by regulatory pressures and deleveraging.

8. Over the past ten years, a new class of PE and debt funds has emerged that are dedicated to
   infrastructure investments, with assets under management reaching US$ 296 billion in 2014 .
   The share of infrastructure equity and debt funds in emerging markets has increased steadily,
   reaching 10% of the total. The investor base encompasses a broad range of investors,
   including superannuation schemes, endowment plans, public and private pension funds,
   foundations, and asset managers. Infrastructure funds have consistently outperformed other
   private equity firms over the 2007-2014 period.

9. The development of PE and debt funds for SMEs, infrastructure, as well as climate
   mitigation and adaptation finance in EMDEs depends on three key pillars: (i) developing the
   PE/VC ecosystem; (ii) developing the framework for infrastructure PPPs; and (iii)
   developing Strategic Investment Funds (SIFs) and the domestic investment component of
   SWFs as anchor investors for international and domestic institutional investors in domestic
   projects and funds.

   (i)     Developing PE/VC ecosystems

10. The establishment of an efficient and transparent legal and regulatory framework is a critical
    element for the development of the PE/VC industry. This encompasses the broad legal and
    regulatory framework for the operations of off-shore and on-shore funds in the country, as
    well as the legal and regulatory framework for the domestic registration and supervision of
    on-shore funds. The second element is the legal and regulatory environment for investments
    by institutional investors, including pension funds and insurance companies, in the PE/VC
    asset class, both under rules-based and risk-based regulatory systems. The third element is
    the business enabling environment, encompassing a number of supply-side and demand-side
    policies. Supply-side policies include tax credits, seed funds that co-invest with qualified
    angel investor groups, and technical assistance and training for angel investor groups, as well
    as hybrid (public-private) funds to stimulate equity finance to early-stage enterprises and
    technical assistance funds to support VC funds reaching down to smaller deal sizes. Demand-
    side measures include entrepreneurship training and support to the development of a network
    of business incubators and accelerators linked with research centers and with angel investor
    groups and VC funds.


   (ii)    Developing frameworks for infrastructure PPPs

11. The development of a comprehensive framework for the delivery of the PPP program is
    critical to mobilize private equity and debt funds for infrastructure finance in a country,
    including clean energy and other climate mitigation or adaptation infrastructure. This
    includes framework objectives, scope, legal and administrative instruments, procedures and
    decision criteria, procedures for management of unsolicited proposals, and contract
    management including contract renegotiations. The preparation cost of PPP transactions
    ranges from 2-3% in middle-income countries that already have experience with PPPs, to
    3%- 10% of total project costs in new sectors in low-income countries. To overcome this
    constraint, several governments are considering the establishment of infrastructure PPP
    project venture funds, responsible for managing all stages of the preparation of PPP
    transactions up to financial close and taking an equity and/or mezzanine stake in the PPP
    project SPV.


   (iii)   Developing SIFs and the domestic investment component of SWFs

12. The third pillar is the development of SIFs and of the domestic investment component of
    SWFs, to serve as anchor investors for domestic and international institutional investors in
    domestic projects and funds. A number of SWFs established since the 1990s have been set up
    to undertake strategic domestic investments, starting with Malaysia’s Khazanah and
    continuing since 2000 with several oil or mineral-based funds in the Gulf and in Africa. In
    parallel with increased allocation by oil or mineral-based SWFs to domestic investments, a

                                                4
   growing number of EMDEs are establishing SIFs, funded by fiscal surpluses, borrowing, or
   other non-resource revenues, to serve as anchor investors for domestic and international
   institutional investors, including international private equity and debt funds interested in
   investing in the domestic economy. SWFs that invest domestically and SIFs take on very
   similar roles, investing for a combined financial and economic return in infrastructure PPP
   projects, SME funds and SOE investment or turnaround projects.


Program Activities
13. The Investment Funds Group delivers the Program through a mix of global and sub-regional
    and country engagements.

14. Global engagements include (i) management of the investment funds Community of Practice,
    including a private equity/venture capital C4D platform jointly managed with the Emerging
    Market Private Equity Association (EMPEA) and a SWF C4D platform jointly managed with
    the Fletcher Network for Sovereign Wealth and Global Capital; (ii) co-management with
    Treasury (TRE) of the SWF Corporate Secretariat and Advisory Group, (iii) preparation of a
    global review of SIFs, in partnership with the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility
    (PPIAF); (iv) preparation of guidelines for the design of SIFs, in partnership with PPIAF;
    and (v) co-management with the Sustainable Urban, Rural and Resilience Global Practice
    (SURR GP) of a feasibility study for a Global Resilience Investment Fund (GRIF), in
    partnership with the Global Fund for Disaster Relief and Recovery (GFDRR)/Disaster Risk
    Finance and Insurance (DRFI) window.

15. Sub-regional and country engagements are driven by country demand, internal partnerships
    across IFC, World Bank Global Practices (GPs), Cross-Cutting Sector Areas (CCSAs) and
    TRE, external partnerships with Governments through reimbursable advisory services
    (RAS), and with donors through multi-donor and bilateral trust funds, and line of sight (LSI)
    lending or guarantee operations aimed at achieving monitorable performance indicators
    towards the three SDGs of growth and employment, resilient infrastructure, and climate
    mitigation and adaptation. These engagements are structured around three business lines: (i)
    development of PE/VC ecosystems; (ii) development of SWFs in resource-rich LICs; and
    (iii) development of SIFs.in EMDEs.

Investment Funds for Development Program - Background Concept Note




16. The objective of this Note is to discuss the development objective, intermediate outcomes,
    strategic relevance, program context/description, program risks, roles of clients and partners,
    and dissemination and outreach strategy for the Investment Funds for Development program
    managed by the Investment Funds Group team in Fin4Dev.

I: Development objective
17. The development objective of the Investment Funds for Development (IFD) program is to
    enable EMDE governments and regional economic communities to create the conditions
    to mobilize investment fund resources for SMEs and infrastructure finance, with the
    objective to contribute to the achievement of the SDGs of growth and employment (SDG8),
    resilient infrastructure (SDG9), and climate adaptation and mitigation (SDG13).

II: Intermediate outcomes
18. The program will have the following intermediate outcomes:

   (i)     Increase in penetration of private equity and venture capital assets under management
           (AUM) invested in EMDEs by 10% by 2020

   (ii)    Increase in private equity and debt funds AUM invested in infrastructure in EMDEs
           by 10% by 2020

   (iii)   Increase private equity and debt funds assets AUM invested in climate mitigation and
           adaptation in EMDEs by 15% by 2020

III Strategic relevance
19. The overall objective of the SDGs is to overcome poverty and save the planet. Following
    developments in the global economy over the last decade, large amounts of investable
    resources, mostly private, are available in advanced and emerging economies (See IMF-
    World Bank op.cit, 2015). To meet the SDGs, total incremental investment needs in
    developing countries through 2030 are estimated at US$ 1.5 to US$2.5 trillion per year, of
    which US$800 billion to US$ 1.4 trillion (or about 60%) from private sources. At $ 22
    trillion per year, the world has adequate savings to finance the private investments in the
    SDGs, but to date private financing directed towards sustainable development remains vastly
    insufficient (See Sachs et..al, op.cit, 2015).


                                                 6
20. This is particularly the case for achieving the SDGs of growth and employment (SDG8),
    resilient infrastructure (SDG9), and climate adaptation and mitigation (SDG13). This raises
    the question on how to mobilize investment funds for financing SMEs that are prime
    contributors to job creation and growth, and for financing infrastructure and climate
    adaptation and mitigation investments.


   (i)     Role of investment funds in SME finance for growth and employment

21. Globally, young SMEs are the primary source of job creation. A recent OECD study across
    18 countries over the 2001-2011 period shows that young SMEs (less than 5 years), although
    representing on average 17% of employment, contribute 42% of total job creation and only
    22% of all job destruction, making them net job creators. By contrast, older SMEs are
    generally net job destroyers. The disproportionate contribution of young firms to
    employment creation holds across all economies, sectors and years considered (See
    Criscuolo, Gal and Menon, op cit. 2014). A similar relationship was found by a World Bank
    study in India, which showed a strong positive correlation between entrepreneurship and job
    growth across Indian states between 1989 and 2005 (See Ghani, E. , W. Kerr and S. D.
    O’Connell, op.cit. 2015).

22. Access of young firms to finance varies greatly across countries. A recent OECD study
    across 23 OECD countries over the 2003-2010 period shows that resource flows to patenting
    firms tend to be stronger in countries with more developed financial markets, and this effect
    is particularly important for young firms. In particular, resources flow more freely to young
    patenting firms in countries with more developed markets for seed and early-stage venture
    capital. Access to seed and early stage venture capital therefore plays an important role for
    ensuring the growth of young patenting firms and the development of radical innovations.
    Specifically, the study shows that increasing access to early stage venture capital from the
    lowest level to the average of the sample implies that capital flows to patenting firms would
    be 30% higher than otherwise (See Andrews, Criscuolo and Menon, op.cit. 2014).

23. More broadly, increasing access of firms to private equity at all stages of their development
    from venture through growth to pre-IPO has a major impact on innovation, productivity,
    employment creation and competitiveness. A recent EVCA study showed that patents
    granted to private equity-backed companies tend to be more economically significant than
    patterns on average, with evidence from the US suggesting that private equity participation
    increases the number of citations of a patent by 25%. The study also shows that private
    equity-backing improves the operating performance of portfolio companies by 4.5% to 8.5%
    during the first three years after investment, and that private equity participation leads to
    improved productivity as measured by EBITDA per employee of 6.9% on average. The study
    also shows that private equity-backed firms are more focused on internationalization by
    comparison with other firms (See Frontier Economics Europe, op.cit. 2013)



                                                7
24. Globally, private equity funds assets under management (AUM) have grown rapidly over the
    last ten years, reaching US$ 3.8 trillion in 2014 (See figure 1). The boom period from 2004
    to 2007 was followed by a flattening out of AUM following the international financial crisis
    in 2008. The crisis resulted in a sharp decline in exit activity between 2008 and 2010,
    resulting in increases in unrealized values, lower capital returned to investors, and a more
    competitive fund raising environment. Since then, exit activity has increased, translating into
    higher levels of distributions and an upturn in new funds commitments, with global AUM
    breaking the US$ 3 trillion mark in 2012.

25. By type of fund, buyout funds are the leading asset class with 37% of global dry powder in
    2013, followed by real estate funds (17%), venture capital funds (11%) and infrastructure
    funds (9%). However, the last ten years have witnessed a significant transformation among
    asset classes. Between 2004 and 2013, the share of buyout funds declined from 43% to 37%
    and the share of venture capital funds was halved, dropping from 23% to 11%. By contrast,
    the share of infrastructure funds increased from 3% to 9%, and the share of growth funds
    increased from 2% to 7% over the same period.

26. In terms of exits, after peaking at US$ 266 billion in 2007, private equity-backed exits
    dropped sharply following the international financial crisis in 2008, reaching a low of US$

                                                                          8
                                   82 billion in 2009. Starting in 2010 however, exits rebounded sharply and broke the US$ 300
                                   billion mark in 2013. Among exit strategies, trade sales represented 51% of exit transactions
                                   in 2013, followed by sales to general partners (26%), and IPOs (19%).

27. The investor base of PE funds has undergone significant transformation over the last six
    years. Between 2009 and 2011, the largest investors were public pension funds, averaging
    28% of the total, followed by fund of funds (13%) and endowment plans (8%). By contrast,
    over the 2012-2014 period, the share of public pension funds and of endowment plans
    dropped to 22% and 6% respectively, while the share of high-net-worth individuals, private
    sector pension funds and insurance companies, increased from 3% to 10%, from 7% to 10%
    and from 6% to 12%respectively. At the same time, the share of fund of funds managers
    remained stable.

28. In terms of performance, private equity horizon IRRs outperformed major market indices,
    generating a return of 21.7% at the 10 year 2013 horizon. However, this performance was
    driven primarily by buyout funds, while venture capital funds underperformed major market
    indices at those horizons. As of mid-2013, buyout funds generated a 10-year horizon return
    of 25.5%, compared to 4.5% for venture capital, 7.3% for the S&P 500 and 13.7% percent
    for the MSCI emerging markets.

29. Following the international financial crisis in 2008, private debt funds have emerged as a
    rapidly increasing asset class. Mezzanine funds represented 42% of private debt fund
    managers established since 2008, compared to 23% of direct lending and almost equal share
    of distressed debt funds (16%) and special situations funds (15%). In particular in Europe,
    the deleveraging of banks following regulatory pressures to replenish support funds and to
    recapitalize in the wake of the international financial crisis created opportunities for third
    parties to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns by acquiring loans and providing liquidity
    to the banking sector.

30. Venture capital deals are a good proxy to evaluate the contribution of private equity and debt
    funds to SME development.

31. After reaching a peak of US$ 52 billion in 2008, venture capital fundraising dropped
    significantly following the international financial crisis. Fundraising rebounded significantly
    in 2011 to US$ 42 billion followed by decrease in 2012 and 2013, and significant increase to

32. By geographical area, the main areas of focus are North America, with 55% of global dry
    powder in 2013, followed by Europe (25 %) and Asia (15%). In recent years, PE investments
    have increased rapidly in EMDEs, reaching US$ 34.7 billion in 2014 (See figure 5) with
    emerging Asia leading with 77% of total EMDE investments (mainly driven by China and
    India), followed by Latin America, with 12% (mainly driven by Brazil), Sub-Saharan Africa
    (5.9%) and Central and Eastern Europe (2.8%).

33. Despite this positive evolution, the penetration of private equity and venture capital remains
    low across EMDEs to date. Private equity investment to GDP were at or below 0.2 percent of
    GDP across EMDEs in 2014, compared to 1.84% in Israël, 1.23% in the USA, and 0.81% in
    the US. The EMDE private equity financing gap is estimated at US$ 270 billion in 2014
    (World Bank staff estimates).

   (ii)    Role of investment funds in resilient infrastructure and climate mitigation and
           adaptation finance

34. Infrastructure is critical for promoting economic growth and social inclusion and for climate
   mitigation and adaptation.

35. There is widespread empirical evidence that infrastructure investments have a positive
    impact on growth. While the magnitude of the estimates vary greatly across empirical
    studies, growth regressions using infrastructure stocks almost invariably find significant
    growth effects: a 1 percent increase in physical infrastructure stocks temporarily raises GDP
    growth by as much as 1-2 percentage points, although the growth acceleration gradually
    tapers off as the economy approaches its long-run per capita income (See Calderon and
    Serven, op.cit, 2014). Some studies also find that physical infrastructure in roads and
    communications facilitates spatial access and information flows, raising labor mobility
    boosting rural non-farm economies, and reducing the incidence of poverty in some
    geographic areas. Recent studies on the roll-out of the electricity grid in South Africa show
    that electrification leads to rising female employment, with women working nearly 9 hours
    more per week in districts that experienced an average increase in electrification. Other
    studies show that better road transportation systems and safer roads help raise school
    attendance, while improved access to electricity allows more time to study and the use of
    computers (See Calderon and Serven, op.ci. 2014). The investments in large infrastructure

                                                  12
   required to achieve the SDGs are estimated at US$900 billion to US$1.6 trillion per year
   through 2030 (See Sachs et. al, op.cit, 2015).

36. Investments in climate mitigation and adaptation are estimated at US$440 billion to US$780
    billion per year over the same period. Investments in climate mitigation required to limit the
    rise in average global temperatures to no more than 2 degrees Celsius relative to pre-
    industrial levels (agreed at the UNFCCC in Cancun in 2010) are estimated to range from
    US$380 billion to US$680 billion per year through 2030 (See Sachs et. al, op.cit 2015).
    Investments in climate adaptation required to adapt to a 2 degrees Celsius warmer world are
    estimated in the range of US$70 billion to US$100 billion per year through 2050 (See World
    Bank, op.cit, 2010).

37. Energy production and use account for around two thirds of global greenhouse-gas (GHG)
    emissions. As of mid-October 2015, more than 150 countries accounting for around 90% of
    global economic activity and almost 90% of global energy-related GHG emissions have
    submitted national climate pledges (Intended Nationally Determined Contributions - INDCs).
    If the INDCs are implemented fully, they will help to achieve the necessary decoupling
    between growth and energy-related GHG emissions. The full implementation of INDCs will
    require the energy sector to invest US$13.5 trillion in energy efficiency and low-carbon
    technologies over the 2015-2030 period, representing almost 40% of total energy sector
    investment. Within this total, around US$8.3 trillion is needed to improve energy efficiency
    in the transport, buildings and industry sectors, while much of the remaining investments are
    required to decarbonize the power sector (See IEA, op. cit 2015).

38. However, the implementation of the INDCs will result in an average temperature increase of
    around 2.7 degree Celsius by 2100, falling short of the UNFCCC goal. Additional measures
    required to achieve the 2 degree Celsius goal (the IEA “Bridge scenario”) include improving
    energy efficiency in the industry, buildings and transport sectors, phasing out the use of least-
    efficient coal-fired power plants, further boosting investments in renewables-based power
    generation technologies, gradually phasing-out fuel subsidies, and reducing methane
    emissions from oil and gas production. This would translate into additional US$3 trillion (or
    20%) of cumulative investments in energy efficiency and low-carbon technologies through
    2030 (See figure 6 below).

39. Adaptation costs vary significantly across climate scenarios, Overall, the drier scenario
    (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization – CSIRO) requires lower
    adaptation costs compared to adaptation costs of under the wetter scenario (National Center
    for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). Adaptation costs also vary considerable across regions.
    They are higher as a percentage of GDP in Sub-Saharan Africa in part because of the
    region’s lower GDP, but also because the higher cost of adaptation for water resources (See
    World Bank, op.cit, 2010). By sector, adaptation costs are estimated at US$ 28.5 billion per
    year for coastal zones, US$ 27.5 billion per year for infrastructure, and USS14.4 billion per
    year for water supply and flood protection under the NCAR scenario (See table 1 below).

New Methods and Estimates, WB 2010) in which these costs stood at $7.6Billion for the NCAR and $7.3Billion for
the CSIRO scenarios. The current costs are estimated as the difference in public spending in the scenario with
climate change and adaptation as compared to the no climate change scenario, and use the same methodology as has
been applied to the other sectors. In WB 2010, the costs were incorrectly reported as reflecting the difference in
public spending in the scenario with climate change and adaptation as compared to the scenario with climate change
but no adaptation. The difference lowers the EACC lower bound estimate of the global cost of adaptation from US$
75 billion reported in WB 2010 to US$ 71.2 billion per year, rounded to US$ 70 billion per year.

40. More broadly, adaptation investments are part of a broader set of resilience investments to be
    undertaken under comprehensive disaster risk management (DRM) strategies. Resilience
    investments encompass a vast array of infrastructure investments by governments, business
    investments by enterprises, and community and individual investments by households.
    Resilience infrastructure investments undertaken by governments include flood protection
    structures, community shelters, improved water supply systems, construction of drainage
    pipes, rehabilitation and construction of resilient public buildings, rehabilitation and
    construction of resilient energy facilities and transport systems, and installation of more
    resilient wireless communications. Resilience business investments by enterprises include
    investments in operational resilience (both on site and through relocation), and investments
    in the development of the resilience products and services value chains, including production
    of resilient construction materials, collection, recycling and reuse of waste materials, design
    and installation of micro water harvesting systems, design and installation of household solar
    energy systems, and design and delivery of disaster risk management services, including
    digital platforms for disaster risk information monitoring and dissemination. Community
    investments by households include resilient community facilities, community-based flood
    protection systems and resilient food storage facilities. Individual investments by households
    include resilient housing and solar energy. Access by governments, enterprises and
    households to disaster risk insurance instruments further enhances the contribution of these
    investments to society’s resilience to disasters (See Jha and others, 2013a and b, op,cit).

41. Investing in resilience as part of comprehensive disaster risk management (DRM) strategies
   yields a triple dividend in EMDEs. First, investment in resilience avoids losses by saving
   lives, reducing infrastructure damages, and reducing economic losses. Second, it unlocks
   suppressed economic potential and stimulates economic activity through encouraging
   households to save and build assets, promoting entrepreneurship and stimulating firms to
   invest and innovate. Third, resilience investments yield co-benefits through generating
   employment opportunities in environmental services, stimulating the development of value
   chains in protected areas, and improving access to employment and services through
   improved resilience of transport networks (See GFDRR, op cit., 2015). Resilience
   investments are on the critical path to achieving the twin goals of poverty eradication and
   shared prosperity, and play a central role in climate change adaptation.

42. A significant part of large infrastructure investments for growth, climate mitigation and
    adaptation and resilience are expected to be undertaken on balance sheet by national and sub-
    national governments as part of their public investment programs and financed through
    taxation or through sovereign or sub-sovereign borrowing. These public investments are
    estimated at US$398 billion to US$844 billion per year for large infrastructure and at
    US$140 billion to US$225 billion per year for climate adaptation and mitigation. Given fiscal
    constraints, the remaining investments will need to be undertaken off-government balance
    sheet through PPP SPVs financed through commercial sources. These investments amount to
    US$291 billion to US$755 billion per year for large infrastructure, or 47% of the total, and
    from US$300 billion to US$564 billion per year for climate adaptation and mitigation, or
    72% of the total. Overall, 55% of large infrastructure and climate adaptation and mitigation
    investments will need to be undertaken through PPP projects and financed from private
    commercial sources, at a cost of US$591 billion to US$1.3 trillion per year through 2030

43. With global savings of $ 22 trillion per year and high levels of liquidity, there would appear
    to be ample capital to finance these investments. However, there is a growing mismatch
    between long-term investment needs and short-term finance, particularly for infrastructure.
    This mismatch is particularly acute in lower middle-income and low-income countries. While
    long-term lending (above five years) represents 41% of bank lending in high-income
    countries, it constitutes 24% of bank lending in upper middle-income countries and only
    12% in low income and lower-middle income countries (See Sachs, 0-.cit.2015 and figure 7
    below)

44. Institutional investors in OECD member states hold over US$79 trillion in AUMs but have
    only about 1 percent of their portfolio directly invested in infrastructure assets. In addition,
    the vast majority of these investments are concentrated in their home markets (See Inderst
    and Stewart, op.cit, 2014). In recent years, there have been increasing investments by EMDE
    pension funds in infrastructure. Of the 33 pension funds that reported infrastructure
    investments in 2013, 10 are from EMDEs (See Inderst and Stewart, op.cit, 2014 and OECD,
    op.cit, 2013). These funds invested US$22.3 billion in infrastructure, or 5.7% of total AUM
    in 2013. Investments in listed infrastructure equity amounted to 2.5% of total AUM,
    compared to 2.0% for listed debt equity and 1.3% for unlisted equity. More recently, EMDE
    pension funds have demonstrated an interest for investing in infrastructure funds (See para 34
    and box 1 below).

45. Globally, the past ten years have witnessed the emergence of a new class of private equity
    and debt funds dedicated to infrastructure investments. Starting from a very low base of US$
    17 billion in 2004, AUM of unlisted infrastructure funds have increased steadily to reach
    US$296 billion globally in mid-2014. The growth of the fund class continued through the
    financial crisis, albeit at a slower pace in 2009 and 2010. Following the international
    financial crisis in 2008, infrastructure debt funds have developed as a small but increasing
    fund class. While an average of 5 new infrastructure debt funds were raised per year over the
    2005-2009 period, the number of funds raised has increased to 20 in 2013, with an aggregate
    capital raised of US$7.5 billion in that year.

46. Over the period, the share of infrastructure funds’ investments in emerging markets has
    increased rapidly, reaching 10% of the total in 2013. By industry, the largest sector is
    renewable energy, which represented 33% to 41% of the total over the 2008-2014 period,
    followed by utilities (12% to 20%), transport (13% to 19%), social infrastructure (8% to
    18%), and energy (8% to 15%) (See figure 9 below).

49. Since 2009, infrastructure debt funds have emerged rapidly albeit from a low base. As of
    January 2015, a record number of infrastructure debt funds were on the road, with aggregate
    capital sought increasing by 51% compared to 2014, with 31 funds seeking an aggregate US$
    22.7 billion, compared to 20 funds targeting US$ 15 billion in January 2014 (See figure 12
    below). Among infrastructure funds providing debt financing, 38% are solely debt-focused
    IDFs, while the remaining 62% make both debt and equity investments. Recent examples
    include the Vantage Capital Green X Infrastructure Debt Fund launched as part of the
    Renewable Energy IPP Procurement Process in South Africa in 2013 (See box 1 below), and
    the Credicorp Capital/Sura Asset Management Fund launched as part of the Fourth
    Generation Concession Program (FCP 4G) in Colombia in 2015, with the participation of
    IFC.
50. Infrastructure debt fund investments in clean energy projects may be supported by a range of
    multilateral and private fund mechanisms that have been established to help increase
    investment in the clean energy sector. This includes multilateral funds that leverage and
    crowd in private financing in the sector such as the Green Climate Fund, the Climate
    Investment Funds, and other multilateral mechanisms such as the Global Environmental
    Facility (GEF), as well as regional initiatives such as the Multilateral Investment Fund. On
    the private sector side, the main mode of engagement has been through green bonds. The IFC
    is leading the way in this space, and well-known investors in IFC’s issuance include

                                                                                                                             20
     Blackrock, State Street Global Advisors, and CalPERS. Several standards for green bonds
     exists, including the Climate Bonds Standard, established by the Climate Bonds Initiative,
     and the voluntary Green Bond Principles, created to reflect the commitment of large
     investment banks such as JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citi, HSBC,
     Morgan Stanley, and many others.

Box 1: The rise of infrastructure private equity and debt funds focused on Africa

 Over the last ten years, the number of unlisted infrastructure funds with Africa as the main fund
 focus has grown rapidly, reaching 36 in 2014 (see Graph B1). As a result, unlisted infrastructure
 funds primarily focused on Africa had approximately US$7.5 billion of AUM at the end of 2014.
 In addition, US$1.9 billion was being raised for this asset class (see Graph B2). The growth was
 fastest in the 2006-07 period, before the global financial crisis, and again in the post-crisis period
 with record high numbers in year 2014.

 The vast majority of active investors in African infrastructure pursue unlisted routes to market.
 While almost half of the investors access African infrastructure directly, only small portion of

                                                               21
them pursue listed investment strategies. As a result, currently there are only 2 listed, Africa-
focused, infrastructure funds active.

Box 2: The South Africa Green X Infrastructure Debt Fund

    1. The Vantage GreenX Fund (GreenX) was launched as an infrastructure debt fund by Vantage
       Capital Group in South Africa in November 2013. The fund first close (Note I) raised ZAR 2.5
       billion entirely from South African pension and provident funds. The fund invests in senior
       debt in energy and renewable energy projects in South Africa.

    2. GreenX Note I focuses on deals that are structured along limited recourse project finance
       principles. Investments under Note I focus on projects that have been successful in the South
       Africa Department of Energy Renewable Energy IPP Procurement Process (REIPPPP). These
       projects include solar plants and wind plants in the provinces of Eastern Cape, Northern Cape
       and Mpumalanga. Note I focuses on refinancing of bank debt on the secondary market and is
       now fully invested.

    3. Vantage Capital is now raising GreenX Note II, which will have a wider remit. In addition to
       projects under REIPPPP, Note II will also target investments in sustainable energy projects
       which will include natural gas and cogeneration projects run by the South Africa Department
       of Energy. By contrast with Note I, Note II is targeted at primary finance and aims to enter
       deals post selection as preferred bidder but before financial close.

IV: Program context/description
IV.1 Program context
51. The development of PE and debt funds for SME and infrastructure finance in EMDEs
    depends on three key pillars: (i) developing the PE/VC ecosystem; (ii) developing the
    framework for infrastructure PPPs; and (iii) developing Strategic Investment Funds (SIFs)
    and the domestic investment component of Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) as anchor
    investors for international and domestic institutional investors.


IV.1.1 Developing the PE/VC ecosystem


   (i)     Legal and regulatory framework

52. The establishment of an efficient and transparent legal and regulatory framework is the first
    element for the development of the PE/VC industry in EMDEs. This encompasses the broad
    legal and regulatory framework for operations of off-shore and on-shore funds in the country,
    as well as the legal and regulatory framework for the domestic registration and supervision of
    on-shore funds.

53. The broad legal and regulatory framework for off-shore and on-shore fund operations in the
    country includes tax treatment (tax residency for foreign investment funds, tax implications
    of alternative fund legal structures, capital gains tax, withholding tax, tax efficiency for
    foreign investors in domestic funds, and double taxation agreements (DTAs)), investor
    protection (minority shareholder rights in investee companies, investors in funds), restrictions
    on issue or transfer of shares, buyout regulations (public auction, listed companies),
    protection of intellectual property rights, bankruptcy procedures and creditor rights/partner
    liability, exits (listing rules on main stock exchange and on SME exchange), exchange
    controls (inward investments, outward transfers of profits and capital gains), corporate
    governance requirements for listed companies, and contract enforcement (court system,
    dispute resolution framework) (See LAVCA, op. cit., 2013).

54. The legal and regulatory framework for the domestic registration and supervision of on-shore
    funds covers fund and fund manager laws and regulations, including fund legal structures
    (including fund compartments), qualified assets, qualified investors, management company
    legal structure, qualification and disclosure of persons who conduct the business of the
    management company, disclosure and resolution of conflicts of interest, delegation of core
    manager functions, own funds, asset valuation rules, contents of fund prospectus, disclosure
    to investors, auditing, reporting, depositary rules, cooperation with the supervisory agency,
    and penalties for non-compliance.




                                                24
   (ii)    Environment for investment by institutional investors in the asset class

55. The second element for the development of the PE/VC funds in EMDEs is the environment
    for investment by institutional investors, including pension funds and insurance companies,
    in the asset class.

56. Across many EMDEs, regulators apply a rules-based approach to the regulation of pension
    funds and insurance companies, which includes the setting of fixed upper or lower limits on
    portfolio allocations to specific investment instruments. For example, among 28 on-OECD
    countries that responded to the OECD annual survey of investment regulation of pension
    funds, only 3 countries had no limits on pension fund allocation to private investment funds,
    13 had limits, and 12 did not allow investment in the asset class (See OECD, op. cit., 2014a).

57. At the same time, in a growing number of EMDEs, regulators are developing and
    implementing multi-year roadmaps towards risk-based supervision of institutional investors,
    which imply the progressive removal of asset allocation limits and their replacement by
    allocations based on external or internal portfolio optimization models. This opens the door
    for greater investment by institutional investors in the private equity and debt asset class as
    part of their portfolio optimization strategies.

58. For pension funds, international best practice for the risk-based regulatory framework is the
    benchmark portfolio approach. In this framework, a body independent from the government
    and separate from the fund management industry establishes a target objective for pension
    funds. This objective is expressed in terms of the replacement rate, ie the expected pension
    income expressed as a percentage of final salary. Given the target replacement rate and the
    level of contribution to the funds, a target return asset and a benchmark portfolio established
    with the maximum probability of achieving the desired return with the minimum amount of
    risk based on projected returns, volatility and correlations among various asset classes. The
    benchmark portfolio should be a lifecycle portfolio which reduces exposure to risky assets as
    individuals reach retirement. The supervisory authority then integrates this analysis into their
    overall internal risk assessment of the pension funds. Under this framework, limits on
    investments in specific asset classes are removed, and pension funds are free to optimize
    their portfolios in line with the benchmark portfolio (Stewart, op. cit. 2014).

59. For insurance companies, the international best practice for risk-based regulatory framework
    is provided by EU Solvency II and comparable frameworks such as the US insurance
    financial solvency framework. Under Solvency II, companies may use either standard
    formula approach or the internal model approach. Under the standard formula approach,
    investments in European Venture Capital Funds (EuVECA) and in other closed-ended
    alternative investment funds, including private equity funds and infrastructure funds, receive
    favorable treatment in terms of capital charges (See EU, op.cit, 2015, art 168-169). Under the
    internal model approach, risk capital charges are determined by the internal model of the
                                                 25
   company as approved by the regulator. Recent research suggests that insurance companies
   applying an economically sound internal model may expect significantly lower capital
   charges for private equity investments (See Braun, Schmeiser and Siegel, op. cit, 2012).


   (iii)   Business enabling environment

60. The third element for the development of PE and debt funds in EMDEs is the business
    enabling environment.

61. Globally, innovation tends to be underfinanced even in well-functioning markets as a result
    of information asymmetries and appropriation risks. This problem is exacerbated for new
    entrants and start-ups because they lack a track record to signal their ability to investors, and
    because they produce an intangible asset that does not constitute acceptable collateral (See
    Hall and Lerner, op cit, 2009). In many EMDEs, the lack of a robust and continuous pipeline
    of promising start-ups, stalls the development of a strong angel investor community which
    can back innovative companies in early stages, and of the associated legal and IP agreement
    services. This in turn hampers the development of a stream of promising early-stage
    companies in which venture funds can invest, and consequently the development of the
    venture capital and PE industry.

62. This market failure can be addressed through a carefully balanced set of supply-side and
    demand-side policies aimed at supporting the development of the angel investment and the
    VC market (See SME Finance Forum, op.cit. 2012)

63. To develop the angel investment market, key supply-side policies include tax credits for
    angel investors, seed funds that co-invest with qualified angel investor groups, and technical
    assistance and training for angel investor groups. Angel group training may include platform
    set-up, group management, deal sourcing and due diligence, investment tracking,
    entrepreneur mentorship, follow-on financing and exit management (See InfoDev, op.cit,
    2014a and b). Key demand-side measures include entrepreneurship training and support to
    the development of a network of business incubators and business accelerators, based on
    three groups of best practices: (i) incubator creation and management, including strategy.
    positioning and long-term sustainability, and internal organization and governance; (ii)
    incubation process, including admission, incubation and exit mechanisms, and (iii)
    performance assessment, including monitoring and evaluation for incubator and added value
    of the incubator in fostering business development. In many countries, the development of
    the angel investment market requires resolution of coordination failures, in particular the
    development of close linkages between university research and business incubators and
    between business incubators and accelerators and angel investor groups (See Infodev, op.cit,
    2002).

64. The development of the VC market also depends on a careful balance between supply-side
    and demand-side policies. On the supply-side, an increasing number of EMDEs are setting
                                                 26
   up hybrid funds to stimulate equity finance to capital constrained but high potential, early-
   stage enterprises. In these hybrid structures, the government participates as a LP together
   with institutional investors and leaves full operational autonomy to the GP fund manager,
   following similar models developed in the US, UK and Australia. Hybrid funds employ a
   variety of investor return enhancing mechanisms including differential timing of investment
   draw-downs of public and private investors, leveraging the returns of private investors with
   debt, capping the profit entitlement of the public investor, and partial guarantee of
   compensation to the private investor for loss of invested capital. In addition, mechanisms are
   used to skew the risk-return trade-off for the GP to compensate for small fund size and/or the
   small carry of VC funds, with the objective to avoid adverse selection of fund managers with
   less experience and lower opportunity costs (See Murray, op cit. 2012). In parallel, several
   EMDEs are designing and implementing reimbursable technical assistance funds (TAFs)
   with the objective to support VC funds in reaching down to smaller deal sizes (See
   Divakaran et al, op.cit, 2014). On the demand-side, governments are developing
   comprehensive entrepreneurship policies, including networking, mentorship, and promotion
   of entrepreneurship training at all levels of the education system. Globally, the SME Finance
   Forum has developed “Enterprise for All” as a comprehensive entrepreneurship on-line
   training portal (See SME Finance Forum, 2013).


IV.1.2 Develop the framework for infrastructure PPPs


65. The development of a comprehensive framework for the delivery of the PPP program is
    critical to mobilize private equity and debt funds for infrastructure finance in a country. The
    framework covers the objectives of the PPP program, its scope, legal and administrative
    instruments, procedures and decision criteria, institutional responsibilities, management of
    fiscal commitments, and program oversight.


Box 3: Definition of Private Finance PPP
 A long term contract between a public party and a private party, for the development (or
 significant upgrade or renovation) and management of a public asset (including potentially
 management of a related public service), in which the private party bears significant risk and
 management responsibility through the life of the contract, provides a significant portion of the
 finance at its own risk, and remuneration is significantly linked to performance and/or the
 demand or use of the asset or service so as to align the interest of both parties.

66. Framework objectives may vary considerably across countries. These may include enabling
    more investment in infrastructure by increasing project financing options, achieving value for


                                                 27
   money, improving accountability in the provision of infrastructure and public services,
   harnessing private sector innovation and efficiency, and stimulating growth and development
   in the country (see World Bank, op.ci. 2015).

67. Framework scopes may be defined by jurisdiction, sector, project size, and contract type. In
    countries with established PPP programs, PPP frameworks are often applied across all
    sectors, and in some cases across multiple jurisdictions (sovereign and sub-sovereign levels).
    Unified frameworks have the advantage of great efficiency for the private sector resulting in
    greater bidder interest. On the other hand, unified framework are difficult to develop and
    inflexible to change, and may not be able to address unique infrastructure challenges in
    specific sectors. In federal systems, unified frameworks promulgated by the federal
    government may not extend to sub-national levels of government and may need to be
    supplemented by separate frameworks at the sub-national level. Unified frameworks may
    also vary in terms of sectoral coverage depending on the infrastructure development priorities
    of the country. Many frameworks also establish a minimum size for PPP projects below
    which it would not be economically feasible to structure a PPP given the high transaction
    costs of this contractual structure. Finally, the framework may define the types of PPP
    contracts allowed in the country, which may fall into two main categories: (i) government
    pay contracts, in which public bodies are purchasers of services from the private sector; and
    (ii) user-pay or concession contracts, in which the private sector leases a government asset,
    delivers public services and generates income from supplying the service. (See World Bank,
    op.cit, 2015).

68. The legal and administrative instruments to support the PPP framework vary greatly across
    countries based on their legal tradition. While concession contracts have a long history in
    civil law countries, investor-owned utilities have provided used-pay infrastructure services in
    common law countries. Common law countries also developed the government pays PPP
    model, which has progressively been adopted in an increasing number of civil law countries.
    At the same time, mixed models have emerged, in which user pays PPPs have some level of
    government payment. In general, common law countries often use policy documents, not
    laws to establish PPP frameworks, although some common law jurisdictions may pass PPP
    laws in order to override existing laws that prevent PPP transactions (See World Bank, op.cit.
    2015).

69. At the core of the PPP framework are the set of procedures and decision criteria for the
    preparation and completion of PPP transactions (See Box 4 below).

70. The cost of preparation of PPP projects is substantial. Based on IFC experience, the share of
    preparation cost in total project costs ranges from 2-3% in middle-income countries and
    experienced low-income countries to 3%-10% in new sectors in low-income countries (See
    Fay, op.cit. 2011 and Figure 13 below)

71. The preparation cost of PPP transactions may act as binding constraint to the development of
    PPP projects in many EMDEs, in particular in low-income countries. To address this
    constraint, governments may consider establishing infrastructure PPP project venture funds.
    These funds would be responsible for managing all stages of preparation of PPP transactions
    up to financial close and would take an equity and/or mezzanine stake in the PPP project
    SPV. Investors in the funds would include international and domestic institutional investors
    including infrastructure private equity funds. The infrastructure venture funds may also be
    structured as a sub-fund under a Strategic Investment Fund (SIF) (See Section IV.1.3 below).


                                               29
72. The PPP framework needs to integrate procedures for the management of unsolicited
    proposals (USP). Several approaches may be applied: (i) inclusion of USP in best and final
    offer round under two-stage bid processes; (ii) developer fee paid by the government or the
    winning bidet to the USP; (iii) bid bonus for the USP (ex. Chile); and (iv) Swiss challenge, in
    which the USP has the option to match the winning bid and win the contract.

73. The PPP framework also needs to include detailed procedures for the management of the
    contract. Of particular importance are procedures for conflict resolution and for contract
    renegotiations, which range from 40% to78% depending on regions and sectors (See table 2
    below).

IV.1.3 Develop strategic investment funds (SIFs) and the domestic investment component of
SWFs


74. Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) hold about US$6.5 trillion in assets. Responding to the funds’
    objectives to sterilize large export windfalls, save for future generations, and balance risks and
    returns, their holdings have traditionally focused on external assets, primarily securities traded
    in major markets but also real estate and other investments. Some SWFs with long-term
    investment horizons have invested in infrastructure, but these investments have mainly been
    in other countries, in high-return existing infrastructure or low-risk new infrastructure projects
    located in middle and high-income economies. Until recently, domestic greenfield
    infrastructure investment was largely uncharted territory.

75. A number of the SWFs established since the turn of the millennium have been set up to
    undertake strategic domestic investment, including several of the Gulf funds, Kazakhstan’s
    Samruk-Kazyna and Malaysia’s Kazanah. During the last four years, Nigeria and Angola have
    established funds with a domestic investment function. More are in the making or are being
    discussed, including in Kenya, Myanmar, Mongolia, Tanzania, Uganda, Mozambique, Sierra
    Leone, and elsewhere. These funds will be capitalized by revenue from oil or mineral exports.
    Currently, 12 members of the International Forum for SWFs (IFSWF) have domestic and/or
    strategic mandates. The use of SWFs as a tool for strategic domestic investments opens up a
    range of new possibilities for deepening undercapitalized domestic financial markets and
    crowding in private capital to infrastructure in priority sectors such as power and transport.
    However, the approach also carries significant risk, and previous experience suggests great
    caution.

76. The interest in SWFs as a tool for strategic domestic investment is driven by four distinct
    factors. First, although several high-income countries have strategic investment funds, the
    countries currently contemplating strategic investment functions for their planned funds tend
    to be low and middle-income with a large infrastructure deficit and looking for ways to increase
    infrastructure investment. Second, amongst governments and international financial
    institutions, there has been a loosening in the interpretation of the permanent income
    hypothesis, which holds that countries should save enough of their revenues from non-
    renewable resources abroad to maintain a permanent income flow into the indefinite future. If
    returns are higher at home than abroad, or if future generations can be expected to be wealthier
    than the current one, it might make sense to save less and invest more at home now. Third, the
    global financial crisis and shrinking aid flows have led to decreased availability of long-term
    finance for developing countries, which have been looking to supplement foreign capital with
    their own. Fourth, public investment in low-income countries frequently poses significant
    management and governance challenges, including low capacity, weak governance and
    regulation, and lack of coordination among public entities. Given this type of shortcomings,
    many countries have not been able to offset the depletion of their natural resources by
    investment in produced capital, as is required to maintain wealth and sustain growth (Hartwick
    rule). In this type of setting, some governments may see a fund as a means to improve the
    quality of public spending, and crowd in private investors to strengthen investment discipline.

77. In parallel with the increased allocation by oil- or mineral-based SWFs to domestic investment,
    a growing number of EMDEs are establishing Strategic Investment Funds (SIFs), funded by
    fiscal surpluses, borrowing or other non-resource revenues, to serve as anchor investors for
    international private equity and debt funds interested in investing in the domestic economy, in
    particular in infrastructure PPPs and in SME funds. This is in line with similar funds
    established in advanced countries and regions, such as BPI (France), FSI (Italy), and more
    recently by the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI).




                                                32
78. SWFs that invest domestically and SIFs face many of the same challenges, whereas others are
    specific to each. SWFs that are capitalized by inflows of foreign exchange from oil or mineral
    sales must address macroeconomic challenges such as exchange rate appreciation (Dutch
    disease) and macroeconomic volatility. To avoid contributing to asset bubbles, macroeconomic
    volatility and exchange rate appreciation, SWFs domestic investment needs coordination with
    overall fiscal and monetary policy, especially if the fund is large relative to the size of the
    national economy. It is imperative to determine the appropriate allocations to domestic
    investment and foreign savings. Also, the political economy of resource-based SWFs differs
    from that of SIFs, since resource funds do not need to raise capital in financial markets, and do
    not rely on fiscal surpluses. This arguably makes SWFs that invest domestically more
    vulnerable than SIFs to political interference, in turn putting the wealth objectives of the SWFs
    at risk.

79. In terms of their domestic investment function, SWFs that invest domestically and SIFs take
    on very similar roles. In both cases, their main objective(s) is to i) act as anchor investors for
    strategic infrastructure PPPs that may provide economic externalities, such as the stimulation
    of private investments and jobs, which are not fully captured by its financial return; or they
    may (ii) be used to improve the access to capital for SMEs by co-financing with private
    investors in the SME financing space. The use of SWFs and SIFs for domestic investment
    generates a number of challenges with regard to governance, mandate, and policy.

80. The legal, regulatory, and institutional environment in LICs and MICs that wish to establish
    SIFs or SWFs with a domestic investment function may require significant upgrading for such
    funds to be able to operate efficiently. This may include reviews of the legal and regulatory
    framework for: i) private equity and private debt funds; ii) limited partnerships; iii) investments
    by domestic insurance companies and pension funds in the private equity and debt asset class;
    and iv) inward investment, outward repatriation of distributions and dividends, and double
    taxation treaties.

81. Although the risks of SWFs and SIFs domestic investment cannot be eliminated, mitigation of
    these risks is possible. For SWFs and SIFs alike there should be a clear separation between the
    type of investments that can be undertaken by the funds, and investments that should go
    through the government budget. In that regard, allowing the SWF/SIF to undertake only
    investments that can be expected to yield a combined commercial and economic return (double
    trigger) can strengthen the integrity and discipline of the investment process.

82. Investing with private investors, pooling with other SWFs, and co-financing with the regional
    development banks can help the fund to reduce risk, bring in additional expertise and enhance
    the credibility of the investment decision. As an example, the Nigeria Infrastructure Fund, the
    domestic subsidiary of the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority, has signed cooperation
    agreements with the Africa Finance Corporation, the IFC and, for power sector investments,
    with General Electric. Limiting investments to minority shares serves to reduce risks of
    politically motivated allocations.

                                                  33
83. Funds need strong corporate governance, professional staffing, transparent reporting, and
    independent audit. There is a large body of knowledge on effective corporate governance,
    including the Santiago Principles, the Revised Guidelines for Foreign Exchange Reserves, and
    general principles of corporate governance, including for state owned enterprises, published
    by the OECD. Independent nominating committees, as well as clear skill requirements, can
    facilitate the independence of boards. Ownership and supervisory roles should be clearly
    separated. To operate as an expert investor, fund need to be staffed with qualified professionals,
    a capacity that may need to be built up over time.

84. IFG support for the establishment of SWFs that invest domestically, mainly funded by RAS
    and TFs, has so far focused on early stage mapping and benchmarking of options with regard
    to the funds’ role; mandate; macroeconomic policy (stabilization, allocation to foreign savings
    vs. domestic investment); governance, ownership, and oversight structures; management
    structure; and investment strategy including investment horizon, liquidity requirements,
    eligible investment universe, and strategic asset allocation. Increasingly, as governments
    advance in the process of setting up SIFs/SWFs domestic investment function, demand
    includes contractual relations with the funds’ counterparts, in particular with external
    investment managers.

85. IFG support for the establishment of SIFs has been structured as to include i) international
    benchmarking of role and modes of intervention of Sovereign Wealth Funds and Strategic
    Investment Funds in infrastructure finance, ii) assessment of in-country infrastructure
    financing needs and demand, iii) assessment and definition of fund strategy to enable it to act
    as a financial adviser and a financier through the development of optimal financial instruments
    for PPP projects, iv) capacity building for the funds through the preparation of PPP pilot
    transactions, and v) support for the implementation of recommendations with regard to the
    above components through the establishment of the most optimal financial instruments
    (venture and/or equity and/or debt fund) and through the preparation of specific PPP
    transactions. In this space, IFG will be coordinating closely with multilateral and private funds
    and instruments aimed at crowding in private investment in climate adaptation and mitigation,
    including in green energy.


IV.2 Program activities
IV.2.1 Global engagements
    IFG global engagements has five main components:
           Manage a global focus point for investment professionals in the SWF/SIF and
            PE/VC space, through the Investment Funds CoP and its two open online platforms.
            Co-hosts for the two open platforms are, respectively, The Fletcher Network for
            Sovereign Wealth and Global Capital at Tufts University (SWF C4D platform), and
            the Emerging Markets Private Equity Association (EMPEA (PE/VC C4D platform).

                                                 34
         Jointly with TRE, manage the Sovereign Wealth Funds Secretariat, which functions
          as an internal one-stop shop for CMUs requiring support for SWF activities through
          the cross-GP Sovereign Wealth Fund Advisory Group.
         Developing global knowledge to directly support operations in the evolving field of
          SWF’s domestic investments, SIFs, and PE/VC funds, in particular:
          . Global review of SIFs
          . Guidelines for the design of SIFs
         Partnering with the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds (ISWF) to
          further develop the Santiago Principles to include principles for domestic
          investment.
         In partnership with the GFDRR/DRFI Program and SURRGP, carry out a feasibility
          study for the establishment of a Global Infrastructure Resilience Fund (GRIF), with
          the objective of increasing commercial investment in climate resilient infrastructure
          and SMEs

86.   The GRIF would contribute to increased resilience through mobilizing resources from
      global private equity and debt funds for the financing of resilience investments by SMEs
      and infrastructure PPPs in EMDEs. The fund would help unlock the triple dividend of
      resilience in EMDEs that is on the critical path to achieving the twin goals of poverty
      eradication and shared prosperity and it would contribute to climate adaptation. This triple
      dividend is reflected in the direct impact on the three SDGs of growth and employment
      (SDG8), resilient infrastructure (SDG9), and climate adaptation and mitigation (SDG13).
      Additionally, as an increasing number of infrastructure assets become uninsurable due to
      climate change, resilience investments through GRIF can leverage the original
      infrastructure investment by investing in existing infrastructure to bring it up to insurable
      standards.

87.   The GRIF would be structured as a specialized investment fund with compartments in the
      form of a limited partnership by shares, registered in a major fund center that allows for a
      a fund structure with compartments. The GFDRR/DRFI Program, FM GP and SURR GP
      would be the fund sponsors. GRIF would be marketed to international institutional
      investors including pension funds, insurance companies, Sovereign Wealth funds (SWFs),
      infrastructure private equity and debt funds, venture capital and private equity and debt
      funds, private foundations, as well as IFIs, multilateral and bilateral donors as limited
      partners (LPs). The fund would open staggered compartments based on (i) asset class
      (equity, mezzanine, senior debt); (ii) sector of investments (SMEs in the resilience value
      chains, resilient infrastructure PPPs); (iii) region/country; and/or (iv) investor appetite.

IV.2.2 Sub-regional and country engagements


89. The development of the PE/VC industry may be initiated in a broad range of EMDEs with
    varying levels of legal, regulatory, institutional and business environment for fund operations
    Across many EMDEs, the PE/VC industry initially develops through funds registered off-
    shore, thus providing investors and investee firms alike with an acceptable legal, regulatory
    and institutional framework for fund registration and operations and for dispute resolution.
    The limited development of the domestic stock exchange may not be a binding constraint, as
    globally the vast majority of private equity exits are executed through trade sales and buy-
    backs, and only 20% through IPOs (See preqin, op.cit, 2015). As the legal, regulatory,
    institutional and business environment framework for PE/VC fund operations develop,
    domestic registration may become an attractive option for fund managers as part of their fund
    structuring and marketing strategies. In particular, the development of infrastructure equity
    and debt funds aimed at domestic institutional investors may act as an incentive for domestic
    fund registration. Similarly, the development of infrastructure equity and debt funds by the
    domestic investment arm of SWFs or by SIFs as anchor investors for both international and
    domestic institutional investors may also act as a powerful incentive for domestic
    registration.


                                                36
90. At the sub-regional and country levels, the Investment Funds Group team supports Regional
    FM GP and TC GP teams on three business lines: (i) development of PE/VC ecosystems; (ii)
    development of SWFs in LICs; and (iii) development of SIFs in low and middle-income
    countries. In each business line, ongoing and planned country engagements are selected on
    the basis of four fundamental criteria:

   (i)     Sub-regional/country demand through CMU
   (ii)    Partnership across WBG (IFC, TRE, GPs, CCSAs)
   (iii)   Partnership outside WBG (RAS, MDTFs, Multilateral TFs, Bilateral TFs, etc..)
   (iv)    Line of sight instrument (LSI) towards relevant SDG(s)

91. In addition, a number of pilots may be undertaken in a few cases as a trigger for future
    engagements based on the above criteria.

V: Program risks
95. The key risk to the program is rapidly growing demand for advisory and project support in
    the investment funds space vs small size of core Investment Fund Group (IFG) team in
    Fin4Dev.

96. To mitigate this risk, the team is taking the following measures:




                                                39
            a. Strengthen the core IFG team through partnerships with senior staff from
               Governance GP (DA assignment) and Energy and Extractives GP (cross-support)
            b. Assign country engagement TTLship to Regional FMGP and TCGP colleagues
               and retain TL and/or co-TTL role only in core IFG team
            c. Build cross-Group, cross-Practice and cross-CCSA task teams based on
               engagement technical and operational scope in particular with IFC Funds
               Group/SME Ventures, TRE, TCGP, SURRGP, Governance GP, Energy and
               Extractives GP, CC CCSA and PPP CCSA
            d. Build strong cadre of senior consultant experts in PE/VC, SWF and SIF spaces to
               contribute to specific advisory and operational engagements



VI: Roles of clients and partners
97. As discussed in Section IV above, strong relationships with clients and partnerships with
    global and regional stakeholders are at the core of the investment funds for development
    program.

98. At the global level, critical partnerships are:

            a. The Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF), as multi-donor
               forum for building ownership and for supporting the preparation of the global
               review of SIFs and the preparation of guidelines for the design of SIFs.
            b. The International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds (ISWF), as international
               standard setter for SWFs governance (Santiago Principles)
            c. The Emerging Markets Private Equity Association (EMPEA), as co-manager of
               the PE/VC C4D platform
            d. The Fletcher Network for Sovereign Wealth and Global Capital (FNSWGC), as
               co-manager of the SWF C4D platform
            e. The Global Fund for Disaster Risk Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR)/Disaster
               Risk Finance and Insurance (DRFI) Window , as multi-donor forum for building
               ownership and funding mobilization for GRIF

99. At the sub-regional and country level, critical partnerships are:

            a. The Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF), as multi-donor
               forum for building ownership and funding mobilization for the SIF business line
            b. The FIRST Initiative, as multi-donor forum for building ownership and funding
               mobilization for the development of PE/VC legal and regulatory frameworks and
               reforms under the PE/VC business line
            c. The European Union Commission, as partner and donor for PE/VC development
               programs in EU candidate countries and in EU Eastern Partnership countries



                                                  40
          d. The UK Department for International Development (DFID), as partner and donor
             for the proposed Caribbean Regional Infrastructure PPP Finance Fund (CRIP3F)
             and for the Kenya SWF/SIF advisory
          e. The Caribbean Development Bank (CDB), as partner in the proposed CRIP3F and
             in the proposed regional diaspora co-investment facility



VII: Dissemination and outreach strategy
100. The core of the dissemination and outreach strategy for the investment fund for
   development program is the Investment Funds for Development Community of Practice
   (CoP), and its two dedicated C4D platforms co-managed and open to outside stakeholders in
   the investment funds space (see Section IV.2.1 above).

101. In addition, the IFG core team and regional engagement task team leaders and team
   members will participate actively through speaking and panel engagements in selected
   international forums and conferences, in particular the IFSWF Annual Meeting, the
   EMPEA/IFC Annual Conference, and the Fletcher Network Annual Infrastructure Forum.
