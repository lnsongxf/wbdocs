                     SUBNATIONAL BUDGET PROCESSES
                         AND PRACTICES IN NEPAL
         Findings and Observations from an Assessment in Three Pilot Districts
  Nepal embarked on a process of decentralization, first through the 1999 Local Self Governance Act, which introduced major
  policy reforms to devolve decision-making power to local bodies, and later through its 2007 interim constitution, which abol-
  ished a feudal state structure and established a federal system of governance that prioritized local government. These reforms
  presented an important opportunity to not only improve efficiency but also engage citizens at the subnational level. However,
  they have not yet translated into a more efficient use of budget resources at the subnational level or enhanced citizen under-
  standing of budget processes.

     It was in this context that the Budget Transparency Initiative (BTI) piloted an innovative approach in 2011 to simplify, analyze,
  and disclose budgets at the subnational level and to build awareness and capacity among government officials and citizens
  that could promote a public dialogue around public expenditures through social accountability approaches. In this context,
  under the aegis of the BTI, a study was conducted in 2011 to assess the gaps between policies and actual implementation of the
  budget at the subnational level in three pilot districts in Nepal—Kaski, Dolakha, and Nawalparasi.

      Analysis from the study, in-depth interviews, and focus group discussions revealed several gaps between policy and prac-
  tice in subnational budget formulation and execution processes, such as the predominance of top-down processes, lack of
  cost-benefit analyses in budget allocation decisions, delays in communication of budget ceilings and release of allocations, and
  capture of user committees. This note describes the institutional framework underlying this context, outlines the methodology
  used, and presents key findings and observations from the study.

 Box 1. Overview of the National and Subnational Process and Institutional Framework

 National budget process. The Ministry of Finance (MoF) and National Planning Commission (NPC) lead the annual budget pro-
 cess and with the involvement of sector ministries, a few civil society organizations, and other experts formulate the budget.
 The resource committee, comprised of the NPC, the central bank and MoF, is responsible for estimating the total revenue and
 spending for the annual budget. Based on this overall expenditure limit, the MoF and NPC determine annual expenditure ceilings
 for sector ministries. The sector ministries then set nonbinding budget ceilings for departments, district offices, and local bodies
 under their mandates. Subsequently, the MoF and the NPC receive programs with details on current and capital expenditures
 that significantly exceed the initial expenditure ceilings; they finalize allocations in the annual budget based on negotiations with
 the sector ministries, taking into account past expenditure levels and internal and external sources of funding.a However, budget
 allocations continue to be adjusted. New projects and programs are added at the budget approval stage and actual funds released
 at the budget execution stage tend to be modified due to high reallocation levels.

 Subnational budget process. The NPC sets the overall district level ceilings. As per the MoF’s budgetary directives, village devel-
 opment committeesb (VDC)—the most grassroots-level local elected bodies involved the budget cycle—are responsible for
 producing lists of desired district-level programs along with anticipated budgets. This is accomplished through VDC council
 meetings that include representatives from political parties and civil society groups.3 The VDCs approve programs and forward
 their demands to the area council, an intermediary body created to compile village-centered program requests; they are then
 forwarded to the district development committee (DDC). Representatives of political parties and civil society groups as well as
 officials of both DDC and the local offices of sector ministries participate in area council meetings. After this process, various
 sector committees at the district level that include government officials and political party representatives meet to discuss the
 demands put forward by the designated areas and propose projects and programs to the DDCs. The DDCs submit the requests
 to the central level for budget allocation. Once implemented, DDC-led projects are audited by the auditor general (AG); the line
 ministry-led projects are audited by the financial comptroller general’s office.

 a. Nepal has a three-year rolling medium-term expenditure framework. Forward expenditure estimates are presented in budget documents but prior year estimates are not used as
 a starting point for new spending ceilings and allocations.

 b. A village development council (VDC), an autonomous institution, is the lower tier of the ministry of local development. The VDC gives villagers an element of control and
 responsibility over development and ensures the proper utilization and distribution of state funds as well as increased interaction between government officials, nongovernmental
 organizations, and other development agencies. By law, members of the VDC are elected. However, if there is no elected body—as has been the case in Nepal for the past several
 years as a result of the political stalemate—a three-member committee chaired by the secretary of the VDC plus two additional nominated officials replaces the elected body.

 c. There are five regional level offices in Nepal, but their role in the budgetary process and implementation is limited. A regional budgetary framework does not exist and regional
 offices are not assigned specific roles. Regional offices are primarily assigned project or program coordinating and monitoring roles.

    Lack of continuity in party representation compromises
decision making. Parties do not appoint one representative
on a permanent basis to attend all DDC council meetings that
include representatives from all local parties. The frequent
changes of party representatives is disruptive to the continuity
in priority-setting and decision making, and leads to delays in
the initiation and completion of projects. In some cases, user
committees have reportedly been dissolved and new ones cre-
ated because of changes in party representatives.

Budget Execution
Allocated budgets are not released in a timely manner.
Typically, the first installment of the allocated program budget
should be released directly to the DDC within the first quarter,
including relevant instructions to the district treasury for the
release of funds. In the three pilot districts, the practice was
quite different. Budget allocations were not released to the
project or program prior to the second week of February, result-
ing in delays in the commencement of project or program activ-
ities. During field visits at the end of the first quarter, allocated
budgets had not been released in any of the three pilot districts.

   Technical and institutional capacity is limited at the local
level. VDCs do not have the technical capacity to document
their priorities and select programs based on their needs, mainly
due to shortages of skilled manpower at the local level, as was
