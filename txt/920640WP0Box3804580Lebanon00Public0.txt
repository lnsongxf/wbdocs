THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ra nking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

      This procedure has two functions: “Registration” of a new employee and

      The “Registration” function entails submitting a file for each new
      employee at the NSSF regional office closest to the company premises
      and obtaining a file reference number (or a receipt acknowledging the
      registration) immediately upon the submission. Once this “Registration”

      The Time to complete this procedure is 1 day at no cost to the
      employer or the employee.

      The “Confirmation” function consists of issuing a hard copy document
      (printed on a special size sheet) in the name of the registered employee
      along with his/her unique NSSF ID. Due to the lack of printing
      equipment at NSSF, the confirmation documents are printed in batches
      every few days or so. Therefore, it could take up to 30 days for a

      Pay building permit taxes to the municipality

      The Urban Development Department refers the file to the relevant
      municipality (in the case of the city of Beirut, to the Administrator of the
      City of Beirut). The municipality collects the construction permit taxes
      and issues the construction permit in the name of the property owner.
      Payment is made at the municipality.

      According to Decree No. 60 of 1988 on Municipal Taxes, the building
      permit taxes paid to the Municipality are a certain value per square
      meter of the building. However, this value per square meter is
      calculated based on the value of 1 square meter of construction as
      follows:

      - From the value of LBP 1 - 25,000: 1.5% of the construction value of 1
      square meter
      - From the value between LBP 25,000 - 100,000: 2% of the construction
      value of 1 square meter
      - From the value greater than LBP 100,000: 1% of the construction value
      of 1 square meter
7                                                                                     1 day     LBP 11,889,684
      In the case of Doing Business, the total construction value is LBP
      720,859,043. Therefore, the value of 1 square meter of construction is
      LBP 720,859,043 / 1,300.6 sq. m. = LBP 554,251.

      Therefore, the value per square meter without taxes to be paid is
      calculated as follows: (1.5% * 25,000) + (2% * 75,000) + (1% * [554,251 -
      100,000]) = LBP 6,418 / sq. m.

      Then a 15% municipal tax is added to this value (15% * 6,418) + 0.05%
      of the construction value of 1 square meter (0.05% * 554,251) to obtain
      the total value to be paid per sq. m. as a municipal contribution. In this
      case, it would be LBP 1,240 / sq. m.

      A second tax of 12% of the value above must be paid per square meter
      as a national tax: 12% * LBP 6,418 / sq. m. = LBP 770 / sq. m.

      A contribution of 5% of the value above must be paid per square meter
      to the Order of Engineers and Architects: 5% * LBP 6,418 / sq. m. = LBP
      321 / sq. m.

      Therefore, the total cost per square meter paid to the municipality for

      all building permit fees is LBP 6,418 + LBP 1,240 + LBP 770 + LBP 321
      = LBP 8,748 / sq. m.

      The total cost is LBP 8,748 / sq. m. * 1,300.6 sq. m. = LBP 11,377,962.

      Obtain building permit

      By law, construction work can start if no decision about the building

      inspection of the building to ensure that it is in compliance with the
      construction permit and approved plans.

      The application for an occupancy permit must be accompanied by the
      plans related to the completed construction, signed by the engineer in

      in the name of the property owner. According to the law, the
      occupancy permit must be issued within a month. However, this time

      * The client receives external inspection from Electricité du Liban
      (EDL)

      The application is forwarded to the relevant department at the utility for
      review. A site inspection is usually carried out to determine the details of
      the connection.

      The inspector then prepares a report with the specifics of the connection
      and awaits clearance from the relevant authority at the utility.

      Once clearance is obtained and the inspector has prepared an estimate
      of the connection fees, the client will need to make the necessary
      payment at Electricité du Liban’s offices. The client is then given the
      approved file back along with a “C23” card (with the number of
      connections and the temporary meter, if needed).

      The client awaits and obtains external works and meter installation
      from Electricité du Liban (EDL)’s service provider (BUTEC)

      External works start after the client has paid the connection fees. For a
      connection of 3x200A, if the warehouse is less than 200 meters away
      from the closest distribution substation, the works will consist of laying
      out an underground cable from the building to that substation.

      Otherwise, a substation would be needed.

      Any permits needed for the works are obtained by the utility directly.

      The utility picks a contractor to do the external works, and possibly
      install the meter and turn the electricity on too. The utility however,
      always supervises the works.
      The contractor is in charge of applying for any required excavation
      permit with the municipality.

      No inspection of the entire internal wiring is done during the process.

      The client obtains final connection from Electricité du Liban (EDL) or

      Usually it is the utility that turns on electricity, but it all depends on the

local courts. Following the step-by-step evolution of       Time for trial and obtaining judgment
a standardized case study, it collects data relating to

The dispute in the case study involves the breach of a
sales contract between 2 domestic businesses. The           Enforcement costs
case study assumes that the court hears an expert on
the quality of the goods in dispute. This distinguishes
the case from simple debt enforcement. To make the
data comparable across economies, Doing Business
uses several assumptions about the case:
       The seller and buyer are located in the
        economy’s largest business city. For the 11
        economies with a population of more than               The seller requests a pretrial attachment to
