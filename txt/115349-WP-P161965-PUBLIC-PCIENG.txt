What is the Lagging Regions Initiative
The scope of the EU Cohesion Policy is to narrow development gaps and reduce disparities between Member
Countries and regions. To this extent, around €454 billion of ESI (European Structural and Investment) Funds
have been allocated to help EU regions become more competitive. However, not all EU regions have been able
to fully take advantage of the benefits of EU growth, due to the effects of the 2008 economic crisis and due to
a host of structural problems.

To this end, Corina Crețu, the Commissioner for Regional Policy, together with the Task Force for Better
Implementation has started the Lagging Regions Initiative. The aim of the Initiative is to identify what holds
back growth in less developed regions, and to provide targeted actions for unlocking their growth potential.
Thus, these lagging regions will be assisted to involve a broad range of stakeholders (regional and local
administrations, educational institutions, business support institutions, SMEs, entrepreneurs, investors, NGOs,
IFIs) to help respond to concrete needs they have and to maximize the impact of regional investments. Two
types of lagging regions have been identified:

•	   LOW GROWTH REGIONS, which cover the less developed and transition regions that did not converge to
     the EU average between the years 2000 and 2013 in Member States with a GDP per Capita (PPS) below
     the EU average in 2013. These include almost all the less developed and transition regions in Greece, Italy,
     Spain and Portugal

•	   LOW INCOME REGIONS, covering all the regions with a GDP per Capita (PPS) below 50% of the EU average
     in 2013. This group covers the less developed regions of Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland and Romania.

Poland and Romania are the first countries to pilot this initiative, with two regions each – Swietokrzyskie and
Podkarpackie in Poland, and North-West and North-East in Romania. In April 2016, Commissioner Crețu together
with Marshal Adam Jarubas in Swietokrzyskie and Marshal Wladyslaw Ortyl in Podkarpackie have officially
launched the Polish part of the Lagging Regions Initiative called „Catching-up Regions Poland”. The „Catching-
up Regions Poland” is an implementation-focused program that aims at providing tailored support to the two
Polish regions to boost the impact of EU and private investments in specific areas selected by the two regions.

Over a year of joint work, the World Bank provided hands-on technical assistance and helped coordinate five
activities that were selected by the Podkarpackie and Swietokrzyskie regions in coordination with the European
Commission, Ministry of Economic Development, and the Bank. The five selected activities were:

•	   Improving the commercialization of Research & Development (R&D) results generated by public research
     facilities and enabling better utilization of existing technology transfer centers in the Podkarpackie region.

•	   Strengthening the vocational education and training system in the Swietokrzyskie region, using best practice
     examples from around the world and tailoring them to the regional context.

•	   Activating entrepreneurship in deprived areas in the Podkarpackie and Swietokrzyskie regions.

•	   Identifying ways to improve conditions for starting a business in the Podkarpackie and Swietokrzyskie
     regions.

•	   Supporting the creation of in-house financial instruments in the Podkarpackie region.

Summary




8   Activity 1: Designing Regional Technology Transfer Office: Podkarpackie Center for Innovation
1.	 This report is an implementation focused document that proposes a solution
    for addressing the problem of unexploited potential in the Podkarpackie R&D
    ecosystem (in particular, relatively low, although gradually increasing, level of
    intensity of business - university collaboration). This problem was jointly identified by
    the project partners, the European Commission, the Podkarpackie Marshal Office (MO), the
    Ministry of Economic Development (MoED) and the World Bank (WB), and a single regional
    technology transfer office (TTO) was found to be a preferred option to tackle it. The main
    goal of this report is to present a model of a proposed Podkarpackie Center for Innovation
    (PCI) that resulted from a joint effort of key local stakeholders (MO, universities, enterprises
    and their representatives).

2.	 The Podkarpackie region is doing relatively well on some key measures of innovation.
    Research and development (R&D) expenditures per capita and employee were on par with the
    national level in 2014 (€90), and almost five times higher than in 2007 (€20). On this measure,
    the region ranks fourth nationwide. In terms of private R&D expenses, the Podkarpackie
    region ranks third in Poland, after the Mazowieckie and Malopolska regions. Despite negative
    national trends, the number of students (and in particular, students of technical universities)
    in Podkarpackie grew significantly over the last years. In particular, with close to 50 thousand
    students, Podkarpackie ranks at the top of all European cities in terms of the number of
    students per capita.

3.	 However, the Podkarpackie R&D landscape has five opportunities for improvement
    in the university-business R&D cooperation realm: 	
•	   The rate of creating technology start-ups (in particular, a low rate of R&D-based start-ups founded
     as a result of research performed at the local universities) is below the region’s potential
•	   The levels of licensing revenues generated by the region’s universities may be significantly
     improved (today’s levels suggest that there may be a problem translating intellectual
     property (IP) into commercial success)
•	   The level of utilization of the local universities R&D equipment for commercial purposes is
     low and could be significantly increased (this applies as well to the level of revenues derived
     from contract research that is based on that equipment)
•	   The involvement of the local corporations in the joint university-business collaboration,
     even though good in some areas by Polish standards (example: the Aviation Valley cluster
     companies and their cooperation with the Rzeszow University of Technology, RUT), falls
     short of its potential
•	   Local student successes in national and international level competitions could be more
     systematically translated into subsequent entrepreneurial success.
	In recent years the Podkarpackie universities and companies have achieved significant
 successes in these five areas, however, their further intensification is necessary for the
 Podkarpackie innovation ecosystem to become one of the leaders in the country.

4.	 The root causes behind the unexploited potential of the Podkarpackie innovation
    system lie first in the still-limited competencies and capacity to deliver (mainly
    in areas of valorization and structured contract research) and secondly in
    underdeveloped entrepreneurial ethos at the two local universities. This problem
    affects researchers, students and university support personnel. While the local universities
    began efforts to strengthen their commercialization capacity (e.g., the RUT operates both a
    sizeable technology transfer center and a special purpose company), the schools typically
    lack the concentrated critical mass of skills necessary for successful commercialization of
    university-born R&D results. This stems in part from their overall shortage in Podkarpackie,
    and partly from a dispersion of these skills across multiple players of the Podkarpackie
    innovation ecosystem (such as universities, regional development agencies, technology parks,
    clusters, incubators, accelerators). Lack of the business-science collaboration ethos stems
    primarily from the misaligned incentive system for the researchers, still limited scope of such
    activities, constraints not allowing commercial utilization of the universities’ R&D equipment,

                                                                                              Executive summary   9
                   and differences in the organizational cultures of corporate and science worlds that area
                   difficult to match. As of today R&D collaboration does not generate sufficient benefits (e.g.,
                   in terms of a parametric evaluation by the Ministry of Higher Education, revenues, research
                   opportunities) for either the universities or researchers to gain their attention. Leading
                   European universities and TTOs acknowledge that the presence of a strong entrepreneurial
                   ethos at the universities is an important ingredient of successful innovation ecosystems, and
                   that this needs to be started early on. For that reason, initiatives that shape innovation-
                   oriented attitude among students and provide them with opportunities to prototype and
                   experiment have been gaining popularity.

               5.	 The aforementioned improvement opportunities are not being addressed by the
                   existing R&D ecosystem. For instance, the technology transfer centers (TTCs) do a very
                   good job at some tasks (e.g., support on IP issues, administration of research grants, etc.), but
                   have neither the scale, nor the required competencies or resources to significantly ramp up
                   the licensing revenues, increase the level of university-originated start-ups, proactively market
                   services to be provided on the university R&D equipment, or to spur the entrepreneurial
                   drive of students.

               6.	 The report recommends the creation of the Podkarpackie Center for Innovation
                   (PCI), a technology transfer office (TTO) to address the weaknesses of the regional
                   innovation ecosystem. In principle, the PCI will help link businesses and university
                   researchers, develop key skills of university researchers and administrative staff necessary for
                   R&D collaboration, support R&D projects by providing resources (money, skills, knowledge),
                   and stimulate students’ entrepreneurship. By intensifying such a collaboration thanks to a
                   proactive attitude and envisaged early commercialization successes, the PCI will contribute
                   to strengthening the ethos of business-university cooperation at the local universities. Its
                   activities will be complementary to and supportive of work performed by university TTCs
                   and special purpose companies (SPCs). The second approach that was considered during
                   this project focused on building up the capacity of individual TTCs and SPCs operating at
                   the universities, however, this was regarded us suboptimal due to the lack of economies of
                   scale and scope, and potential lack of financing.

               7.	 Creation of a relatively independent professional entity (PCI) to deal with
                   commercialization and technology transfer seems a more effective and efficient
                   choice. Such an approach allows attracting private sector talent to develop business-academia
                   collaboration, while also building up capacity of the universities in a mid-term horizon (by
                   working hand-in-hand with the PCI, the universities will learn in practice key principles and
                   good practices of commercialization). Creating an entity that gathers competencies in R&D
                   project valorization and contract research under one roof (thus creating scale and scope
                   economies), and has a stable mid-term financing model will help jump start business-university
                   collaboration. R&D-based innovation usually requires several years to yield results. A five-year
                   period seems sufficient to prove effectiveness of the proposed solution and demonstrate to
                   the local stakeholders the value added of such an entity.

               8.	 Building separately the capacity of each of the existing TTCs and SPCs from the
                   inside of the universities seems a much longer and less cost-effective process. Such
                   option is also likely to be more difficult to pursue as financial, staffing and governance-
                   related issues of the TTCs and SPCs are regulated by the universities’ rules that may not be
                   easy to modify. Current budgets of the existing SPCs and TTCs would need to be significantly
                   enlarged to boost their capacities and competencies (attract new talent and train existing
                   staff to form separate teams at each university). Such a change is unlikely, especially in light
                   of the ongoing reform of the universities pursued by the Ministry of Science and Higher
                   Education (MoSHE), which will impose financial constraints on the universities.

               9.	 The PCI will complement the work of TTCs and SPCs in several ways. First, by
                   providing experienced private sector people, who could coach and assist research teams


10   Activity 1: Designing Regional Technology Transfer Office: Podkarpackie Center for Innovation
     in developing their inventions. Second, by proactively reaching out to entrepreneurs and
     marketing services that could be offered by universities. Third, by co-financing promising
     applied research work performed by scientists. Fourth, by helping upgrade existing R&D
     equipment to increase its commercial potential. Collaboration with the PCI will benefit TTCs
     and SPCs at least in three important ways, while at the same time will not add extra burden
     to their ongoing operations. First, enhancing the capacity of TTC/SPCs’ staff (learning by
     doing); secondly, raising awareness and entrepreneurial ethos among researchers, staff and
     management; finally, accruing real financial benefits from the enhanced business-science
     collaboration (i.e., increased revenues from licensing and royalties).

10.	The PCI will aim at increasing universities’ revenues from licensing of R&D results
    and certain kinds of contract research, and enhancing the rate of creation of IP-
    driven start-up companies. These are three key measureable indicators that will define
    the success of the PCI. Increasing revenues from licensing and contract research can
    further translate into universities’ enhanced R&D capacity and stronger acceptance of the
    entrepreneurial ethos among academics. This can create a virtuous circle mechanism and, in
    turn, lead to a continuous increase of university revenues. However, currently, the main three
    local universities focus primarily on education and basic research, with applied research
    being a third priority (this allocation of priorities is consistent with the way universities are
    being evaluated by the MoSHE). Applied research efforts are largely directed at expertise-
    based contract research projects performed for local companies.

11.	 The PCI will help develop and fund high-risk innovative projects that emphasize
     research and development background and originate at the Podkarpackie
     universities. The R&D focus implies that the PCI will focus on identification of projects that
     create new knowledge, which will be turned into university-originated intellectual property,
     as well as product or process innovation. Such innovation can originate from any field of
     science, hence both social and engineering sciences projects will be taken into account.
     In addition, interdisciplinary projects will be sought out, on the assumption (born from
     the available research) that such projects are especially promising and are likely to result in
     disruptive innovation.

12.	A higher rate of innovative R&D projects and start-up companies could yield a
    positive spillover effect for the Podkarpackie region and beyond. Innovation implies
    higher productivity, and this, in turn, translates into higher competitiveness of companies,
    both domestic and international. Table 1 presents selected benefits to the stakeholders of
    the Podkarpackie ecosystem from increased intensity of the R&D collaboration.

                   13.	 A PCI team will operate three activity platforms (R&D project valorization, structured
                        contract research, and the ProtoLab). Platform 1 will perform R&D project valorization
                        tasks, thus raising the TRL (Technological Readiness Level) of the funded projects to the
                        point where commercialization becomes possible. Platform 2 will focus on taking advantage
                        of universities’ R&D equipment being freed up1; it will do so by marketing to businesses
                        structured, repeatable contract research services that leverage this R&D equipment.
                        Platform 3 will target Podkarpackie university students; it will foster entrepreneurial culture
                        among them by providing a facility and tools to prototype their inventions and experiment
                        in an interdisciplinary atmosphere. Through those platforms, the PCI will support the local
                        universes (and their TTCs and SPCs), as well as Podkarpackie innovative enterprises, students,
                        and young researchers (Figure 1). Ideally, the PCI would be located in close proximity to
                        universities and student dorms in a location that has good transport accessibility to provide
                        easy access to and from the schools for both researchers and students.

                   14.	 The presented model of PCI is a result of consultations with all key local stakeholders
                        and lessons learned from other European and Polish TTOs. The MO, universities
                        (university management, TTCs, researchers, students) and enterprises have been active
                        partners in designing the model, and during multiple individual interviews and workshops
                        they have contributed comments and verified feasibility of subsequent versions of the
                        proposed model. They also expressed support for the three-platform PCI concept (for
                        instance by offering a building to house a ProtoLab, etc.), though the design is still work in
                        progress and its details are likely to evolve during the implementation stage. The universities
                        are interested in the specifics of how PCI can add value to their operations without disrupting
                        the progress on the commercialization front that some of them (e.g., RUT) accomplished over
                        the recent period. This report proposes a number of detailed solutions, especially regarding
                        PCI’s activities, governance, team selection and financing to illustrate the current state of the
                        model development and set up a baseline for the further implementation work.

                   15.	A top-quality team will be key to the success of the PCI. A professional team that is
                       experienced in commercialization, innovation management, and knowledge of both the
                       private sector and scientific environment, offers significant potential to help push the
                       Podkarpackie region to the next level on the innovation front. Such experience will enable
                       the team to act as a contact point for business and academia. The PCI can start with 14-28
                       people in the core team and grow with the expansion of its activities.
1
 The “freeing up” of universities’ R&D equipment means that up to 20% of that equipment’s capacity can be used for ancillary purposes; in
practice, this means for commercial use

16.	Stable political support for the PCI concept and a clear vision of its future are at
    least as important for the PCI’s success as is the assurance of its funding. International
    good practices underscore the critical importance of stable and favorable environment for
    developing a robust technology transfer organization. To achieve that, coordination and
    collaboration is needed between all key stakeholders, including universities, regional and
    city authorities, as well as local companies.

17.	 The PCI should be set up as a limited liability company (LLC), with mixed public-
     private shareholding and managed by the competitively selected team of top
     professionals. The PCI’s shareholding will include a private entity representing the
     management team, the Marshal Office (it is recommended that the PCI have a 10-year
     agreement with the MO), and possibly other parties (e.g., the City of Rzeszow or local
     corporations). The PCI’s management team has to be competitively selected in an open
     procedure to ensure that best possible professionals are hired. The management team has
     to have hands-on experience in both technology investing and R&D commercialization,
     and willing to commit to implement the PCI’s mission on the ground in Podkarpackie. Clear
     goals and incentives will motivate performance of the PCI management team.

18.	The PCI will use a transparent process to allocate resources to valorized R&D
    projects and create a commercially attractive structured contract research offer.
    Decisions to fund R&D projects through microgrants (both at the Proof-of-Principle (PoP)
    as well as Proof-of-Concept (PoC) stages), as well as decisions to fund other initiatives (e.g.,
    using the Enhancement Fund to add to the universities’ R&D equipment in order to increase
    its commercial potential) will be made by the Resource Allocation Committee (which will
    include members of the PCI management team and representatives of the universities and
    local business, with a MO representative as an observer). Similarly, decisions to discontinue
    funding will be done transparently and based on analytical materials gathered by the
    management team.

19.	 The PCI will aim at full financial sustainability in the long-term, yet public resources
     will constitute indispensable support in the short- and medium-term. International
     experience shows that it usually takes around ten or more years for a TTO to become nearly
     or completely self-sufficient and that public funds play a facilitating role in their success. It
     is assumed that the PCI will generate increasing revenues, thus its dependency on public
     funds will diminish over time. The report sets the target break-even date for the PCI at year
     15 after the launch of its operations.

   Approximately PLN 70 million is needed to fund the launch and the initial five
20.	
   years of the PCI’s operations. The report also recommends a funding solution for the
   subsequent five-year period. The PCI will be funded from the Podkarpackie Regional
   Operational Program (ROP), which needs to be changed to accommodate the program. It is
   expected that during PCI’s initial five-year period, revenues generated from its activities will
   amount to 15% of its expense base. That percentage will gradually increase, allowing for the
   PCI to reach a break-even point after 15 years from its launch.

21.	This report is an interim milestone that will guide subsequent discussions on the
    implementation of the PCI model. Its conclusions and recommendations will be further
    validated and developed during the remainder of 2017.

14   Activity 1: Designing Regional Technology Transfer Office: Podkarpackie Center for Innovation
  This chapter describes demand and supply sides of the Podkarpackie innovation
  ecosystem. The main purpose is to present the current state of affairs in the region, shortly
  describe main players in the innovation field, and relationships between them. On the demand
  side, companies and local science parks’ perception of the current system are presented. An
  assessment of the current business-science collaboration is provided, potential collaboration
  areas are specified, and main obstacles to more effective cooperation are identified. The supply
  side focuses on the Podkarpackie universities. It describes available R&D equipment as well
  as entities at the universities that deal with technology transfer and thematic areas with high
  commercialization potential. Additionally, this chapter describes issues related to the “freeing
  up” of “20% of capacity” of the universities’ R&D equipment.




1.1 Demand side

  Podkarpackie companies seem to express high demand for selected R&D services. This
  observation is based on a number of interviews with local entrepreneurs as well as managers
  of two science and technology parks (Rzeszow and Mielec), representatives of two regional
  development agencies (Rzeszow and Mielec), personnel and representatives of the TTCs
  at Rzeszow University of Technology (RUT), Rzeszow University (RU) and the University of
  Information, Technology and Management (UITM), and selected researchers at the universities,
  who are involved in R&D collaboration with companies. Interviews were carried out with a
  selected group of 27 companies that either have a track record in technology transfer with local
  universities, or are strongly focused on innovation (the list of companies interviewed is included
  in the Appendix to this document). In general, these companies express interest in closer R&D
  collaboration with the universities, should the latter be able to use, at least partly, their R&D
  equipment for commercial purposes.

  The interviewed companies represent a wide variety of business areas. They range from
  young and small companies to large international corporations. The companies were selected
  in cooperation with RUT, RU and the Podkarpackie MO. The key criteria were the presence of
  R&D activities in the company (e.g., the presence of an R&D department), and/or experience
  in cooperating on research projects with the universities. R&D activities undertaken by the
  interviewed companies are typically closely related to their core business and their successful
  implementation ensures companies’ competitive position in the marketplace. The range of
  R&D activities pursued by companies varies from advanced materials engineering – both metal
  and plastic – to research on different types of coatings, electric materials, automation, robotics,
  chemistry, to new aeronautics engine construction. The size of corporate R&D departments
  differs as well, from small (a few people) to large corporate divisions employing hundreds of
  people. The corporate sample – although relatively small – appears to have covered sufficiently
  broad range of types of R&D work being pursued by private companies.2

  Current state of business-universities cooperation
  The interviewed businesses seem reasonably familiar with the type of R&D equipment
  at the Podkarpackie universities. Some companies currently engage in contract research
  projects involving the universities’ R&D equipment and infrastructure, usually on a limited
  scale. The majority of companies do not perform contract research projects that would use


  2
   According to GUS, 145 private companies are engaged in R&D activity in Podkarpackie, and the number of companies doing R&D work per
  100,000 of inhabitants (7.4) is below average for Poland (9.0)
                                                            1 - The current innovation ecosystem of Podkarpackie                    15
                     the universities’ R&D equipment, but would like to do so in the future. One of the reasons for
                     their current limited, or no use, usually is due to the companies’ perception that universities
                     are not allowed to use EU-financed equipment to perform commercial R&D activities. Until
                     recently, this has been true, but currently this situation changed (more information is provided
                     in the section on the rule about “20% of capacity” of R&D equipment). There is also a group of
                     businesses that cooperate sporadically with individual scientists acting as consultants, without
                     relying on university-based R&D equipment. Regardless of the extent and type of cooperation
                     with researchers, all of the interviewed companies seemed to be aware of the universities’ R&D
                     equipment and infrastructure; however, knowledge of what kind of specific research services
                     can be undertaken there and about the competences of researchers who could deliver these
                     services was much more limited among enterprises.

                     The companies have limited experience of ongoing, systematic cooperation with
                     local universities on the R&D front. Among the 27 companies interviewed in Podkarpackie,
                     around 30% have initiated cooperation with at least one university. The main reasons of the
                     relatively low number of cooperation projects – as pointed out by the companies – include: the
                     lack of marketing from academia’s side, formal difficulties in getting access to the EU-funded
                     R&D equipment, and the lack of flexibility in cooperation with researchers. A small group of
                     successful companies explained two reasons underlying examples of successful cooperation:
                     i) good personal relationships with university researchers (usually applicable to entrepreneurs
                     that used to study at the local universities), ii) presence of a researcher in a given department
                     or laboratory of a university, who is more business-oriented and open to collaboration with the
                     corporate sector. One of the best practice examples in this area is the cooperation between
                     Pratt & Whitney and RUT (see Box 1, below), though there are also numerous other examples
                     from outside of the aviation sector (for instance, in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors).



      Box 1        CASE EXAMPLE OF COOPERATION – PRATT & WHITNEY AND RUT

     Pratt & Whitney (P&W) is a leading global aviation company, a unit of United Technologies Corporation
     (UTC), operating its Polish unit in the Aviation Valley in Podkarpackie. P&W entered Poland in June 2015,
     although the UTC acquired a Polish jet engines manufacturing company (PZL) already in 2002. P&W has
     about 1400 employees in Poland and more than 50 employees work in their R&D department in Poland.

     The cooperation between P&W and RUT is continuous and has lasted since UTC purchased PZL. All R&D
     managers from P&W had graduated from RUT and there is continuous exchange of students and R&D
     workers between RUT and P&W. Moreover P&W was consulted when RUT was choosing R&D equipment
     and infrastructure for their labs. This has ensured that the R&D equipment and infrastructure at RUT reflects
     business and technology needs of the Aviation Valley companies.

     There have been many detailed examples of successful cooperation between P&W and RUT. Those examples
     include numerous joint research projects or research grants (P&W and RUT applied for those projects and
     grants jointly). Both parties are satisfied with the cooperation – RUT because it ensures that its students
     are offered the skills demanded by the private sector, and P&W because it allows them to access the R&D
     infrastructure they do not have in P&W labs. Examples of successful joint projects include materials research,
     jet engine blades design, coatings of the inside of the turbines, automation processes, and robots for the
     parts manufacturing plants.

                     Recent changes to EU regulations (“20% of capacity” rule) paves the way for stronger
                     business-science cooperation. Due to the fact that universities’ R&D equipment could not,
                     as a matter of principle, be used for commercial purposes (the universities bought it with a high

16      Activity 1: Designing Regional Technology Transfer Office: Podkarpackie Center for Innovation
financial contribution from EU funds), successful technology transfer collaboration examples
were limited. The collaboration was often limited to situations where i) a company could cover
the cost of materials used for research purposes but could not pay for the commercial use of the
equipment, or ii) a business and a university would jointly apply for R&D grants. The interviewees
pointed out that the constraints associated with EU-funded equipment have been a powerful
brake on the extent of R&D cooperation. Most times, companies did not even request R&D
services from the universities, since they knew that commercial utilization was not allowed. The
recent introduction of the “20% of capacity” rule is changing this situation. This rule refers to
R&D equipment and infrastructure financed from EU funds, and it allows for “ancillary” (i.e.,
commercial) use of up to 20% of equipment’s available capacity.3

There seems to be significant demand to use the “freed-up” R&D equipment. Although
present day cooperation between the Podkarpackie businesses and universities is neither
frequent, nor systematic in nature, all of the interviewed companies declared that, should
commercial use of the universities’ R&D equipment be allowed, they would use it more
extensively. A necessary condition for such increased demand is the existence of clear rules of the
game – i.e., transparent and competitive pricing, contractually guaranteed access (e.g., agreed
upon time slots when infrastructure is accessible for commercial use), as well as adherence to
committed deadlines.

Companies indicate several areas for potential R&D commercial cooperation with
universities. Podkarpackie universities own R&D assets that would be of high interest to
business. A list below presents a selection of areas where Podkarpackie businesses see potential
for closer R&D collaboration with universities. Detailed information on attractiveness to
businesses of a specific piece of R&D equipment is included in the R&D equipment database
(excerpts of this database are presented in Appendix 4):
•	   Chemical companies are interested in access to R&D facilities in the nanotechnology area
     (e.g., the laboratories at RU’s Centre for Microelectronics and Nanotechnologies);
•	   Metal engineering companies (especially in aerospace) show interest in the modern CNC
     laboratories at RUT;
•	   Companies in the aeronautics sector want access to the aerodynamic tunnel facility at RUT;
•	   Companies located in the Science and Technology Park in Rzeszow would to collaborate
     with the Park’s labs with metal 3D scanning and printing equipment, as well as advanced
     metal engineering machines.

Constraints and barriers to R&D cooperation – companies’ viewpoint
Companies usually name three key barriers that hamper business-research cooperation.
These constraints highlight differences in attitudes between entrepreneurs and researchers, and
they focus on processes that take place on the universities’ side. The three areas are as follows:

a)	 “Casual” (i.e. loose) time management by university counterparts
	Time management by university staff was the most often mentioned constraint by
    entrepreneurs experienced in cooperating with universities on the R&D front. Some companies
    complained about the amount of time required by researchers to prepare to start a project, or
    even decide whether they want to participate. There were situations when an entrepreneur
    wanted to quickly initiate a certain project within a specific area, and it took four months
    for a group of university workers to decide that they are not interested (or not competent
    enough) to undertake it. Other companies experienced the time management problem. In
    those cases, their university counterparts extended the duration it took to complete project
    milestones, while businesses worried about such impacts to the success of the project.

 Calculation of the “20% of capacity” depends on an adopted calculation methodology and each university can propose own approach. It seems
recommendable that all universities prepare a uniform methodology that would optimize potential use of the R&D equipment for commercial
purposes and that would be easy to monitor. For instance, the approach specifying 20% of nominal capacity could be a preferable solution
                                                            1 - The current innovation ecosystem of Podkarpackie                        17
                   b) 	 Inflexibility on intellectual property rights ownership
                   	    The second barrier is the ownership of intellectual property (IP) rights. University researchers
                        are motivated to develop R&D ideas by the prospect of having a percentage of the potential
                        future profits from the project. They therefore insist on securing IP rights to inventions or
                        research outcomes originating from contract research projects. On the other hand, businesses
                        argue that, since they are the ones funding contract research projects, they should be sole
                        owners of IP rights (after all, it is they who set goals of those R&D activities, fund them,
                        find commercial application for their results, and bear all the risks of commercializing the
                        outcome of the project). This is not a view typically shared by researchers, who usually
                        propose a 50/50 intellectual property rights split.


                   c)	 Poor management of processes and lack of results orientation
                   	The third barrier is the quality of process management by university staff. Often there are
                       no good practices in managing project processes within the university driven projects.
                       Entrepreneurs complain about the lack of dedication from research personnel – they have
                       no incentives to work long hours, especially close to deadlines and have little understanding
                       of the need for results (input vs. output orientation). It is fair to conclude that research staff
                       simply does not understand or appreciate the way in which commercial businesses operate.
                       Business and researchers speak different languages, and both sides do not exhibit the will
                       to alter their priorities and behavior.

                   Entrepreneurs also name other impediments, though less frequently. These include:
                   •	   Lack of a middleman function at the universities to guide entrepreneurs interested in joint
                        R&D projects in the right direction (despite all the efforts of the TTCs, some companies view
                        them as not having sufficient knowledge or “pull” to enable effective cooperation).
                   •	   The R&D offer of the Podkarpackie universities cannot be found easily. This issue concerns
                        not only finding the R&D equipment and infrastructure, but also access to an easy-to-search
                        list of research available for business.
                   •	   Some university laboratories do not meet the certification standards, and thus have only
                        limited usefulness to business from the commercial standpoint.


                   Summary observations and conclusions
                   At least two reasons give hope that business-university cooperation in Podkarpackie,
                   which capitalizes on the R&D equipment that will be freed up, will grow in the future.
                   First, all interviewed companies expressed willingness to increase their level of cooperation with
                   universities once the issue of access to R&D equipment is resolved. Companies that operate
                   in cluster functioniong in the Podkarpackie region are good examples of businesses looking
                   forward to this (see Box 2 for an example of the Aviation Valley Cluster).4 Second, a number
                   and value of R&D equipment estimated as having great commercial potential (“5”)5 is high at
                   both RU and RUT. Despite the fact that these findings are based on non-random and mostly
                   qualitative interviews, it can be concluded that under favorable circumstances, R&D equipment
                   owned by universities could be in high demand.

                   University TTCs’ performance on key technology transfer tasks could be enhanced by a
                   complementary regional entity focused on the demand for R&D. The type of key barriers
                   identified by Podkarpackie businesses that hamper their R&D collaboration with universities
                   indicates that the mediation role of TTCs and SPCs is viewed as being performed with a modest

  This is measured by actual expression of interest that businesses directed to universities and their TTCs

   level of success today. Some TTCs, to a large degree, focus their efforts on supporting university
   grant projects; others lack scale and funding. As a result, companies often do not understand
   TTCs’ functions and their potential usefulness. To address that, the TTCs should work on further
   strengthening their middleman capability and set specific goals to address some of the barriers
   (e.g., by continuing their educational role on IP rights issues). Second, the new regional-level TTO
   organization, (i.e., the PCI) could complement work performed by the TTCs in several ways. For
   example: representing the interest of businesses in their relations with the universities (especially
   helping to address various contractual matters), guiding companies on how to obtain required
   R&D services, pro-actively educating business on potential use of universities’ R&D equipment,
   and infrastructure (and thus stimulating demand for that equipment).


      Box 2         AVIATION VALLEY CLUSTER

    The Aviation Valley is one of the most successful clusters in Poland. It started in 2003, when 18 CEOs of
    companies in the aerospace sector decided to form a cluster. In 13 years, the cluster has grown and became
    a symbol of positive economic transformation. The number of members amounts to 137 companies, out of
    which most are small and medium-sized companies. Initially, 18 companies of the original cluster employed
    9,000 people; currently, cluster members employ 24,000 people in total. The annual sales of member
    companies have risen from 250 million USD in 2003 to two billion USD now.

    The cluster played an important role in facilitating the cooperation between the corporate sector and science
    researchers. First, due to the cooperation with RUT, the Aviation Valley helped RUT choose cutting edge R&D
    equipment, which will enable close business-academia cooperation in the future. Second, the Aviation Valley
    cooperated with the National Center for Research and Development to formulate the InnoLot Research
    Program – a sectoral, tailor-made program for companies in the aerospace industry. Third, the Aviation Valley
    helped build a consolidated education system that supports the development of aerospace companies
    in the Podkarpackie region. The system includes special courses at universities, colleges, high schools and
    primary schools. The Aviation Valley also modernized 13 practical educational centers in Podkarpackie at the
    cost of 13 million USD. Last but not least, the Aviation Valley helped set up the Aeropolis Science-Technology
    Park that focuses, among others, on the aviation industry.

    The cluster also cooperates with the local authorities. Thanks to this cooperation the aerospace industry has
    been selected as one of four Regional Smart Specializations of the Podkarpackie Region.

1.2 Supply side

   The R&D supply side in Podkarpackie is diversified and displays elements of excellence.
   This section presents a methodology for a systematic overview of the available R&D equipment
   and its commercialization potential. Areas with high R&D commercialization potential are listed,
   the issue of freeing up the 20% of capacity is explained in a greater detail, and estimates of
   revenue potential of this freed-up equipment are discussed. Finally, the university TTCs are
   presented in a greater detail.

   An assessment of the universities’ R&D resources requires a standardized approach and
   creation of a unified database. RU and RUT used different methods to describe their R&D
   infrastructure and equipment. To allow comparisons across different labs and universities and
                                                               1 - The current innovation ecosystem of Podkarpackie   19
                    to create a comprehensive and business friendly description of R&D equipment, the WB team
                    proposed a standardized template to universities and they adopted it (the template is provided
                    in the Appendix 9). On this basis, a unified database of the R&D equipment was initiated that
                    in a business-friendly manner gathers information about this equipmemt, indicates its potential
                    uses and people responsible for individual equipment.6 Appendix 10 provides an overview of
                    the R&D infrastructure and equipment at RUT and RU.

                    This database forms the basis for future record-keeping of information on the schools’
                    R&D equipment. The database describes approximately 30% of total R&D equipment at both
                    universities that possess the highest potential from the standpoint of likely business interest. It is
                    recommended that, once the database with R&D descriptions is complete, it should be publicly
                    available online, and access to it should be enhanced by a search engine optimization strategy
                    that facilitates high search results rankings and helps the Podkarpackie universities effectively
                    communicate its research capabilities to the business world and other potential partners.7

                    The database includes an assessment of expected demand from business for services
                    that could be provided on specific R&D equipment. To quantify this potential demand, a
                    scale of 1 to 5 was applied where “1” means R&D equipment that is the least attractive from the
                    commercialization perspective, and “5” represents R&D equipment that is the most attractive in
                    potential commercial uses. The scoring is based on the university staff’s perceived attractiveness
                    of the R&D equipment to potential commercial customers. The assessment was performed by the
                    laboratories’ management, based on actual track records of collaboration with the private sector
                    and conversations about potential utilization of this equipment. The assessments were subjective
                    and, in general, the overall level of self-assessment at RUT was more stringent (i.e., on average,
                    lower) than those at the RU. Despite the subjectivity of the scale, from a practical viewpoint,
                    the top two scores (4 and 5) provide a fairly accurate assessment of actual commercialization
                    potential of a given piece of equipment, although cross-comparisons between universities are
                    made difficult because of the differing standards used to assess commercialization potential.

                    The database could provide transparency and visibility to the potential commercial
                    uses of R&D equipment. The information included in the recommended format went far
                    beyond the data shared online8 by the universities thus far, and contained such additional
                    information as ancillary equipment without which a given piece of infrastructure cannot be
                    used, R&D equipment operators, main and ancillary uses of the equipment, the degree of actual
                    and potential commercial use, key industries likely to be the clients, potential ways to enhance
                    the value of the equipment (e.g., through certification), etc.

                    In describing the R&D equipment, the database uses language that is easily
                    understandable to business people. One of the goals of this newly initiated database is to
                    provide entrepreneurs with an overview of R&D capacity of universities. Such a tool has to be
                    written in clear and simple language, so entrepreneurs that are not researchers could use it for
                    their purposes. For that reason, the focus of the database is on benefits to business from the
                    potential use of a given piece of R&D equipment, rather than just descriptions of equipments’
                    technical attributes. This way of describing the R&D infrastructure and equipment is key to
                    proactively market the access to freed up R&D equipment in the future.


6
  Each of the universities’ organizational units (e.g., centers, labs, departments, etc.) was asked by the rectors (and the TTCs) to assist in the
process of completing the aforementioned information. World Bank and TTC teams were available on as-needed basis to perform these
activities. Subsequent work involved designing and implementing a template to describe these pieces of R&D equipment at both universities
that have the highest commercialization potential
7
  In addition to accessing information about available R&D equipment, businesses should be able to see a description of standardized,
structured services that can be performed on this equipment, their pricing terms, etc.
8
  The existing descriptions typically available on the websites of both university TTCs were not always complete and written in a language that
could be difficult for commercial clients to understand. This imperfect communication of what is available at the universities in terms of R&D
equipment and how businesses may use it seemed one of the major barriers limiting the university-business collaboration

Constraints and barriers to R&D cooperation – universities’ viewpoint
A misaligned incentive system for researchers is one of the reasons of ailing R&D
collaboration. Researchers are not encouraged to collaborate with the business on R&D;
such cooperation does not “benefit” the researchers when an assessment of their scientific
performance is conducted. This assessment is important as it is further translated into a score
of a university department/lab where a researcher works, and this departmental score is, in
turn, used by the university to allocate between departments/labs resources flowing from
the school’s general budget. Researchers “earn” more points for publishing papers in scientific
journals, hence their incentive system is oriented towards publishing and not towards R&D
collaboration with businesses.

Inability to utilize “20% of capacity” of the R&D equipment constitutes another
obstacle. The interviewed researchers indicate that because the R&D equipment is not freed-
up yet, they cannot use it for commercial collaboration with the private sector. Since a big
part of this equipment was purchased with high co-financing of the EU funds, the “20% of
capacity” rule has to be applied, prior to commercial utilization of the equipment. Researchers
also mention that only when the freeing-up is completed, a serious marketing effort of the
universities’ R&D offer could be undertaken, including for instance maintenance of a up-to-date
database describing the R&D equipment.

Different perceptions of the nature of R&D work also seem to hamper R&D cooperation.
The researchers point out that companies often do not understand their point of view. One of
examples provided by researchers is that companies expect from researchers to perform R&D
work in the framework of a too tight a schedule and budget. Companies tend to not understand
that R&D is a trial and error process that requires time and resources, which cannot be exactly
planned in advance. Another argument is that some companies’ requests for R&D work are
imprecise, suggesting that the entrepreneurs are not always fully aware of what they intend to
pursue or do not understand the R&D processes. Other entrepreneurs, on the other hand, are
said to expect specific results without paying attention to the fact that the R&D work may yield
different outcomes. Such differences, researchers say, make R&D collaboration with companies
difficult and not always tempting for universities.


Areas with high commercialization potential
RU’s four areas with the highest commercialization potential are: biotechnology,
agricultural sciences, material sciences, and medical science. The biotechnology
department is the only top-rated faculty at RU (A-rating). Its research focuses on genetics,
botany, animal reproduction, and ecotoxicology. The agricultural sciences faculty also has
commercialization potential, and this field is critical to the local economy. There are four institutes
within the agricultural science faculty, focusing on landscape architecture, plant biotechnology,
dairy technologies, and food economy. Material sciences are relatively new at RU, and comprise
13 institutes and laboratories, some of which dispose of modern, sophisticated R&D equipment.
Research focuses on such areas as nanotechnology, microelectronics, and magneto-transport.
In medical science, the university’s medical center has a strong R&D potential.

At RUT, the top four areas are: aviation and aeronautics, chemistry and composites,
construction materials, and mechanical gear/large scale machining. Aviation and
aeronautics have large commercialization potential, due to the sophisticated R&D equipment
and research and technical skills at the university, especially if collaboration with the Aviation
Valley is to intensify. Chemistry and composites is another field with high potential, due to top
R&D equipment for analysis of composites and experienced researchers. Moreover, RUT has a
good track record of collaboration with local businesses in both fields and they are competitive

                                                    1 - The current innovation ecosystem of Podkarpackie   21
                        in international markets thanks to their innovative products. The construction materials sector is
                        another promising commercialization area, because the RUT possesses both infrastructure and
                        capacity to conduct R&D work. There are a couple of pieces of R&D equipment demanded by
                        the market, and a number of R&D projects are on-going. Finally, mechanical gear and large-
                        scale metal machining also have high commercialization potential. The mechanical gear faculty
                        has a highly skilled academic staff, with lots of experience, good pro-business orientation, and
                        modern R&D lab equipment allowing for machining of high-precision parts.

                        Strong areas of the University of Information, Technology and Management (UITM) are
                        IT and cosmetology. In terms of R&D work, the UITM mostly focuses on development, rather
                        than research. The school has invested much less in the R&D equipment and infrastructure
                        during recent years than the other two schools, due it to its smaller size and different profile.
                        Because both public universities (RU, RUT) possess more R&D equipment than UITM, the
                        remaining of this chapter focuses on them.


                        Freeing up “20% of capacity” of the R&D equipment
                        To exploit the commercial potential of the R&D equipment, the universities have to
                        first free up the so-called “20% of capacity” of their equipment. The term “freeing-up of
                        R&D equipment” refers to the process of amending the contracts (annexing) to purchase R&D
                        equipment and accompanying infrastructure, which were to a large degree co-financed by EU
                        funds. Recent decisions by the European Commission make it possible to amend those contracts
                        in a way that allows “up to 20% of equipment’s capacity” be used for “non-essential purpose”
                        (ancillary). Because the equipment and infrastructure was purchased with the intention of being
                        used for primary research or educational purposes, in practice “non-essential purpose” means
                        the use of R&D equipment for applied research and commercial applications.

                        The Podkarpackie universities differ in their approach to freeing up the R&D equipment.
                        Both RU and RUT decided to amend (“annex”) their R&D equipment contracts, but each school
                        took a different approach to this process – this process is also commonly referred to as “annexation”.
                        RUT decided to amend contracts financed under both the Development of Eastern Poland
                        Operational Program (RPW; where the Polish Agency for Enterprise Development –PARP– is the
                        Managing Authority) and the Regional Operational Program (ROP) 2007-2013 (the Marshal Office
                        of the Podkarpackie region is the MA). The RU decided to amend only contract financed under
                        the ROP 2007-2013. The process of amending the contracts required the universities to describe
                        in detail the R&D equipment covered by the contracts they believed worthwhile to amend
                        and to identify the commercial potential of said equipment and infrastructure. Annexation also
                        requires calculation of a forecasted income stream that such freed up infrastructure is expected
                        to generate.

                        The different approaches to freeing up the R&D equipment most likely stem from
                        different situation at each of the universities. While reviewing their projects’ timelines
                        included in an original project documentation, RU calculated that the “durability period” for a
                        large part of the R&D infrastructure purchased under contracts with PARP (RPW) ends in 2017.
                        The RU assumed that this period ends after five years and is set to five years from the payments
                        of the last invoice for the purchase of the R&D infrastructure in the project. Hence, the RU
                        decided not to amend the RPW contracts; instead it chose to wait one more year and then (after
                        2017) be able to use this equipment for commercial purposes without having to worry about the
                        “20% of capacity” rule.9 As for the regionally managed ROP contracts, their durability period ends
                        in 2020, so the RU decided to amend contracts pertaining to two projects with R&D equipment
                        valued at PLN 55 million. The completion dates for “durability periods” at RUT fall between 2019
                        and 2022, so the university’s management decided to amend contracts pertaining to eight
                        projects funded from both RPW and ROP programs. The total amount of the “freed-up” R&D
                        infrastructure amounts to a combined PLN 81.6 million under both programs.

Revenue potential from commercialization
The RU’s TTC currently has two revenue sources that are estimated to bring in about
PLN 50-60 thousand revenues annually. The first source is derived from student recruitment
fees (a percentage from those fees are allocated to the TTC). The second source comes from
revenues generated from R&D commercialization. In general, revenues from commercialization
activities undertaken to date seems limited.

The envisaged revenue potential of the RU’s freed up infrastructure should be much
larger. An initial estimate of potential commercialization revenue that could be generated from
the 20% of R&D equipment capacity being freed-up amounts to PLN 3.5 million annually, in
the early period after the annexation. This estimate was developed by RU’s Finance Office as a
part of the annexation process of agreements for the purchase of R&D infrastructure that was
co-financed from European Union funds. No independent validation of this estimate has been
performed. The World Bank (WB) team assesses that the likely revenue potential of leveraging
the five-level10 R&D equipment appears to be significantly higher than the aforementioned
estimate of PLN 3.5 million per annum. A directional estimates for RU (as well as those made
for RUT, see below) are based on information acquired during interviews with companies and
universities’ personnel, however no statistically valid confirmation of these estimates has been
performed.

The envisaged revenue potential of the freed up infrastructure can make RUT revenues
from cooperating with business grow even faster. Initial estimates of commercialization
revenue generated from the 20% of R&D equipment capacity being freed-up hover around
PLN three million annually in the early period after annexation. The predicted revenues come
from ROP-financed equipment (predicted revenue amounts to PLN 2.85 million per annum)
and RPW-financed equipment (PLN 164 thousand per annum). These estimates have been
developed by RUT’s Chancellor’s Office as part of the preparation of annexes to the ROP and
RPW contracts with the Marshal Office and PARP, respectively. No independent validation of
these estimates has been performed. However, interviews and visits conducted by the WB
team at the RUT TTC, as well as with a number of RUT’s professors and researchers confirmed
interest in closer cooperation with businesses, as well as understanding what it takes to make
this cooperation work. These findings reinforce the view that freeing up R&D equipment can
get RUT revenues from collaborating with business to an entirely new level.


University TTCs – current status
The TTC at RUT employs 26 staff divided into four departments,11 some of which
perform “traditional” TTC activities and others provide support to grant projects. RUT
also owns an SPC that currently develops its activity. Most of RUT TTC employees focus on
acquiring research grants and managing their administration. As of 2016, more than half of its
staff (17 people) were engaged in this “project funding” activity. The rest of RUT’s TTC team (nine
people) work on addressing contract research from the corporate sector and IP issues. TTC’s
internal division is as follows:
•	   European Projects Department – nine people; the task of the department is to run the EU-
     funded research projects, i.e., to seek grants, educate and recruit research staff, prepare
     applications and contracts, provide the organizational structure to support the projects
     carried by the university, and provide documentation for the projects;
•	   National-level Projects Department – eight people; the department runs national-level,
     Polish-government-funded research projects similar to the European Project Department;
•	   Technology Transfer Department – five people; the role of the department is to be a ‘middle
     man’ between an industry partner and researchers; the department prepares the research
10
   This refers to the 1-5 scale used for the assessment of the R+D equipment that is provided in the database of the R&D equipment, 5 is the
highest score indicating the highest commercialization potential
11
   This section reflects status as of second half of 2016; after restructuring actions in 2017 the number of TTC employees has been reduced to
18 (as of May 2017)                                                1 - The current innovation ecosystem of Podkarpackie 23
                    offer for the private sector companies, monitors researchers’ projects and helps them
                    connect with companies;
               •	   Intellectual Property (IP) Department – four people; the department is engaged in legal
                    issues involving negotiation of IP rights, (their apportionment and pricing); a patent specialist
                    works on the team and is responsible for the preparation of patent applications.

               The operational model of RUT’s TTC differs from best-practice TTC models in some
               ways: There is no separate TTC budget and engagement is funded mostly from grants, and
               partly from the university’s budget. The TTC provides a wide variety of services, but its grant
               administration activity (performed by the two “projects” departments) does not fall under a
               typical technology transfer definition. TTC’s output (in terms of licenses sold, start-ups created
               or patents filed) in core technology transfer activities is somewhat constrained by its limited
               budget. The TTC annual budget in 2016 amounted to PLN 1.4 million; it did not cover all the
               ongoing expenses, moreover it was too small to build a strong, self-funding TTC. Given this
               small size of the budget, TTCs ability to generate about PLN 400 thousand in annual licensing
               revenues should be viewed as a success. The TTC has no marketing department and provides
               limited assistance to researchers and entrepreneurs in creating marketing strategies and
               pursuing business development opportunities. Some value-added services for RUT personnel
               are provided free of charge, e.g., the IP services and educational events. The TTC processes
               about 400 requests from the corporate sector per year, and coordinates and oversees contract
               research activity at the RUT even though some requests from business go directly to various
               units and labs of the RUT.

               The RU TTC has not yet achieved the scale it needs to operate successfully. Today, the
               total staff of the RU’s TTC is small: two full-time equivalents plus a part-time Deputy Director.
               It does not rely on a fully dedicated team and its members are part-time employed, with an
               exception of the full-time secretary.

               The financing model of the RU’s TTC does not seem optimal. There are at least three
               areas that could be addressed to enhance the TTC’s performance. The RU TTC does not have a
               separate budget that is not funded from grants. The source of current funding is a part of the
               university budget called “Rector’s reserve,” that covers unpredictable ad hoc expenses, and is
               not dedicated to systematically cover the TTC budget. The current budget does not cover all
               expenses. The expenses of the RU TTC amount to ca. PLN 100 thousand, whereas the budget
               covers around half, resulting in an annual deficit of around PLN 50 thousand.

               Setting up an SPC at the RU would enhance the commercialization potential. Currently
               the university does not have a SPC that would manage commercialization of the R&D results
               through the creation of spin-off companies (indirect commercialization) and equity participation
               in university-originated start-up companies. This activity could allow for better management
               and enhance revenues flowing from commercialization activities.

               Both TTCs have scope for improvement of their performance, e.g., by implementation
               of specific good practices. One solution would be to introduce key performance indicators
               (KPIs – performance measures of output) could be used to support management of the TTC.
               These comprise: i) total number of requests for support from business at the TTC level, which
               currently is an unknown, ii) total number of requests for support from businesses that go straight
               to professors or laboratories – the TTCs are aware that a part of contract research is conducted
               outside of TTC, but its size is unknown, and iii) total number of requests turned down or those
               that for some other reason did not lead to cooperation between a company and the university
               is not monitored and registered (this also means that the universities are unable to identify and
               quantify the reasons why the business’ requests did not result in projects). Setting up such KPIs
               would allow for better management and performance of the TTCs.

24   Activity 1: Designing Regional Technology Transfer Office: Podkarpackie Center for Innovation
TTCs at both universities can benefit from the creation of the PCI. It seems reasonable
to set up a new regional entity to ensure high quality of commercialization activities to support
both TTCs. The RU and RUT staff is largely university-oriented, as they tend to work with internal
research teams. It is critical that a more proactive and outward-looking approach to marketing
of universities’ R&D is prepared and implemented, especially with the expected increase in
volume of the commercial cooperation between companies and universities as a result of the
partial freeing up of the universities’ R&D equipment for commercial purposes. This could be
one of the PCI’s tasks. Moreover, professional experts will be crucial to perform high-quality
services in the area of contract research marketing. It also seems more effective and efficient to
establish a relatively small, highly competent commercialization team at the regional level, rather
than separately at each of the universities. Such a team would benefit from professionalization
and economies of scale and could serve both universities.

There is much to be done in the area of marketing of the freed-up R&D equipment in
the future. The necessary, but not sufficient, condition is finalization of the annexation process
with the MO and PARP. Second, proactive management and marketing of the universities’ R&D
equipment and infrastructure have to be put in place. Third, a joint marketing effort by the
RU and RUT (and other universities), or the future PCI, should rely on a set of new tools and
processes (e.g., a common database of equipment, jointly developed access procedures to R&D
equipment, compensation mechanisms, etc.).


IPR regulations in Poland
The Polish law provides a general framework for the issue of IP rights (IPR) for
inventions originating at the universities and the PCI will further work with the
universities to specify more detailed solutions.12 The law regulates the principles of
commercializing IP originating at the universities, it imposes an obligation on the universities
to enact detailed regulations on IP management, and sets the guidelines on division of profits
from commercialization. Article 86f of the Law on Higher Education specifies certain threshold
limits for the division of proceeds from commercialization (these limits cannot be modified by
individual university regulations):
•	      Minimum participation of the researcher (or a research team) in profits from commercialization
        done by their university (or its SPC) is to be at least 50% of the proceeds, reduced by no more
        than 25% of the costs directly attributable to such commercialization)
•	      The level of university participation in the profits from commercialization received by the
        researcher is set at 25% of the proceeds received by the researcher (or research team), reduced
        by no more than 25% of the directly attributable costs incurred by the employee

Individual universities devise their own specific regulations within the broad
framework of countrywide regulations. For instance, the Jagiellonian University in Cracow
has the following scheme for division of profits (“benefits”) from commercialization of university-
originated IP:
•	      Researcher(s): 50%
•	      Faculty or department from which the research team comes: 15%
•	      University central budget: 25%
•	      IP support fund: 10%

The PCI will work within the national legal framework and universities’ regulations
regarding the IPR proceeds. Since the PCI will, at one point in time, take over the responsibility
of funding the valorization of R&D projects (via grants), it is expected that a framework of PCI-

                    university agreements will be prepared to assure that the PCI is included in the division of
                    proceeds from commercialization. The PCI will act as an extension of the TTCs and SPCs in
                    performing valorization and commercialization work, which currently is limited, hence it should
                    be entitled to part of generated profits. Early discussions with both RUT and RU suggest that
                    such an “extenstion” role for the PCI would be welcome by the schools. The exact division of
                    proceeds from commercialization of IP will be the subject of detailed agreements between the
                    PCI and the universities (although an outline of such an agreement will be prepared with the
                    universities prior to the launch of the program and the selection of the PCI management team).




           1.3 R&D support activities in the
               Podkarpackie ecosystem
                    The PCI will help fill in gaps of the Podkarpackie innovation ecosystem. Table 2 presents
                    a selected list of activities that are important for the R&D collaboration between universities and
                    companies and their division between stakholders in Podkarpackie and which roles could be
                    performed by the PCI. Activities are grouped according to three platforms that are proposed in
                    the PCI model. The table indicates, which of the activities are currently well performed (green),
                    require significant strengthening (yellow) and are missing or require complete revamping (orange).
                    The PCI will have skills and resources to support the TTCs and SPCs in further developing their
                    capacity, and to fill in existing gaps. Further sections of this report will discuss all three activity
                    platforms and collaboration between the PCI, universities and their TTCs/SPCs.

Design Implications
for a Regional TTO




28   Activity 1: Designing Regional Technology Transfer Office: Podkarpackie Center for Innovation
This chapter discusses key principles of a TTO design that are derived from identified
best practices and a literature review, and presents their implications for the PCI design.
This discussion helps understand key directions and rationale for the recommendation presented
in this report regarding the PCI’s functions, governance, organization and financial structure.

The overall design principle is to complement and enhance existing structures, not
replace or compete with them. By law, each university or technology university in Poland must
have a TTC within their organizational structure, as well as a special purpose company as a fully
owned subsidiary.13 For instance, both RUT and RU each have a TTC organization, the RUT also
has a working SPC. Any proposed PCI solution must therefore complement the existing TTC and
SPC organizations (e.g., performing activities the TTCs and SPCs either do not offer, or provide
services to TTCs and SPCs in situations when their own offer or resources are weak or insufficient
or otherwise are limited by other regulations corresponding to public universities).

The EU Commission and the MO are prepared to provide funding to one new PCI
entity. The EU Commission made it clear that under no condition should such funding be
provided to multiple entities. New types of activities not provided by the existing TTCs and SPC
(such as valorization, creation of start-ups, specialized advisory, or operating student-oriented
prototyping facilities – see further chapters that explain these concepts) are best done in a
single, autonomous and well-resourced entity rather than building up duplicate structures at
each of the Podkarpackie schools.

The PCI design should reflect global and Polish best practices as well as avoid repetition
of mistakes made by others. Of several global TTO10 models analyzed, the LRD Leuven, the
Toulouse Technology Transfer (TTT) and the Aalto Design Factory (ADF) were selected as good
examples of successful TTO organizations (Leuven, Toulouse), and new ideas in TTO design (ADF).
Experience of some relatively long-established Polish TTCs was considered (e.g., at the Wroclaw
University of Science and Technology, Gdansk University of Technology, and AGH University of
Science and Technology), as well as some independent regional initiatives, which were meant
to complement the TTCs (e.g., the Pomeranian InnoBaltica or EIT+ in Wroclaw). In addition to
these real-life case examples, an extensive literature review of best practices in designing TTOs
was conducted and used when designing detailed concepts of PCI’s operations.

The PCI design should be adaptable to possible future changes. On the one hand, the process
of freeing up the R&D infrastructure is taking place and the PCI structure has to reflect its outcome.
On the other hand, should the law regulating IP issues change, to enable researchers to become
owners of IPR, such a situation should not require strong adjustment of the PCI’s basic activities,
business model, and organizational structure. Moreover, physical location of the PCI should offer
an easy access to the universities, which on the one hand will facilitate PCI’s team contact with
researchers, TTCs and SPCs, and on the other hand will encourage students to use PCI’s facilities.

   The purpose of the SPC is to manage the intellectual property rights of a given university. The SPC can create spin-off/spin-out firms which
are university’s IP and know-how

               2.1 PCI’s mission and objectives

                      The PCI’s mission is to provide an effective bridge between the region’s R&D providers
                      and users of that R&D. The PCI’s activities are to foster the culture of entrepreneurship at the
                      universities and be complementary to and supportive of work done by local TTCs and SPCs.
                      The PCI will accomplish this mission by performing three key functions that encompass the
                      following selected activities:

                      1. Valorization of university-sourced R&D projects:
                      •	   Select and nurture promising R&D projects, and help increase their level of technology
                           readiness (TRL) to prepare them for commercialization via licensing deals;
                      •	   Help incubate, accelerate, and fund (through microgrants) university spin-offs and start-ups;
                      •	   Facilitate access to business angel networks and assist in obtaining access to subsequent
                           rounds of venture capital funding (in case of successful projects);
                      •	   Perform specialized advisory for R&D projects to help them obtain grants from public
                           programs such as the Fast Track (by the National Center for Research and Development),
                           Horizon 2020, and ROP initiatives targeting R&D projects.

                      2. Structured contract research:
                      •	   Proactively re-sell and/or broker up to 20% of the capacity of the universities’ R&D equipment;
                      •	   Identify R&D needs of companies potentially willing to collaborate with Podkarpackie
                           universities.


                      3. Provision of the prototyping platform for students:
                      •	   Launch and operate a physical platform (the ProtoLab) for students and young researchers
                           to meet, learn, experiment;
                      •	   Proactively identify and organize joint university-corporate R&D projects.




             2.2 Good practices and practical examples

                      A successful and professional TTO requires a favorable environment to flourish. While
                      setting up a TTO, various organizational and financial aspects that match local circumstances
                      have to be accounted for. For instance, stakeholders need to be identified and relationships
                      must be established and developed, adequate core staff that is equipped with suitable skills is
                      needed to provide diversified services (since TTO’s in house capacity is important), outsourcing
                      should be carefully managed, information management is key, sufficient and stable budget
                      has to be ensured, a suitable business model is required, suitable incentives for researchers
                      should be in place (e.g., advisory support, trainings, financial benefits, appreciation), and student
                      entrepreneurship should be promoted.15 Box 3 presents 10 aspects that are important when
                      considering setting up a TTO.

15
     More information on these aspects are provided in Appendix 8

       Box 3         TEN THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT SETTING UP A TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER OFFICE

     The economic five:

                     Technology transfer will not make a university rich. A successful program will make a small profit but will not
          1          support the university. It will, however, provide many other benefits to the institution and the community.

                     Building a robust technology transfer program takes sustained financial investment. Investments are
          2          required to develop a patent portfolio, attract expert talent, and train office professionals.

                     It will likely take eight to ten years before your program stops losing money—and it may never make your
          3          institution any substantial amount. It takes time to build an IP portfolio, establish contacts, and develop skills in
                     technology transfer. Following the set up, the TTO may begin to make money.

                     It may take two decades or more before a university technology transfer program (including
          4          entrepreneurial spinouts) substantially affects the local economy. Impact in regional economic development
                     takes 20 to 30 years. Expecting substantial returns in a few years leads to underinvestment and disappointment.

                     The ultimate impact may be large—both economically and culturally—for the university, its graduates, and
          5          the community.

     The implementation five:

                     Sustained effort requires visible support—fiscal and otherwise—from senior administration. Senior
          6          management must not only lead the way, but also sustain the effort to change the culture of research and
                     investment.

                     Only senior administration can set the mission, policies, and priorities for the program. Clear mandates will
                     help technology transfer professionals choose among competing priorities and the ever-present trade-offs between
          7          business and academic values. These policies will ultimately help to define the university. They need to be clearly
                     stated, and supported from the top, so that technology transfer professionals can make the best decisions and
                     withstand pressure from competing interests.

                     Clear policies on IP ownership, the roles of researchers in interactions with industry, and other ground
                     rules should be set up before the program begins. Working out such policies in the middle of making deals leads
          8          to confusion and bureaucratic lethargy, slows down the learning process, and hurts a university’s reputation for being
                     able to consummate deals.

                     Conflicts of interest, both real and perceived, are inevitable. Clear policies and a well understood review and
          9          appeal process need to be put in place early. Much can be learned from the experience of others in the technology
                     transfer field. Again, support from senior administration is critical.

                     Technology transfer is a talent-based business. It is difficult to find people who can speak the two languages of
                     academia and industry and who also have the creativity to craft agreements that meet the needs of both sides. One
         10          should not underestimate the combination and level of skills required. These skills and experiences are very different
                     from those needed to conduct research.

The LRD Leuven is widely recognized as the top TTO in Europe. It began its operations
in the 1970s, and since then has seen continuous growth. The so-called virtuous circle of the
LRD is attributed to the following eight best practices developed over the 40+ years of LRD
operations:16
•	      Engagement: Start at the top. University leaders should send a signal that they are
        embracing technology transfer as a core role of the institution and engage with academics
        to build consensus.
•	      Autonomy: Structure the TTO as an autonomous unit of the university with the power to
        make legal contracts.
•	      Funding: Dedicate sufficient budget for at least three full-time equivalent professionals to
        set up and launch the TTO.
•	      Expertise: Hire professionals who understand industry and have experience in technology
        transfer. They should be facilitators and dealmakers who have experience bridging the
        university-industry divide.

               •	   Incentives: Design incentives that channel the rewards of engaging with industry back to
                    university researchers.
               •	   Industry collaboration: Focus first on industry collaboration to learn how it works. Do not
                    rush to develop spin-outs without first learning how to work with industry.
               •	   Service mentality: Provide excellent service to academics in every aspect of technology
                    transfer.
               •	   Catalyst role: Actively engage with researchers and industry, connect researchers within
                    the university, innovate on the job, avoid the role of rubber-stamping projects.




         2.3 Implications for the PCI

               The recommendations of this report directly address key best practices identified in
               the academic literature review as well as in practical lessons from the leading TTOs. For
               example:
               •	   The PCI program is developed with top-level managers of the leading regional
                    stakeholders, i.e., with university rectors, representatives of the MO and leading companies.
                    Their interest in and commitment to the PCI concept is built through collaborative work on
                    designing the details of the program and by piloting various elements of the PCI (where,
                    and when, possible) before the launch of the program.
               •	   The scope of the PCI’s activities covers typical areas, which good TTOs attempt
                    to address. In addition to the commercialization of R&D through start-ups, licensing, and
                    contract research, it should also stimulate student entrepreneurial activity, including business
                    projects.
               •	   Expectations on how soon the PCI will be able to break-even are managed carefully
                    and conservatively. The point at which revenues cover operating expenses is assumed to
                    be about 15 years, based on the experiences of successful TTOs.
               •	   Adequate funding is guaranteed for the first five years, and clear expectations on
                    the sustainable sources of funding for the next 5-10 years are outlined. Mechanisms
                    (e.g., the Trust Fund, funded with revenues from the first five years of the PCI’s operations) are
                    created to assure that a long-term planning perspective is applied to the funding strategy.
               •	   The PCI management team is accountable to the Supervisory Board and
                    shareholders. The management team has autonomy in operating the PCI and its contract
                    could be terminated in case of significant underperformance, defined in the contract with
                    the MO.
               •	   Strong stress is put on the “talent” issue from the beginning. Recommendations of
                    this report highlight the need for selecting a team with the best demonstrated competencies
                    one can find in Poland (or perhaps even within the EU), making sure the commitment of such
                    a team to Podkarpackie is strong and lasting. Appropriate, competitive, and performance-
                    oriented motivation schemes are planned for, making sure that best teams will be attracted
                    to the program to ensure the high quality service delivery for researchers and companies.

               Detailed preparatory work will be done on setting the ground rules of the game prior
               to the launch of the program (i.e., by developing upfront legal agreements governing the
               relationships between the PCI and universities, and their SPCs).

                       recommended by the WB assumes that for synergies and economies of scale and scope,
                       all three functions are better housed within one “umbrella” entity, i.e., within the PCI.
                       The overriding objective for the PCI is to become an important element of the ecosystem
                       for R&D, performing the functions and activities that are currently either missing or could be
                       reinforced in the region.




               3.1 Platform 1: R&D Project Valorization

                       Selection and nurturing of promising R&D projects will be a key activity of the PCI.
                       These will be R&D projects at Proof-of-Principle (PoP) and Proof-of-Concept (PoC) stages that are
                       mainly initiated at the local universities. The PCI will add value to these proposals in several ways:
                       •	   Increase the TRL of the projects (e.g., by providing external market and technical expertise)
                            from the level of approximately TRL 2-3, which is a standard technology level when a R&D
                            project leaves the basic research stage, to the TRL 6-9, which are close to commercialization
                            either via licensing (direct commercialization) or setting up a start-up company (indirect
                            commercialization)
                       •	   Prepare grant applications for obtaining financing for further R&D work that aim at raising the
                            projects’ TRL, e.g., from the Fast Track program run by the National Center for Research and
                            Development or EU’s Horizon2020 (synergy with the national, interregional and European
                            programs), as well as help attract external investors (e.g., venture funds, business angels)
                       •	   Provide advisory services (strategic and tactical) and hands-on assistance on securing the
                            intellectual property rights (IPR) position of the selected R&D projects
                       •	   Provide advisory services and hands-on assistance on business strategy, marketing, staffing
                            and business development to the selected R&D projects.

     Valorization is defined here as adding value to R&D projects via a combination of technical, business, IP, and funding assistance

34       Activity 1: Designing Regional Technology Transfer Office: Podkarpackie Center for Innovation
While providing the aforementioned activities, the PCI will fund selected R&D projects
via the microgrant mechanism that will be financed from the Podkarpackie ROP see
financing section in the Chapter 5 for greater detail). The PCI will act as a microgrant operator;
microgrants will be oriented towards developing R&D projects. They will be divided into two
broad categories, PoP microgrants and PoC microgrants. These will have different funding
caps and requirements. In general, though, it is envisaged that the application mechanism for
microgrants should be simple and not burdensome.

The exemplary process of the R&D project valorization will look as follows:
1.	 The PCI team, acting in collaboration with TTCs, will continuously follow R&D work
    performed at universities and potentially influence the behavior of researchers that could
    prohibit future commercialization or lower the commercial value of a potential R&D project,
    e.g., by premature publication of research results.
2.	 Promising R&D projects are selected and a PCI advisor, together with a researcher team
    (inventors), work to prepare the project for a hearing (several standard elements such as
    preliminary determination of IP issues, existence of the market for the invention, etc.).
3.	 The Resource Allocation Committee (RAC)18 makes a decision whether the PCI invests in the
    project, and if the decision is positive, then issues related to project development are agreed
    on, such as:
	a.	Resource allocation: in a form of time, know-how, cash, or all of these
	 b.	Project team: what kind of expertise the project requires to grow further
	c.	Commercialization path: usually one of two main options will be selected, either
 	  licensing (a preferred path19) or setting up a start-up company
	d.	Milestones: key short- and mid-term targets and development goals for the project		
 	  (or a start-up) are agreed upon.
4.	 A project team is formed. The team includes people with competencies such as: project
    management, business development, expertise in a given technology (mostly externally
    sourced), marketing, IP, etc. Experience from other successful TTOs show that the project
    team should have a stable core team and in source external expertise as needed.
5.	 The R&D project is developed (creation of value added by enhancing its TRL by the project
    team) and monitored, and the PCI’s Resource Allocation Committee periodically revisits
    decisions about resource allocation.
6.	 A commercialization process is initiated and ultimately it leads to signing a licensing
    agreement, or in the case of a start-up path, a project team manages the start-up portfolio
    and undertakes efforts to secure successive rounds of external financing and/or exit.

     Licensing is usually more flexible, less expensive and less risky to get invention to the market

                      Additional financial support by the PCI could further reinforce the valorization activity.
                      It is recommended for the PCI to have additional means to attract and retain in the Podkarpackie
                      region and further support potentially promising R&D projects originating outside of the
                      universities. One instrument could take a form of a micro grant for an R&D activity that would be
                      provided to a company by the PCI on the basis of a grant application, which would be assessed
                      in a light and swift procedure (an innovation voucher).




             3.2 Platform 2: Structured Contract Research

                      The structured contract research platform will concentrate on matching demand for and
                      supply of R&D. The supply side will mostly focus on the local universities (20% of the freed up
                      capacity20), while the demand side should encompass entities beyond the Podkarpackie region
                      and beyond Poland. Acting in accordance with its demand-driven mission, the PCI will not simply
                      act as an intermediary in the sale of R&D services provided by the universities, but instead it will
                      assist SMEs in purchasing these R&D services and assure the high quality level of such service. The
                      PCI will focus on a specific sub-segment of R&D services, namely ones that are of standardized
                      nature, hence the name “structured contract research”. This means that the PCI will not deal with
                      highly specialized, one-off research services that require intense preparatory work of researchers.
                      These expertise-based services will continue to be provided by the individual researchers and labs,
                      while the existing TTCs will continue to be the primary conduit for such work.

                      “Technology brokers” will proactively help match R&D demand and supply. Brokers will
                      be a dedicated team hired by the PCI that proactively reaches out to entrepreneurs (both local
                      and beyond Podkarpackie and Poland) to understand their R&D needs. The brokerage team
                      can serve as a primary link between the PCI and the corporate marketplace within the area of
                      structured contract research. The brokers will also complement work of the universities’ TTCs.
                      They will continuously collaborate with the universities to be up to date with ongoing research
                      and able to market it to entrepreneurs.

                      The PCI will operate as a business-friendly one-stop shop for entrepreneurs that need
                      R&D support. There are two advantages to why the PCI could perform such a function. Firstly,
                      thanks to the collaboration with all local universities (TTCs/SPCs), the technology brokers will
                      have a good overview of research performed there. Second, the PCI will possess resources that
                      could support further development of promising R&D projects (both via valorization and help
                      with finding consequent rounds of financing).

                      The PCI can help universities upgrade their R&D equipment via the “Enhancement
                      Fund”. The model assumes that the PCI will support the universities in identifying bottlenecks
                      and areas with high commercialization potential. The PCI will have at its disposal an “Enhancement
                      Fund” through which the PCI will be able to support universities in upgrading these pieces of
                      R&D equipment, where high potential demand for structured contract research exists but is
                      constrained by incomplete equipment.

                      Additional R&D staff could also be financed by the PCI. In situations where limited staff is a
                      restraining factor for increased structured contract research (especially when technical, not scientific
                      staff, is concerned), the PCI could finance such additional staff to fill in a capacity gap. For instance,
                      the PCI could pay for skilled technicians that would be placed in the SPC to service structured
                      contract research requests from companies during e.g., evening hours or academic holidays.

3.3 Platform 3: ProtoLab
  The ProtoLab is a physical space equipped with basic tools that allow constructing
  prototypes. The main idea behind the ProtoLab is to offer students and researchers an
  opportunity to learn and experiment with various production technologies. Students and
  young researchers will be able to build PoC prototypes resulting from their R&D projects, as
  well as learn using some basic equipment (e.g., electrical equipment, basic 3D printers, basic
  lathe, milling machines, etc.) which will be accessible 24 hours a day. Experimentation could be
  targeted at students’ and researchers’ own ideas or at real-life business or societal challenges
  sourced from the public and private sector. When more sophisticated equipment is needed,
  arrangements could be made with a university to use its facilities.

  Strong bottom-up demand for such a prototyping area exists. International experience,
  for instance Aalto Design Factory (ADF) in Finland, and interviews at Polish universities show
  that both students and faculty need a space where they can test ideas and gain hands-on
  experience in basic processing techniques. An example of SIMLE at the Gdansk Technology
  University, where such a prototyping area is located in a student dorm, shows that students
  are ready to pay extra premium to live is a building with access to the prototyping space (Box
  4). Consultations with students at the three local universtities confirmed their interest in such a
  facility and proved that students would be interested in not only co-developing this idea, but
  also co-managing its operations.

  Business also seems interested in the idea. The interviewed companies indicate that the
  ProtoLab offers them several promising opportunities. Firstly, interdisciplinary student teams
  can help solve real-life problems of companies, either during regular “courses” or competitions
  sponsored by companies. Second, firms’ collaboration with students could help them identify
  potential future employees and encourage students to apply for jobs. Third, the ProtoLab
  students are likely to come up with ideas for companies (as well as the public sector) to
  implement. Some companies indicated that they could be interested in contributing resources
  to co-finance specific activities of the ProtoLab, for instance student competitions oriented at
  areas relevant to companies’ operations.

  Ideally, the ProtoLab will facilitate collaboration between students from different
  schools and beyond. To ensure high uptake among students, universities could include
  interdisciplinary courses performed at the ProtoLab into their curricula. It should remain as open
  as possible to promote interdisciplinary. While closely linked with the universities, the ProtoLab
  could also attract students from other schools, such as vocational schools. Moreover, it could
  become a space for teaching young children basic manufacturing techniques and developing
  their manual skills and drive for experimentation.

  The ProtoLab requires a dedicated building that will be student-oriented. It is assumed
  that the ProtoLab will be located in a refurbished building. To allow an instant kick-off 1000-1500
  square meters is sufficient, and could expand over time to 2000-3000 square meters. Since a
  variety of the projects in different research/industry areas will be pursued in the ProtoLab, the
  space should include several different sub-labs (e.g., for 3D printing, lamination, electric work,
  mechanical processing, etc.). An area to display the results of the projects (i.e. working prototypes)
  and a shared common area for interaction should also be planned (e.g. a kitchen with a coffee
  machine). The ProtoLab could be, for instance, designed by art students and student-users
  should have a significant degree of freedom to remodel and adjust the space, as needed.

  The initial set-up could be basic. The ProtoLab definitely should not be a state-of-the-art
  facility.. Workshops will include aged equipment about to be sold by the universities or donated

                                            3 - Detailed description of activities to be performed by the PCI   37
                  by companies. This equipment should be supplemented by some selective purchases by the
                  PCI. The users of the ProtoLab should in principle supply any materials needed to build prototypes,
                  which would help them initiate contacts with business partners or future employees. In case such
                  cooperation is not possible the ProtoLab could help selected student projects obtain the materials.

                  Location seems crucial, ideally in proximity of student dorms and universities. The ease
                  of access by potential users should be one of the key factors for selecting the location for the
                  ProtoLab. Ideally, it should be placed close to dorms and universities to allow 24/7 access. It should
                  be well-connected to other parts of the city, and it would also benefit from a parking lot with
                  substantial bike parking space. Such a location should encourage students to utilize its premises
                  and stimulate socialization by extending the amount of time users spend inside the ProtoLab.

                  The ProtoLab has limited requirement for permanent staff. It seems that initially 2-3
                  people could operate the facility. A pro-active and student-oriented animator will be a key
                  for running the facility – a university scientific staff member would be perfect for such a role.
                  Then, one or two machine operators (supervisors) are required; these could be, for example,
                  trained students. The animator would coordinate outreach to companies to solicit potential
                  student projects. Supervisors would help students use tools, ensure safety, and teach students
                  processing techniques.

                  The PCI could operate the ProtoLab, while the ownership would stay with the
                  universities. It is assumed that the ProtoLab facility could be refurbished with the Podkarpackie
                  ROP resources. Similarly the funding for the first five years of the ProtoLab operations will be
                  provided from the ROP as part of the overall funding of the PCI. It is assumed that, like the PCI
                  itself, the ProtoLab will use a combination of public funding from the MO as well as fees from
                  sponsoring business and public entities.



     Box 4       SIMLE: A PROTOTYPING FACILITY AT THE GDANSK UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY

 There is a working example of creating a small prototyping facility at the Gdańsk University of Technology in Poland. In
 2014, the university signed an agreement with a local real estate developer. As the result of the cooperation, an old tenement house
 was converted into a small student dormitory. The real estate developer performed the construction work, and the final design of the
 facility was students’ responsibility. The dormitory was adapted and the prototyping space in the immediate vicinity was arranged.

 The ownership and responsibility for the space are the necessary conditions of boosting students’ creativity. The prototyping
 space is located in an old garrison club. It consists of several rooms connected with a wide corridor. Each room has a different function.
 Smaller rooms serve as storage spaces for different student groups working at the facility. Larger ones are being used to perform work
 such as laminating, painting, or sanding, interchangeably with assembly and construction activities. The total space of the facility is
 roughly 300 square meters which forms enough room for two student associations, one working on a flight simulator, and the other
 on racing water bikes and solar boats. Access to the facility is allowed 24/7. The students themselves have provided the majority of the
 manufacturing equipment available at the facility. Part of it comes from the university because it was outdated and withdrawn from
 duty. Students’ partners – companies cooperating with students, donated the rest of the equipment and materials. This way, students
 learn how to approach companies and establish business relations. The real estate developer owns the facility but the students were
 granted full control and responsibility over its design and arrangement. The general rules of use apply, but it is the students who
 manage the facility on an operational level.

 Participation in prototyping facilities influences students’ careers. Many participants of this prototyping facility see that they
 benefit greatly from this experience on many levels of their lives. Participation allows students to hone their manufacturing and team
 work skills. Using only basic tools, for example, students managed to design and construct a full-scale Cessna 172 simulator and several
 racing water bikes. Prototyping at SIMPLE teaches all the participants how to cooperate better and help create networks, e.g., some of
 the students already graduated, yet they are still supporting younger colleagues. By pursuing joint project at SIMLE, students learn to
 be self-sufficient, usually no one helped them acquire the equipment and materials, and they designed and manage the prototypying
 space on their own. Feedback from former students, who engaged in prototyping, indicates that experience they gained helped them
 find a good job and is still supporting their careers.

  The PCI team could support promising projects. Inventions and IP created by students
  usually belong to them. Hence, promising ideas could be analyzed and channeled to the
  valorization process by the PCI to further develop their business potential.




3.4 Complementarity with innovation programs
  The PCI complements the existing programs and instruments aimed at the innovation
  support. A number of instruments supporting innovation exist in Poland at the national and
  regional level that are mostly EU financed. The PCI was designed to fill in the gaps and reinforce
  existing measures.

  The PCI will act as a spring board to the European (Horizon 2020) and national level
  programs (Fast Track operated by the National Center for Research and Development).
  By supporting companies and local universities in application to these programs, the PCI will
  build up local capacity. The PCI will also reinforce the Alfa BRIdge program by pre-screening
  valuable R&D projects, developing them at the pre-seed and seed stages and then attracting
  external investors, for instance Alfa or Starter funds, to participate in further financing rounds.

  PCI will also support the macro-regional development of Eastern Poland. For instance
  the ProtoLab is likely to feed candidates to such initiatives as the Startup Platforms operated
  by the MoED. Students that experiment in the ProtoLab can come up with promising business
  ideas that need further nurturing to turn them it in a viable business. Accelerators such as StartUp
  Platforms could be well suited to provide coaching and help students develop business plans
  and minimum viable products for their companies.

  At the regional level, the PCI will support innovation programs by operating R&D-
  oriented grants (Proof of Principle and Proof of Concept grants). The grant program is an
  integral part of the ROP 2014-2020 and PCI’s expertise will help invest the ROP funds in the most
  promising R&D projects. This means that the PCI is not an additional source of public money
  for the R&D projects, but it helps channel money that is already designated to such programs.
  By encouraging experimentation among students and raising commercialization capacity and
  awareness at the universities, the PCI will also help other innovation supporting entities in the
  region, such as tech parks, incubators, etc., to perform their tasks. By operating the Enhancement
  Fund the PCI will be, at the margin, able to support universities’ R&D capacity. Such support
  will not interfere with regular financing of the universities that comes from the state budget,
  as the amounts from the Enhancement Fund will be relatively small when compared to these
  other sources and will be targeted at specific niche areas (e.g., additional technical staff, small
  upgrades of the existing R&D equipment etc.).

The PCI Governance
and Management
Team




40   Activity 1: Designing Regional Technology Transfer Office: Podkarpackie Center for Innovation
   The PCI will be set up as a legal entity subject to commercial law of Poland. This chapter
   describes recommended structural solutions for the PCI that relate to governance, relations with
   key local stakeholders, the questions of who is the team managing the PCI, and the selection
   process of such a team. As described in previous chapters, the PCI will run three distinct platforms
   (Valorization, Structured Contract Research, and the ProtoLab), but due to multiple synergies the
   “umbrella” entity (a management board) as well as the three platforms will all be housed under
   one roof in one PCI legal structure.

   While subject to the commercial law, the PCI should not be seen as an entity set up
   and run to maximize profits and pay off maximum-size dividends. During the initial years,
   the PCI will focus on increasing the implementation potential of R&D projects originating at
   local universities. It will do so by transferring public funding for those projects to universities
   and directly to research teams. In the longer term, revenues generated by the PCI from this
   commercialization activity will be used to fund its operations and, in this way, will be reinvested
   in the continued development of the Podkarpackie R&D ecosystem. It follows that, at least in
   the 5-10 year planning horizon, the PCI should have a budget that balances its expenses with
   the combination of the self-generated revenues and public funding, resulting in a neutral (zero)
   net profit outcome.21




4.1 Structural considerations
   The PCI can take a legal form of a foundation, association or corporation (a partnership,
   joint-stock, or limited liability company). These are three legally feasible solutions for the
   PCI that could be implemented. While this section presents arguments as to why a limited
   liability company is a preferred legal form for the PCI, the Appendix 7 discusses the limitations
   of the remaining legal solutions.

   The Polish Code of Commercial Companies22 distinguishes two main kinds of corporate
   legal entities: partnerships and companies. The companies themselves can take either limited
   joint stock or Limited Liability Company (LLC). Both the joint stock and the LLC forms have legal
   personality, and shareholders of such companies are not personally liable for company obligations.
   Transferability of shares is largely unlimited for both types of companies (unless articles of association
   or a shareholders agreement provide otherwise), thus the shareholders are, in principle, free to exit
   the company and reclaim their investments. Both forms also have separate governance bodies in
   their structures: a management board and a supervisory board (a supervisory board is an optional
   choice in a limited liability company), thus the shareholders do not run the business by themselves,
   but appoint and control selected agents.

   A limited liability company structure is recommended as the optimal form of business
   activity for the PCI. A form of a limited liability company is better suited for PCI than a joint-
   stock company. One of the reasons is transparency of the shareholding structure (unlike in a
   joint-stock company, where data on shareholders is typically not made public). Another reason is
   relative simplicity and lower cost of the limited liability structures (e.g., no need for a notary deed
   at GSM, and a potentially simpler procedure of making in-kind contributions to the company
   – e.g., no need for a specialized audit procedure, which is mandatory in joint stock companies).

      The incentive system for the private team running the PCI is discussed later in the chapter. The assumption here is that public funding is
   classified as “Non-operating revenue” from the financial statements perspective

                                                                            4 - The PCI governance and management team                       41
                   PCI set-up and shareholding
                   The PCI’s role as a professional regional interface unit, its function as a conduit for
                   EU funding managed by the MO, and its need for operational autonomy are three key
                   considerations influencing the possible ownership structure of the PCI. It is a regional
                   platform, set up to collaborate with several universities (Rzeszow University, Rzeszow University
                   of Technology, and University of Information, Technology and Management ), but not affiliated
                   with any of them. A sufficient level of autonomy for the PCI mangers, together with transparent
                   rules and good corporate governance practices seem key conditions to attract best in class
                   management teams to compete for this function. The candidate teams have to be assured that:23
                   •	    The governance of the PCI will be relatively free of political influences and considerations,
                         and that the performance of the team will be evaluated on objective criteria having to do
                         with the PCI mission and goals;
                   •	    Unless the team significantly underperforms over a sufficiently long (18-24 months) period
                         (i.e., at least 30% below initially agreed upon Key Performance Indicators), it should not be
                         easy to cancel the management contract (appropriate agreements employing the concepts
                         from the so-called Limited Partnership Agreements used by the private equity and venture
                         capital industries should be considered as example for structuring such contracts);
                   •	    Decisions to fund (or not to fund) specific R&D projects should be taken on merit, based on
                         analyses and recommendations of the PCI team, and according to clearly spelled out criteria.

                   An ideal design of the PCI shareholding structure would therefore be as follows:
                   •	    A private entity representing the future PCI management team (“Management Company”):
                         50%+ (a stake allowing an operational control of the entity) see Figure 4;
                   •	    The Podkarpackie Marshal Office: a 25%+ (a stake allowing for the so-called passive corporate
                         controls over key decisions – i.e., control over strategic decisions such as the sale of a company
                         or an acquisition of another, new share issues, etc.). The Podkarpackie MO should have the
                         so-called call option (“Call Option” defined later in this chapter) to purchase the stake of the
                         Management Company should the underperformance clause be invoked. Terms of such a
                         call option should be set upfront during the selection procedure of the private partner to run
                         the PCI. The existence of such a call option would allow the Marshal Office to intervene and
                         replace a poorly performing management team;
                   •	    Other potential stakeholders: minor stakes (combined stakes should add up to less than 25%):
                   	     •	The City of Rzeszow
                   	     •	   Local corporations
                   	     •	   Other parties

  Selected teams with experience in such R&D-focused programs as Innovative Economy Operational Program 3.1 and BRIdge Alfa were
interviewed. The presented key success factors is partly based on their feedback
42    Activity 1: Designing Regional Technology Transfer Office: Podkarpackie Center for Innovation
Despite the lack of local universities’ formal participation in the PCI shareholding
structure (mainly for the potential conflict of interest reasons; the universities will be
PCI’s main client), RUT, RU and UITM will have several mechanisms to use to ensure that
they are adequately involved in the PCI operations. These will include mainly the participation
in the Supervisory Board of the PCI and participation in the Resource Allocation Committee
(more details below). Given the prerogatives of the SB, and in particular the RAC (which is the
equivalent of an investment committee in a VC fund), the university representatives will have a
real, day-to-day influence on the operation of the PCI. The lack of formal, equity ownership in
the PCI should not be an obstacle in establishing a real involvement by the universities in the
operations of PCI. These mechanisms are both necessary and sufficient to ensure the appropriate
level of participation and buy-in into PCI activities by the Podkarpackie universities.

Given the envisioned concept of the PCI in the initial 5-10 years (i.e., an entity acting
as a pass-through for public funding and attempting to cover as much cost basis from
own-generated revenues), the initial capitalization of the PCI is not a major factor
influencing the design of the program. The initial capital of the PCI can be set, for example,
as low as PLN 10,000. Since the structure is designed not to be dividend-generating, and the
funding of the structure is, for all practical purposes, guaranteed for the first 5-10 years, the initial
capitalization seems to be of secondary importance.

The corporate structure of the PCI should give proper representation to all the
relevant stakeholders. Figure 5 presents a recommended corporate structure that is made
of General Shareholders Meetings (GSM), Supervisory Board, and Management Board. Besides
representation of the main stakeholders, a key feature of the structure is that it is acceptable
for the Management Company (representing the management team). The latter is responsible
for the quality of the PCI’s functioning because it is supposed to deliver skills, experience, and
competencies – core value added to the PCI.

An additional “Shareholders Agreement” seems to be a useful tool to regulate detailed
matters of day-to-day collaboration of the shareholders. Such an agreement, in addition
to corporate bylaws, can bind parties participating in the shareholding structure (in particular,
the Management Company and the MO). The Call Option, that is the situation when the MO
may want to acquire the PCI shares held by the Management Company in case of its significant

                                                               4 - The PCI governance and management team              43
                  underperformance, can be either written into corporate bylaws or regulated by the Shareholders
                  Agreement. The recommended solution is that the Shareholders Agreement covers the Call
                  Option and the specifics of when and how it can be invoked, while keeping the PCI corporate
                  bylaws relatively standard (registration of PCI corporate documents in Poland’s Share Registry,
                  or Krajowy Rejestr Sądowy, will likely be faster that way). In addition to the Call Option, the
                  Marshal Office will have typical rights of a significant (25%+) minority shareholder at the GSM,
                  such as blocking rights over key decisions – i.e., control over strategic decisions such as the sale
                  of the company or an acquisition of another, new share issues, etc.

                  Although the funding commitment of the MO is high, it is recommended that a private
                  party control 50+ percent of the shares (and votes) of the PCI. The main rationale is as
                  follows:
                  •	   Few good management teams will be attracted by terms that put them in situations where
                       their fate is determined by factors beyond their direct control. In particular, no good team
                       will bid for the privilege of operating the PCI if their contract could be annulled for reasons
                       having nothing to do with their actual performance;
                  •	   The MO will have the Call Option to replace any underperforming PCI management team
                       at a relatively low cost (making it possible to enact changes despite its minority stake at the
                       shareholding level);
                  •	   As a quid pro quo, the candidates for the role of managing the PCI should be prepared
                       to show their capability to attract (when needed) funding for the R&D projects being
                       commercialized, as well as some potential ‘skin-in-the-game’ (own resources to be co-
                       invested in projects moving past the seed stage). Some selected criteria for the selection of
                       the potential team are reviewed later in this chapter.


                  The Management Board and the Management Team
                  The success of the PCI will depend on the quality of the selected management team
                  (experience, track record, and competencies). This means that personnel with established
                  track records in commercialization of R&D projects (either through licensing or through start-
                  ups, but also with experience in contract research) will form the core of the PCI team. The formal
                  management structure of entities putting bids to manage the PCI is of secondary importance. At
                  the same time, an important requirement for the team will be their commitment to the program
                  by allocating needed amounts of time the ground in Podkarpackie.

                  Composition of the Management Board of the legal entity housing the PCI is less
                  crucial. The main issue is the quality of the so-called “Key Personnel”.24 A one to three person
                  Management Board, proposed by teams interested in running the PCI (and satisfying the
                  minimum formal requirements of the board management of Polish LLCs), should be enough
                  to satisfy the conditions of the selection process. Any private party interested in managing the
                  PCI should be able to field the team satisfying the conditions imposed by the MO in the open
                  competition to select the PCI manager. The size of the team will vary, starting with a small
                  initial core team, and expanding as the operations of the PCI (and the number of valorized R&D
                  projects) grow and gain traction (estimation is between 14-28 people – see below and Figure
                  6). It is expected that teams interested in managing the PCI should be able to display their
                  competencies and ability to source people in the following areas:
                  •	   The general management (1-2 people)
                  		The general management has the legal responsibility for PCI. It performs the corporate
                   	 duties and is charged with responsibilities as stipulated by the Code on Commercial
                   	Companies.

44   Activity 1: Designing Regional Technology Transfer Office: Podkarpackie Center for Innovation
•	 Valorization team (6-13 people)
		1-3 subject matter experts (technical background)
			                  Most of the technical expertise will be purchased by PCI on an as-needed
 		                  basis (i.e., after a given project team is launched and funded). In certain areas,
 		                  however, (e.g., biotechnology, composites, or other areas where local
 		                  universities have strong competencies) it could be advisable to build up in-
 		                  house expertise.
		1-2 Intellectual Property (IP) specialists (IP lawyers)
			                  As with the case of technical subject matter experts, most of the IP-related
 		                  work will be either outsourced or leveraged with the university staff. However,
 		                  examples of successful TTO teams suggest that it is advisable for the PCI to
 		                  also have in-house IP expertise.
		1-3 business development/marketing specialists
			                  Ideally business development personnel will also specialize in specific areas of
 		                  technology. Their number can grow over time as the number of valorized R&D
			                  projects increases.
		1-2 “boundary spanners”
			                  These are people that gather information, obtain feedback and perceptions
 		                  from the external environment through their stakeholder network, building
 		                  sustainable relationships across the boundaries, identify issues, influence, and
 		                  support.25
		2-3 specialists (by area) in structured contract research (“technology brokers”)
			                  The ideal profile for this function is a combination of technology/engineering
 		                  experience in a certain area and sales/marketing expertise (having an
 		                  extensive network of contacts in the corporate world is also a desirable asset).
 		                  People with experience and good track records in technology brokerage
 		                  would fit this profile well.
•	     The ProtoLab team (4-5 people)
		2 animators
			                  Managers with good exposure to the world of student associations and the
 		                  local businesses and other organizations. Capable of facilitating student
 		                  activity, organizing contests, carry out fundraising activity.
		2-3 technical support
			                  Persons capable of operating some of the equipment in the ProtoLab (e.g.,
 		                  the machining centers), as well as performing simple service/repairs on most
 		                  of the equipment.
•	     Administrative support staff (3-8 people)
		3-8 support staff
			                  Support staff will be necessary to administer issues related to valorization of
 		                  the R&D projects and structured contract research. They will deal with
 		                  issues such as filing documents and applications, keeping deadlines related to
 		                  patent applications, and general support to the PCI.

                    PCI’s General Shareholders’ Meeting and the Supervisory Board26
                    The Polish commercial companies law determines the key prerogatives of the General
                    Shareholders’ Meeting (GSM) and the Supervisory Board (SB). LLCs in Poland do not
                    require the establishment of the SB. However, given the potential number and variety of
                    shareholders, it is advisable that their representation in the form of SB is put in place. It also is
                    recommended that, to the largest extent possible, the corporate bylaws and regulations and
                    specific laws pertaining to such things as the GSM and the SB should follow the Polish Code on
                    Commercial Companies (the Code), and any exceptions should be used judiciously. In particular,
                    as the Code specifies, the GSM will have the prerogative to nominate and recall the members of
                    the Management Board of PCI.

                    The five-person Supervisory Board will have the typical board prerogatives and
                    responsibilities awarded to it by the Polish Code on Commercial Companies. Among
                    other duties, the SB will evaluate financial statements and make recommendations to the
                    GSM for their approval and prepare an annual SB report on its activities to the GSM. The SB
                    prerogatives will allow it to examine any corporate documents and inquire the management
                    board about various matters. It is also expected that the SB will hold periodic discussions about
                    the direction of the program and work with the management board on preparation of quarterly
                    and annual budgets, which it will approve. It will also be within the scope of SB’s prerogatives
                    to approve certain Management Board decisions that are of an unusual or extraordinary nature,
                    or having to do with activities not covered in the PCI budget, for instance:
                    •	   Expenditures or decisions about assumption of financial responsibilities exceeding certain

etc.) are not the subject of this report and will be developed as part of detailed planning for the launch of the PCI

       limits;
•	     Asset (e.g., IP, other intangible rights, real estate, etc.) disposals exceeding certain limits;
•	     Related party transactions, etc.

The ideal setup of the SB should allow for representation of each counterpart of the
PCI. A statutory minimum number of SB members are three. It is proposed that, in order to give
proper representation to various shareholders, and to assure that SB has independent board
members as well as the representation of the local universities, the PCI’s SB should initially have
the following five members:
•	     The Management Company will have the right to nominate two members (including the
       Chairman of the SB);
•	     The Marshal Office will have the right to nominate one member;
•	     The local universities will have the right to nominate one member;
•	     One SB member should be independent. A procedure to nominate the independent SB
       member should be made part of corporate bylaws.

The number of SB members may change in the future. Should other stakeholders, such as
the City of Rzeszow or local companies, acquire PCI shares allowing it to collectively own more
than 15% of the PCI shares, SB membership could expand to seven (in which case one additional
SB seat would be given to a representative of those shareholders, and one additional seat to a
representative of the Management Company).


Resource Allocation Committee
The Resource Allocation Committee (RAC) will be PCI’s main operational decision-
making body. The RAC will meet monthly and approve R&D project funding decisions (ranging
from PLN 50 thousand to PLN 1.5 million) regarding disbursements from the Enhancement and
Patent Funds (i.e., funds at the disposal of PCI designed to respectively enhance the commercial
attractiveness of universities’ R&D equipment, or assist project teams with patent filing and IP
protection), allocation of resources (people) to funded R&D projects, and assignment of research
microgrants. The RAC will be presented with recommendations from the PCI management
team to expand resources on certain R&D projects (or to cease funding them). The resource
allocation decisions can take a form of non-cash allocations (e.g., allocating an analyst to perform
a Freedom-to-Operate research27), or cash allocations (e.g., PLN 200 thousand to continue the
research and try to increase the TRL level of the funded project from TRL3 to TRL6). The PCI team
will present its recommendations to RAC in a structured form (the RAC will need to have an
analytical back up to make a decision).

RAC will consist of up to seven members:
•	     Two representatives of the PCI management team (one of the PCI representative will act as
       the Chairman of the RAC, and in situation of a split vote his/her vote will be decisive)
•	     A representative of the MO (with an observer status)
•	     Up to three representatives of the universities (one each)
	      •	   The rationale is to involve universities to a maximum extent in the operational
       	    decision-making processes; it is assumed that, once involved and seeing the benefits
       	    of a structured, analytical process, the universities will come to view the PCI as a natural
       	    extension of their activities and a primary go-to place for commercialization of their IP.
•	     One representative of the local businesses

     Freedom-to-Operate analysis aims at verifying whether the R&D project does not infringe on valid IP rights of others

                                                                           4 - The PCI governance and management team       47
                 It is important to properly set the financial motivations for the RAC members. Since the
                 RAC will operate on a monthly basis, non-PCI members of the RAC should be remunerated for
                 the time spent in the process.

                 Three types of decisions could be taken by the RAC when it is presented with a
                 recommendation from the management team. These are:
                 •	   Approve the R&D project funding recommendation from the PCI management team, or
                 •	   Disapprove and therefore discontinue the funding of the R&D project (this applies to R&D
                      projects that previously received funding, but which subsequently failed to meet certain
                      project milestones), or
                 •	   Postpone a decision and request additional information/analyses (such requests should be
                      made only once; the next RAC meeting should take a definite “go” vs. “no go” decision on
                      the funding of such a project).
                 RAC decisions about funding R&D projects (or discontinuation of such funding) are final (i.e.,
                 they cannot be overruled). The decisions may be conditioned, among others, on signing an
                 agreement with a university covering the questions of IP rights on a given project.




         4.2 Relationship between the PCI, SPCs and
         	universities
                 Business-university R&D collaboration requires assuring clear rules that are acceptable
                 for universities, researchers and companies. Without transparent regulations on access to the
                 R&D equipment or providing R&D services (quality, time, cost etc.), the TTCs/SPCs and brokers can
                 encounter problems when convincing corporations to engage in collaboration on R&D. The WB
                 team recommends signing two types of service level agreements, one between the universities
                 and their SPCs, and one between SPCs and the PCI (Figure 7).

A relationship between a university and its SPC has to be also clearly regulated. According
to article 86a of the Law on Higher Education, a university may form a LLC or a joint-stock company
with a purpose of commercializing research and experimental development. Such an entity has a
status of a Special Purpose Company. It should be separated from a founding institution by legal,
organizational, and financial means and should work as a business unit of an institution, being
responsible mainly for technology transfer and cooperation with the industry. The SPC should
obtain the right (ideally, an exclusive one28) to dispose of IP rights created at the universities, and use
this right to either pursue the path of direct commercialization via licensing (with the help of PCI), or
use it as an in-kind asset when following an indirect path of commercialization, i.e., when creating
a spin-off company (start-up). Such SPCs have one significant limitation concerning the legal status
of its shareholders: so far only universities can be shareholders of SPCs. Thus, participation of private
or public financing from non-research public entities such as public agencies or the State Treasury
is not allowed.

An SPC guarantees a university flexibility, which is important to establish a relationship
with the PCI. This is the primary reason why the direct commercial relationship will exist
between PCI and SPCs, and not between PCI and the universities. An SPC is not obliged to
act in accordance with the Polish Public Procurement Act, nor to pursue a public procurement
procedure when awarding contracts, despite the fact that an SPC is founded by public finance
sector entities (i.e., the university/ies). That is because an SPC is not established for the purpose
of meeting needs of ‘general interests’ (e.g., primarily education), which is one of the conditions
for the Public Procurement Act in this situation, but for the management of universities’ IP. Thus,
an SPC can freely engage its contractors, e.g., the team operating the PCI, to perform various
services, although some restrictions may be established by agreements with public institutions
such as the MO, Ministry of Science and Higher Education, or National Center for Research and
Development.

  Examples of best practices of European TTOs indicate that a relationship based on exclusivity, in a well-defined area, is one of the ingredients
of success
                                                                           4 - The PCI governance and management team                          49
               The SPC has to manage at least 20% of capacity of R&D equipment at the universities.
               It must be taken into account that, before a Service Level Agreement between the PCI and the
               university SPC is concluded, a university (or universities) needs to transfer certain rights pertaining
               to the use of their R&D equipment to an SPC (e.g., a purchase agreement) or give the SPC rights
               to “use and take benefits” (e.g., to issue license agreements allowing universities to earn profits
               from this activity). Without these university-SPC agreements, it will be difficult (if not impossible)
               for the PCI to enforce the SPCs performance requirements included in the SLA agreements.




         4.3 Profile of the PCI team and its selection

               The outcome of the selection process of the PCI team will define the PCI for the next 5-10
               years, therefore its quality is key. The selection process should be competitive and open for
               entities from Poland and other countries to participate (the idea is to select the best entity that will
               assure the optimal mix of track record and experience in the provision of services the PCI will deliver).
               The selection process should be performed by an independent board, whose members will include
               representatives of the Podkarpackie local government and universities, possibly representatives of
               the Ministry of Economic Development, as well as international experts. Detailed selection criteria
               and design of the selection process are not part of this report, which focuses mainly on the general
               profile of ideal candidates and directionally suggests ways to evaluate candidates (such detailed
               criteria, as well as detailed guidelines on process design, should be developed over the next few
               months in preparation for the launch of the PCI). The selected team (Management Company) will
               enter into a 10-year contract with the Podkarpackie MO, with an option for the Office to terminate
               it after five years (should certain minimum indicators of performance not be reached). Termination
               will be also possible after an extended period (usually defined as 12-18 months) of non-performance
               that will be defined in the contract between the MO and the PCI.

               Ideal candidates for the PCI staff should form a balanced mix of competencies from
               the worlds of applied research, seed investing, and general management. Candidates to
               manage PCI should be sought from among the best international teams managing R&D-focused
               seed funds (e.g., beneficiaries and candidates for the BRIdge Alfa program or the selected Smart
               Growth Operational Program (SGOP) 3.1 funds, technology brokers, university researchers (PhDs)
               with some commercialization and business experience, existing personnel of the TTCs, IP lawyers,
               etc.). The role of the Management Company will be to assemble a team of such individuals, while
               indicating the platform in which each of them would be deployed (i.e., Valorization, Structured
               Contract Research or the ProtoLab). An investment or managerial background in a university R&D
               environment will be preferable to a pure advisory background. Measurable indicators of the team’s
               experience (e.g., number of license agreements negotiated and license revenues generated from
               them, number of R&D intensive start-ups funded/advised, revenues generated from contract
               research, etc.) should be given significant weight in the selection criteria.

               The management team will be based in Podkarpackie, so the candidates will be expected
               to make a time commitment to the region. The management team does not have to be
               local during the selection process (the scope of search for a Management Company should be
               at international), although willingness to make a tangible time commitment to Podkarpackie
               (and over time transfer know-how: employ and train a certain threshold number of local key
               personnel) is crucial. An important consideration while selecting the team should be its ability
               to organize independent seed funding for promising R&D projects in the total amount of
               commitments around PLN 10-15 million (e.g., in the form of letters of intent from seed/venture
               capital funds and angel investors).
50   Activity 1: Designing Regional Technology Transfer Office: Podkarpackie Center for Innovation
The Podkarpackie MO should consider conducting a proactive process of selecting the
ideal candidate for the Management Company. Before publishing the conditions of the
competitive selection process, the MO should identify 10-20 potential institutional candidates to
manage the PCI (e.g., using the profile description provided earlier in this chapter), and meet with
those teams, explaining to them the goals of the program, judging the interest from the teams to
participate, and listening to feedback and potential concerns.


Incentives for the team managing the PCI
The remuneration model for the PCI is crucial for motivating the management team
to perform high quality work. The challenge in designing a model of remunerating the PCI
management team is to come up with a system that encourages participation of successful,
competent teams representing a good mix of managerial, investment, and advisory skills,
and discourages candidates with a pure advisory bias. The concept of the PCI, with its stress
on the provision of value-added services to R&D projects and the universities, as well as the
philosophy of the PCI serving as the funnel for mostly public funding of commercially-viable
R&D, poses some challenges for attracting management teams with the right motivation to
perform their job well. The question is whether the PCI’s mostly fee-for-service model will be
attractive enough for upside-oriented management teams that the MO would like to attract
to the program. The question is especially important since, for a foreseeable future, the PCI
is unlikely to turn an operating profit, and therefore, it is unlikely to generate any meaningful
dividends. The reverse side of the “upside” question (“will there be enough of an incentive for
the PCI management team to be truly performance-oriented?”) is the so-called “skin-in-the-
game” issue (“will the team’s remuneration be adversely affected if it underperforms and does
not achieve its results?”).

The motivation for good management teams to get involved in PCI is somewhat similar
to that present in such programs as the BRIdge Alfa or E-Pioneer. Good management
teams will be attracted to the PCI concept primarily by the opportunity to be present at the very
earliest stages of development of interesting R&D projects. They can profit by either investing
in them at the later stages (but any conflict of interest issues are resolved by the fact that they
act as co-investors only), or by getting remunerated on a transactional basis (for arranging the
additional external financing), when the PCI acts as an corporate finance advisor to a valorized
project. Having the assurance of the funding of the PCI for the first five years will help; with
such funding that is classified as non-operating revenues, the PCI will show at least a break-
even net profit result (will not be a loss making entity at the net profit level). With the proposed
mechanism of the Trust Fund, as well as the opportunity to work on the prospective funding
of the PCI by the local business and other entities (e.g., the city of Rzeszow), competent private
parties will see the PCI as a good value proposition to get engaged in (this has been tested with
several potential candidates for the role of the PCI operator).

Good practices TTOs suggest a simple performance compensation scheme. A
performance scheme for key team members that relies on a competitive (not too high relative
to a potential bonus) base salary, and offers a possibility of a sizeable (in comparison to the base,
e.g., 50-75%) quarterly or annual bonus tied to the accomplishment of tangible results may be a
feasible solution in Podkarpackie. Successful European TTOs (such as LRD in Leuven, Belgium, or
TTT in Toulouse, France) have a fairly “flat” reward system (e.g., the team members do not share
directly in the upside generated by successful licensing or start-up deals).

The underperformance penalty clause should motivate the management team to put
its best efforts in managing the PCI. The Management Company chosen to manage the
PCI will enter into a 10-year contract (with a possibility of cancellation after five years) with the
Podkarpackie MO. In addition to the sheer size of the contract, it should give the management
team a unique experience in the Polish university R&D space, alongside with a long-term
                                                             4 - The PCI governance and management team   51
                    potential to capitalize on its relationships with local universities and the rich Podkarpackie
                    ecosystem of innovative companies. The very status of being the operator of the ProtoLab can
                    give the management team potential visibility and access to a stream of innovative projects
                    and opportunities originating among students and young researchers. On the other hand,
                    underperformance for a sufficiently long period of time, e.g., 12-18 months (counted from the
                    first quarterly or semiannual report), can cause the MO to pull out of the contract and to invoke
                    their right to execute the Call Option, buy-out, and replace the Management Company. Such
                    “underperformance penalty” clause, as well as potential reputational implications, should be a
                    sufficient disincentive to good teams for not putting their best effort into the PCI management
                    task. An additional financial incentive could be also considered to increase Management Team’s
                    “skin-in-the-game”.

                    Participation in the valorization process gives the management team a unique
                    opportunity to observe and invest in most promising projects. By requiring that the
                    selected Management Company demonstrate the ability to organize seed financing for
                    successful projects, and giving the members of the Management Company an opportunity to
                    co-invest their own money in the most successful R&D projects originating at the PCI at the
                    post-seed stage29, the program presents an attractive proposition to the management team.
                    The team will have an ample opportunity to help a given R&D project progress through most
                    risky stages of its development, so when most of the product risks have been addressed, the
                    team should be in a good position to make an informed investment decision.30

                    PCI will organize and facilitate third-party investments in valorized R&D projects.
                    PCI’s own investments (if any) will come only in later stages of the project’s lifecycle, and in
                    such cases it will be the third-party investor that will set pricing and other terms of potential
                    capital raising rounds. Any potential conflicts of interest for PCI are thus eliminated. R&D projects
                    receive funding supervised and organized by PCI in three stages. In the first stage PCI (with the
                    approval of the Resource Allocation Committee) allocates a microgrant to the project, typically
                    to get it to the Proof-of-Principle stage. In the second stage PCI organizes a seed round of
                    financing (e.g., through BRIdge Alfa type seed funds), typically to achieve a Proof-of-Concept
                    and initial stages of commercialization of products that result from the R&D project. In the third
                    stage growth/expansion type of finance (otherwise classified as pre-A or A series) is sought for
                    the project. At this third stage investors are sought jointly by the PCI and the seed fund. The PCI
                    design foresees that at this stage it would be possible for PCI managers to participate in the
                    financing, but not as lead investors. It follows then that the terms of such investments would be
                    set by new pre-A or A round investors, and not by PCI managers. Such definition of the role of
                    PCI removes any potential for conflict of interest: PCI managers and investors would be at most
                    co-investors in any further rounds and would have no significant influence on the terms of such
                    investment rounds.




29
   To avoid conflict of interest, the PCI management team will be able to invest own money but not as a lead investor setting the terms, but
rather as a passive coinvestor
30
   It should be noted that, in any case, a co-investor setting key terms of such a transaction would be required to avoid potential conflict of
interest issues

                                                 7 - Economic and Financial Analysis   53
                               The good practices review suggests that the revenues of TTOs tend to rise slowly over
                               first 5-10 years of operations. The funding model for the PCI’s initial 10 years of operations
                               includes a mix of public money and revenues generated from the PCI’s activities. A 10-
                               year planning horizon is assumed in this report because this is the proposed duration of the
                               management contract for a management team selected through a competitive procedure. Over
                               the initial five-year period, the coverage ratio of its cost base by revenues generated from its
                               core activities is expected to reach 26%. After a 10-year period, the PCI is projected to reach the
                               point where it covers 55%31. These parameters are in line with the historical track record of some
                               of the most successful European TTOs. Extrapolating from this base of experience, and taking
                               into account the expected inflexion point in the revenue “J-curve” of typical TTO operations (see
                               Figure 8, below), during the following five years (beginning in 2028 and onwards) a substantial
                               take-off in the performance of the PCI can be anticipated. This will result in PCI reaching the
                               break-even point (the situation when cash revenues cover cash expenses for a given year) in
                               years 15-18 after the launch of PCI, or between 2032 and 2035.

                         5.1 Expenses in the 2018-2022 period33

                               The first five years of PCI operations will be funded mostly from the ROP managed by the
                               MO.34 The following Table 3 illustrates preliminary high-level budget of the PCI in the initial five
                               years of operations (it is assumed that the projections assume an average level of performance
                               indicators, i.e., the management team is meeting assumed performance targets – e.g., in terms of a
                               number of valorized projects, but not necessarily exceeding them):


31
   The 26% is the projected percentage of coverage (i.e., the portion of expense base covered by own-generated revenues) in year 2022. For
the entire period between 2017 and 2022 the average percentage of coverage is forecast at 15%
32
   Developed based on interviews with the LRD Leuven managers
33
   The report presents a baseline scenario that assumes neither a rapid growth of revenues, which would make the PCI profitable within the
first five to seven years, nor a flat revenue trend that would not allow achieving the break-even point within first two decades
34
   The Podkarpackie ROP will be modified to accommodate funding for the first 5 years of PCI operations

                   Personnel expenses
                   The Management Board and its Office are the most important category in the PCI
                   budget. The employees in charge of managing the umbrella PCI organization will include
                   two senior people (MB) and one junior assistant (OMB). Table 3 totals for this category cover
                   complete (base and bonus) average gross monthly pay for the three-person team (MB and
                   OMB) of about PLN 22 thousand per month per person in the first year of operations, gradually
                   increasing to a monthly PLN 33 thousand per person in year five of the contract to manage PCI.
                   While high by Podkarpackie (and public sector) standards, the year one compensation can be
                   considered at best average for good-performing Polish high-technology management teams.
                   It is assumed that the teams will view the first few years as a warm-up period, designed to build
                   networks, relationships, and get a feel for the potential pipeline of projects. Hence it is expected
                   that they will accept relatively low compensation in initial years in anticipation of the ramp up
                   of PCI operations (which should increase their chance of earning higher performance bonuses).

                   It is key that the Valorization team employs top-notch people. The initial team will be just
                   two people, but over the five-year period, from 2018 through 2022, the core team will grow
                   to six people. Gross compensation levels of around PLN 20 thousand per month per person
                   (combined gross base salary and bonus) are assumed for a team which will include marketing
                   experts, “boundary spanners”, as well as technology and IP specialists.

                   The headcount in the structured contract research team should grow steadily over
                   time. Starting at two people initially, the team will increase in size to three people in year 2020
                   and stay at that level through the end of the first five-year period. The volume of demand from
                   the companies should determine the number of people in the Structured Contract Research
                   team. Compensation levels are assumed to be comparable to those of the Valorization team.

                   The ProtoLab may need to hire trained people to operate certain equipment. The levels
                   of the animators’ wages are assumed at no more than PLN 15 thousand gross pay (base salary
                   plus bonus) per person. This budget category covers the employment of up to two technical
                   personnel (compensated at under month gross pay), whose task will be to supervise the use
                   of the basic equipment which, for safety reasons, cannot be used by students alone, as well as
                   providing basic training for the students who are not yet able to operate certain equipment. The
                   technicians will also provide basic service and maintenance on the entire set of the ProtoLab’s
                   tools and equipment.

                   Running a regional TTO that is to invest EU funds will require significant staff hours
                   handling administrative duties. The General and Administrative Expenses cover a variety
                   of administrative costs, such as office rental,35 utilities, administrative support, office supplies,
                   finance and accounting, and basic legal services. In addition, a back office for microgrant
                   administration and supporting projects being valorized will also fall into the scope of G&A
                   activities (e.g., dealing with microgrant documentation, cooperation with the universities on the
                   status of patent applications, participating in the governance processes of start-ups – General
                   Stakeholder Meetings, Supervisory Board meetings, etc.).


                   Platform 1 – Valorization unit
                   It is important to support R&D projects at low-levels of technology readiness (i.e. TRL
                   2-4). The PoP microgrants (budgeted between PLN 3-4 million per annum - Table 3) is designed
                   to provide interim bridge funding to promising R&D projects entering the “Valley-of-Death” zone
                   (i.e. reaching the point where the research is no longer fundable by universities as basic research,
                   but no funding for commercialization has been obtained yet). This category can be used to
                   continue promising projects’ research momentum until the Resource Allocation Committee

35
  If the rental space is co-located with the ProtoLab, it is possible that such expenses could be treated as revenues for the ProtoLab. This
possibility has not been reflected in the revenue projections, though
56   Activity 1: Designing Regional Technology Transfer Office: Podkarpackie Center for Innovation
reaches a decision on further funding (i.e. until full research into market potential or competitive/
Freedom-to-Operate situation has been performed and a microgrant disbursement decision is
taken). The PoP microgrant category is designed to fund personnel expenses and it is expected
that typical funding allocations will range from PLN 30 to 100 thousand.

The PCI is expected to outsource a number of services. It will rely on a relatively small core
(permanent) staff and leverage this core team with external resources on an as needed basis
(details in the chapter 4.1). In particular, one can expect extensive reliance on external resources
when it comes to staffing valorized R&D projects with project managers, external technology
experts and business/marketing experts. Other types of services that could be outsourced
include human resources/recruiting (e.g., for start-ups), small market research projects, Freedom-
to-Operate studies, external research requiring specialized equipment, etc.

Microgrants at the Proof-of-Concept level remain one of the most important
valorization tools. The microgrants will be awarded to promising R&D projects based on
decisions of the Resource Allocation Committee (those decisions, in turn, will be taken after
a recommendation to award a microgrant to a given project is made by the PCI valorization
team). The PCI team will then monitor and administer the way in which the microgrant is being
used, and the performance of the recipient project. For the purpose of budgeting the program,
it is hereby assumed that, in a typical year, several PoC microgrant disbursements are made, and
that a single PoC allocation can range from PLN 50 thousand to 1.5 million. As the program gets
under way, up to 20 such PoC microgrants could be awarded annually (e.g., in year 2022 an
amount of PLN 4.5 million could be disbursed on promising Podkarpackie-area R&D projects).

One of the expected constraints in the commercialization process is the patenting
activity. The Patent Fund, budgeted not to exceed PLN 0.81 million annually, is supposed to
supplement money available at the Podkarpackie universities for patenting activity. It will be
used as part of the Valorization platform in situations when obtaining university TTC IP services
is difficult or impossible (e.g., for early stages of the IP protection process), or where external IP
expertise (e.g., from area-specialized patent lawyers) is necessary. The Patent Fund is expected
to help streamline patenting activities needed to commercialize.


Platform 2 – Structured Contract Research
In order to establish a long-term relationship resulting in a high volume of contract
research, a good research offer is necessary. It is assumed that the universities (through
their SPCs) should be the ones turning a description of their R&D equipment into a description
of the commercially available research offering. Such an offering would specify what type
of standardized (or structured) contract research would be provided (quality specifications,
conditions, etc.), and at what prices.

The Enhancement Fund will make the R&D equipment more competitive. The
Enhancement Fund will be used as part of the Structured Contract Research platform to
enhance the value of the R&D equipment being freed up for ancillary (i.e. commercial) use. The
Fund will be used to address the most common barriers to such commercialization, including:
•	   Cover the cost of procedures/personnel necessary to obtain certification for a given piece
     of R&D equipment. Obtaining such certification (or attestation) will enable universities to
     sell services performed on such equipment, and thus substantially broaden the commercial
     attractiveness of a given piece of R&D equipment.
•	   Hire and train additional technical personnel needed to operate a given piece of equipment.
     If the barrier to provision of commercial R&D services on a given piece of equipment is that
     no personnel is available to operate it (e.g., after normal school hours), the Enhancement
     Fund can be used to fund the acquisition and training of extra personnel, and thus eliminate
     this barrier.
•	   Fund marketing activities designed to better communicate the research service offering of

                                                                                     5 - The PCI funding model   57
                           the universities. This could include such items as redesigning the websites of the universities/
                           TTCs, production of marketing brochures, participation in trade events (participation fees,
                           display costs, travel expenses, etc.).

                      The Enhancement Fund should be focused on the most profitable investments. Given the
                      variety of activities that may be funded from the Enhancement Fund, budgeting its projected
                      size is subject to rough estimation. It is assumed that, given the magnitude of potential revenues,
                      which can be generated on the basis of the R&D equipment being freed up, PLN 1.8 million
                      annually is an appropriate size for this category’s expense.


                      Platform 3 – The ProtoLab
                      The ProtoLab will require a renovation of an old building and its adaptation for this
                      purpose. It is important that the concept of the ProtoLab is implemented relatively soon after
                      the start of the PCI (in practice, within a year of its launch). As a result, an adaptation of an
                      existing building seems to be a preferable option to that of a new building. Since no specific
                      potential location for the ProtoLab has yet been selected,36 estimating the cost of any renovation
                      and adaptation work can only be preliminary. The PCI budget assumes that a gross amount
                      of PLN 1.52 million will be sufficient to cover the cost of adapting a 1000-1500 square meter
                      building (resulting in the implied cost of about PLN 1500 per square meter; such cost should be
                      adequate to allow for fairly substantial building improvements to be performed).

                      Apart from the building, the ProtoLab will require an investment in basic equipment
                      and tools, and a continuous purchases of materials. In a different section, this report covers
                      the question of the type of equipment that will be used to provide the ProtoLab with basic core
                      functionalities (i.e. standard metal machining centers, 3D printers, woodworking tools, laminating
                      facilities, etc.). CAD software will also be made available, along with some computers on which
                      it can run. Since various student societies at the Podkarpackie-area universities today have
                      access to specialized tools, it is assumed that PCI should invest in basic (rather than specialized)
                      equipment, and expand its equipment base as demand for its services (and popularity among
                      students) grows. As a result, the budget for the ProtoLab assumes that less than PLN three million
                      during the two initial years will be spent on equipment purchases. In addition, universities and
                      local businesses will be asked to contribute any working equipment they may be considering to
                      retire, thus allowing for inexpensive additions to the ProtoLab equipment base. In principle the
                      students will have to obtain materials themselves, thus initiating contacts with business partners
                      and possible future employers. This system proved to work well in other structures similar to the
                      ProtoLab. In case the materials are difficult to obtain the ProtoLab will have a budget for such
                      purchases at its disposal.




              5.2 Revenues for years 2018-2022 and 2023-2027

                      The proposed funding model assumes that the sources of revenues for the PCI will be
                      diversified. The revenues generated by PCI will come from five main sources: (1) commissions
                      on licensing activity; (2) proceeds from start-ups; (3) revenues (retainers and success fees) from
                      grant applications for R&D projects by companies and universities; (4) commissions on structured
                      contract research contracts; (5) payments to The ProtoLab from local companies. While other
                      types of revenues may appear gradually (e.g., payments from universities for certain valorization
                      services), they are not budgeted in the timeframe of 2018-2027.

 The most important revenue stream is licensing commissions. Today’s licensing activity
 at the Podkarpackie universities generates marginal revenues (combined revenues generated
 from licensing by the local schools are under PLN 0.5 million per annum), which leaves much
 room for improvement and a possible opportunity for the PCI. It is highly desirable to entrust
 the PCI to be the Podkarpackie universities’ exclusive representative in bringing the valorized
 R&D projects to the stage when they are ready for license deals (i.e. to near the TRL 8-9). The
 PCI revenue model assumes that this recommendation is accepted, and that PCI retains 10% of
 the license payments by companies as its sales commission. Revenue budget assumptions call
 for a slow ramp-up of the licensing activity (i.e. no revenues for PCI in the initial two years, and
 slow ramp-up afterwards). In the longer period (toward the tenth year of the planning horizon),
 provisions from licensing are likely to become the main source of PCI revenues, contributing
 close to 50% of its revenue base.

                      Proceeds from start-ups may bring in high, yet more unstable, revenues. It is not
                      expected that PCI will ever become a significant shareholder of start-ups created as part of the
                      valorization processes. Minor stakes (up to 10%) in start-up companies will be taken up in-lieu of
                      cash for services delivered to founder teams and/or to start-ups themselves (typically PCI may
                      receive a status of the so-called late founder). Since it takes 4-10 years for a typical start-up to
                      allow for its shareholders to receive any cash proceeds from their investments (more frequently
                      through the sale of shares rather than dividends). The PCI revenue projection assumes only one
                      such liquidity event toward the end of the first five years of PCI operations (2018-2022), and
                      three during the next five years (2023-2027). In all of these cases, valuations in exit transactions
                      are assumed to be average for the Polish pre-A and A-round38 deals (i.e., between PLN 10 million
                      and PLN 20 million for 100% of the start-up’s shares). Finally, it is assumed that PCI would be
                      allowed to at least partly cash in their shares in such transactions (i.e., at least some transactions
                      are buy-outs; rounds pre-A and A are mostly concentrated on capital-raising, not on providing
                      liquidity to existing shareholders).

                      The PCI will also profit from offering services in writing grant applications for R&D
                      projects for the business and universities. As part of the valorization activities, the PCI team
                      will assist various businesses (local firms, but also other Polish companies), as well as the local
                      universities in professional preparation of grant applications for R&D projects. The team will
                      aid in performing needed analyses on market definition and research, IP questions, return-on-
                      investment calculations, etc., in order to prepare applications to programs such as Fast Track
                      (managed by the National Center for Research and Development), Horizon 2020, or the regional
                      ROP R&D programs. It is assumed that the team prepares between five and 10 such applications
                      per year during the first five year planning period. Commercial terms for such cooperation
                      assume that firms will pay the PCI team retainers of PLN 20-30 thousand per application, plus a
                      success fee of 3-5%. A 50% success rate on applications is projected in the revenues model.

                      The PCI will also profit from assisting in matching business with R&D equipment at
                      the universities in structured contract research. At the time of writing this report, the
                      Podkarpackie universities engage in a fair amount of contract research work for business (e.g., RUT
                      generated over PLN four million in such revenues in 2016). A large part of this contract research
                      work relies on expertise of individual professors and other research workers; any commercial use
                      of R&D equipment is typically one-off, i.e., the research does not have a structured, repeatable,
                      regular nature. One of the recommendations of this report is that universities would be well
                      served giving the PCI an exclusivity for contracting this sort of research seldom undertaken
                      today: structured, based on well-described, standardized procedures, not dependent on
                      interpretation and expertise of professors – the latter kind of contract research work would
                      remain as it functions today, i.e. it would stay with TTCs or university departments. The revenue
                      model assumes, therefore, that PCI does have such limited exclusivity, and that it earns a 10%
                      commission on such repeatable research contracts.

                      The smallest batch of revenues will come from payments to the ProtoLab from local
                      companies. The PCI model assumes that the involvement of local companies (as well as some
                      key local public institutions, such as the City of Rzeszow) in the activities of the ProtoLab will
                      be gradually increasing. The revenue projections include the assumption that the firms (and the
                      City) will be mainly interested in sponsoring student competitions for innovative solutions (the
                      local business also indicated high interest in access to the ProtoLab as part of their recruitment
                      strategy). The model projects relatively small (PLN 30-50 thousand annually) subscriptions for
                      those stakeholders to stay involved with the ProtoLab.

5.3 Funding model for 2018-2027
  The funding model assumes continuous movement towards the self-sustainability. The
  first five years (2018-2022) of PCI operations will be 100% funded from the ROP (any revenues
  accruing into a Trust Fund set up to provide funding for future years). The subsequent five years
  (2023-2027) will see an increasing reliance on self-funding, while the financing needed from the
  MO will continue, but decrease in importance. It is recommended, when designing the next EU
  financial perspective, to secure the future predicted outlays for the PCI.

  PCI’s budget for the period of 2018-2022 assumes 100% level of public funding. This
  will be made possible by the changes introduced to the Podkarpackie ROP. Most probably
  one cannot count on such high levels of public funding (both in absolute and percentage
  terms) in subsequent years. Any revenues generated by the PCI during this initial period will be
  therefore set aside to provide a funding cushion for the future periods of operation. In essence,
  it is recommended that a Trust Fund is established during the first five-year period. The purpose
  of the Trust Fund would be to provide as much PCI funding for years 2023-2027, as possible. In
  essence, all PCI revenues generated in the first five years will be used to fund future operations.
  The existence of the Trust Fund should not be conditional to the size of public financing in the
  subsequent years and should be developed regardless of its value.

  It is expected that other regional stakeholders will help finance the PCI’s activities.
  After the PCI’s initial start-up period, as a newly established player in the Rzeszow technology
  ecosystem, it could expect some level of funding from the City of Rzeszow (such additional
  funding would be in excess of any funding provided for city-sponsored projects in the ProtoLab).
  PCI could become an ambassador to the Rzeszow positioning it as the “City of Innovation”.

  Obtaining financing from companies from the region and beyond will be key to
  strengthen the revenue stream and develop relationships. After the initial five years, one
  can expect significantly increased involvement in the funding of PCI from the Podkarpackie
  companies. If the program execution proceeds as planned, local firms will see many reasons to
  stay involved, be continuously informed about interesting R&D projects originating at the local
  universities, participate in funding, and influence the strategic direction of PCI. As a result, one
  can expect a significant decrease in the level of funding required from the MO during years
  2023-2027.

                    As a result, by the end of the second five-year budgeting period the PCI will be able to
                    finance close to 50% of its expense base from its revenues. This objective is in line with the
                    experience of the well-performing Western European TTOs.




             5.4 Getting to break-even past 2027

                    It is important to take into account experiences of the best Western European
                    technology transfer offices when forecasting the PCI revenues. For example, the Leuven
                    LRD (a TTO at the KUL Leuven university) has been in existence since 1970s. The almost two
                    decades of the LRD’s initial operations were a period of gradual, but slow, growth in its revenues.
                    The inflexion point came in mid 1990s; since then the LRD’s revenue growth significantly
                    accelerated, resulting in the center’s being responsible for about EUR 250 million in revenues
                    generated for the university KUL Leuven from contract research, licenses, and proceeds from
                    start-ups. The LRD team attributes this pattern of long-term revenues to the phenomena of
                    building critical mass and the center’s brand. In their opinion (supported by a body of research
                    on TTOs), it takes years of perseverance to build a sustainable TTO.

                    The PCI is likely to reach break-even around 15th year of operations. Table 6 below
                    presents a possible path to reach this point.

  The length of time for PCI to get to the break-even point depends on the number of
  local stakeholders. The above estimates assume that PCI budgets have not been significantly
  cut in the period past the 10-year planning horizon presented in this section, and that the PCI
  maintains and strengthens its relationship with key the local stakeholders (MO, universities,
  City of Rzeszow, and local businesses). It is conceivable that the time to break-even may be
  shortened if the universities come to see PCI as a valuable extension of their core activities, and
  if the ethos of entrepreneurship becomes much more widespread in the academic environment
  (as has happened, for instance, at KU Leuven). If that happens, a more substantial portion of the
  PCI revenues could come even sooner from the services provided by PCI to universities, thus
  decreasing the time needed to reach break-even point.




5.5 Amendment of the ROP

  Amendment of the ROP takes place in a formal procedure. This procedure is governed by
  the provisions of the Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council
  of 17 December 2013, laying down common provisions on the European Regional Development
  Fund, European Social Fund, Cohesion Fund, European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development,
  and European Maritime and Fisheries Fund and laying down general provisions on the European
  Regional Development Fund, European Social Fund, Cohesion Fund, and European Maritime and
  Fisheries Fund and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/200639 and the Act of 6 December
  2006 on the principles of development policy (Figure 9).40

  Once the ROP is amended, other documents will require amendments to remain in line
  with the ROP. One of these documents is the “Detailed Description of Priority Axes within
  the Regional Operational Program of the Podkarpackie Region for years 2014-2020” (in Polish
  “SZOOP”). The procedure for the adoption of these amendments is governed by the Minister
  of Development and Infrastructure’s Guidelines41 on the detailed description of priority axes of

                    The PCI’s management team will be selected in an open tender, based on objective
                    criteria. The selection criteria will be subject to the approval by the Monitoring Committee.
                    The contest’s documentation must be published on the Board of Voivodship’s website 30 days
                    before the start of call for applications. Each tender must be governed by a specific set of rules
                    that also have to be published.43

                    To achieve the initiative’s objectives, the PCI must be given the right to support
                    individual projects (valorization) within Platform1, without an obligation to select
                    beneficiaries in open tenders. The ROP and SZOOP should therefore include a project,
                    consisting of the creation of the PCI with the function of the microgrant operator. Further
                    beneficiaries (to which the PCI will pass public funding in the process of project valorization),
                    should not be required to submit their applications in an open call.

                    The PCI should be given right and financial means to acquire research services from
                    the universities’ SPCs (Platform2). The PCI will acquire research services to further market
                    them (therefore acting as an agent to facilitate commercial use of the freed-up infrastructure
                    capacity). It is foreseen that the PCI will participate in the costs of preparation of standard
                    research procedures and costs of necessary infrastructure’s upgrade.

                    The PCI should be able to finance modernization of the ProtoLab’s premises even if it
                    will not own them. It is preliminarily envisaged that the PCI might operate the ProtoLab that
                    will be housed in a building owned by another entity, i.e. one of participating universities or a
                    private undertaking. The conditions attached to the rules on financing should not restrict the
                    PCI to cover costs of investments in third party’s assets.




           5.6 State aid considerations                                               44




                    Public funding for this initiative has to comply with State aid rules. Pursuant to Article
                    107.1 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), “Save as otherwise provided
                    in the Treaties, any aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any form
                    whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favoring certain undertakings
43
   Cf. the Act of 11 July 2014 on the rules of programs in the field of cohesion policy financed in the 2014-2020 financial perspective (Journal
of Law of the Republic of Poland of 2016, item 217 as amended) and the Minister of Development and Infrastructure’s Guidelines of 31 March
2015 (MIiR/H 2014-2020/9(01)/03/2015) on the procedure of selection of projects (https://www.funduszeeuropejskie.gov.pl/media/1995/

or the production of certain goods shall, in so far as it affects trade between Member States, be
incompatible with the internal market.” State aid might nevertheless be considered admissible
if it fulfills certain conditions.

In the case at hand presence of State aid should be assessed with respect to a number
of entities. This is due to the fact that State aid may be present on various levels, not only the
PCI, which will be the direct recipient of the ROP’s funding. The table, below, presents potential
State aid beneficiaries broken down by Platforms with an identification of where State aid will
be present.

                                                                   Platform 1

                                 It will not be considered as a beneficiary of State aid, since it will act as an intermediary (pass-through) to
              PCI
                                 direct public funding to final beneficiaries.

        Research teams           As long as research teams do not conduct economic activity, they are not considered State aid
        (natural persons)        beneficiaries.

           Spin-offs             Spin-offs conduct economic activity; any advantages granted to them will therefore constitute State aid.

      Other undertakings         Since they conduct economic activity, any advantages granted to them will constitute State aid.

                                 It will not be considered as a beneficiary of State aid. The PCI will receive public funding to cover specific
                                 costs incurred (and passed through the PCI) by the universities (or their SPCs), i.e. costs of development of
              PCI                research procedures.
                                 The PCI will only withhold a premium for the marketed research services that will constitute the PCI’s
                                 market remuneration.

                                 These entities fall within the definition of “Research Organization” (cf. para 15 (ee) of the Communication
             SPCs                from the Commission — Framework for State aid for research and development and innovation45; “the
                                 Framework”) and their predominant activities are of non-economic character.
                                 Since the scope of their economic activity will not exceed “the ancillarity threshold”, they will not be
          Universities
                                 considered as undertakings and therefore the advantages they will benefit from will not constitute State aid.

                                 It is envisaged that research services will be marketed at prices covering direct costs plus margin (as
 Contractors of research
                                 required by para. 25 of the Framework), therefore no State aid will be granted to the contractors of
        services
                                 research services.

                                 It will not be considered as a beneficiary of State aid. The PCI will receive public funding to cover
                                 specific costs incurred in connection with the development and operation of the ProtoLab. The activity
                                 conducted by the ProtoLab should be considered as constituting part of a system of “education for
              PCI                more and better skilled human resources” (cf. para 19 (a) of the Framework), which is of non-economic
                                 character.
                                 The financing withheld by the PCI will be considered as a market remuneration for its services.

                          in passing public funding to the final beneficiaries, the rate of public financing should be 100%,
                          at least in the first couple of years of the PCI’s operation. Although State aid rules do not apply,
                          it will still be required that funding is granted in accordance with respective rules of the ROP
                          concerning inter alia eligibility of expenses,47 etc.

                          In cases where State aid will occur, maximum flexibility should be ensured. Therefore,
                          solutions based either on the Commission regulation (EU) No 651/2014 of 17 June 2014 declaring
                          certain categories of aid compatible with the internal market in application of Articles 107 and
                          108 of the Treaty48 (GBER) or the Commission Regulation (EU) No 1407/2013 of 18 December
                          2013 on the application of Articles 107 and 108 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European
                          Union to de minimis aid49 should be taken into consideration. Aid granted under conditions
                          established in the GBER or de minimis regulation does not require formal notification under
                          Article 108 (3) TFEU. Since the limit for de minimis aid is relatively low, the primary solution with
                          respect to State aid compatibility should be based on the GBER. Only when the beneficiary
                          does not meet eligibility criteria de minimis aid should be taken into consideration.50

              5.7 The uncertainties

                          The collaborative nature of the process of designing PCI (the design was developed
                          with active participation of the local innovation system stakeholders) will help mitigate
                          risks and uncertainties related to its future implementation. Since supporting R&D
                          collaboration is a multidimensional and multistakeholder endeavor, its implementation bears
                          risks typical for such complex initiatives. When developing the PCI model, three specific risks
                          were raised. Their mitigation will require coordinated remedial action and commitment from key
                          stakeholders of the local innovation ecosystem. First risk is that the universities’ TTCs and SPCs
                          may consider the PCI as a competitor and will not be willing to collaborate with it. Secondly,
47
   However, on further stage of this project certain modifications should be introduced in order to address the specificity of the PCI
48

   For this reason two possible solutions should be included in the amended SZOOP
51
   De minimis aid should be granted only in cases where the beneficiary does not fulfill eligibility criteria for aid covered by Article 22 GBER

university researchers may not be willing to change their attitude toward responsiveness to
business’ expectations (e.g., compliance with R&D project deadlines). Thirdly, universities may
continue with their generally unenthusiastic view of applied research, preferring instead to
concentrate on basic research and education. While these challenges will need to be tackled
one by one when implementing the PCI concept, they have already been addressed by the PCI
design itself and by the fact that all key stakeholders have been involved in the design process.
Subsequent paragraphs offer a short explanation of how these risks can be managed during
upcoming stages of the detailed PCI design and implementation.

The PCI will perform activities that are not delivered by the TTCs and SPCs. Thanks
to performing complementary tasks in all three platforms (valorization, structured contract
research, ProtoLab), the PCI will eventually be viewed as a partner and not a competitor of the
universities and their entities. The PCI cannot replace the existing TTCs or SPCs, and they will be
actively involved in the PCI operations via such mechanisms as the Supervisory Board, Resource
Allocation Committee etc., where the universities will play an important role. By providing hands
on training, the PCI will also help build capacity of the universities’ TTCs and SPCs beyond what
they are currently doing. Moreover, the TTCs, SPCs and PCI will share an objective of making
R&D collaboration a success, because this will build their joint brand within the universities and
businesses. Finally, the PCI will not compete for resources with the SPCs and TTCs, because it
will be financed mostly by the Marshal Office funds, and these funds could be partially used to
enhance capacity of the TTCs and SPCs.

The PCI will provide university researchers with an opportunity to better communicate
with their corporate clients. R&D work is a naturally risky endeavor and its outcome and
timeliness cannot be always guaranteed. The researchers and entrepreneurs are aware of that,
yet they often have differing, sometimes contradictory, expectations toward R&D collaboration
(both in terms of the process of such collaboration and its outcomes). These varying perspectives
may potentially lead to disagreements if clear engagement and communication principles do
not exist or are not adhered to. The PCI will help manage expectations of both researchers and
businesses by facilitating communication processes and putting in place procedures that are
acceptable to both parties. Such rules will be a part of service level agreements (SLAs) signed by
the universities, SPCs and the PCI; they will be also reflected in contracts signed with companies.
The facilitating role of the PCI will also allow stakeholders to pursue tasks where they have
comparative advantage, i.e. researchers will focus on performing R&D work, companies on their
business, while the PCI (in collaboration with SPCs and TTCs) will deliver support services for
R&D work and technology transfer.

The PCI will help the universities, researchers and TTCs/SPCs achieve benefits that can
be reinvested for their further development. These benefits can take both tangible and
intangible form, for instance: increased revenues, more research grants, strengthened brand
among prospective students and researchers (already mentioned inTable 1). Financial revenues
are often perceived as the most tangible result; currently universities’ revenues from the R&D
collaboration are low, due to the limited scope of such activity. This, in turn, causes that universities
(as well as researchers, TTCs and SPCs) do not put a high priority on this area. In the mid-term,
one can expect that the PCI will contribute to generating additional and growing revenues
resulting from the R&D collaboration. Additional resources will help increase even further the
research potential of the universities. Such a financial incentive, reinforced by intangible benefits,
are expected to strengthen the universities’ interest in collaboration with business on the R&D.
Since the universities will not bear additional financial burden of these collaborative efforts, they
are expected to continue with the program.

Implementation
Plan




68   Activity 1: Designing Regional Technology Transfer Office: Podkarpackie Center for Innovation
This section presents an envisaged timeline of implementing the PCI. The timeline
encompasses the period from April 2017 (when a new set of activities is started to launch the PCI
concept) until approximately December 2017, when it is expected that the modified Podkarpackie
ROP will become effective (Table 11). The modification of the ROP is crucial, because its change will
ensure stable financing and sustainability for the PCI.

The activities presented hereby do not constitute an exhaustive list but rather illustrate
key elements to be pursued during that period. Since these activities will be performed in
close collaboration with all the relevant stakeholders, their implementation will also depend on
collaboration of the parties involved. The World Bank team will ensure that continued structured
communication processes are implemented at the regional and national level, including the Marshal
Office, universities, local agencies, European Commission, Ministry of Economic Development,
Ministry of Science and Higher Education, PARP, etc.

Individual stakeholders will be responsible for selected activities. Since the PCI is a joint
effort of the stakeholders creating the Podkarpackie innovation ecosystem, it is recommended
that each activity have its own local leader. Such an approach would ensure a strong buy-in by key
players, but it would also allow them to closely monitor the implementation progress. Moreover,
their involvement would ensure that PCI addresses critical shortcomings of the current system,
and that it does not duplicate already existing structures.

Conclusions and
Recommendations




74   Activity 1: Designing Regional Technology Transfer Office: Podkarpackie Center for Innovation
The Podkarpackie region is doing relatively well on some measures of innovation (e.g.,
total amount of R&D spending), but has a room for improvement in two key areas:
intensity of business-university R&D collaboration (e.g., contract research, licensing)
and start-up formation (especially for high-technology start-ups). The three local
universities focus mainly on education and basic research. Applied research efforts are largely
directed at expertise-based one-off contract research projects for the local companies, and not
at standardized R&D services. Licensing activity has scope for improvement, alike the rate of
R&D-oriented start-ups that originate at the local schools. R&D equipment, purchased by the
universities mostly with the help of EU funds, could be more intensely used for commercial
purposes. Building acceptance for the entrepreneurial ethos among researchers, university
personnel and students, which is still at the early development stage at the universities should
be one of the key challenges in the upcoming years.

The local innovation ecosystem appears to be well diversified, with a variety of
public-sector players present, and the local corporate sector includes innovative,
technology-driven companies gradually building strong R&D departments. Enhancing
the effectiveness of some key elements that are important for the R&D collaboration
is required to utilize the region’s full potential. Technology parks, development agencies,
and accelerators form a potential basis of support (at least in terms of infrastructure) for young,
innovative companies. Podkarpackie has its share of technology champions – innovative, fast-
growing companies that declare their willingness to significantly strengthen their ties to the local
universities. Local students are winning national and international technology competitions.
Elements that could enhance the effectiveness of the innovation ecosystem are: enhanced
accumulation of R&D project valorization competencies, encouragement for local seed funding
for promising R&D projects originating from the local universities, increase of the level of R&D
equipment use for commercial purposes, and creation of a platform for the area’s students to
increase the intensity of their prototyping and entrepreneurial efforts. This report proposes
solutions for these areas.

The report recommends that a regional Podkarpackie Center for Innovation (PCI) be
created as a regional technology transfer office (TTO) to utilize full potential of the
regional innovation ecosystem. PCI’s mission will be to provide an effective bridge
between the region’s R&D providers (mainly local universities) and users of that
R&D in a way that fosters the culture of entrepreneurship at the universities and is
complementary to and supportive of work done by university technology transfer
centers (TTCs) and special purpose companies (SPCs). PCI will do so by significantly
strengthening R&D project valorization efforts at the local universities, resulting in increased
revenues from licensing university-originated intellectual property (IP) and creation of university-
originated tech start-ups that base on this IP. It will create and market structured contract
research offers on the basis of universities’ R&D equipment base. Finally, it will create a platform
(ProtoLab) for local students to design and build prototypes of innovative products. The PCI
design will be based on the best practices of European and Polish TTOs and complement and
reinforce the existing innovation ecosystem of the Podkarpackie region; in particular, it will add
to, not replace, the efforts of the existing university TTCs and SCs.

The PCI should be set up as a limited liability company (LLC), with mixed public-private
shareholding, which is managed by the competitively selected team, chosen from
among the most competent and experienced R&D commercialization experts. PCI’s
shareholding will include a private entity representing the management team, the MO, and
possibly other parties (e.g., the City of Rzeszow or local companies). The team selected to manage
PCI will enter into a 10-year agreement with the MO (which will have the option of backing-out
of the agreement after five years, in case of the team’s underperformance). The PCI will enter
into contractual relationships with the university SPCs that will regulate scope of collaboration

                                                                    7 - Conclusions and recommendations   75
               regarding the commercial use of the R&D equipment and commercialization of the R&D results.
               It would be highly desirable for the PCI to be granted selected exclusivity to support universities
               in some areas (e.g., licensing IP or structured contract research, which constitutes a subgroup of
               a broader category of contract research).

               The PCI will use a transparent process to allocate resources to valorized R&D projects
               (Platform 1) and create, market and re-sell a commercially attractive structured contract
               research offer (Platform 2). Decisions to fund R&D projects through microgrants (both at
               the Proof-of-Principle as well as Proof-of-Concept stages), as well as decisions to fund other
               initiatives (e.g., using the Enhancement Fund to add to the universities’ R&D equipment in order
               to increase its commercial potential) will be made by the Resource Allocation Committee (RAC).
               The RAC will include members of the PCI management team, representatives of the universities
               and the local business, and the Marshal Office. Similarly, decisions to discontinue funding will
               be taken transparently and based on analytical materials gathered by the management team.

               The ProtoLab (Platform 3) is a physical space equipped with basic tools and machines
               that offer students and researchers from all local schools an opportunity to learn
               and experiment with various manufacturing technologies in interdisciplinary teams,
               and gain experience in prototyping and entrepreneurship. The ProtoLab is designed to
               leverage some of the best practices of European and Polish universities (such as Aalto in Finland
               and KUL Leuven in Belgium). The report recommends that a 2000-3000 square meters building
               that is conveniently located, is selected and adopted to house the ProtoLab (initially, the space
               can be smaller at approximately 1000-1500 square meters and expand with growing demand
               for the facility). In the ProtoLab, students will be able to design and build prototypes reflecting
               their own ideas, as well as participate in design competitions sponsored by the corporations and
               other entities (e.g., the public sector, such as the City of Rzeszow).

               Approximately PLN 70 million is needed to fund the launch and the initial five years
               of PCI operations (the report also recommends a funding solution for the subsequent
               five-year period). The PCI will be funded from the Podkarpackie ROP (which needs to
               be changed to accommodate the program). In the longer term (after some 15 years), the
               PCI is expected to reach a point (so-called break-even point) when its revenues cover
               the expense base. It is expected that during PCI’s initial five-year period, revenues generated
               from its activities will amount to 15% of its expense base. That percentage will gradually increase,
               allowing the PCI reach a break-even point after approximately 15 years from its launch.

               The PCI, as designed, stands a high chance of strongly and positively influencing the
               Podkarpackie innovation ecosystem. For the PCI to impact the region’s economy in a
               significant way, several key success factors need to be present. First, the leadership at
               the top needs to be stable and strong. The MO, the rectors of the universities, and the mayor
               of the City of Rzeszow all should play the role of supporting the initiative, helping to overcome
               inevitable hurdles, and encouraging the stakeholders to stay the course. Second, all parties need
               to arm themselves with patience and realistic expectations. The best practice examples show
               that it takes time and commitment to build successful regional TTO organizations. Third, a strong
               commitment to select the best management team to operate the PCI as well as ensuring that
               the team itself is strongly committed to the program is crucial, because as experience of other
               successful TTOs indicates the “talent is key”.
