FOREWORD

           Assistance to Least Developed Countries (LCDs), which Myanmar joined in April
           2013, the Government of Myanmar has asked the World Bank Group (WBG) to
           be the implementing agency for a Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS).

           The general objectives of a DTIS are: (i) to assist the government in mainstreaming
           trade and competitiveness in the country’s overall development strategy; (ii) to
           provide a diagnostic and analytical tool to prioritize and sequence key reforms
           in the area of trade and competitiveness; and (iii) to provide a platform for
           development partners to coordinate action and align trade-related assistance

           This DTIS has identified a number of domestic and external constraints facing
           Myanmar as it strives to leverage regional and global integration for inclusive,
           export-led growth. Based on this, the current report provides analytical input
           on the linkages between trade and poverty, and highlights key steps to remove
           bottlenecks in terms of trade policy and trade facilitation.

                                          four decades, its re-integration
                                          into the global economy has
                                          presented Myanmar with a unique
                                          opportunity to leverage growth in
                                          trade to reduce poverty, promote

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY




The policies suggested in this
report have the potential not
only to transform Myanmar’s
economy through greater
trade, but also to transform the
lives of all of Myanmar’s citizens.
Trade can be honed by
policymakers into a tool for
wealth distribution and
poverty reduction. Myanmar
is at a historic juncture when
it could transform its economy
into one that addresses these
issues through improved trade
openness.

EXECUTIVE
SUMMARY
Myanmar’s elections in 2015
marked      another    historic
milestone in the country’s
political    and    economic
transition that began in 2011.
In November 2015, the people of Myanmar voted
overwhelmingly for change and reform. It is now up
to Myanmar’s policymakers to deliver on the people’s
hopes and aspirations for a more prosperous, equitable
and peaceful Myanmar, with support from development
partners, including the World Bank Group.

Leveraging trade to underpin inclusive growth and
poverty reduction is within reach. While growing
rapidly in recent years, Myanmar’s trade is still modest
as a proportion of its GDP compared with its neighbors.
It still has huge potential to grow. Developing into
a major trading partner with its ASEAN neighbors
and beyond offers Myanmar a unique opportunity
to empower the private sector to drive its economic
opening, and spread the benefits of increasing trade
more equitably throughout society and across regions.
After all, Myanmar shares borders with countries that
account for some 20 percent of global GDP and 40
percent of the world’s population. Expanding trade can
help Myanmar to rebalance its economy away from
over-reliance on natural-resource industries that very
often offer little in the way of employment to ordinary
people, and have a history of provoking social tensions
and unrest in Myanmar’s more remote ethnic-minority
regions.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY




A new paradigm for private-sector driven growth.
Based on its diagnostic analysis of Myanmar’s current
trade environment, this report offers suggestions for
fostering competitiveness and a dynamic environment
for private sector growth to drive trade. Myanmar is
poised to take off on a new and ambitious trajectory
going forward. The challenges are daunting and success
cannot be guaranteed, but our hope is that the findings
in this report can provide important guidance and policy
options that can help to ensure success.

    Infrastructure
    development and
    regulatory reforms
    can occur in tandem


    Only one-third of homes have electricity in
    Myanmar. Only 33 percent of Myanmar households
    have access to electricity, compared with 60 percent
    in Bangladesh and 99 percent in Vietnam. Myanmar’s
    logistics infrastructure (ports and their hinterland
    connections) ranked 137th out of 160 countries in the
    2014 Logistics Performance Indicator (LPI), the lowest
    among ASEAN countries. It is also less connected
    with global shipping-liner networks than Bangladesh
    or Vietnam. Both Yangon’s seaport terminals and
    highways along the country’s main economic corridors
    (i.e., Yangon-Mandalay-Muse) will soon reach their
    capacity limits, while the road along the Mandalay-
    Tamu corridor has been severely damaged by flooding.

    The business environment remains challenging for
    the private sector. While securing electricity and
    starting a business in Myanmar have become much
    easier and boosted its ranking in the World Bank
    Group’s 2016 Doing Business survey from 177 in
    2015 to 167, the business environment in Myanmar
    remains challenging for the private sector. International
    experience has shown time and again that in order to
    reap the benefits of hard infrastructure investments, it
    is also vital for the government to work in parallel on
    “soft” infrastructure reforms, including, in Myanmar’s
    case, (i) reforming procedures and regulations; (ii)
    strengthening institutional capacity; and (iii) ensuring
    broad ownership of the reforms.

Changes in procedures and incentives could be
considered to reduce trade costs and stimulate the
provision of services. On top of the steps already
taken to reduce import and export licenses, a number of
other procedures could also be considered for removal,
and whose objectives can be better addressed through
other means. Examples include: (i) the requirement for
exporters to pay 2 percent income tax in advance; (ii)
limits on how much banks can charge traders to process
L/Cs; and (iii) requirements to demonstrate that foreign
buyers have already paid for exports (or have used L/Cs).
Another example is the flat and relatively low charges
levied for storing containers in port (of just US$2/day),
creating port congestion. The Ministry of Commerce
(MoC) could consider reviewing these practices and
consulting stakeholders, including the Myanmar
Business Forum, with a view to removing them.

•	 Availability of reliable trade-related data (action
   A2 in the Action Matrix). Myanmar’s trade
   statistics are inadequate, while plenty of technical
   assistance from the World Bank Group, the
   WTO, the International Trade Center (ITC) and
   the UN Statistics Division (UNSD) is on hand
   to help build up the necessary know-how. In the
   interim, the MoC could start working with the
   Ministry of Finance, in particular with Customs,
   to put in place a reliable trade-statistics tool and
   forward the data to the UNSD for inclusion in the
   UN Comtrade database.
•	 Capacity to analyse data and develop policy
   briefs (action A3). The MoC could consider
   working with other ministries (e.g., Labor,
   Planning and Finance, and Central Statistical
   Organization) and think-tank organizations to
   build up the statistical capabilities needed to
   inform policy through data collection and sharing
                                                               protocols, together with the hiring of competent
                                                               professionals. It could also consider creating and
                                                               strengthening the capacity of specialist teams with

                                                               can be met.

                                                               Building capacity through training is important

                                                               effective organizational structure—human

                                                            Myanmar’s tariff structure could be streamlined
                                                            and simplified, with the role of protection against

                                                            This implies tariff reform, as well as continued efforts

While trade opens new economic
opportunities, it also carries the risk
of increased tensions if its benefits
are not perceived as being shared
fairly, or if proper safeguards are
not in place to protect vulnerable
populations from expropriation,
environmental degradation, or
poor working conditions.

Ensuring that trade development works to reinforce rather than
undermine the peace process will require a number of steps to be
adopted (a positive list) and mistakes to be avoided (a negative
list). Trade expansion and an influx of investment may also
aggravate employment, skills development and wage disparities
between men and women, and women may not be able to access
economic opportunities if their interests as enterprise owners,
traders and workers are not taken into account.




Myanmar has an opportunity to raise its share of the
gains from mining, in particular in jade mining. Jade
is currently exported raw and the current system fails to
provide local communities with a sense of ownership
or any of the gains from Myanmar’s huge scale on the
world jade market. In this regard, economic theory
suggests that a small export tax would raise government
revenue without any offsetting economic loss.1 Such
a tax would generate revenue that could then be used

The need for a quality infrastructure
in Myanmar is gradually rising.

3.
In Myanmar today, most export-oriented
production struggles to comply with important
technical regulations and voluntary standards.

However, the quality requirements are largely
informal and few producers demand the full array of
services offered by a modern quality infrastructure.
Global reintegration will only reinforce this trend,
but change will be slow. Therefore, commercial
demand for quality infrastructure services will be
specific. Likewise, the demand for quality services
that is derived from the regulators needing to enforce
regulations to protect consumer safety and health will
be specific to particular health threats. Even in the best
of cases, the supply will be slow to come forward, in
particular the public supply of quality infrastructure
services, because the capacity of the government
within quality infrastructure is very limited and a rapid
expansion of services cannot be realistically expected.

In order to compete successfully in export markets,
Myanmar might consider adapting its quality
infrastructure to meet the demands of buyers with
their various levels of demands in terms of quality
and SPS certification. This could be achieved with
both a legislative/regulatory modernization effort and
a capacity-building effort in ministries involved in
setting and enforcing standards. However, it will be
important for the process to be driven by the demand
of the market and from regulators seeking to protect
consumer health and safety. Furthermore, it will
also be important for Myanmar to avoid rushing to
build a quality infrastructure disproportionate to the
enforcement capabilities. The regulatory framework
will benefit from being carefully designed to avoid
conflicts of interest and rent-seeking by the ministries

                                                             seeking to protect consumer health and safety.

                                                             by the ministries involved.

Located on the ancient Silk Road, Myanmar holds a strategic
position to facilitate trade, which is key to unlocking its
economic potential. Myanmar shares land borders with
China, India, Lao PDR and Thailand, together accounting
for about US$15 trillion, or one-fifth, of global GDP.


As poverty tends to be higher isolated and remote
areas, while industrial agglomeration occurs in
cities, a coherent approach would help to link
infrastructure development with local economic
potential, particularly in mountainous and western
coastal areas, and link these areas to industrial
agglomerations and nearby international markets.
Such an approach would benefit from a coordinated
effort to reduce hard and soft bottlenecks in
logistics infrastructure, which could generate huge
competitive gains for local economic development.

Planned upgrades of the country’s infrastructure
offer opportunities for transformational change.
Both inclusive development and the needs of
international investors point towards the need to build
infrastructure to international standards. Myanmar’s
highway network is around 36,000 km, of which only
two-thirds are paved. Moreover, the overall design
is inadequate for the needs of an efficient market-
based economy. Port capacity in Yangon, a river port
32 km inland currently handling 80 percent of the
country’s trade, is likely to reach saturation soon.
Cargo throughput has grown fourfold over the past
decade and is slated to grow even faster going forward,
                                                          The Yangon-Mandalay road corridor is the country’s
                                                          main logistics backbone and could be prioritized
                                                          for upgrading. According to traffic projections by
                                                          JICA (2014), by 2017 heavy traffic along the AH1
                                                          will surpass the highway’s capacity. This could be
                                                          temporarily alleviated by allowing container trucks
                                                          to use the National Expressway between Yangon and
                                                          Mandalay with certain tariff rates, before the combined

                                                          2028. Therefore, opening the National Expressway
                                                          to container trucks seems inevitable (action E1). In

                                                          the highway would benefit from major upgrading,
                                                          as it will deteriorate rapidly once heavy traffic is
                                                          allowed; such upgrading would be closer to a total

                                                          as today’s low traffic will be easier to divert onto the

Improving port efficiency and

and improvements can be made
in a relatively short timeframe.

Around 80 percent of Myanmar’s trade is handled
by river ports in Yangon and Thilawa situated 32
km in-land. Cargo throughput (measured in TEU)
grew from 155,000 TEU in 2004/05 to more than
617,000 in 2013/14, a fourfold increase.


While extending the berthing area for vessels is one
option, this may not be an optimal strategy given that
berth productivity of Myanmar’s main port in Yangon
is still relatively low due to constraints on vessels
navigating the channel at night. Port congestion due
to the stacking of containers and local traffic in Yangon
city is contributing to a lack of reliability of logistics
services. Developing a deep-sea port with smooth
links to industrial zones and a transport network to
hinterland and border areas is desirable. However,
such a major investment will take time and the
following options may be considered in the interim:

•	 Upgrade/revamp night navigation on the
   Yangon River. In order to allow vessels to call
   at ports at night and help to increase utilization
   of the available capacity at Yangon’s ports, night
   navigation on the Yangon River needs to be
   upgraded. This action should also be accompanied
   by reviewing the tariff structure, including the low
   and flat fee for storing containers in port, to allow
   higher cargo turnaround (action F1).
•	 Facilitate the transport of containers from port
   to Yangon’s industrial areas using river barges
   (action F2). Increased traffic congestion around
   Yangon will increase time and reduce reliability
   for cargo arrivals. Myanmar’s authorities (MPA,
   Customs and the Ministry of Transport and
   Communications) could consider facilitating the
   transport of containers from ports to industrial
   areas around Yangon by using river barges as an
   alternative. Thilawa Port has this option already
   but in order to make it cost effective handling will
   have to be minimized and customs procedures

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY




Having an enabling regulatory environment would
help Customs and other trade-related departments
to align their procedures with international
standard.To date Myanmar has been amending the
1878 Sea Customs Act to accommodate modernization
of customs and trade facilitation practices. Myanmar
may want to consider reviewing existing Customs and
other trade-related legislations and assist with writing a
new National Customs Code (action F7).

Making it easier to issue certificates of origin. One
of the key aspects for Myanmar’s exporters in utilizing
preferential tariffs in ASEAN is to use Form-D to
establish “origins of the product” according the rules
of origin (ROO). Currently, Myanmar is the ASEAN
member that least utilizes Form-D, so it may be
important to review current practices and encourage
automation in the issuance of certificates of origin
(action F8).

Finally, although sanctions have been largely lifted,
access to trade finance remains a key issue for
Myanmar’s traders. Many players in Myanmar have
little awareness of the potential benefits of trade-finance
instruments, and a communication and training effort
would help to raise awareness among business players
and in the banking sector (action F9). Domestic banks
have little capacity to process or provide trade finance
instruments, such as receivable financing or letters of
credit. They could be encouraged to make trade finance
available through the adoption of an appropriate legal
framework, technical assistance, and guarantee for
risk and liquidity. Finally, capacity-building could be
facilitated for more banks to open access to receivable
financing for Myanmar’s exporters.

                Myanmar’s decision to reintegrate with
                the global economy is a major policy
                choice that transforms its development
                trajectory. In particular, openness to
                trade and investment is expected
                to accelerate industrialization and
                diversify the economy through private
                sector-led investment and productivity
                improvements. But the process also
                carries risks, such as losing out to
                regional competitors, stoking resistance
                to reform and increasing social
                tensions. Therefore, key infrastructure
                and structural reforms will be required
                to address the high transaction costs
                of trade, increase competitiveness
                and inclusiveness in the private sector,
                and strengthen institutional capacity
                to implement better trade-related
                regulations.

1.1 Can Myanmar achieve its targeted growth?
International experience
Myanmar has set itself an ambitious growth target that is as high as any
achieved by any other developing countries to date, with the sole exception
of China. In order to achieve it, the economy will have to undergo an
extremely rapid structural transformation. New opportunities do exist that
were not available to other countries at a similar stage of growth, but it will
be important to shed Myanmar’s unfavorable political legacy very rapidly.




1.1.1 What are the precedents?                                                            by growth above 7 percent.1 Thus, sustaining GDP

                 Achieving and sustaining Myanmar’s
                 growth target requires it to tap
                 opportunities from greater economic
                 integration. Exports and FDI are closely
                 inter-linked and expected to bring
                 a boost to growth, job creation and
                 product diversification. Achieving this
                 requires supporting policies to unlock
                 the potential in manufacturing exports
                 to drive the structural transformation
                 and enable Myanmar’s income per-
                 capita to catch up with neighboring
                 countries, with a consequent significant
                 impact on poverty reduction.

MYANMAR’S BEAN AND MANGO EXPORTERS



Myanmar ships large quantities of peas to India through
Yangon, with India accounting for over two-thirds
of Myanmar’s recorded exports of beans and pulses.
Substantial quantities of beans are also exported overland
to China through the Muse border post.
Trading takes place at the Mandalay pulse exchange where large traders set
prices at the start of the trading day for all remaining transactions. Most of
the products exported to China are brewed to produce alcohol. Myanmar’s
beans are exported raw as producers have not succeeded in convincing Chinese
buyers to buy processed products. As a result, domestic mills are run at less than
full capacity and lose money. While there are many reasons for the inability of
Myanmar’s producers to squeeze more value-added from their products, the
lack of SPS infrastructure does not help, although a few traders in Yangon have
managed to obtain certification and export to the EU.

The lack of sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) infrastructure has similarly
prevented mango producers from diversifying export destinations and reaching
out to higher-end markets. Most OECD countries require fumigation, which
itself requires substantial investments in the exporting country. The lack of
certification and good logistics makes high-end markets such as Singapore,
where quality products can fetch high unit values, largely unattainable.
Producers rely on the marketing networks of intermediaries with only weak
quality management capabilities and little strategic vision. As a result, they
remain largely dependent on informal sales to Chinese buyers with severe
moral-hazard problems. For instance, according to Burmese producers, in
some cases sales are made in Mandalay over a handshake, but when the product
reaches the border the buyer claims that its quality is not what had been agreed
and applies a discount. Sometimes the claim is real, reflecting poor logistics and
storage conditions, but often it is just a “hold up”, which the producer, having
no alternative, is forced to accept.

Overcoming moral hazard through the formalization of marketing channels
and contracts, encouraging and certifying quality, and providing producers with
information on market opportunities, all require a support infrastructure that
is currently non-existent in Myanmar. Putting in place such an infrastructure is
a first-order priority to ensure that export development translates into income
and growth for farmers.

MINIMUM WAGES AS A SAFEGUARD TO PROTECT WORKERS




                                                                                                                        BOX 2.2
The setting of a minimum wage is one the most widely used labor policy instruments in the world, with
varying types of design and implementation. The primary objective in setting a minimum wage is to establish
an acceptable wage floor to protect low-income workers and to correct labor market distortions whereby
employers keep workers’ wages artificially well below market levels. However, countries may have other
objectives in setting a minimum wage, such as reducing poverty, narrowing inequality, or incentivizing
workers’ productivity as better paid workers can lead to higher consumption spending.

Empirical evidence is mixed on the impact of minimum wages on demand for labor and unemployment. For
developing countries with dual labor markets (formal and informal workers), it is possible that increases in
minimum wages will have limited impact on unemployment, as workers can shift from formal to informal jobs.
But in a situation where most jobs are informal jobs, raising minimum wages can displace informal workers
as formal workers become informal job seekers. The impact of raising minimum wages on formal workers also
depends on compliance with minimum wage regulations. In Honduras and Nicaragua, strict compliance with
minimum wages caused job losses in large corporations, while smaller firms were less formal and could absorb
the relocation of formal workers. However, in Indonesia, where compliance with the minimum wage is less
strict, raising the minimum wage in the late 1990s had more impact on labor absorption among small firms
as they faced higher labor costs. For industries that rely more on the size of domestic demand, minimum wage
increases in the late 1990s are associated with increasing formal employment in firms producing goods for
local consumption or non-tradeable goods (Macgruder, 2013).

•	   Myanmar already has minimum wage legislation. The first minimum wage policy was introduced in
     1949 and in 2013 the government passed a Law on Minimum Wage Rules. To strengthen institutional
     arrangements and capacity in setting minimum wages that are equal for men and women but at levels that
     do not jeopardize trade competitiveness, below are several key issues that Myanmar may want to consider:

•	   Setting (single) clear objectives for the minimum wage that aim to address imperfections in the labor
     market. Minimum wage is quite an appropriate tool for use in correcting labor market inefficiencies,
     which cause discrepancies between wages and economic productivity. But the empirical evidence shown
     in the Del Carpio and Pabon Study (2014) in ASEAN, reveals that the relationship between minimum
     wage and poverty is far from compelling. In some cases, the poor benefit with better wages; however,
     much of the evidence suggests that the poor are more disadvantaged in that they are more likely to lose
     their jobs and/or leave the formal labor market

•	   Keep the minimum wage structure simple: A complex minimum wage structure may appear desirable
     but can be difficult to enforce.

•	   Agree on the key principles and comprehensive criteria for setting the minimum wage level: It is
     important to agree on a comprehensive list of criteria and indicators. These typically include: cost of
     living/consumer prices, productivity, enterprise capacity to pay, producer prices, competitiveness, income
     inequality, immigration, the informal economy, unemployment and GDP growth, among others.
     It is also important for the law to take into account wage structures. For instance, in Myanmar, the
     notified minimum wage is for a standard eight-hour working day and there is no mention of overtime
     compensation, which forms the bulk of take-home wages in many sectors, including garments.

•	   Determine the policy tool and process for future adjustments of the minimum wage: It is important
     for Myanmar’s National Minimum Wage Committee to derive a suitable range of minimum wages,
     which can serve as a basis for negotiations between parties. It is crucial that the relevant information is
     available to support the negotiations. It is important that the process is time-bound and involves all the
     negotiating parties, including independent technical experts to represent the public interest.

•	   Strengthen enforcement and monitoring capacity: Although only a small fraction of the labor force
     in Myanmar will be covered by the new minimum wage, it is important to strengthen enforcement and
     monitoring capacity to ensure compliance with the regulations.

               MARKET ACCESS AND THE EU’S GSP
BOX 2.3



               The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) is a
               WTO-sanctioned system of non-reciprocal preferences
               offered by the EU to developing countries in order to
               assist them to overcome obstacles to market access in
               the EU. There are three main variants (arrangements)
               of the system:
               The standard GSP scheme, which offers limited tariff reductions to
               developing countries, in the form of partial or entire removal of tariffs on
               two-thirds of all product categories.

               The “GSP+”, a system of enhanced preferences involving the full
               elimination of tariffs on essentially the same product categories as those
               covered by the general arrangement for countries that have ratified and
               implemented international conventions on labor rights, environment and
               good governance.

               The “Everything–But-Arms” (EBA) scheme for least-developed countries
               (LDCs), which grants duty-free quota-free access to all products except
               arms and ammunitions.

               There are two basic problems with trade preferences such as the GSP. The
               first is called “preference erosion”—the fact that preferences granted to a
               large number of beneficiary countries may end up being of little benefit for
               anyone of them because competition between beneficiaries pushes down
               producer prices to a level where the incentive effect of preferences is all but
               eliminated.

               The second problem is with rules of origin (ROO), particularly in the
               garments sector. The EU’s EBA initiative in its original form did not relax
               rules of origin mandating that, in order to qualify for preferences, garment
               products had to be produced out of locally-made fabric, a rule called
               “double transformation” (from yarn to fabric and from fabric to garment).
               As weaving is a capital-intensive activity that is typically not profitable in
               LDCs, this requirement severely undermined the usefulness of the EBA
               scheme. The problem was particularly apparent when compared with the
               US’s AGOA, which relaxed the double transformation requirement for
               African countries.

               Recognizing these two limitations of the EBA initiative, the EU
               introduced phased reforms to improve its effectiveness. In 2010, the
               double-transformation rule was relaxed, making garments made out of
               imported fabric eligible for tariff-free import into the EU. Moreover, in

                CAPACITY-BUILDING: IT’S ABOUT MORE THAN JUST TRAINING
BOX 2.4



                The Ministry of Commerce (MoC) is currently undergoing a significant
                transition that will modify fundamentally the nature of its work.
                Historically, the MoC’s predominant activities were to issue export and
                import licenses, based on policy decisions made by higher authorities. This
                has started to change as Myanmar reintegrates with the global economy,
                and the MoC has been given a mandate to coordinate and formulate
                policies in the following domains: trade policy, trade promotion, trade
                remedy, competition, and consumer protection. The MoC has also
                been called upon to play an active role within the government on trade-
                related issues that involve inter-ministerial coordination, such as trade
                facilitation, tariff rationalization, standards and quality infrastructure
                and Aid-for-Trade projects.
                Similar to other government institutions in Myanmar, this transition will reduce the emphasis on clerical
                functions of the MoC and increase the focus on analytical and policy coordination functions. Outdated
                command and control mechanisms within government institutions are gradually being replaced by
                mechanisms that are compatible with the market-oriented economy, greater democratization, demands for
                accountability, and greater demands for inclusiveness.

                While the MoC has emerged as a strong champion of policy reform, the transition poses significant
                challenges as the MoC is called on to narrow its capacity gaps to function as a modern trade ministry. There
                is still limited capacity in its knowledge of basic trade and economic policy issues, data analysis and report
                writing, policy formulation and consultations, and trade negotiations. The MoC’s 3,050 staff of 12 ranks
                are all recruited through the civil servant recruitment process managed by the Union Civil Service Board,
                in addition to officers being transferred from the Army. The process of securing new recruits with adequate
                profiles often takes considerable time.

                Currently, the MoC’s staff capacity is being developed both under an internal program and with the support
                of development partners. The MoC has been organizing in-house trainings for staff in computers, languages,
                and procedures to issue trade licenses. Development partners have also been providing, and plan to provide,
                training on policy analysis and have organized workshops on various topics, such as NTMs, trade remedies,
                regional integration and trade facilitation.

                Nevertheless, more assistance is needed to strengthening the MoC’s capability in formulating policies and
                implementing policy reforms. The formulation of a comprehensive capacity development program would
                include a thorough needs assessment of the MoC’s staff, based on both its current and future responsibilities
                in the area of trade-related reforms as listed in the DTIS Action Matrix. The assessment will lead to the
                development of a prioritized capacity development program to be implemented and monitored with the
                assistance of development partners, in the interest of better aid efficiency. In-class workshops could be
                complemented with on-the-job training, whereby experts are assigned to support specific officers who are
                responsible for sensitive tasks, such as those supporting decision-making in the Directorates (e.g., data
                analyses, policy consultations, reviewing regulations, etc.). Sending staff abroad with high-level training
                in specialized institutions could also be selectively promoted by the MoC. A system to incentivize staff
                to develop their capacity and make them more effective in their daily work could also be devised. This
                could include: (i) adequate incentive and career development path to reward well-performing staff; and (ii)
                aligning the MoC’s incentives and organizational structure to ensure greater responsiveness to demand for
                accountability, transparency, and inclusivity in policymaking.

                 ASEAN TRADE IN GOODS AGREEMENT (ATIGA)
BOX 2.5



                 ATIGA entered into force on May 17, 2010,
                 consolidating all commitments related to
                 trade in goods and bringing greater legal
                 certainty and transparency to regional
                 trade liberalization. ATIGA focuses on
                 tariff liberalization, non-tariff measures,
                 simplification of rules of origin, Customs
                 reform and trade facilitation.
                 ATIGA consolidates and streamlines all the provisions of former
                 ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) Agreement and AFTA-Common
                 Effective Preferential Tariff, and formalizes several ministerial
                 decisions. An Annex to ATIGA provides the full tariff reduction
                 schedule of each AMS and spells out the tariff rates to be applied
                 on each product for each year up to 2015. It comprises elements
                 to ensure the realization of free flow of goods within ASEAN,
                 including the following: tariff liberalization; removal of non-tariff
                 barriers; rules of origin; trade facilitation; Customs; standards and
                 conformance; and sanitary and phytosanitary measures. In order
                 to account for challenges unique to the less-developed ASEAN
                 member states, ATIGA also provides additional flexibility for
                 Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Vietnam (CLMV).

                 Under ATIGA, Myanmar benefits from zero-duty access for 99
                 percent of tariff lines in ASEAN-6 countries and in 40 to 78 percent
                 of tariff lines in CMLV (where bounds represent differences in
                 commitments among CLMV countries). Figure 2.19suggests
                 that ASEAN members, with the exception of Cambodia, are on
                 track in meeting target of import duty elimination according to
                 ATIGA.

                LABOR SHORTAGES AND MIGRATION
BOX 3.2




                A fundamental factor exacerbating the labor
                shortage is the ease with which workers can migrate
                to readily available jobs in Thailand. Large numbers
                of Myanmar citizens work in Thailand, most of
                whom reside there at least temporarily, although
                the duration of residency varies significantly, from
                day workers to those holding 3- to 7-day border
                passes (renewable), to those with regularized status
                who have worked and lived in Thailand for over 10
                years.1
                An estimated 2 million Myanmar nationals currently work in Thailand,
                although the number could be higher, since accurate measurement is
                difficult. Wages in Thailand are significantly higher, even for the least skilled
                workers such as agricultural day laborers. The minimum wage in Thailand
                is Baht 300 per day (equivalent to US$10/day and K 12,000 per day),
                about three times the going wage in Myanmar. Based on an IOM survey
                of Myanmar migrants in Thailand,2 about one-third earn less than the
                minimum wage (most of whom are undocumented), one-third earn the
                minimum wage, and one-third earn more than the minimum wage. There
                is significant heterogeneity in the sector of work, wages and formality status
                (the majority being informal), and these vary across the different regions of
                Thailand. Prior to migrating, about 20 percent were unemployed, one-third
                were self-employed farmers, and 40 percent were wage employees. About
                one-third comes from urban areas, two-thirds come from rural areas.

                Not only are higher Thai wages attracting workers from Myanmar, the real
                wage is even higher given the lower cost of living in Thailand. Myanmar’s
                prices are inflated in part due to high transportation costs given its landlocked
                position. The recent growth and investment boom have also driven prices
                higher, not only the price of labor, but also the price of consumer products
                and especially the cost of land.

                 for populations that have long been isolated
                 by years of conflict. But the development of
                 trade also carries risks of increased tensions if

                 expropriation, environmental degradation,
                 or poor working conditions. Such safeguards
                 could take cross-cutting forms, such as legal

          CHAPTER 4




                THE PRECEDENT OF KACHIN STATE
BOX 4.1



                The ceasefire between the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) and
                the Myanmar military, which lasted from 1994 until 2011, was one
                of Myanmar’s longest lasting and most important. However, the lack
                of conflict was not associated with rapid, broad-based development.
                The most immediate consequence of the ceasefire was a widespread growth in natural resource extraction
                (mostly jade) and plantation agriculture in Kachin State. Despite 17 years without fighting, the ceasefire
                brought limited benefits for the people of Kachin State and was “widely regarded as [a time] of lost
                opportunities” (Transnational Institute, 2013). Despite promises from the SPDC, a political dialogue about
                the future of Kachin-Burmese relations did not occur. There was little improvement in public goods and
                services. For example, limited government statistics show that throughout the 2000s, the total length of
                all roads in Kachin State increased by 7.3 percent (Central Statistical Organization, 2012). Yet over the
                same time, natural resource extraction grew dramatically. During the 2000s, the number of non-jade mines
                in Kachin State grew from 0 to 342, the officially recorded production of jade jumped more than 2,400
                percent, and the volume of teak and hardwood trees extracted grew nearly 500 percent (Central Statistical
                Organization, 2012). Yet the Kachin people enjoyed few benefits from outsized growth in resource
                extraction, in part because there were no robust, transparent mechanisms within either the government or
                the KIO/KIA to translate resource revenues into broad social spending and development projects.

                Natural resource extraction did benefit the government, Kachin’s EAGs and select businesses. For the
                Kachin Independent Organization (KIO), the ceasefire created opportunities to get into business, which
                meant new revenue coming especially from jade, gold mining and logging (International Crisis Group,
                2013). Global Witness, a UK NGO, argued that the ceasefire actually opened up the needed space for
                logging on “an industrial scale” (Global Witness, 2003). According to a recent report by the Transnational
                Institute (TNI), the government also benefitted, as regime officials and businesses took over many lucrative
                natural resource concessions in Kachin State, including logging, gold-mining, agriculture and the valuable
                jade mines at Hpakant.

                Growth of crony business, disenchantment about the failure to further the Kachin ‘cause’, growing
                militarization in Kachin State, and stagnation on political dialogue, together contributed to deteriorating
                relations between Kachins and the Myanmar government. Over time, there were “increasing complaints
                from communities and civic groups over the lack of transparency of these resource revenues” because little of
                it was used for the benefit of the population (International Crisis Group, 2013). Many in Kachin perceived
                that their cause had been “systematically discriminated against by Tatmadaw and government leaders”,
                and became increasingly dissatisfied with Myanmar’s central government (Transnational Institute, 2013;
                International Crisis Group, 2013). At the same time, the central government took advantage of the ceasefire
                to increase the number of Burmese soldiers in Kachin State (number of battalions rose from 26 in 1994 to
                41 in 2006) (Kachin Development Networking Group, 2007). The long-standing grievances of the Kachin
                were not addressed through political dialogue, and in the lead-up to the 2010 elections, the regime reneged
                on key promises to the KIO, including by making demands that they transform into a Border Guard
                Force (International Crisis Group, 2013). This contributed to the government abrogating the ceasefire, and
                the resumption of conflict in Kachin State. Since 2011, the KIA and the government have been engaged
                in active fighting, which has been concentrated in strategic and resource-rich areas, including Hpakant,
                Myanmar’s jade capital, again a sign of the importance of the presence of natural resources for conflict. The
                ‘Kachin case’ now serves as a cautionary tale for many of Myanmar’s other ethnic groups about the risks of
                economic development before a peace agreement has been reached.

                 In order to compete successfully
                 on      export    markets,     Myanmar
                 could consider adapting its quality
                 infrastructure to meet the demands of
                 buyers with various levels of demand in
                 terms of quality and SPS certification.
                 This will require both a legislative/
                 regulatory modernization effort and a
                 capacity-building effort in ministries
                 involved in setting and enforcing
                 standards. However, to support export
                 development, the development of a
                 quality infrastructure could be driven
                 by commercial demand and, in areas
                 where the health and safety of domestic
                 consumers are at stake, also by the need
                 from regulators enforcing legislation to
                 protect consumer health and safety. It
                 will be important for Myanmar to avoid
                 rushing to build quality infrastructure
                 disproportionate with its enforcement
                 capabilities. The regulatory regime
                 could also be carefully designed to

                      WHAT IS A QUALITY INFRASTRUCTURE?
BOX 5.2



                      QUALITY REQUIREMENTS
                      Quality requirements are specifications of the nature of the product, including its production methods
                      as demanded by buyers or regulated by regulatory agencies both of which may be either domestic
                      or foreign depending on the end market of the product. Quality requirements may be expressed as
                      purely private requirements determined by a single or a group of buyers, as formal standards, or as
                      technical regulations. Some private quality requirements may operate in a fashion similar to standards
                      in the market place due to their market dominance.


                      STANDARDS
                      Standards are documents, established by consensus and approved by a recognized body, that provide
                      for common and repeated use, rules, guidelines or characteristics or their results, aimed at the
                      achievement of the optimum degree of order in a given context. Standards set quality requirements
                      providing the basis for the evaluation of compliance with the demands of buyers and regulatory
                      agencies. Standards may be set by a variety of actors, including national, regional and international
                      bodies. National standardization bodies bring together public and private stakeholders to develop a
                      formal consensus national standards. Such standards may become international standards if adopted
                      by international standardization bodies following certain procedural rules about the development of
                      standards.1 Following the definition of the WTO TBT Agreement, compliance with a standard is
                      voluntary.


                      TECHNICAL REGULATIONS
                      Technical regulations are documents that lay down product characteristics or their related processes
                      and production methods, including the applicable administrative provisions, with which compliance
                      is mandatory. They may also include or deal exclusively with terminology, symbols, packaging,
                      marking or labelling requirements as they apply to a product, process or production method. A range
                      of government departments may adopt technical regulations. Technical regulations are highly variable
                      in formulation, ranging from being highly prescriptive to setting out only the end goal of regulation,
                      thereby leaving the choice of how to comply up to the private sector. Often technical regulations refer
                      to standards as the technical basis of regulation. This approach ensures that a consensus exists between
                      public and private sector actors on the most efficient ways to comply with regulation.


                      TESTING AND INSPECTION
                      Testing means the determination of one or more characteristics of any particular material, product,
                      service or process according to a procedure. Inspection means the examination of a product design,
                      product, process or installation and determination of its conformity with specific requirements or,
                      on the basis of professional judgement, with general requirements. Testing and inspection may be
                      done by first parties (in-house), second parties (buyers or regulatory agencies) or third parties (bodies
                      independent from both transaction parties). For many needs, testing and inspection services are
                      tradable. Small and large service providers supply testing and inspection services across borders, in
                      developing countries typically to exporters.




                      1	          In 2002, the WTO TBT Committee adopted a decision outlining procedural requirements necessary for the de-
                      velopment of international standards (i.e., transparency, openness, impartiality and consensus, effectiveness and relevance,
                      coherence and developmental dimension). This implies that no particular institution is authorized to produce international
                      standards, but an international standards may be issued by any institution that respect the TBT Committee’s decision (WTO,
                      Document G/TBT/1/Rev.8 of May 23, 2002).

                                                                                                              BOX 5.2
CERTIFICATION
Certification is the assurance by an independent body that a product, services, system or process
conforms to quality requirements, standards or technical regulation. The certification bodies
are often private but may also be public, especially in markets for which conformity assessment
services are little developed. As with testing and inspection, certification services are tradable and
a large number of global firms provide such services across borders.

ACCREDITATION
Accreditation is a third-party attestation related to a conformity assessment body conveying formal
demonstration of its competence to carry out specific conformity assessment tasks. Conformity
assessment bodies undertaking testing, inspection and certification can seek accreditation on
a voluntary basis as proof of competence in a given area. The accreditation may be a domestic
or a foreign entity. More developed countries often has a single national accreditation body
responsible for all areas of accreditation.

CALIBRATION
Calibration is the set of operations that establish, under specified conditions, the relationship
between values of quantities indicated by a measurement instrument or measurement system,
or values represented by a material measure or a reference material and the corresponding values
realized by standards. Firms often use calibration laboratories to calibrate their measurement
equipment, although some calibration takes place in-house. Calibration services may be provided
by private or public service providers and they may be produced domestically or imported.

METROLOGY
Metrology is the science of measurement. More developed countries have established a national
measurement system designed to maintain, develop and diffuse measurement standards. This
system provides calibration services to independent calibration laboratories and other institutions
involved in measurement. Calibration laboratories in turn provide services to firms and public
sector agencies using measurement equipment. Measurements are traceable through a chain
of comparisons back to the national system and eventually to global measurement standards,
thereby guaranteeing the accuracy of the primary users of measurement equipment.

This section now presents selected case studies of

but remains dwarfed by other Asian producers. With
its large population and proximity to other successful
exporting countries, Myanmar could become a major
new sourcing hub for the global brands that dominate
the mid- to high-end of global garments markets. The
industry has grown rapidly, doubling in size over just
three years (MGMA, 2015). Today, Myanmar exports
garments worth about US$1.5 billion a year. However,
Myanmar remains a globally small exporter. Cambodia
is about three times larger, Vietnam and Bangladesh
10-15 times larger, and China more than 100 times
larger.

To continue growing, the industry is looking towards
global brands. The German sportswear brand Adidas
has begun sourcing Myanmar garments and San
Francisco-based GAP has announced that it will
buy from a Rep. of Korea firm owning factories in
Myanmar. Whether more international brands will
come to Myanmar depends not only on traditional
sources of competiveness, such as wage levels
and logistics, but also on compliance with buyer
requirements. Prominent among the requirements are
CSR issues. Adidas has been at pains to explain that it
only decided to source from Myanmar after two years
of discussions with Myanmar stakeholders. Assisted by
the EU-funded SMART program, these stakeholders

Myanmar’s tourism subsector is facing important
challenges that require strong inter-ministerial
support. The World Economic Forum Travel and
Tourism Competitiveness Index ranks Myanmar 134th
out of 141 economies. The main challenges to tourism
services relate to infrastructure, both in terms of air
and ground transport, as well as in ICT availability.
In addition, the current limited options in terms of
entertainment, convention centers and other business-
oriented tourism also appear to be a limiting factor
(Figure 6.7). These are all important challenges that
will take time to address. Therefore, Myanmar could
consider focusing its effort on addressing challenges in
certain areas using “Destination Management”. This
is a platform that can help the tourism subsector to
benefit from better inter-ministerial coordination to
manage cultural sites, the zoning of hotels, programs
to raise workers’ skills, and the provision of key
infrastructure.

                  Located on the ancient Silk Road,
                  Myanmar holds a strategic location to
                  facilitate trade, which is key to further
                  unlocking of its economic potential. It
                  shares overland borders with China,
                  India, Lao PDR and Thailand, which
                  together account for about US$15
                  trillion in GDP, or one-fifth of the
                  world’s total GDP. Myanmar is also
                  located in the growing Indian Ocean
                  Rim, with proximity to dynamic markets
                  in Bangladesh, India and East African
                  countries. But the challenge is not only
                  to connect Myanmar to those markets
                  but also to connect remote areas within
                  Myanmar to trade corridors. While the
                  government is keen to link up industrial
                  areas with foreign markets through
                  trade, it will be important to make a
                  coherent effort to link local and remote
                  areas with industrial agglomerations
                  and nearby international markets. This
                  requires a coherent approach to reduce
                  hard and soft bottlenecks in logistics
                  infrastructure, but could generate
                  huge competitive gains.

          CHAPTER 8




                THE MANGO EXPORT SUPPLY CHAIN
BOX 8.1



                Myanmar mangos are highly regarded among Singaporean
                consumers for their freshness, fragrance and texture (no
                fiber in the flesh). Since 2012, Myanmar mangos have
                been exported to Singapore using air freight from Yangon
                to Singapore’s Changi airport (Mandalay airport cannot
                be used for air freight).
                During peak season (May-June), volumes amount to 2-3 tons per week and less in
                July because mangos are only available in Shan State. The supply chain can be divided
                into two parts: the first from the farm to Yangon airport, which is organized by a
                Myanmar trader, and the second from the Singapore airport to the supermarkets,
                which is organized by the Singaporean importer.

                The average shipment size is around 500-600 kg with an approximate value of
                US$6,000-7,200 (around US$12.00 per kg). The selling price is a seasonal price
                and is fixed already in April. Orders are made by the Singaporean buyers depending
                on demand.

                The lead time from placing the order until the goods are shipped is roughly 1-2 days.
                Whereas air transport from Yangon to Singapore is only 3.5 hours, the majority of
                time is used to organize the shipment: selecting the fruit, conducting hot water
                treatment, packaging in boxes, transporting the cargo from Mandalay to Yangon
                using express buses, completing all export formalities, and loading the cargo onto
                the plane.

                Transport from the farm to Yangon is arranged by the Myanmar trader and the
                international segment by using a freight forwarder, because freight forwarders
                are better able to obtain volume discounts. The average transport price is around
                US$0.50 per kg, or US$250-300.

                The contract between the Myanmar exporter and the Singaporean importer is on a
                free-on-board (FOB) basis although the actual shipment is on a cargo, insurance,
                freight (CIF) basis. Damage and losses during transport are minimal (close to 0
                percent). Because the contract currency is in Singapore dollars, the Myanmar trader
                carries the exchange rate risk. The fixed purchase price can go both to the advantage
                or disadvantage of the Myanmar trader depending on the development of the
                mango price.

                There are two principal difficulties in the export of mangos: (i) Obtaining the
                export license from the Ministry of Commerce because it requires to submit an SPS
                certificate. But due to the short order cycles, SPS certificates cannot be obtained in
                time for the cargo to be shipped. To circumvent this obstacle, the exporter submits
                the SPS certificate of comparable mangos while the actual export mangos are still on
                the tree at the time of application. (ii) Logistics challenges such as costs, transport
                time and the lack of temperature control.

                  WOMEN FACE SPECIAL OBSTACLES AT BORDER CHECKPOINTS
TABLE 8.5



                  In 2015, the World Bank conducted a study at selected check points in Cambodia and
                  Lao PDR with Thailand and Vietnam. The study aimed to fill knowledge gaps on the
                  patterns of small-scale cross-border trade in those countries and the profile of those
                  engaged in it. Qualitative (field observations, stakeholder interviews and focus group
                  discussions), as well as quantitative (sampling frames listing small-scale cross-border
                  trade transactions and in-depth interviews) data, were collected.
                  The survey focuses on people who dealt with the authorities and were involved in the trade of goods that cross
                  the border in man-powered vehicles or vehicles with fewer than four wheels. The findings show that women
                  face certain types of idiosyncratic treatment at the border, including authorities’ insistent questions, either
                  discriminatory or with sexual innuendos. In general, however, no evidence of sexual harassment was found.
                  Certain constraints seem to justify the discrepancy between the share of women in crossings and in the general
                  population of crossers:  

                  Women are charged higher tax rates than men, and are less often able to negotiate taxes and fees;

                  Women spend on average more time to clear border procedures than men; and

                  Women face a dissuasive tax wedge when willing to upgrade from brokerage to own-account trading or to
                  scale up business activities.

                  Despite gender-specific constraints in participation, the report found that this business area may be a
                  worthwhile avenue for income generation and empowerment for women. Evidence is based on comparisons
                  with socioeconomic status in similar jobs and on income distributions, and calls for enhanced inclusiveness
                  and gender-awareness in trade facilitation projects.

                  The report identified important patterns of small-scale cross border trade in those countries, with an important
                  welfare impact on the population. Some of these findings include:

                  A high proportion of small cross-border traders report situations where a cash and in-kind bribe was expected
                  of them in the course of their cross-border activities;

                  Many authorities are present at the border and levy taxes or fees on small cross-border traders beyond their
                  mandates;

                  In Cambodia, they are often assisted in the collection of tax payments by plain-clothes, unauthorized
                  individuals;

                  Most taxes are informal in the sense that their amount is not fixed, and payment is not recorded or the record

          CHAPTER 8




                 OFF-SHORE TRADE FINANCING BY MYANMAR’S IMPORTERS AND EXPORTERS
BOX 8.6



                 Current regulatory constraints and lack of efficiency, if not know-how,
                 in the supply of trade finance instruments led most of the importers
                 and exporters met during the mission to seek alternative modes of
                 financing overseas. One of the most commonly practiced is the use of
                 a parent company registered in Singapore or Hong-Kong to act as an
                 intermediary with trading or banking counterparties. Using remittance
                 channels normally used for the transfer of savings by Myanmar workers
                 established in the region, Myanmar’s importers and exporters send
                 money transfers to the parent company or individuals to guarantee
                 for the issuance of letters of credit by Singapore, Thai or Hong Kong
                 banks, which themselves are necessary to guarantee payments to foreign
                 suppliers.
                 Remittance channels are also used to circumvent the obligation on Myanmar residents to pay for imports
                 only on delivery. Exporters often require advance payments or cash guarantees, notably for car exports,
                 but also other goods, including industrial inputs. One relatively common practice is for the buyer to send
                 a payment through remittance channels to Singapore. Once the merchandise is delivered to Myanmar,
                 an official payment of the same amount will be sent to the seller, with the seller returning the advance
                 payment through the remittance channel once the transaction is completed.

                 These practices mobilize a fair amount of cash, and therefore are affordable for companies with a certain
                 size, or active in sectors that generate higher profits (construction, import and distribution of imported
                 durables, and consumer goods) than lower margin businesses (agriculture, garments) for which cash
                 resources are scarce.

                 Apparently, local and foreign brokers help Myanmar’s importers and exporters to find overseas banks
                 ready to open or endorse letters of credit on their behalf. Cash deposits are often necessary, particularly
                 for “newcomers”, albeit not always if the trader in question has already a good track record of payment
                 or credit. Information was provided about possible “commissions” reverted by brokers to local banks,
                 although this could not be confirmed by the mission. Other banking services are provided off-shore, such
                 as working capital, pre-shipment financing and foreign exchange services.

                 Second-best solutions may be tolerated by the government in view of the limited capacity or desire of small
                 local banks to take on more risks, or to handle quickly and efficiently trade services and instruments. The
                 status quo may even have generated a “conservative consensus” towards maintaining current practices, in
                 view of the benefits generated by it (kickbacks of commissions from brokers to small local banks; gaining
                 time and efficiency for traders).

                 In the long run, there is a danger of creating a dual market for trade services, if relatively less efficient
                 services are left to local start-ups, small and medium-sized enterprises, and the more efficient services are
                 affordable only to larger, well-established and higher profit-generating groups.
