     PROVIDING QUALITY HEALTH SERVICES IN
     AFGHANISTAN

The System Enhancement for Health Action in Transition (SEHAT) Program implemented by the Ministry
of Public Health aims to expand the scope, quality, and coverage of health services to the population,
particularly the poor, across Afghanistan. The program, estimated at a total value of $654 million, is
jointly supported by the Government of Afghanistan with $30 million, IDA Grant $100 million, Health
Results Innovation Trust Fund $7 million, and ARTF $517 million. The SEHAT Program, which supports
the provision of basic health services and essential hospital services in the entire country, was approved
on June 17, 2013, for a period of five years of funding. The closing date for the project is June 30, 2018.




CHALLENGE



THE AFGHAN HEALTH SYSTEM has made considerable progress over the period of 2002–2012 due to Ministry of
Public Health (MoPH) leadership, sound public health policies, innovative service delivery, careful program monitoring and
evaluation, and development assistance. The number of functioning health facilities increased from 496 in 2002 to more than
2,000 in 2012. Data from household surveys (between 2003 and 2011) show significant improvement in the coverage of
reproductive and child health services as well as a drop in maternal and child mortality.


However, despite the aforementioned progress, the country faces significant challenges in the sector. Afghanistan’s infant
and under-five mortality rates are still higher than the average for other low-income countries. Afghanistan also has one of
the highest levels of child malnutrition in the world. About 41 percent of children under-five suffer from chronic
malnutrition, and women and children suffer from high levels of vitamin and mineral deficiencies.

APPROACH



THE HEALTH SECTOR has experienced a significant turnover since the establishment of a new administration in 2002.
The government has given the utmost importance to addressing the high maternal and child mortality, especially in rural
areas. MoPH undertook a series of critical and strategic steps: it defined a Basic Package of Health Services (BPHS) and later
an Essential Package of Hospital Services (EPHS); and it established a system for contracting on a large scale with
international and national nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) for delivery of these services.


The SEHAT Program aims to expand the scope, quality, and coverage of health services provided to the population,
particularly the poor, across the country, and to enhance MoPH stewardship functions. The program supports the provision
of BPHS and EPHS in both rural and urban areas. It is strengthening the national health system and MoPH’s capacity at
central and provincial levels to effectively perform its stewardship functions.

vaccinations, and the mortality rate among mothers and children was high. Villagers lacked basic
health care awareness and did not know what to do in emergency health situations.
                                                                                                          road blockage.

Koprok BHC was established over 11 years ago and has been receiving financial support from the            — Sayed
SEHAT Program since January 2014. SEHAT supplies quality medicine to the health center, which             Habibullah,
is given free to patients. It also provides staff salaries and helps with capacity building programs as   resident,
well as equipment repair.                                                                                 Koprok village


Quick delivery of health services


A medical doctor and four nurses and midwives provide vaccinations, obstetrics and gynecology,
and emergency services at the health center. It has a laboratory for the diagnosis of tuberculosis
because of the high prevalence of the disease in Bamyan Province.

“Koprok Health Center has saved the lives of so
many villagers,” says Sayed Habibullah, 65, an elder
from Koprok village. “Before this clinic was built,
patients would die on the way to hospital during the
winter season because of road blockage.”


Koprok BHC has 12 health posts where 24 male and
female volunteers work to raise villagers’ awareness
of health care issues. As a result, villagers pay more
attention to their health now. Women who
previously delivered their babies at home are now
visiting the clinic. Villagers now bring their under-five-
year-old children for regular vaccinations.
