    1. Strategic Framework

    Although workforce development (WfD) is a clear priority in the country’s national
    strategy with strong advocacy from government leaders, advocacy by non-
    government stakeholders is generally absent. Timor-Leste has taken modest steps
    to foster a demand-led approach to WfD by conducting a few assessments of
    national economic prospects with the support of donor agencies and by providing
    incentives for skills upgrading by the informal sector. Government ministries and
    agencies responsible for WfD have well defined mandates with no overlaps, but
    rely on ad hoc mechanisms to coordinate in strategic areas.

    2. System Oversight

    Basic procedures are in place for allocating funding for targeted programs and
    institutions, but a culture of assessment of the impact of funding on beneficiaries
    remains underdeveloped. In addition, the government has not taken any action to
    facilitate partnerships between training institutions and employers. A National
    Qualifications Framework has been introduced as well as the necessary
    institutional infrastructure for aligning it with curricula, testing procedures, and
    standards for accreditation; however, this new system is reaching only some
    training providers and leaves out Technical Secondary Schools. While pathways
    are available for technical students to progress to other types of programs, several
    parts of the system are still disconnected.


    3. Service Delivery
    A broad range of non-state providers is active despite few government incentives.
    Although significant efforts have been made to put in place measures for quality
    assurance, they apply only to providers that are accredited or seeking
    accreditation. While informal and sporadic links exist between the two public
    training centers and industry, Technical Secondary Schools have no such link.
    Instructors at public training institutions lack appropriate qualifications, particularly
    in the Ministry of Education schools where opportunities for professional
    development are limited. All accredited training providers, state and non-state, are
    required to collect and report basic administrative data, but these is only
    occasionally analyzed; the sources of data on labor market outcomes are limited.

World Bank’s initiative on Systems Approach for Better        SABER-WfD Framework
Education Results (SABER) 2 whose aim is to provide
systematic documentation and assessment of the policy
and institutional factors that influence the performance
of education and training systems. The SABER-WfD tool
encompasses initial, continuing and targeted vocational
education and training that are offered through
multiple channels, and focuses largely on programs at
the secondary and post-secondary levels.

The tool is based on an analytical framework 3 that
identifies three functional dimensions of WfD policies
and institutions:

(1)   Strategic framework, which refers to the praxis of
      advocacy, partnership, and coordination in
      relation to the objective of aligning WfD in critical
      areas to priorities for national development;

3. Key Findings and Policy Implications                       Figure 10: Timor-Leste’s Dimension-Level Scores
This chapter highlights findings from the assessment of
Timor-Leste’s WfD system based on the SABER-WfD
analytical framework and tool. The focus is on policies,
institutions and practices in three important functional
dimensions of policymaking and implementation—
strategic framework, system oversight and service
delivery. Because these aspects collectively create the
operational environment in which individuals, firms and
training providers, both state and non-state, make
decisions with regard to training, they exert an
important influence on observed outcomes in skills
development. Strong systems of WfD have
institutionalized processes and practices for reaching
agreement on priorities, for collaboration and
coordination, and for generating routine feedback that
sustain continuous innovation and improvement. By
contrast, weak systems are characterized by
fragmentation, duplication of effort and limited learning
from experience.                                             Note: See Figure 2 for an explanation of the scale on the horizontal axis.

Policy Goal 2: Fostering a Demand-led Approach
Effective advocacy for WfD requires credible
assessments of the demand for skills, engagement of
employers in shaping the country’s WfD agenda and
incentives for employers to support skills development.
Policy Goal 2 incorporates these ideas and benchmarks
the system according to the extent to which policies
and institutional arrangements are in place to: (i)
establish clarity on the demand for skills and areas of
critical constraint; and (ii) engage employers in setting
WfD priorities and in enhancing skills-upgrading for
workers.

workforce development, to facilitate effective skills
acquisition by individuals and to enable employers to
meet their demand for skilled workers in a timely
manner. The objective is to minimize systemic
impediments to skills acquisition and mismatches in

and governed before presenting the detailed SABER-

To encourage people to participate in training, efforts
are being made to raise awareness to the positive
relationships between: training and career options;
training of staff and business profitability; and
upgrading skills and career progression. As part of this,
the Government is making an effort to make sure all
graduates of training programs are employed by, for
example, requiring companies to present the
certificates of workers when they bid for public work.
The creation of the TLNQF has also been a major step
towards pathway diversification. A serious downside of
the system is that technical secondary school diplomas
and post-secondary level qualifications are not yet
recognized in the TLNQF.

       The Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER)
       initiative produces comparative data and knowledge on education
       policies and institutions, with the aim of helping countries
       systematically strengthen their education systems. SABER evaluates
       the quality of education policies against evidence-based global
       standards, using new diagnostic tools and detailed policy data. The
       SABER country reports give all parties with a stake in educational
       results—from administrators, teachers, and parents to policymakers
       and business people—an accessible, objective snapshot showing how
       well the policies of their country's education system are oriented
       toward ensuring that all children and youth learn.

       This report focuses specifically on policies in the area of workforce
       development.
