    World Bank Group and World Bank
    Corporate Scorecards
    In July 2013, the World Bank Group launched its Strategy, outlining how it will partner more
    effectively with clients to help them achieve the ambitious goals of eradicating extreme
    poverty and boosting shared prosperity through economic growth, inclusion, sustainability
    and resilience. In April 2014, the World Bank Group Corporate Scorecard was launched for the
    first time and the World Bank Scorecard revised to monitor the implementation of the Strategy.

    The World Bank Group Scorecard provides view of the results and performance indicators
    of the three World Bank Group institutions: the World Bank (WB), the International Finance
    Corporation (IFC), and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). This brochure
    presents the Scorecards, updated with the latest data available in fiscal year 2015.




         To Eradicate Extreme Poverty and Boost Shared Prosperity
                          In a Sustainable Manner


                          Development Context
                Tier 1    Reports the long-term development outcomes that countries are
                          achieving

                          Client Results
                Tier 2    Reflects the results reported by clients implementing operations
                          supported by the World Bank Group


                          Performance
                Tier 3
                          Covers operational and organizational effectiveness


                          Complemented by institutional scorecards for WB, IFC, and MIGA


    The Scorecards are structured in three tiers. Tiers 1 and 2 present indicators monitoring aspects
    of growth, inclusiveness, and sustainability and resilience. Tier 3 captures the progress in
    implementing the World Bank Group Strategy and includes measures of both operational and
    organizational effectiveness.

    The World Bank Group Strategy gives special attention to gender issues and to the needs of
    fragile and conflict-affected situations (FCS). Therefore, as applicable, the Scorecards‚Äô indicators
    are disaggregated to show results in these two categories.

    For each indicator, a baseline value was set when the Scorecards were first released. In addition,
    performance indicators (Tier 3) include targets and performance standards. The Scorecard
    includes a few placeholders‚Äîresults areas for which indicators, definitions, and values had
    not yet been developed. In this year‚Äôs Scorecard the placeholders in Tier 3 have been replaced,
    although a few remain in Tiers 1 and 2.

                                                                                     Corporate Scorecards | October 2015

Tier 1

    Tier 1 reports long-term development outcomes and the broader context of countries in
    which the World Bank Group operates. Improvements in Tier 1 indicators are not attributed
    to the World Bank Group; they are the outcome of collective efforts by countries and their
    development partners.

    Most Tier 1 indicators reflect the development context in World Bank Group client countries,
    while a few, particularly those related to climate change, have global dimensions. Consequently,
    the Tier 1 indicators for CO2 emissions and average annual deforestation change are reported not
    just for World Bank Group client countries, but for the world as a whole.

    We expect to refine the Tier 1 indicators over time to reflect the evolving consensus on what the
    key development challenges are and how progress should be measured. Therefore, the World
    Bank Group Scorecards will be aligned with the outcomes of international dialogue such as the
    Sustainable Development Goals and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
    Change (UNFCCC).

Tier 2


     Tier 2 reflects the results reported by clients supported by the World Bank Group in implementing
     operations that promote growth, inclusiveness, and sustainability and resilience. Tier 2 data in
     the Scorecards cover the stock of results achieved over fiscal years 2013-2015. It is important to
     note that, in the World Bank Group Scorecard, results reported by the World Bank are achieved
     primarily by government and other public entities. On the other hand, private sector entities
     achieve the results reported by the IFC and MIGA. MIGA now reports data in Tier 2 of the World
     Bank Group Scorecard, providing a more complete picture of results.

Tier 3


    Tier 3 includes measures of operational and organizational effectiveness, such as quality
    and timeliness of investments and advisory services delivered to clients; alignment with the
    Strategy; stakeholder and client feedback; internal knowledge sharing and collaboration;
    financial sustainability; and talent management. Where feasible, Tier 3 indicators have targets
    and performance standards to reinforce the World Bank Group‚Äôs commitment to accountability,
    provide a vision of where the institution aspires to be, and strengthen the focus on achieving
    results. Targets are set for fiscal year 2017, and progress is assessed annually.

    This year, new indicators were developed to replace placeholders in Tier 3. This brochure reports
    data in such areas as alignment with the strategy, measure of knowledge flow, measure of joint
    engagement and staff working across institutional boundaries.

    A ‚Äútraffic light‚Äù graphic shows the status of some performance indicators with targets for fiscal
    year 2017. It shows, at a glance, indicators for which there have been positive results and those
    for which additional efforts are needed.

DEFINITIONS OF THE WORLD BANK GROUP AND WORLD BANK CORPORATE SCORECARD INDICATORS
Tier 1: GOALS AND DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT
Goals and Development Context are the same for the World Bank Group and the World Bank Corporate Scorecards. Data are for IBRD and
IDA countries unless otherwise indicated.

Population living on less than US$ 1.90 (2011 PPP) a day (%): Percentage of the world population living on less than $1.90 a day at 2011
international prices. Average, weighted by the total population. Data reported for the world.
Source: World Bank staff estimates calculated using data from PovcalNet1.       Frequency: Annual (available annual data varies by country)

Median of growth rates of average real per capita income of the bottom 40% (%): Median, across all client countries, of growth rates of
average real per capita income of the bottom 40% of every country‚Äôs population. The growth rate of the bottom 40% of the population of
a country for year T is the average annual growth rate measured over a period of (roughly) five years leading up to (or close to) year T.
The baseline number refers to a period that corresponds to roughly five years for every country, ending in a year between 2009 and 2013.
Data is available for 64 countries.
Source: Global database of Shared Prosperity circa 2007-2012, calculated Frequency: Annual (available annual data varies by country)
from PovcalNet.

GDP per capita (constant 2005 US$): Gross domestic product divided by midyear population. GDP is the sum of gross value added by all
resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated
without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources.
Source: World Bank, World Development Indicators.                               Frequency: Annual

Gross capital formation (% of GDP): Gross capital formation (formerly gross domestic investment) consists of outlays on additions to the
fixed assets of the economy plus net changes in the level of inventories. Fixed assets include land improvements (fences, ditches, drains,
etc.); plant, machinery, and equipment purchases; and the construction of roads, railways, and the like, as well as schools, offices, hospitals,
private residential dwellings, and commercial and industrial buildings. Inventories are stocks of goods held by firms to meet temporary or
unexpected fluctuations in production or sales, and ‚Äúwork in progress‚Äù. According to the 1993 SNA, net acquisitions of valuables are also
considered capital formation. Population coverage is 64% overall, and 52% for FCS in FY15.
Source: World Bank, World Development Indicators.                               Frequency: Annual

Agriculture value added per worker (constant 2005 US$): A measure of agricultural productivity. Value added in agriculture measures the
output of the agricultural sector (ISIC divisions 1-5) less the value of intermediate inputs. Agriculture comprises value added from forestry,
hunting, and fishing as well as cultivation of crops and livestock production. Average, weighted by agricultural employment. Population
coverage is 49% for FCS in FY15.

Adults with financial accounts (%, age 15+ all/bottom 40%): Percentage of adults (age 15+) in overall population and for bottom 40% of
earners that use an account at a bank, credit union, another regulated financial institution (e.g. cooperative, microfinance institution) or the
post office or mobile money services. Accounts can be accessed directly at a branch, or remotely via an agent, correspondent or mobile
phone. Average, weighted by the total population.
Source: Global Findex database 2015.                                             Frequency: Survey, every 3 years

Adult women with financial accounts (% of women, age 15+): Percentage of adult women (age 15+) that use an account at a bank, credit
union, another regulated financial institution (e.g., cooperative, microfinance institution), or the post office or mobile money service.
Accounts can be accessed directly at a branch, or remotely via an agent, correspondent, or mobile phone.
Source: Global Findex database 2015.                                            Frequency: Survey, every 3 years

Countries with growth concentrated in the bottom 40% (%): Percentage of countries (with available data) for which growth in average
(mean) real per capita income of the bottom 40% is positive and greater than growth in average (mean) real per capita income of the total
population. Growth rates are annualized (average annual growth rate) over a time interval of roughly five years. The growth rate of the
bottom 40% of the population of a country for year T is the average annual growth rate measured over a period of (roughly) five years
leading up to (or close to) year T. The baseline number refers to a period that corresponds to roughly five years for every country, ending in
a year between 2009 and 2013. Data is available for 64 countries.
Source: Global database of Shared Prosperity circa 2007-2012, calculated Frequency: Annual (available data varies by country)
from PovcalNet.
Access to electricity (%, bottom 40% and gap to average): Percentage of the poorest 40% of population of each country5 (with available
data) with access to electricity through a household connection and the gap to country‚Äôs average electricity access rate. Electricity refers
to public or quasi-public service availability of electricity from mains. It refers to having an electrical connection and does not reflect
details about actual electrical service received by the household. Bottom 40% is defined as the poorest 40% of each country. The data
is not to be interpreted as data for the poorest 40% globally. The gap is calculated as a difference between country‚Äôs total population
average rate and the average rate for the poorest 40% of population. Average, weighted by the total population. Data is available for 65
countries. The baseline data is from World Bank, The International Income Distribution database (I2D2).

Employed persons remaining extremely poor (%, age 15+): Percentage of extreme poor among employed people of age 15+5. The
employed comprise all persons of working age who, during a specified brief period such as one week or one day, were in the following
categories: a) paid employment (whether at work or with a job but not at work); or b) self-employment (whether at work or with an
enterprise but not at work). Extreme poor are defined as people who live under US$ 1.90 a day at 2011 international prices. Average,
weighted by the total population. The baseline number refers to a period 2005-2013. Data is available for 87 countries. The baseline
data is from World Bank, The International Income Distribution database (I2D2).

Countries with equal economic opportunities for woman in law (number): Number of countries that provide women and men the
equal legal ability to participate in the economy or generate an income through getting a job or starting a business, including the
capacity to sign contracts, open bank accounts, or pursue employment opportunities. The indicator covers four areas: (i) accessing
institutions ‚Äì examining legal capacity; (ii) using property - covering ownership rights; (iii) getting a job ‚Äì examining working hours,
industry restrictions, and retirement and pensionable ages; and (iv) providing incentives to work - covering tax treatment. Data are
examined separately for married and unmarried women.

Countries without wealth depletion (%): Percentage of countries with positive or zero changes in wealth per capita. Based on changes
in physical, human, and natural capital, change in wealth per capita indicates a country‚Äôs genuine savings to sustain income and
welfare for its (growing) populations in the future. This measure is based on gross national savings adjusted for changes in physical
(i.e. depreciation in fixed capital), human (e.g. education expenditure), and natural capital (i.e. mineral, energy, and forest depletion),
and accounting for the wealth-diluting effects of population growth.

Countries with low or moderate risk from unsustainable debt (number): Number of countries rated 4.0 and above on a 1 to 6 scale
on question 3. A of the Country policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) rating. The indicator rating is based on debt policy criteria
and assesses whether a country‚Äôs debt management policy is conducive to ensure medium-term debt sustainability and minimize
budgetary risk. The criteria cover the extent to which external and domestic debt is contracted with a view to achieving/maintaining
debt sustainability. CPIA rates countries against a set of 16 criteria grouped in four clusters: (a) economic management; (b) structural
policies; (c) policies for social inclusion and equity; and (d) public sector management and institutions. For data comparability purposes,
the 2014 number includes countries which were not assessed in 2014 due to changes in country coverage, but which were included
in the previous years, with 2013 ratings.

Tier 2: CLIENT RESULTS SUPPORTED BY WORLD BANK GROUP/WORLD BANK OPERATIONS
The Results sections of the World Bank Group and World Bank Corporate Scorecards report results achieved by clients implementing
operations supported by the World Bank Group/World Bank. Results reported are three-year incremental results, as reported by
projects active and/ or closed during the three-year reporting period (currently fiscal years 2013-2015).

Data are disaggregated for fragile and conflict-affected situations (FCS) and for female beneficiaries where feasible. Efforts are
continuing to improve the level of gender reporting by projects. FCS figures are based on countries of the FCS list equivalent to the last
year of the reporting period (currently fiscal year 2015).

WORLD BANK GROUP

The Results Tier of the World Bank Group Corporate Scorecard integrates Results from World Bank‚Äôs Investment Project Financing
(IBRD, IDA, and Recipient Executed Trust Funds), IFC‚Äôs Investment Services (IS) and from operations supported by MIGA. The exception
is the ‚ÄúCountries with strengthened public management systems‚Äù indicator, which also includes the World Bank‚Äôs development policy
Operations and IFC‚Äôs Advisory Services (AS). Efforts are underway to integrate more systematically the results of policy, knowledge
and advisory activities.

When interpreting results, it is important to consider that the World Bank, IFC and MIGA operate with different instruments and work
with different clients‚Äîi.e. government and private sector respectively. The results reported are those achieved by these clients, with
support of the World Bank and IFC. It is also important to bear in mind that some indicators aggregate results from projects that
finance expenditures (e.g., WB projects that fund vaccinations) and projects that finance capital investments (e.g., IFC investments in
hospitals). Aggregation rules will be improved in the future to make such numbers more comparable.

The aggregation of results across the World Bank Group has created the opportunity for the World Bank, IFC and MIGA to align their
methodologies to support accurate and meaningful results reporting. This alignment resulted in some adjustments to baseline values,
as methodologies were refined to better capture actual results.

Private investment catalyzed: (US$ billions): Private investment resulting from the WBG‚Äôs involvement in an investment, operation
or non-financing activity, measured regardless of whether or not the WBG entity was actively and directly involved in raising such
financing or soliciting investors. Includes investment made as a result of an operation after it is completed. Private Investment Catalyzed
includes Private Capital Mobilized. For purposes of this Indicator, a private entity is one which (a) is carrying out, or is established
for, a business purpose, and is operating on a commercial basis; (b) is financially, legally, and managerially autonomous; and (c) is
not owned or managed by a government. Private Investment Catalyzed is reported in the indicator within the fiscal year when the
investment is quantifiable by the execution of the legally binding obligation (‚Äúcommitment‚Äù) of debt financiers to the project or equity
holders invested in the client for defined business purposes; or, by the legally binding commitment of an instrument which facilitates
access to commercial financing by guaranteeing defined government payments or obligations.

improved service thanks to increased power generation or new or upgraded distribution/transmission lines as a result of World Bank
Group-supported operations. Data: Fiscal years 2013-2015.

 ‚Ä¢	 World Bank contribution includes the number of people who have received a new grid or off-grid electricity connection and the
    number of people that have benefitted from increased generation capacity, a proportion of whose output is reasonably estimated
    to be powering residential customers. In the future, efforts will be made to also estimate the population benefitting from the World
    Bank‚Äôs transmission and distribution investments.

Students reached (millions): Number of students that have benefitted from World Bank Group-financed operations. Composite
indicator of World Bank and IFC.

 ‚Ä¢	 Word Bank contribution includes the total number of students in all countries that benefited from World Bank-supported projects
    or activities supporting classroom assessment, examinations, national, or international assessments. The number of students
    benefiting from the assessment is calculated as the total number of students in the targeted cycle in each of the countries supported.
    The cycle refers to International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED 2011) categorization: primary, lower secondary, upper
    secondary education. The students are counted only if the Governments score 5 or higher (the highest score is 6) in the Assessment
    Rubric based on the Systems Approach for Better Education Results Framework, which measures the extent to which the country is
    utilizing the results of the assessments to enhance the quality of education. Results achieved by projects approved between fiscal
    year 2009 and 2013, as an approximation of the last 3-year results. Precise results achieved in the last three fiscal years cannot be
    determined given that students‚Äô benefits accrue over time.

 ‚Ä¢	 IFC counts the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) students enrolled annually in institutions receiving support from IFC. Student
    FTE represents the institution‚Äôs best academic judgment of the full-time equivalence of the students. The full-time equivalence of
    students on part-time courses should be established by comparison with a comparable full-time course. Part-time students should
    be returned as a proportion of an equivalent full-time course. The Student FTE of part-time study can be estimated on either a ‚Äòcredit‚Äô
    or ‚Äòtime‚Äô basis. The number of student loans provided by financial institutions receiving support from IFC also counts towards the
    total number of students reached by IFC, where each loan outstanding is used as a proxy for one student.

Students that have benefitted from learning assessments (millions): The total number of students in all countries that benefited from
World Bank-supported projects or activities supporting classroom assessment, examinations, national, or international assessments.
The number of students benefiting from the assessment is calculated as the total number of students in the targeted cycle in each of the
countries supported. The cycle refers to International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED 2011) categorization: primary, lower
secondary, upper secondary education. The students are counted only if the Governments score is 5 or higher (the highest score is 6) in
the Assessment Rubric based on the Systems Approach for Better Education Results Framework, which measures the extent to which
the country is utilizing the results of the assessments to enhance the quality of education. Efforts are underway to develop additional
indicator/s to measure the extent of students learning. Data: Fiscal years 2013- 2015.

People who have received essential health, nutrition, and population (HNP) services (millions): Number of people who have received any
of the essential health, nutrition, and population (HNP) services delivery. The essential HNP services, depending on the country context,
include: number of children immunized; number of pregnant women who have received antenatal care; number of deliveries attended
by skilled health personnel; number of women who have received family planning services; number of women and children who
have received basic nutrition services; number of adults and children who have received tuberculosis treatment (WHO-recommended
directly Observed Treatment Short Course (DOTS)); number of adults and children who have received treatment for malaria; number

Countries with strengthened public management systems (number): Number of countries in which a particular public management
system has been strengthened under Bank-supported operations. Institutional strengthening is measured by changes in the ‚Äúbehavior‚Äù
or ‚Äúperformance‚Äù of public agents (consistent with Indicators of the Strength of Public Management System (ISPMS) methodology).
Indicator aggregates countries that have demonstrated public management system strengthening in the following areas:

(a)	Civil service and public administration systems: Countries would have improved relevant ISPMS performance measures, such
    as increasing the ‚Äúshare of merit-based appointments,‚Äù reducing the ‚Äútime for key services and administrative processes,‚Äù or
    increasing the ‚Äúpercentage of the population reporting satisfaction with central government services,‚Äù etc.

Emission reductions with support of special climate instruments (annual, million tons CO2 equivalent): Annual tons CO2 equivalent
emission reductions produced with support of World Bank‚Äôs special climate instruments. The data is calculated as sum of estimated
annual emission reductions with support of special climate finance instruments, i.e., Global Environmental Facility (GEF), Carbon
Finance (CF), Montreal protocol (MP), and Climate Investment Funds (CIFs). The numbers are calculated as follows: for GEF, MP and
CIF projects the annual equivalent figure for projects closed during the fiscal year is the expected GHG emission reduction over the
lifetime of the investments supported by these projects, divided by the lifetime of the respective investments. In the case of MP the
GHG emission reduction is achieved through the elimination of ozone-depleting substances. For CF projects, the annual equivalent
figure for Emission Reduction purchase Agreement (ERPA) approved during the fiscal year is the expected GHG emission reductions
over the time-period of the ERPA contract, divided by the time- period of the ERPA contract. This indicator is a placeholder for a broader
greenhouse gas accounting indicator, which is being developed under the WBG Corporate Scorecard (climate change mitigation and
adaptation indicator). Once the WBG indicator is in place, it will also be included in the World Bank Corporate Scorecard. Data: Fiscal

Projected lifetime energy and fuel savings (MWh and MJ): Lifetime energy savings (converted to MWh) and lifetime fuel savings
(converted to MJ) achieved due to energy efficiency measures, directly attributable to the Bank-supported project. Projected savings
are calculated against baseline or business-as-usual scenario in the absence of the project. Savings are defined as projected savings
for the lifetime of the intervention in the year it is completed. The core sector indicators for ‚Äúprojected lifetime energy savings‚Äù and
‚Äúprojected lifetime fuel savings‚Äù were approved in fiscal year 2014 only. Reporting is expected to start in fiscal year 2016. Data: Fiscal

Tier 3: WORLD BANK GROUP/WORLD BANK PERFORMANCE
The World Bank Group Corporate Scorecard aggregates those indicators that can be meaningfully reported at the Group level and/or
are highly relevant for at least two of the three World Bank Group institutions. Individual institutions scorecards provide information
on how these institutions are contributing to the Group-wide measures reported in the World Bank Group Corporate Scorecard. If
the measures can be meaningfully reported only at the Group level, it is not repeated in the scorecards of the individual institutions.

Data for fragile and conflict-affected situations (FCS) are based on FCS list equivalent to the last year of reporting period.

Satisfactory completion of country strategies (%, IEG rating): Percentage of Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and/or Country
Partnership Framework (CPF) Completion Reports rated moderately satisfactory, satisfactory or highly satisfactory by Independent
Evaluation Group (IEG).

Satisfactory outcomes of World Bank Group operations (%, IEG rating): Percentage of operations in World Bank (IBRD and IDA),
IFC and MIGA portfolio (three-year rolling average) at exit (at early operating maturity for IFC investments and MIGA guarantees)
rated moderately satisfactory, satisfactory, or highly satisfactory on achievement of development outcomes by the Independent
Evaluation Group (IEG). Note that IEG evaluates Bank, IFC, and MIGA according to different methodologies and sampling techniques,
and the ratings therefore are not directly comparable.
 ‚Ä¢	 World Bank IBRD and IDA operations. Share of IBRD and IDA operations and of IBRD and IDA commitments rated by the IEG
    as ‚Äúmoderately satisfactory‚Äù or higher on achievement of outcomes. Data are for projects exiting in the three previous fiscal
    years for which at least 60% of the projects for each fiscal year have been evaluated by IEG. The rating captures the extent to
    which a project‚Äôs original or formally revised development objectives were achieved. The rating is based on three criteria: (i)
    relevance of the objectives and design (relevance); (ii) extent to which the objectives were achieved (efficacy); and (iii) extent to
    which the operation achieves a higher rate of return than the opportunity cost of capital, or is able to provide a similar economic
    justification (efficiency).

 ‚Ä¢	 For IFC and MIGA operations, the development outcome rating is a synthesis rating reflecting achievement of both project
    benchmarks and objectives. It rates the project across four development dimensions: project business success, economic
    sustainability, environmental and social effects, and private sector development impact.

 ‚Ä¢	 For IFC, the rating captures percentage of IFC investment projects rated over a given calendar year with Highly Successful,
    Successful, or Mostly Successful Development Outcome ratings. IFC‚Äôs project evaluation for a given calendar year is based on a
    representative sample of projects that have reached early operating maturity, defined as projects approved five years earlier than
    the calendar year for which the evaluation is being conducted (with adjustments for early operating maturity made based on
    judgments by IEG and IFC staff). It is based on a self- evaluation by investments staff of development and investment outcomes,
    as well as work quality and their sub-dimensions using Expanded Project Supervision Reports (XPSR) and corporate guidelines.
    All ratings are independently validated by the Private Sector Evaluation department of the Independent Evaluation Group
    (IEGPE) and are adjusted, as needed, to ensure that the prescribed evaluation guidelines and criteria are applied consistently.
 ‚Ä¢	 For MIGA, the ratings capture the percentage of MIGA- supported projects rated satisfactory or excellent for their development
    outcomes. MIGA and IEG evaluate the entire population of regular MIGA guarantee projects reaching operating maturity in a
    given fiscal year. Projects supported by the Small Investment Program (covering eligible guarantees up to $10 million) are being
    evaluated on a programmatic basis. MIGA staff conduct self- evaluations of a proportion of regular MIGA guarantee projects;
    these are independently validated by IEG. In addition, IEG evaluates a share of MIGA projects directly to ensure coverage of the
    population of regular guarantees by evaluation. Both self-evaluations and direct evaluations follow the same evaluation guidelines
    and criteria.

Climate-related World Bank Group commitments (US$ billions, annual): Annual dollar amount of World Bank Group commitments
that are addressing climate change mitigation or adaptation. Development activities provide climate change co-benefits when they
contribute to climate change adaptation and/or mitigation, even when adaptation and/or mitigation is not their main objective. In other
terms, an activity can provide adaptation and/or mitigation co-benefits both when climate change is among its stated objectives or
one of its positive externalities. The climate finance system tracks lending commitments with climate change co-benefits at the time of
project approval, not the amount of emission reductions or increased climate resilience resulting from the financing associated with
each operation.

 ‚Ä¢	 Adaptation is defined as an activity that provides adaptation co-benefits if it reduces the vulnerability of human or natural systems
    to the impacts of climate change and climate variability-related risks by maintaining or increasing adaptive capacity and resilience.

 ‚Ä¢	 Mitigation is defined as an activity that provides mitigation co-benefits if it either reduces Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions into
    the atmosphere or enhances their removal from the atmosphere. Reductions are measured against a ‚Äúno-project‚Äù baseline, and,
    similar to adaptation, the assessment is based on information in the project‚Äôs appraisal and/or supporting documents.

component of the index, with each indicator weighted at 0.20, except for SSA/CR, which is weighted at 0.40. The index components are
calculated by multiplying the weight by the progress of the applicable indicator, measured as the ratio of each indicator to its target.
Surpassing the target for each indicator is weighted the same as achieving the target, with no additional credit awarded. The final index
is the sum of the four components, with a WBG institutional target and maximum of ‚Äú1‚Äù.

Commitments with climate co-benefits (US$ billions): Investment project financing (IBRD and IDA) commitments that address climate
change mitigation or adaptation. Development activities are considered to provide climate change co-benefits when they contribute to
climate change adaptation and/or mitigation, even when adaptation and/or mitigation is not their primary development objective. In
other words, an activity can provide adaptation and/or mitigation co-benefits both when climate change is among its stated objectives
or is integrated into the project‚Äôs components. The World Bank data management system (SAP) tracks lending commitments¬†with
climate change co-benefits at the time of project approval in dollar terms, not the volume of emission reductions or increased climate
resilience resulting from the operation.
 ‚Ä¢	 Adaptation co-benefits are defined as are the results of an activity that specifically intends to reduce risks from increasing climate
    variability or the vulnerability of human or natural systems to the impacts of climate change by maintaining or increasing adaptive
    capacity and resilience.
 ‚Ä¢	 Mitigation is defined as an activity that provides mitigation co-benefits if it either reduces Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions into
    the atmosphere or enhances their removal from the atmosphere. Reductions are measured against a ‚Äúno-project‚Äù baseline, and,
    similar to adaptation, the assessment is based on information in the project‚Äôs appraisal and/or supporting documents.

Employee engagement (%): The Employee Engagement Index measures a staff member‚Äôs pride & willingness to advocate, sense of
belonging and contribution, and willingness to go the extra mile (‚Äúsay, stay and strive‚Äù). For the 2015 Engagement Survey, the index
was comprised of four survey questions grouped into three categories: (i) Q57. ‚ÄúI am proud to work at WBG‚Äù‚Äù and Q58. ‚ÄúThe WBG
is the best place to work in development‚Äù‚Äù (SAY); (ii) Q59. ‚ÄúI feel strong sense of belonging to WBG‚Äù‚Äù (STAY); (iii) Q60. ‚ÄúThe WBG
inspires me to do my best work‚Äù‚Äù (STRIVE).

Managerial effectiveness (%): The Managerial Effectiveness Index measures the successful application of a manager‚Äôs technical and
people skills to effectively lead their team. Specifically, it assesses managerial capabilities by direct and indirect reports, such as
honesty and integrity, fairness to all staff, and taking informed risks. It is constructed using eight survey questions that focus on a
manager‚Äôs: (i) Q13. Technical skills; (ii) Q14. People skills; (iii) Q16, Q19, and Q20. Helping staff to succeed; and (iv) Q15, Q17 and Q20.

Staff diversity (index): The Staff Diversity Index measures the aggregate difference from a target of ‚Äú1.‚Äù The weighted composite index
is made up of four institutional diversity indicators: Sub-Saharan African/Caribbean (SSA/CR) staff at grades GF and above, women in
technical roles at grades GF and above, Part II Managers, and Female Managers. Each indicator has a target and is weighted to form a
component of the index, with each indicator weighted at 0.20, except for SSA/CR, which is weighted at 0.40. The index components are
calculated by multiplying the weight by the progress of the applicable indicator, measured as the ratio of each indicator to its target.
Surpassing the target for each indicator is weighted the same as achieving the target, with no additional credit awarded. The final index
is the sum of the four components, with a WBG institutional target and maximum of ‚Äú1‚Äù.

Inclusion index (%): The Inclusion Index measures the degree to which the WBG creates a diverse and inclusive environment that fosters
equal opportunities for everyone to succeed in the work place regardless of demographic characteristics. The Index is comprised of
three attributes based on seven questions in the 2015 Engagement Survey: (i) Q27. and Q49. Creating an environment of trust and
inclusiveness; (ii) Q24, Q29 and Q50. Managerial commitment and accountability for diversity and inclusion; and (iii) Q47 and Q48.
Treating staff with fairness, dignity and respect.
