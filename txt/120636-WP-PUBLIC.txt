Overview
Highlights
 Most of the world’s poor live in rural areas, and rural nonfarm activities are an important part of
  their livelihood strategies. However, for the poor to benefit from the rural nonfarm economy
  (RNFE), they need to overcome a host of human, physical, financial, institutional, and social
  capital constraints.
 The World Bank Group has highlighted the RNFE in its strategies. From 2004 to 2014, the World
  Bank Group implemented 1,141 projects, valued at $46.5 billion, that included support for RNFE
  activities. However, the World Bank Group currently lacks an articulated approach to developing
  the RNFE to alleviate poverty. Many units have products in this space, but there is no
  coordinating mechanism.
 There is a gap between poverty and growth-oriented approaches in the RNFE. Those designed
  to reach the rural poor have reduced vulnerability and increased access to services but have not
  generated sufficient, sustained income to lift the rural poor out of poverty. Those RNFE projects
  with a growth aim—mainly value chain approaches—achieved increased revenues but mostly
  without evidence of benefits for the poor. Spillover effects are not measured. Efforts to bridge this
  gap asked approaches adept at service delivery to achieve earned income goals beyond their
  original design.
 Where investments by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in food processing have had
  strong links to rural areas, they have mainly generated positive rural employment outcomes and
  demonstrated links to the RNFE. However, in its agribusiness portfolio, there was little in project
  design that targeted or tracked benefits for the poor. IFC’s retail investments linked to rural areas
  seek to increase the availability of goods and drive down costs for rural consumers. However,
  none of the investments tracked consumer benefits (costs) and only a few included local
  sourcing. In spite of examples where market power has adversely affected poor value chain
  participants, the risks imposed by market structure, its impact on the poor, and related mitigants
  are rarely treated explicitly in project documentation.
 The World Bank has been a leader in researching the RNFE, including its link to poverty. But
  there is a gap on the diagnostic and analytics side that has been addressed occasionally but not
  systematically.
 Addressing binding constraints is key to linking the rural poor to productive activities in the RNFE.
 World Bank–financed rural transport projects have not measured their contribution to local
  economic gains, in spite of intentions to achieve this. Rural connectivity is being achieved through
  synergies between transport and agriculture lending but mainly in transitioning economies. Basic
  literacy and skills are critical enablers in the RNFE, but dialogue is lacking between the
  Agriculture and Education Global Practices. Although many value chain projects include a skills
  component, impact is not assessed. The delivery of sustainable, low-cost rural financial services
  requires research, piloting, and scaling-up of innovative business models to reach the
  underserved. World Bank support has extended some financial services to the poorest rural
  segments, but subsidization raises questions about sustainability, crowding out, and potential for

    politicization. IFC investments reach countries with high exclusion rates, but only a fraction caters
    to the lower end of the retail segment.
 Based on its evaluation, the Independent Evaluation Group recommends the World Bank Group
  do the following:
          At the corporate level, clarify its approach to the RNFE and how it engages across
           institutions.
          More flexibly and relevantly select and design projects in a manner tailored to country
           conditions and the needs of the target rural population.
          Close knowledge gaps about what works to reduce rural poverty within the RNFE.
          For IFC, include in its value chain analysis, and monitoring and evaluation, a consideration
           of poverty and gender impacts. In project documents, articulate market power risks as
           applicable.
          Where the rural economy is a key part of the solution to ending poverty, collect information
           on rural enterprises to better inform the Systematic Country Diagnostic.
          Strengthen and deepen gender analysis during project preparation and more consistently
           use the results to address key constraints in project design.

Management Response
Management of the World Bank Group institutions welcomes the Independent
Evaluation Group (IEG) report reviewing the World Bank Group’s contribution to
poverty reduction in the rural nonfarm economy (RNFE) from FY04 to FY14.
Management generally agrees with the review’s recommendations and thanks IEG
for its collaborative engagement with staff over the course of the evaluation.

As per capita incomes increase and structural transformation takes place, the share
of the nonfarm economy in rural incomes tends to increase. Rural activity beyond
the farm gate is initially strongly linked to agriculture—such as the storage,
processing, distribution, and transportation of agricultural outputs and inputs that
account for a large share of the manufacturing and services sectors in rural areas.
Increased incomes from these activities across the broader food system tend to
increase demand for rural non-agriculture-related activities such as construction and
other services that can become an important source of incomes. Better
understanding this rural dynamic can help inform policies and programs to facilitate
rural jobs and income growth. Indeed, a recent World Bank publication, Shaping the
Food System to Deliver Jobs, unpacks some of this dynamic and provides a
framework for jobs and income growth in the food system that accounts for much
rural economic activity.

A challenge for the IEG evaluation was the criteria for selecting projects that affect
RNFE, given the broad and somewhat fluid definitions of rural and nonfarm. As the
report notes, “There is no global definition of ‘rural’ …Thus rural is everything that
a country does not define as urban, and although it is measured, it is an amalgam of
non-uniform criteria”; and “Rural nonfarm activity is defined both spatially, by
activity that takes place in rural areas, and functionally, by a set of activities that do
not constitute primary agricultural production.” Defining RNFE as activities in rural
areas that do not constitute primary (farm) production, and applying associated
project selection criteria, IEG evaluated a portfolio for 2004–14 that amounted, for
the World Bank, to $35.4 billion, and for IFC, to $10.7 billion (investment projects)
and $273 million (advisory projects). For the World Bank, these projects were
mapped across multiple Global Practices (GPs): including Agriculture; Social,
Urban, Rural & Resilience; Social Protection and Labor; Trade and Competitiveness;
and Environment. Not included in the core portfolio evaluated were projects
focusing on energy, health, education, and broader finance projects supporting
activities in rural areas, although the report drew on other evaluations on these
aspects.

MANAGEMENT RESPONSE


World Bank Management Response
CONTEXT
Management welcomes and is in general agreement with the findings of the review.
Nevertheless, we would like to emphasize several aspects related to the broader
context that have implications for prioritization considerations in rural areas.

Relative importance among rural economic activities. While the evaluation focuses
on RNFE activities, it is important to recognize the centrality of farm activities for
poor people in rural areas, which has implications for prioritizing overall support in
rural areas. Of the worldwide poor, 80 percent live in rural areas, and about
80 percent of them work in agriculture, mostly on-farm. The importance of
agriculture varies by Regions and by the country’s stage of structural
transformation. For example, in Sub-Saharan Africa, agriculture accounts for about
70 percent of rural household income, rural nonfarm activities for about 20 percent,
and transfers for about 10 percent. In Asia, about half of rural incomes are from
agricultural activities, 37 percent from nonfarm activities, and 13 percent from
transfers. In agriculturally dependent countries, it is hard to create nonfarm jobs and
income sources in the RNFE without first growing the profitability of agricultural
tradables, the income from which stimulates demand growth in rural and urban
areas.

Shifts in strategic directions. The evaluation noted the World Bank Group’s shift to
focus more explicitly on agriculture relative to broader rural development—a shift
that was driven by the 2008 World Development Report (WDR) and earlier IEG
findings and recommendations. The 2008 WDR, Agriculture for Development,
highlighted that “agriculture has served as a basis for growth and reduced poverty
in many countries, but more countries could benefit if governments and donors
were to reverse years of policy neglect and remedy their underinvestment and mis-
investment in agriculture,” and it called for more and better investment in
agriculture. The report World Bank Assistance in Sub-Saharan Africa: An IEG Review
(2007) stated that “the central finding of the study is that the agriculture sector has
been neglected by both governments and the donor community, including the
World Bank. The World Bank’s strategy for agriculture has been increasingly
subsumed within a broader rural focus, which has diminished its importance.”
These findings initially led to the development of a World Bank Agriculture Action
Plan (roadmap) for Africa, then for all Regions. The world food price spikes in 2008
reinforced the findings of the 2008 WDR. About 75 percent of support through the
Agriculture Action Plans focused on raising agricultural productivity, and
25 percent on linking farmers to markets, strengthening value chains, and other

rural nonfarm income-generating activities (including physical infrastructure, value
chain coordination, enabling environment, finance, and skills). This 25 percent
portfolio share overlaps with the definition of the RNFE in the IEG evaluation.
Moving forward, it will be important to continue to reflect the relative importance of
farm and nonfarm rural activities in the composition of support.

Demand for RNFE activities. The IEG report tends to focus more on supply-side
constraints to RNFE activity. While these undoubtedly matter, it is important to
recognize that the development of rural nonfarm enterprises is dependent on the
demand for the goods and services they provide. Demand-side aspects include
growing the profitability of tradable agriculture (mentioned above), improving the
rural business climate, providing infrastructure, and encouraging competition and
private sector participation. As rural non-agriculture-related activities are mostly
non-tradable, they are by definition demand-constrained. To make these rural non-
agriculture-related activities grow, it is necessary to bring new income from outside
the local area that is widely distributed to poor consumers. Increased exports of
crops and other agricultural products from the local area (to cities and across
borders) can sustainably stimulate additional demand for nontradables in rural
areas. Moreover, additional sources of demand for RNFE activities can be provided
by linking rural enterprises to external sources of demand, through such means as
the e-commerce platforms linking small entrepreneurs in China’s Taobao rural
villages with national and global markets.

Coordinating mechanisms. The evaluation indicates that there is no one GP or unit
with coordinating responsibility for RNFE activities. We would note that since the
2004–14 evaluation period, with the 2014 introduction of the World Bank Group’s
new operating model, Systematic Country Diagnostics (SCDs) and Country
Partnership Frameworks (CPFs) provide the coordinating mechanism at the country
level. The GPs, also established in 2014, promote the flow of knowledge across
sectors, Regions, and the World Bank Group, and enable personnel from various
sectors and Regions to work together on solutions, providing expertise from diverse
technical areas to address multidimensional problems.

COMMENTS ON RECOMMENDATIONS
Management welcomes the report’s approach in formulating a limited number of
focused recommendations, with some specific actions listed as possible options or
suggestions for Management’s consideration.

Recommendation 1: At the corporate level, the World Bank and IFC should clarify
its approach to the Rural Nonfarm Economy, and as part of it, how the World Bank
Group engages across its institutions, GPs, and partnerships to promote nonfarm


                                                                                    xix

economic development to reduce poverty in the rural space. Management agrees
with the essence of the recommendation that aims to ensure an appropriately
focused and coordinated set of activities to promote RNFE development. An overall
framework to improve jobs and income in the RNFE can help guide World Bank
support in this area. The modalities for operationalizing this are already reflected in
the new operating model adopted by the World Bank Group in 2014 (the end of the
evaluation period).

The SCDs and CPFs provide the principal coordination mechanism for the
implementation of World Bank and IFC country-level activities in both rural and
urban areas. An overall framework to improve jobs and income in the RNFE can
help guide and strengthen the SCDs and CPFs, including through engagement
across the institution and GPs, and with partners. In this context, we highlight the
continued need to reflect in World Bank support the relative importance of farm,
rural nonfarm, and urban activities in the incomes and opportunities of the world’s
767 million poor people. In countries with high levels of rural poverty, SCDs need to
explore the challenges and opportunities in rural space, with an understanding of
current trends and patterns in poverty reduction, inclusion, and sustainability,
including exploring critical contextual factors such as geography and the spatial
distribution of poverty.

The new operating model the World Bank Group put in place in 2014 was
specifically created to facilitate cooperation across GPs/cross-cutting solution areas
and across Regions. An example is the new Global Solutions Group on Rural
Livelihoods and Jobs, which brings together staff from different parts of the World
Bank Group (including the Trade & Competitiveness GP, the Urban, Rural & Social
Development GP, the Health, Nutrition, and Population GP, and the IFC). The
group is beginning to work on job diagnostics, measurement, rural structural
transformation analytics, and studies on the nonfarm subsector, including the
informal economy. Consistent with the World Bank Group’s new operating model,
Management is increasing efforts to coordinate and carry out analytics and
evaluations in this area.

Recommendation 2: In order to bridge the identified gap, the World Bank and IFC
should more flexibly and relevantly select and design projects in a manner tailored
to the specific stage and nature of a country or area’s structural transformation and
adapted to the needs and dynamics of the target rural population. Management
agrees that project designs should be tailored to the specific stage and nature of a
country’s or area’s structural transformation and adapted to the needs and dynamics
of the target population. Pooling knowledge of lessons from specific contexts,
including from this evaluation, can help inform future project designs.

Recommendation 3: The World Bank Group should work to close knowledge gaps
about what works to reduce rural poverty within the rural nonfarm economy. The
World Bank should conduct evaluations (either systematically, through a
representative sample, or through clusters) of poverty and growth oriented projects
to learn more about the mechanisms by which they influence the development of the
rural nonfarm economy and their impact on poverty. Management agrees to track
income effects in more projects supporting activities in the RNFE than it did during
2004-14. This can yield information about which approaches work best in which
contexts. The World Bank has a range of work ongoing in this area. For example,
under the i2i Trust Fund and DIME-funded programs, 26 impact evaluations in the
related agriculture sector, and 14 non-agriculture rural impact evaluations, are
completed or under way. That said, to reach a number that would cover all “major
intervention categories” in a representative sample of countries and sectors would
be challenging. In addition, to learn more about the mechanisms and interventions
through which structural transformation takes place, the Agriculture GP has
initiated studies and evaluations that include enterprise surveys carried out in
conjunction with household surveys and a review of enterprise data that are
collected through national and local statistics and survey systems. The World Bank
is trying to do more collection of survey data in rural areas, but the extent of more
invariably depends upon the availability of funding. In a time of flat budgets, it will
be important to give priority to countries where, for example, the RNFE is identified
in the SCD as being a top-priority area.

Recommendation 5: In countries where the rural economy is a key part of the
solution to ending poverty, the World Bank Group should (in partnership with
donors and client countries) collect information on both formal and informal rural
enterprises and their constraints and performance to help better inform the
Systematic Country Diagnostic. Increasing our knowledge of the constraints to and
performance of formal and informal rural enterprises in client countries can better
inform SCDs and subsequent programs of support. As the evaluation notes, while
excellent work has been done on the higher-level diagnostics of RNFE, there is a
knowledge gap on deeper granular insights to further guide policy and investment
interventions. It will be necessary to prioritize data collection efforts in this area,
taking into account the country context and other competing knowledge gaps.
Analytical work using existing information on both formal and informal micro and
medium-sized rural enterprises is ongoing to deepen our knowledge base on
enterprise dynamics and on associated incomes and jobs. Over time, we hope to
build a critical mass of knowledge and robust insights capable of better informing
future SCDs and the design of new operations. For IDA18 one of the key themes of
focus is Jobs, including those in the RNFE; therefore, the intensity of analytical work



                                                                                     xxi

on jobs diagnostics and measurement has significantly increased, and over time the
results will become a significant part of SCDs and operations.

Recommendation 6: The World Bank Group should strengthen and deepen gender
analysis during project preparation of rural nonfarm projects and more consistently
use the results of this analysis, to address gender-related binding constraints to
female labor force participation in the RNFE. Project design should incorporate
measures to address these constraints, and select indicators to track progress made
toward gender-related economic outcomes. Management agrees with this
recommendation. It is entirely consistent with the World Bank’s new gender
strategy, which requires that Project Appraisal Documents (PADs) include: (a) an
analysis to identify relevant gender gaps (as in access to services, markets, or assets)
that the project can contribute to closing, (b) actions to address the gender gaps
identified in the analysis, and (c) indicators to monitor the outcomes of actions taken
to reduce the gender gap.

As has been noted, World Bank Management is in general agreement with the
evaluation’s recommendations. We note that most of the recommendations are
entirely consistent with broader Bank requirements introduced in recent years:
better analysis of the drivers of poverty, including from a geospatial perspective,
within the SCD process; better design of solutions and a World Bank program in the
CPF (including better integration/collaboration across the World Bank Group and
across the development community); design of projects/interventions with results
frameworks that track impact on incomes/livelihoods (consistent with project
objectives an intended impacts); and much better analysis of gender-based barriers,
along with actions to address and monitor them.


IFC Management Response
IFC Management would like to congratulate the IEG team for a thoughtful report on
the World Bank Group’s contribution to the rural nonfarm economy (RNFE). IEG’s
engagements and dialogues were welcome and appreciated. Before responding to
the recommendations of the report, Management wishes to note a few points.

First, as was shared with IEG from the early stages of engagement, IFC Management
is of the view that farm and nonfarm impacts are fundamentally intertwined;
therefore, IFC does not distinguish between the agricultural and the nonfarm rural
economy. IFC’s Agribusiness Strategic Action Plan (ASAP) FY12–14, which was
presented to CODE in August 2011 and continues to be the strategic framework for
agribusiness today, incorporates both types of support and related activities, which



xxii
                                                              MANAGEMENT ACTION RECORD


are overseen primarily by the Agribusiness group in the Manufacturing,
Agribusiness, and Services (MAS) Department. The ASAP, which is aligned with the
World Bank Group’s Agriculture Action Plan, focuses on (a) food security, (b)
inclusive economic development, and (c) environmental and social sustainability as
business drivers. It facilitates relevant cross-team collaboration from different IFC
departments as well as the World Bank’s Agriculture GP and other relevant GPs. A
revised strategy, now being developed, is expected to continue the main ASAP focus
areas.

Second, as the ASAP second pillar highlights, economic inclusion is central to IFC’s
agribusiness strategy, which aims to support smallholder farmers, including
women, in agri-value chains and to promote intentional engagement with global
and regional value chain “anchor firms.” IFC seeks to engage with these anchor
firms, including agricultural trading companies, because they are the main vehicle
for setting standards, ensuring traceability, driving productivity increases, and
rewarding quality differentials. IFC’s approach is to increase the inclusiveness and
reach of agri-supply chains by working with both local and international value chain
anchor firms where access to markets creates increased access to finance, inputs, and
other opportunities. In many rural markets, such anchor firms may be the only
organized, formal private sector operators. IFC seeks out partnerships with firms
that function as supply chain managers, providing inputs, extension services, and
technical assistance, and helping to ensure that the market is linked to global pricing
and standards. Supply chain managers typically seek ways to improve farmers’
yields and quality of production, as it aligns with their incentives to provide
consistent quality and quantities, and reinforces long-term relationships. For farmers
who are able to respond to these standards and requirements and to utilize the
inputs and services provided effectively, there are significant opportunities to
sustain and increase their incomes through participation in the value chain.

While IFC Management recognizes the positive experience with strengthening
producer organizations and government support, such as Latin America’s
productive partnerships in improving smallholder farmers’ access to markets and
inputs that the IEG report noted, IFC considers it also critical to develop private-
sector-oriented solutions that leverage the value chain “market power” of anchor
firms—an approach that the report criticized. With this objective in mind, IFC
collaborates with anchor firms where IFC’s development objectives are aligned with
their commercial interests and where the only subsidy is the donor-funded portion
of IFC Advisory Services. The resulting solutions often include strengthening
cooperatives and other producer organizations, as in coffee in Nicaragua and more
recently in cocoa in Côte d’Ivoire and Cameroon. The same objective drives some of
IFC’s Advisory Services to improve the functioning of the supply chain and the


                                                                                   xxiii
MANAGEMENT RESPONSE


system, which would then generate benefits for smallholder farmers and anchor
firms alike. Evaluative evidence from IFC advisory engagements has so far validated
the benefits to farmers from this approach of working through value chain anchor
firms.

IFC Management is pleased with the report’s finding that many IFC agribusiness
projects have strong reach into and impact on rural areas, and that certain issues
related to small farmers are being more positively addressed by IFC with new and
evolving mechanisms. One example is the Global Agriculture and Food Security
Program Private Sector Window (GAFSP PrSW), managed by IFC since 2009, which
is an innovative vehicle to support smallholder farmers in the poorest countries,
nearly all of which are agrarian economies, through both on-farm and nonfarm
activities. The vehicle has been facilitating support outside IFC’s traditional tools
and activities, leading to benefits beyond the financing instrument itself through
technical assistance and linkages to the client company and related beneficiaries.
Another tool developed in recent years is the Global Warehouse Finance Program
(GWFP), which works with local banks to provide inventory financing to farmers.
While the GWFP program is still in its early stages, it has already been very effective
in improving farmers’ access to finance, especially where warehouse receipt
financing did not exist previously, and especially where the instrument was
introduced with the support of GAFSP PrSW.

With respect to GWFP, IFC Management clarifies that the purpose of the program is
to introduce warehouse receipt-based financial instruments into commercial
banking systems where they do not currently exist. Between September 2010, when
the program began, and November 2016, GWFP supported 19 transactions worth
$552 million, most of which were committed and disbursed after the 2004–14
evaluation period. Warehouse receipt finance offers an important alternative way
for farmers to store their product for a period before the sale, allowing them to take
advantage of higher prices in off-harvest periods. The report suggests that IFC
should influence participating banks to focus on poor clients to maximize the
poverty impact, and should otherwise seek to influence banks to focus on particular
crops relevant to small farmers. IFC’s focus at this stage is on establishing well-
designed financial instruments to be in common use for as large a market as possible
to achieve efficiency and reach to all appropriate crops and transaction sizes. This is
the critical priority for a new financial instrument; once it is firmly embedded in the
market, IFC can then seek to address any access and distributional inefficiencies.

Regarding attribution difficulties on the benefits of IFC or private sector
interventions for the rural poor, IFC Management agrees that this is an area that
remains challenging. However, building on initiatives in this area, such as IFC’s

                                                             MANAGEMENT ACTION RECORD


initial comprehensive household income and benefits study conducted for
Nicaraguan coffee farmer suppliers in 2014, IFC is expanding its efforts. While
economic and household income studies are challenging, resource-intensive in both
personnel and financing, and, even in the best cases, imperfect, several current
initiatives and partnerships are designed to further help with greater evidence of the
broader impacts of selected interventions. In several advisory projects IFC has
successfully piloted the SWIFT poverty assessment tool developed by the World
Bank. Income and poverty impact studies built into the GAFSP PrSW at both the
overall and project levels and an IFC-sponsored evaluation of “Agri-Traders”
investments and advisory services are examples of efforts examining more direct
income and other farmer benefits.

With this background, IFC is in broad agreement with the essence of the
recommendations, except the premise of Recommendation 4.

Recommendation 1: IFC agrees that it will be helpful to clarify the approach. In IFC,
this is best done within the articulation of the Agribusiness strategy, which, as
noted, brings in other parts of IFC. For implementation of World Bank and IFC
country-level activities, IFC agrees with the World Bank colleagues that the SCDs
and CPFs provide coordination mechanisms in both rural and urban areas.

Recommendation 2: IFC Management does not disagree with this approach. It
clarifies, however, that impact on rural areas is often not the primary impact IFC
seeks in supporting projects, which the recommendation appears to suggest that it
should be.

Recommendation 4: Although IFC Management agrees with the substance of the
recommendation, it does not agree with the premise of the recommendation on the
distortions of market power in agricultural value chains. In IFC Management’s view,
it is important to assess the impact of an IFC-supported project on the market,
including on market structure and competition. IFC also considers it important to
identify poverty and gender impacts both ex-ante and ex-post. In this respect, IFC
has developed a new ex-ante framework for evaluating economic impact,
Anticipated Impact Measurement and Monitoring (AIMM), which is being
introduced in phases in FY18, with full deployment planned for FY19. In AIMM, the
market-level impact is a key part of the framework; another dimension assessed will
be inclusiveness, which will incorporate likely impacts on women and low-income
populations. The AIMM assessments will be ex-ante assessments of pending
projects, and subject to limitations and assumptions. With regard to ex-post
assessments, assessments of poverty and gender impacts are typically undertaken as
part of external evaluations, but without distinguishing rural and non-rural

domains, and it is not possible to obtain accurate poverty impact data in all cases. In
projects where IFC has additional resources for monitoring and evaluation, such as
GAFSP and some Advisory Services projects, IFC is increasingly incorporating these
elements—for example, through the use of poverty scorecard metrics and gender
differentiation.

Recommendations 3, 5, and 6: These are oriented largely to the World Bank. IFC is
prepared to support World Bank colleagues as appropriate in meeting these
recommendations.

1. Introduction and Background
 Highlights
 The rural nonfarm economy (RNFE), defined both spatially and functionally, is critical to poor
  household’s income strategies, enhancing resilience and sometimes providing a pathway out of
  poverty.
 Empirical evidence shows that, although much RNFE activity is low productivity and informal, the
  rural nonfarm sector can, and often does, contribute to economic growth, rural employment,
  poverty reduction, and a more spatially balanced population distribution.
 For the poor to access opportunities in the RNFE they will need to overcome many constraints,
  including transport connectivity, access to skills and education, and financial services, as well as
  social factors of exclusion linked to status, identity and gender, among others.
 The opportunities and challenges of the RNFE are context-specific and can be understood
  through a “three worlds” lens that captures the stage of a country’s structural transformation.
 This evaluation assesses the effectiveness of World Bank Group support to the development of
  the RNFE to reduce rural poverty using a constructed theory of change linking a diagnostic
  understanding of challenges to interventions, outcomes, and impacts.
 In the wake of the global food crisis of 2008, the World Bank Group’s Agriculture Action Plans
  increased emphasis on agricultural productivity, agribusiness, and aspects of the RNFE.
  However, at present there is no clear locus for a spatial focus on rural economic development or
  an integrated view of the RNFE, across global practices or with regard to partnering.
This evaluation asked a key question: “How successfully has the World Bank Group
contributed to the creation of sustainable income-generating opportunities for the
rural poor through the rural nonfarm economy (RNFE)? And, what attributable
effects have World Bank Group efforts had on reducing poverty?”

Definitions
Rural nonfarm activity is defined both spatially, by activity that takes place in rural
areas, and functionally, by a set of activities that do not constitute primary
agricultural production. Rural nonfarm activities include value chain activities, such
as agroprocessing, transport, distribution, marketing, and retail, as well as other
economic activities in the rural space, such as tourism, manufacturing, construction,
mining, and other self-employment activities (handicrafts, bakeries, mechanics,
kiosks, and so on).1

There is no global definition of “rural”; instead, the World Bank relies on the
definitions used by national statistical agencies. These definitions vary widely,
sometimes applying a cutoff at a particular population level or density, sometimes
using sectoral characteristics (for example, whether the population is primarily
engaged in agriculture), and sometimes using legal or administrative definitions (for
example, whether the settlement is incorporated as an urban unit). Thus rural is

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
everything that a country does not define as urban, and although it is measured, it is
an amalgam of nonuniform criteria.

Analytical Underpinnings

Most of the world’s poor live in rural areas, and rural nonfarm activities are an
important part of rural households’ complex income strategies. In 2013, an estimated
767 million people were living under the international poverty line of $1.90 a day,
with 80 percent of the total poor living in rural areas (World Bank 2016b). Although
migration, urbanization, and increased farming productivity can be key pathways
out of poverty, the poverty-reducing effects of rapid modernization are highly
contextual and policy dependent, especially where high inequality exists. In rural
areas, farming accounts for a large share of most rural households’ income, but
empirical evidence points to a large and growing rural nonfarm sector (Losch 2012;
Haggblade, Hazell, and Reardon 2007; Davis 2006; Lanjouw 2001).2 Rural nonfarm
activities account for 35 to 50 percent of rural income in developing countries, and
for the landless and the very poor, sustainable income gains at the household level
are associated with additional wages earned from nonfarm activities. Households
relying only on farming tend to be among the poorest.

But for the poor to benefit from opportunities in the RNFE—including those
presented by mobility—they must overcome many policy and resource constraints.
These include connectivity, access to basic literacy and numeracy, relevant skills,
finance, and legal rights to land. Other constraints are associated with exclusion
based on gender, age, or identity. This is evidenced in studies showing a positive
correlation between increased access to rural services and the ability of the poor to
benefit from the RNFE. For example, in China, nonfarm activity was found to reduce
rural income inequality, disproportionately benefiting poor households (Zhu and
Luo 2006). Rural infrastructure and basic education were critical. In India, although
the most disadvantaged may not directly participate in the nonfarm sector, the
sector raises rural labor demand and wages, with indirect effects on poverty
(Lanjouw 2001).

Much RNFE activity is low productivity and subsistence level through household or
microenterprises, the latter often located in rural villages. These activities provide
important, if intermittent, sources of income. With few assets and spare earnings,
there is little investment or growth for such enterprises, but they provide important
supplemental income for consumption. The relatively better off rural residents, with
greater endowments of human and physical capital, are better able to profit
substantially from nonfarm enterprises and wage employment. Research indicates
that the better off are more equipped to take advantage of chances to link to value

chain opportunities reaching into the rural space, as traders, processors, distributors,
retailers, and workers (Davis 2006).

Nonetheless, the rural nonfarm sector can, and often does, contribute to economic
growth, rural employment, poverty reduction, and a more spatially balanced
population distribution (Lanjouw 2001). The distributional impacts of rural nonfarm
opportunities can be significantly pro-poor, extending through linkages between the
nonfarm and the farm sector. In recent years, there has been emerging evidence that,
in some cases, rural diversification and secondary town development is leading to
faster poverty reduction and more inclusive growth patterns than larger-scale
urbanization (Christiaensen 2013; Christiaensen, Weerdt, and Todoc 2013; Dorosh
and Thurlow 2013, 2014; Wenban-Smith and Ambrose 2014; Datt and others 2016).
Mobility and access to transferable assets augment this.

Evaluation Rationale
This evaluation aims to deepen the evidence concerning the effectiveness of World
Bank Group support to the development of a sustainable and inclusive RNFE. The
RNFE is a vital pathway for many rural poor households to lift themselves out of
poverty and is thus a key building block of the twin goals. The evaluation took on an
area critical for realizing further gains in poverty in the coming decade. To date,
none of the evaluations by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) have conducted
a multisectoral assessment to learn about what works in this segment of the
economy.

Strategies and Analyses of the World Bank Group Related to the RNFE
Prior to and during the evaluation period, the World Bank approved and
implemented two successive rural development strategies. Rural Well-Being: From
Vision to Action, launched in 1997, decisively influenced global thinking but had
disappointing results in the field. The 2003 strategy, Reaching the Rural Poor, focused
on the most disadvantaged and sought to address rural areas in their entirety by
promoting broad-based rural growth and service provision, including the RNFE. It
also recognized that lending for agriculture was then at its lowest level in the World
Bank’s history, despite the integral role that agriculture plays for the rural poor
directly, through farming, or indirectly, through value chain activities.

Midway through the implementation of the World Bank’s 2003 rural strategy, IEG’s
report on World Bank Assistance to Agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa: An IEG Review
stated that “the agriculture sector has been neglected by both governments and the
donor community, including the World Bank” (World Bank 2007). This, followed by



                                                                                       3
CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
similar findings in IEG’s global evaluation, Growth and Productivity in Agriculture and
Agribusiness, initially led to the development of a World Bank agriculture action plan
(roadmap) for Africa, then for all regions as reflected by the World Bank Group
agriculture action plans (World Bank 2011). But as stated in these IEG agriculture
evaluations, the broader aims of the World Bank’s rural development strategy,
including an analysis of the poverty reducing potential of the RNFE were not
evaluated.

Since 2008, The World Bank Group’s approach in the agriculture sector and the
RNFE is largely rooted in analysis conducted for the World Development Report
(WDR) on agriculture, which recommended that when crafting policy, the World
Bank Group should consider the specific growth pathways of client countries—with
particular attention to their dependence on agriculture and the nature of rural
poverty (World Bank 2008). The WDR 2008 introduced a “three worlds” lens of
agrarian, transitional, and urbanized countries (figure 1.1). Although each country
follows a somewhat different path of structural transformation and RNFE
development, this lens facilitates observing some systematic differences in country
context and in the World Bank Group portfolio, as well as the relationship of the
RNFE to the farm, urban, and global economies. In larger countries, there are also
regional differences in the state of structural transformation.

The case studies illustrate several differences supported by findings at the portfolio
level and in the literature. For example, in agrarian economies, RNFE income-
generating opportunities are highly dependent on the performance of farming, and
the ability of the RNFE to reduce rural poverty is directly linked to smallholder
productivity. Demand, labor availability, and wages are each critically linked to
agricultural cycles and productivity. In transitional economies, demand and labor
markets in secondary towns and urban centers begin to feature more prominently.
In industrial economies, RNFE may be driven far more by opportunities connected
to urban or export markets.3 At the same time, rural nonfarm labor may transition
from informal employment in household enterprises and self-employment to more
structured and formal wage employment and formal entrepreneurship. Sectorally,
there may be substantial diversification out of agriculture.4 However, as the case
studies reveal, current poverty levels call for strategic investments in infrastructure,
training and innovation, market functioning, and regional integration, the coherence
of which needs to be ensured through appropriate development strategies.
Evaluations of more than two decades of integrated rural development projects,
demonstrates that RNFE approaches should not be embedded in a single project but
that spatially integrated approaches are needed.

Subsequently, the WDR on economic geography recommended the need for a more
nuanced understanding of the influence of country conditions and policies on the
pace, pattern, and consequences of rural-urban transitions (World Bank 2009). The
Global Monitoring Report 2013: Urban-Rural Dynamics and the Millennium Development
Goals focused on spatial inequality, suggesting that spatial divides are mainly a
function of country conditions, policies, and institutions which, combined,
determine the way a country may choose to address or neglect drivers of rural
poverty and the quality of growth (World Bank 2013).

Agriculture Action Plans. Following two successive food crises, the World Bank
Group launched its Agriculture Action Plans (FY10–12, FY13–15), which have
explicitly recognized the importance of the RNFE, including the poverty reduction
potential of promoting more effective local production and expenditure linkages. In
the action plans, RNFE is one of the major thematic areas of assistance due to its
increasing importance in many countries and because of its role in structural
transformation and sustainable urbanization. 5 Specifically, the five RNFE business
lines identified were

       investment;

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
       improving rural livelihoods by expanding the South Asia approach of
        supporting self-help groups to increase women’s access to income, social, and
        financial services;

       upgrading skills to expand job opportunities to promote nonfarm activities
        and enhancing rural education to improve productivity and vocational
        training for supply chain skills, especially for women;

       investing in rural infrastructure to help lower transaction costs, increase
        connectivity, and raise nonfarm earnings, especially in lagging areas; and

       promote youth employment by removing barriers and identifying entry
        points for youth to join the labor force by improving access to land, capital,
        and skills.

The Agribusiness Strategic Action Plan of the International Finance Corporation
(IFC), covering FY12–14 was designed to be aligned directly with the agriculture
action plans. It has three pillars: (i) enhance Food Security, by increasing
productivity and reducing loss in the global food system; (ii) Inclusive Economic
Development, and (iii) Making Environmental and Social Sustainability a business
driver. The Agribusiness Strategic Action Plan FY12–14 has been extended as the
guiding framework for FY15 and beyond. IFC’s strategy (2017–19) recognizes that
the global food system requires integrated solutions across the value chain from
agricultural inputs to production to food retail. It commits IFC to continuing to
integrate advisory and investment operations in agribusiness to enhance
development impact beyond financing alone. In particular, it will focus on firms
which work with smallholder supply chains, while noting that, in many markets,
increased coordination with the World Bank Agriculture Global Practice (GP) and
IFC infrastructure and investment climate reforms initiatives are critically needed to
achieve impact.

Interviews with World Bank headquarters and country level staff noted that a key
challenge of implementing the RNFE pillar of the World Bank’s agriculture action
plans is that many of the enabling conditions listed lie outside the control of the
Agriculture GP, and that this issue has expanded since the reorganization due to the
dispersion of rural-themed projects across GPs. IEG interviews with the Social,
Urban, Resilience and Rural GP (SURR) indicate that its rural theme will be replaced
with a focus on territorial approaches. Country-level discussions expressed concern
about “siloized approaches” and a lack of incentives and reward for intersectoral
collaboration to achieve a more integrated and strategic approach toward
developing the RNFE. In the agriculture action plans, there is an articulated

partnership strategy for the agriculture sector, but not for the development of the
RNFE to reduce poverty. One key partnership in the rural space is the International
Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD), with which the World Bank has a
corporate Memorandum of Understanding. However, at the country level, several of
the RNFE country studies pointed to missed opportunities to use this partnership to
leverage more effective rural policy reform and to achieve more synergies in linking
the rural poor to more productive rural nonfarm income-generating opportunities
and to addressing binding constraints (box1.1).


 Box 1.1. Partnering to Develop the Rural Economy to Reduce Poverty: The Role of IFAD
 IFAD’s mission is to “enable the rural poor to overcome poverty,” with the aim to
 “empower rural poor women and men in developing countries to achieve higher incomes
 and improved food security” (IFAD 2012). These goals are well aligned with the World
 Bank Group’s mission and efforts to use the RNFE as a vehicle to reduce poverty. The
 RNFE country case missions revealed opportunities to deepen collaboration at the
 country level to achieve better complementarities. This was most evident where IFAD
 was simultaneously engaged in rural poverty reduction programs while the World Bank
 had moved toward a more competitive approach. For example, in northeast Brazil, the
 World Bank has shifted from community-based approaches toward value chain models
 while IFAD has retained a community development focus. In Ethiopia, where the World
 Bank and IFAD have cofinanced pastoral and livestock programs, IEG’s Project
 Performance Assessment Report of the Pastoral Community Development Projects
 highlighted the need for a clear engagement strategy for pastoral areas (World Bank
 2016a). In Nicaragua, shared concerns were expressed about the need to strengthen the
 role of the local private sector and an ongoing IFAD pilot was discussed in this regard,
 but a common platform had not established to partner in this respect. Artisanal
 opportunities had been identified by UN partners in Morocco (for example, argan oil) but
 the absence of finance (the type that the World Bank could bring) has limited the poverty
 reducing effects of this value chain activity. IEG’s portfolio review also pointed out that at
 the project level, opportunities were being missed to achieve greater learning across the
 institutions’ differentiated approaches, especially in cofinanced projects. Between 2004
 and 2014, there were 31 IFAD–World Bank cofinanced projects, valued at $441 million,
 mainly in IDA countries. Yet, opportunities for learning about what works through
 codissemination of the project level evaluations has not occurred—except for the Ethiopia
 pastoral evaluation, where the IFAD consultant was also the author of the assessment
 conducted by IEG.

The Rural Nonfarm Income-Generating Portfolio

The RNFE is not a sector but a prominent theme in the Agriculture Action Plan. As
articulated in that plan, the development of the RNFE requires support across
sectors (now GPs). As such, in the absence of an identified portfolio, this evaluation


                                                                                                  7

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
used the theme code “rural nonfarm income generation” applied by the World Bank
to 152 projects between 2004 and 2014. By deconstructing the rural nonfarm income-
generation activities linked to the code, the portfolio review used these activities to
identify projects with similar or identical characteristics. A second-order screening
tool was applied to all projects with an agriculture code approved during the period.
In parallel, thematic reviews of enabling activities were conducted of rural transport
infrastructure, rural education, and rural finance (chapter 4). A gender analysis was
also conducted across the entire portfolio.

IEG found that the World Bank plays a larger role in generating rural nonfarm
income than has been identified by its thematic codes. The evaluation identified 529
World Bank projects, fully valued at $35.4 billion that have directly supported rural
nonfarm income during the period. Forty percent of this portfolio is mapped to the
Agriculture GP. Other key GPs include SURR, Social Protection and Labor; Trade
and Competitiveness; and the Environment GPs (table 1.1). For IFC, IEG identified
382 investment projects, valued at $10.7 billion, and 230 advisory projects, valued at
$273 million, in commitment terms. These projects are mapped to IFC’s Agriculture,
Food and Beverage, and Retail and Wholesale sectors (table 1.2). Agri-finance is
included, whereas other activities that broadly support the extension of rural finance
(microfinance, small and medium enterprise [SME] finance, and so on) are included
in the enabling environment chapter 4.

Broadly, the portfolio review revealed that RNFE interventions fall into one of two
categories: (i) poverty-oriented approaches financed by the World Bank that target
the rural poor and include productive components and (ii) growth-oriented
approaches financed by the World Bank and IFC—mainly value chains—that seek to
increase productivity and competitiveness but where links to the rural poor,
including benefits, are not evident. The former include community-based
approaches with a productive aim, rural livelihoods projects implemented in South
Asia, and special protection projects with a productive component. The latter
includes all of IFC’s interventions, as well as World Bank support for value chains
(crop, animal, tourism) and spatial approaches (tables 1.1 and 1.2). IEG’s RNFE
portfolio review also found that there has been increasing investment in growth-
oriented approaches in relation to poverty-oriented approaches (figure 1.2).

The Evaluation Lens: Key World Bank Group RNFE Approaches across the Three
Worlds
The 2008 WDR’s “three world” typology was a useful starting point to identify
discrete areas of needed attention. IEG found marked differences in the way that
projects supported rural nonfarm income generation across the three worlds
(figure 1.3). In agrarian areas, there was a focus on connectivity, resilience, welfare
smoothing through the provision of public and private assets, and services. In
transitioning and urbanized economies, there was a greater focus on factor markets.
Specific patterns of investment, like the productive partnerships which depend on the
vitality of intermediaries in the supply chain were designed in urbanized contexts
and therefore may have limited adaptability.

LOGICAL FRAMEWORK OF THE RNFE STORYLINE
In the absence of an existing framework within the World Bank Group, IEG deduced
a logical framework describing the World Bank Group’s RNFE engagement (figure
1.4). The framework links a diagnostic understanding of opportunities and
constraints in the RNFE to a set of interventions designed to address them. The
completeness and efficacy with which the World Bank Group carries out different
steps varies dramatically, and the evaluation shows where work is to be done or
paths to be changed. The way forward for a given economy depends on the initial
country conditions and context, including the state of structural transformation. The
tools for intervention range from strategic, analytic, and advisory to enabling
conditions to specific investments. Figure 1.3 also emphasizes the binary nature of
the portfolio, divided into major approaches between those focused on poverty and
on growth. IEG found a few hybrid projects, most notably the pastoral livestock
projects, however these are rare. A dynamic theory of change would allow for
relevance, efficiency, and effectiveness to improve with learning. Such learning and
course correction would depend on information being generated on interventions,
outcomes and impacts, so that such learning is possible, as well as incentives to
encourage this.

REPORT ORGANIZATION
Based on this framework, chapter 2 examines key approaches pursued by the World
Bank that have been designed in the agrarian and transitioning context- that are
poverty oriented. These approaches include rural livelihoods, community-based
approaches with a productive aim, and social safety net projects with a productive
inclusion theme. Chapter 3 examines key approaches pursued in all three worlds
that are growth oriented. These include different types of value chains, including
crop, livestock, tourism, and so on. Chapter 4 examines the role of the enabling
environment, critical to linking the rural poor to the productive opportunities in the
rural economy. It presents the results of three thematic reviews of rural transport
connectivity, rural education, rural skills in the agriculture sector, and rural finance.
Chapter 4 also presents the findings of cross-cutting themes, including RNFE
diagnostics. Chapter 5 presents the conclusions and recommendations of this report.

Development— Background Paper for the IFAD Rural Poverty Report 2011. Rome: IFAD. “In an initial stage, rural economies
are often remote from urban centers, isolated by transport costs. The wealth of the rural ecoonmy thus depends on the richness of
local resources. . . . Rural non-farm activity is thus likely to be closely linked to the prosperity of an economic driver, often
agriculture, but possibly mining or tourism. At a later stage, as cities grow and transport costs to urban areas fall, there is more
scope for interaction with the rest of the national economy and indeed with the global economy” (ii).

  The agriculture action plan 2013–15 thematic areas are as follows: (i) raise agricultural productivity and resilience; (ii) link
farmers to markets and strengthen value chains to improve market access and trade through support to improve infrastructure,
information technology, postharvest handling, and access to finance; and (iii) facilitate rural non-farm income through improving
the rural investment climate and skills development. The action plans include the following cross-cutting areas: (i) reduce risk,
vulnerability, and gender inequality through support to risk management mechanisms, greater transparency in food markets, and
improving women’s access to services, resources, and opportunities; and (ii) enhance environmental services and sustainability.

2. Poverty-Targeted Approaches to Generating
Income and Employment
 Highlights
 The rural poor face a multitude of constraints that limit their opportunity to participate in and
  benefit from the RNFE. This chapter reviews three common approaches in the RNFE portfolio that
  focus on delivering benefits and services directly to the poor.
 Rural livelihoods projects, valued at $2.2 billion, have achieved strong social outcomes, improved
  service delivery for the rural poor owing to increased agency, and access to credit that has
  generated household income gains capable of smoothing consumption and weathering shock.
  Notable income gains in the RNFE have been achieved in the dairy sector through collective
  procurement and market and the provision of market information (Andhra Pradesh). IEG found
  that, as the model is deepened and phased, it has the potential to increase its technical support
  for rural enterprise development to generate poverty reducing benefits for the rural poor.
 Community-driven development projects with support for productive, income-generating assets
  have achieved their service delivery goals and have had positive impacts on agricultural
  production for the poor, but there is little reliable evidence on the poor being lifted out of poverty
  through income or employment gains, or relatedly, the profitability and sustainability of rural
  enterprises supported.
 Where evidence is available, sustained income in the rural economy was achieved by a rigorous
  commitment to training and supporting facilitation teams, identifying and addressing key binding
  constraints (often credit) and by association providing strong social accountability tools. Evidence
  also points to the approach being more effective in “less transient” areas where citizens share a
  similar set of values or norms, or can hold each other to account through a set of project tools.
 Social protection productive inclusion approaches, while new, have grafted earned income
  components onto social safety net projects where separate, complementary approaches to rural
  employment and entrepreneurship may have been more effective.

The rural poor face a multitude of constraints that limit their opportunities to
participate in and benefit from the RNFE. Among these are identity-based exclusion
such as gender, a lack of access to networks (that is, social capital), relevant skills,
and power asymmetries that require specific redress by development practitioners
and governments to enable rural poor to access the RNFE as a critical and
diversified source of household income. This chapter reviews three main modalities
of project support that both target the poor and to aim to stimulate earned income in
the RNFE. These include (i) community-driven development projects with an
income, employment, or livelihood aim; (ii) the rural livelihoods approach in South
Asia; and (iii) social safety net projects with a productive inclusion projects
implemented by the social protection practice, that support the inclusion theme.
These approaches have mainly been implemented in agrarian and transition
economies (figure 2.1).

Community-Driven Development Projects with an Income-Generating Focus
Community-driven development projects linked to the agriculture sector stimulated
savings, income, and productive asset formation in the rural economy. Although
community-based approaches in general are highly heterogeneous, this evaluation
includes only projects implemented in rural areas that had a productive focus.
Community-driven approaches emphasize community control over planning
decisions and investment resources, with the hypothesis that participation leads to a
better use of resources in meeting community needs. Thus, they focus on enabling
communities and local institutions to take the lead in identifying and managing
community-level investments.

IEG’s portfolio review identified 73 community-based projects (plus 32 additional
financing), of which 44, valued at $8.3 billion, are closed and evaluated. The projects’
objectives sought to stimulate income and employment, reduce income poverty,
enhance livelihoods, increase access to economic opportunities, productive assets, or
to income-generating activities. Altogether, they financed 208,152 subprojects, of
which 130,406 were described in the project documentation as rural nonfarm
activities. Most subprojects were linked to agricultural processing activities,
including for tractors, threshing machines, manioc and flour mills, slaughtering,
dairy, small animal husbandry (chickens, goats) aquaculture, and apiculture. A
small number of investments supported self-employment in grocery and retail,
handicrafts, petty trade, sewing, and beauty. These were self-financed through
rotating loans. In a few cases, projects financed rural enterprise development,
business centers, and commercial facilities.

                                          POVERTY-TARGETED APPROACHES TO GENERATING INCOME
Community-based approaches that combine agricultural and RNFE activities
generally measure and report satisfactory results for agriculture production, leading
to increased incomes, but do not adequately assess the profitability or sustainability
of small rural enterprises set up with project financing (see appendix D). Of the 43
closed projects, 14 measured the profitability or sustainability of rural nonfarm
investments, and of these, 5 reported very good results. Data quality was a concern
across most closed projects (box 2.1).


 Box 2.1. RNFE-Related Measurement Challenges in Productive Community-Based
 Approaches
 A measurement flaw in community-based RNFE projects is the tendency to equate assets
 to income or to measure the incremental income effects shortly after the transfer of the
 asset. This is because disbursements take place late in this approach, since it is important
 to first lay a strong foundation. An illustrative comparison can be made between the
 positive results reported in northeast Brazil or the Kyrgyz Republic, where results were
 evaluated one year after disbursements, and the cautious results reported in Ethiopia or
 Haiti, where results were evaluated over a longer duration. Brazil reports incremental
 employment for “98% of the households that had an asset transfer and Kyrgyz reports
 excellent internal rates of returns for carpentry, bakeries, and retail (between 59 and 193
 percent). But these results were collected within a year of project disbursement or in-kind
 assistance. On the other hand, data collected on similar rural enterprise investments
 several years after disbursements in Ethiopia and Haiti report that 73 and 75 percent,
 respectively, of small enterprises were not sustained in the case of the former or were
 under severe financial stress in the case of the latter.

Poor performance was associated with binding constraints that had not been
concomitantly addressed through support for critical enabling activities (see chapter
4). These constraints include lack of access to finance for recurrent capital costs; lack
of diagnostics to address needed skills upgrading and technical gaps, including
business acumen, business development, and marketing; and challenges linked to
rural connectivity that hindered market integration and to down-turns (negative
internal rates of return) during drought years for rural activities linked to
agriculture. Lessons from Implementation Completion and Results Report Reviews
(ICRRs) and Project Performance Assessment Reports (PPARs) in Brazil, Nigeria,
Chad, Burundi, and Sri Lanka also attribute some of these challenges to the fact that
project management units are housed in ministries of agriculture, which are able to
provide agricultural rather than business development advice. Beneficiary
interviews revealed that community participants perceive nonfarm investment to be
riskier than crop expansion especially when access to finance is small and
intermittent.

CHAPTER 2
POVERTY-TARGETED APPROACHES TO GENERATING INCOME
Few community-based approaches with productive aims measure income or
employment. Of the 69 reviewed, 60 percent had some form of poverty targeting (in
many cases, area targeting), and 15 of these measured income and, in a few cases,
employment at the community or household level. Of those measuring income,
income increases for the poor were reported to range from 32 to 60 percent. Most of
the income reported was derived from agricultural mechanization, livestock, and
agroprocessing activities. However, for half of projects reporting on income or
employment, a review of the evaluative evidence found that results lack validity
owing to the small (less than 2 percent) and nonrandom methods used for
subproject analysis. The remaining projects that did not measure income or
employment outcomes report on access to economic activities or time saved or used
perception surveys to measure satisfaction with service delivery etc.

IEG’s gender analysis revealed that there was strong gender integration in
community-based approaches, with 87 percent including sex-disaggregated
indicators 77 percent including gender analysis. But only half reported having
conducted consultations with both men and women to inform design, and only 14
percent included gender in the project development objective. Of the closed projects,
76 percent tracked sex-disaggregated activity; however, reporting was limited to
female participation in decision-making bodies, associations, municipal councils,
and in a few cases, access to economic opportunities (for example, women-led
subprojects). No projects tracked sex-disaggregated economic benefits.

Rural Livelihoods
India’s state poverty reduction programs have organized 22 million rural poor
women (and some men) into self-help groups and tiered self-governing structures.
The World Bank has supported 80 percent of this membership through state-level
projects valued at $2.2 billion. The approach is based on the theory that power and
information asymmetries have undermined the poor’s ability to negotiate with
market actors for economic gains and better service delivery. As such, World Bank
support, along with local government and NGOs, seeks to create accountable and
representative institutions of and for the poor to enable greater representation
through collective voice. The model seeks to establish sustainable access to
affordable finance including, where viable, banking linkages. Projects also support
training and job placement, but this is not central to the approach.

Impact studies show that World Bank–financed rural livelihood projects have
achieved strong social outcomes but have not yet achieved substantial increases in
income or asset formation for the rural poor.1 In the former state of Andhra Pradesh,
Deininger and Liu (2009) find positive effects on empowerment and consumption

                                       POVERTY-TARGETED APPROACHES TO GENERATING INCOME
for participants but not income or asset formation. The finding suggests that the
program’s main impact was through consumption smoothing and diversification of
income rather than exploitation of new income sources. A follow-on impact
assessment of the program’s second phase found that the average annual income
increase of participants over nonparticipants was $107 for the poorest and $263 for
the poor (Prennushi and Gupta 2014). Like Deininger and Liu (2009), the assessment
found that increased incomes were achieved through diversification, including farm
diversification, and the addition of supplementary nonfarm activities (petty trading,
handicrafts, sari making, and so on). By project close, the percentage of household
income derived from nonfarm activities was 48 percent for participants and 37
percent for nonparticipants. For both the poor and poorest, rural nonfarm income
generation was about 55 percent of household income.

Datta (2015) found that World Bank–financed project beneficiary households in
Bihar, India, were able to reduce their debt burden by leveraging cheap credit and
that cheap credit was not used for productive investments, as evidenced by a more
diverse asset base (Datta 2015). However, for Bihar, evidence on income or welfare is
not available. Likewise in Orissa, debt held by moneylenders was reduced for
250,000 participating households, freeing up capital for more productive social and
economic investments. Although there was increased spending on education, an
impact evaluation found that there was no significant change in overall
consumption compared with a control (ICR, 2015).

Some rural livelihood projects also support training and job placement, including in
the artisanal sector, but this involves only a small fraction of total participants. Of
the 22 million women mobilized, 896,261 youths (men and women) were trained (in
textiles, computers, auto industry, and so on), and of these, most were placed (see
appendix C). Efforts to expand training and job placement will require better
tracking and learning about what works for female versus male participants. Only
one project had sex-disaggregated training data (Orissa: 1,409 female and 1,923
male). This was acknowledged by the Rural Livelihood teams in interviews, noting
that women are underrepresented in skills training programs and also face
“gendered” constraints. Upstream placement issues and difficulty in transitioning
from rural to urban areas—including transport, safe housing, and support
networks—affects their ability to participate. Women also face gendered choices in
training provision, with an overemphasis on low-return segments such as tailoring
and beauty.

CHAPTER 2
POVERTY-TARGETED APPROACHES TO GENERATING INCOME
Social Protection Productive Inclusion Approaches
Broadly, there have been two types of public works programs supported by the
World Bank. The first approach provides a safety net, often through temporary
employment, offering a source of income to the vulnerable who need it most. The
second aims to build sustainable infrastructure. In this case, links to the
development of the RNFE are generated through the creation of, for example, feeder
roads, small-scale irrigation infrastructure, or maintenance. These programs can
include skills building and training components, sometimes focusing on rural
entrepreneurship and self-employment.

Recently, a shift occurred as part of the World Bank’s new social protection strategy,
Resilience, Equity, and Opportunity (World Bank 2012). Social safety nets are
increasingly seeking to develop human capital, skills, and entry into labor markets.
The strategy recognizes that complementary programs will be needed to foster
productive employment and to have a multisectoral perspective. It also recognizes
that support for rural employment must take into account the changing agricultural
context and rural-to-urban migration. New “productive inclusion” approaches are
being piloted in an effort to “graduate” less risky populations from social safety
nets, mainly in agrarian economies. The implicit theory is that programs effective at
reaching the rural poor with benefits and temporary employment are best placed to
assist the same populations in enhancing skills and finding permanent employment.
Interviews with the Social Protection and Labor GP staff and consultants indicate
that this new approach is being implemented in parallel but separately from other
productive approaches mapped to the Agriculture and SURR GPs. An analysis of
this combination of traditional social safety nets with the new earned income
objective (including a focus on nonfarm income generation, technical assistance, and
finance) reveals that multiple teams working across GPs are grappling with similar
rural development challenges. Yet, as evidenced through the RNFE roundtables and
interviews, the efforts are segmented by organizational units without overarching
coordination.

IEG identified 31 (plus 13 additional financing) rural public works and productive
inclusion projects, valued at $4.7 billion, of which 29 were closed and evaluated. Of
these, a quarter were implemented in Ethiopia and assessed as part of the Ethiopia
RNFE country case study. Using evidence from impact evaluations of closed
productive inclusion projects, the RNFE Ethiopia country case study revealed the
limits of layering productive expectations on an otherwise effective instrument—the
social safety net (box 2.2).

Rural public works and cash-for-work programs have been effective in increasing
access to services, providing temporary labor that has facilitated access to increased

income, which has mainly been used to smooth consumption and pay for critically
needed services. Very few of these programs have been rigorously evaluated to
determine outcomes or impacts in the rural economy. For those that have, evidence
is mixed. For example, an evaluation of the Malawi Social Action Fund (Beegle,
Gallasso, and Goldberg 2014) found that although employment was generated, the
program did not improve food security, investment in farm inputs (fertilizer), or the
purchase of durable goods. The program’s contribution to rural infrastructure
rehabilitation (for example, irrigation works) and the knock-on effects in the rural
economy were not evaluated. In Sierra Leone, on the other hand, a World Bank
assessment of the cash-for-work program found that in rural areas, temporary work
provided beneficiaries with cash to invest in existing enterprises, most notably by
acquiring more livestock (Andrews and others 2012).


 Box 2.2. The Challenge of Layering Productive Expectations on Successful Safety Net
 Systems
 The World Bank’s Productive Safety Net Programme in Ethiopia has helped poor rural
 citizens respond to drought-induced shocks through temporary employment and
 infrastructure development. It has helped 7.6 million cope with chronic droughts and
 achieve food security while creating a range of community assets. The accomplishments
 have catalyzed a discussion around the use of public works and have influenced social
 safety nets in Africa. In an effort to graduate beneficiaries, the program piloted a
 Household Asset Building Program to promote income diversification for food-insecure
 households. Training, technical support, and financial products were provided to
 households that proposed a new or expanded business activity. The Household Asset
 Building Program has revealed the limits of layering productive expectations on an
 otherwise effective instrument—the social safety net. An impact evaluation of Household
 Asset Building Program found that 70 percent of the business plans came from the
 extension agents, not the households, and that the agents lacked nonfarm skills, so that
 more was achieved in agriculture and soil than in the area of rural income diversification.
 Loan sizes for the productive investments were small and allocated on a predetermined
 basis. Women focus groups indicated that the agents tended to work with male farmers,
 not with female-headed households.

Gender in social safety nets. IEG undertook a thorough review of social safety nets
and gender in 112 World Bank projects approved between 2003 and 2013. From the
point of view of the rural nonfarm, the review found that public works programs in
Africa had sex-disaggregated data because of gender quotas. Since then, an impact
evaluation on Sierra Leone’s cash-for-work program, which used gender quotas,
suggests the quotas may have hidden costs. For example, when males participated
in the program as wage laborers, it freed up opportunities for women in self-

employment but not the other way around. Tension between gender quotas and
community interests were also identified.


What Works: Lessons from IEG’s ICRRs and PPARs
From the existing models, and where evidence was available, lessons can be derived
from external evaluations, IEG’s ICRRs and PPARs on what works to connect the
rural poor to more productive and sustained income-generating opportunities
through community-based and rural livelihood approaches in the RNFE portfolio.
Each example highlights the need for effective targeting, an assessment of key
binding constraints, and the alignment of aid as close as possible to activities that lift
these. In Sri Lanka, under Gemi Diriyia, the World Bank effectively addressed three
key binding constraints: namely, access to finance, associated issues of
accountability, and technical assistance. Efforts to train, grade, and hold facilitation
teams to account ensured the effective functioning of savings and credit
organizations and associated investments. These investments resulted in a 41
percent income increase for poor households, and five years after project close, IEG’s
survey found that, on average, a half of project households still participate in the
savings and lending schemes (2009 ICRR).

In Nigeria, while IEG was not able to validate income gains reported under Fadama
II due to weak construct validity in the external assessment, fieldwork conducted
five years after project close found that for the majority of participants, RNFE
activities were continuing to generate critical sources of income. Four key lessons
were identified: (i) the community-based approach works better in “less transient”
areas where citizens share a similar set of values or can hold each other to account
through a set of project tools; (ii) rising land prices affect the success of rural
enterprises; (iii) rural infrastructure services delivered near-term impacts on
beneficiaries’ access to markets and transport costs, however the high level of
subsidy may have induced construction of public goods that could not affordably be
maintained (IFPRI 2008); (iv) environmental risks require attention (some cassava
grinding activities were shut down by complaints about mill effluents).

The World Bank has a long engagement in the Kyrgyz Republic, through its Village
Investment Programs focused on enterprise development for the poor. An
integrated approach, the Village Investment Programs provide training and
investment for small business development alongside essential infrastructure. The
rural poor, as confirmed by a rigorous external evaluation, gained access to
complementary services such as water, electricity, roads, etc. Over the same period,
2,319 permanent jobs were created through income-generating subprojects (retail,

                                             POVERTY-TARGETED APPROACHES TO GENERATING INCOME
auto repair, carpenter shops, and so on). Success was associated with investments in
existing rural enterprises or in entrepreneurs that had established skill set.

In Andhra Pradesh, India, the rural poor have been reached by the use of
participatory approaches to identify them, including the disabled and most
vulnerable. Feasibility of proposed Self-Help Group investments were assessed
through a business plan approach. While the bulk of investment was made in the
farm economy, lessons can be learned from the considerable strides made in dairy
processing capacity that generated investment in livestock and resulted in increased
household incomes. This was achieved through training for collective procurement
and marketing, provision of market information, establishment of marketing
centers, and by addressing infrastructure needs.

Chapter synthesis. Poverty-targeted approaches have proven relatively effective in
reaching the rural poor where they live, and have had success in such dimensions as
social empowerment, income smoothing and rural service delivery in. However,
while these approaches generated employment and income gains for the rural poor,
the results were insufficient to sustainably lift large numbers of them out of poverty.
Efforts to bridge this divide are asking instruments adept at reducing vulnerability –
most notably productive inclusion projects - to achieve earned income goals that
exceed the original purpose of their design. There is an opportunity to learn from
RNFE projects where evidence exists, to blend or pilot new hybrid approaches
designed to more effectively target and link the poor to more productive
opportunities in the RNFE. For this, skills will need to be blended across different
approaches and between different parts of the World Bank Group.

3. Growth-Oriented Approaches in the Rural
Nonfarm Economy
 Highlights
  Growth-oriented interventions in the RNFE portfolio mostly focused on crop, animal, and food
   value chains, but also value chain finance and tourism. Value chain projects have frequently
   achieved increased sales, revenues, and income, but reach to the rural poor is often not tracked.
   In these projects, there are likely spillover or secondary effects, but these require measurement.
  In agrarian economies, World Bank financed value chain interventions have emphasized the role
   of the producer but placed little emphasis on other value chain actors. As a result, there are
   recorded increases of productivity, but distributional impacts are unclear, and in the absence of
   a definition or metrics associated with value chain competitiveness, evidence is lacking that
   growth, income, and employment for the poor can be sustained after project end. In transitioning
   and urbanized economies, value chain projects targeted multiple value chain segments and
   achieved good results with regard to enterprise revenue, but projects lack poverty targeting or
   reporting.
  Where IFC’s investments in food processing projects have been associated had strong links to
   rural areas and smaller urban centers, they have generally generated positive rural employment
   outcomes and demonstrated links to the RNFE.
  Despite IFC’s stated objectives of reaching the poor through its agribusiness portfolio, in most
   cases there was little in the project design that identified, targeted or tracked benefits for the
   poor. In wholesale and retail investments linked to rural areas, IFC’s clients seek to increase the
   availability of goods and drive down costs for (rural) consumers. However, none of the
   investments tracked consumer benefits (costs) and only a few included local sourcing.
  In spite of examples of where market power has adversely affected poor value chain
   participants, the risks imposed by market structure and its impact on the poor and related
   mitigants are rarely treated explicitly in project documentation.

This chapter addresses growth-oriented approaches to the RNFE, which have been
dominated in recent years by efforts to create competitive and (sometimes) inclusive
value chains. A value chain refers to a linked set of economic actors and activities
ranging from primary producers to traders, processors, retailers, and consumers.
Sustainable value chains must be competitive: they must be able to create and move
a product from production to the consumer at a higher-quality and/or at a price that
is equal to or better than what value chains in other countries produce. The
challenge for development practitioners is to promote economic growth strategies
that make entire industries and their associated value chains within the rural
economy more competitive, while promoting inclusion, skills, and ensuring a broad
distribution of benefits, including income, across all parts of the chain.

CHAPTER 3
GROWTH-ORIENTED APPROACHES IN THE RURAL NONFARM ECONOMY
The World Bank Group has traditionally viewed chains as vehicles for
competitiveness and growth, with benefits for employment generation. Value chains
have been perceived as opportunities for developing economies to link to vast
international distribution networks and consumer demand, through increased
productivity and efficiency. Since the food crisis, crop and livestock value chains
have received greater attention as ways to create dynamic linkages to the rural
economy, with the potential to generate employment for farmers, rural workers, and
entrepreneurs. As noted in chapter 1, World Bank Group postcrisis strategies
embrace value chain approaches that put smallholder farmers and SMEs at the
center of a strategy to reduce poverty.

Over the evaluation period, the World Bank financed 150 value chain projects worth
$6.3 billion in commitment terms. Included are 70 crop value chain projects
($3.6 billion), 21 livestock and horticultural projects ($1 billion), and 25 productive
partnerships—a value chain model designed somewhat differently in the Latin
American and the Caribbean region ($1.6 billion), and 34 rural tourism value chain
projects ($821 million). Sixty of these projects were closed and evaluated. IFC
financed 382 value chain–related investment projects, valued at $10.7 billion in the
Agriculture, Food and Beverage, Wholesale and Retail, Value Chain Finance, and
Tourism sectors. Another 230 advisory projects were linked to value chain support,
valued at $273 million. Of these, 60 investments and 64 advisory services were
mature and evaluated. World Bank financed value chain approaches in the RNFE
have been designed in the context of all three worlds (see figure 3.1). IFC’s largest
investments in agribusiness were in firms operating in transition and urbanized
economies reflecting linkages that these firms have with international markets.
Advisory services are more frequently situated in agrarian economies.

World Bank Crop Value Chain Approaches
Although IEG’s Implementation Completion and Results Report Reviews reveal that
82 percent of crop value chain projects achieved their project objective, these projects
did not effectively define or measure their intended competitiveness aims across the
value chains they were supporting. This impedes the ability to track the backward
and forward linkages between the farm sector, the nonfarm sector, and impacts on
poverty. An analysis of the project-targeting mechanisms of the crop value chain
portfolio (59 projects) reveal that areas with high agriculture potential were selected,
but for most projects, beneficiary selection criteria was weak or not evident. Each of
the crop value chain projects, closed and evaluated, achieved a positive result along
one part of the chain, but none of the projects demonstrated that the chain as a
whole was working more efficiently and could therefore catalyze sustained growth,
income, and employment after project financing in the RNFE.

In agrarian economies, especially in Africa, IEG’s RNFE portfolio revealed that
World Bank–financed value chain interventions have emphasized the role of the
producer as the main means of reducing poverty in the rural economy. Less focus
has been placed on poor downstream participants in the value chain. The rural poor
engage with value chains at many points: as aggregators, threshers, millers, retailers,
marketers, transporters, and mechanics. Value chain projects in agrarian economies
(for example, Burundi, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Senegal, Mozambique, and Sierra
Leone) mainly targeted farmers and their metrics were limited to production (yield

increases) and income. Rwanda was an exception (many actors were supported) but
the project did not have poverty targeting or tracking (box 3.1).

This finding was triangulated through a series of agrarian country studies and
project assessments in agrarian areas. In Mozambique, IEG’s PPAR on the World
Bank’s support to the Zambezi Valley found that while agriculture productivity
increased, the value chain approach did not tackle the underlying poverty drivers
related to the composition and nature of the input and output marketing chains,
which were highly unfavorable for actors upstream (World Bank 2016). IEG’s RNFE
Morocco case study found that where poverty is mainly rural, integrating the poor
into more productive value chain activities has significant poverty-reducing
potential. In Rwanda, the World Bank Group has supported an agricultural
modernization strategy that has generated increased revenue by supporting rural
nonfarm activities across many parts of the targeted value chains. But emerging


 Box 3.1. Rwanda: A Rapidly Modernizing Agriculture Sector May Be Leading to Increased
 Inequality in the Farm and Nonfarm Economies
 In Rwanda, cooperatives supported by the World Bank Group have increased their
 revenue by 50 percent, and the increased revenue was attributable to support along the
 value chain, including for such modernization techniques as drying, threshing, shelling,
 storage, packaging, and marketing. However, the effects on poverty are unclear because,
 as identified by RNFE country case study, the poverty-reducing effects of rapid
 agricultural modernization—and the distributional benefits associated with the growth of
 the nonfarm economy—are highly contextual and policy dependent. Agricultural
 modernization and increased production are less likely to result in reduced poverty
 where high inequality exists and may even lead to exacerbated poverty or
 marginalization of disadvantaged groups (Negin and others 2009; Thorbecke 2013). In
 Rwanda, the World Bank Group has supported the government’s agricultural
 modernization program, which is rapidly transforming the sector away from subsistence.
 Although these efforts have been successful in raising yields, evidence suggests that only
 a relatively wealthy minority may be benefiting and that these policies may be
 exacerbating landlessness and inequality for the most poor.

research suggests that greater attention is needed to the policy context in countries
undergoing rapid structural transformation which may be in some cases
exacerbating inequality for the landless and the very poor (box 3.1).

In marked contrast to agrarian contexts, in transitioning and urbanized economies,
IEG’s RNFE portfolio review revealed that value chain projects targeted multiple
actors, from farmers to agroprocessors to rural enterprises. Nonetheless, results
reporting was limited to a single actor, or results could not be distinguished by actor

                                GROWTH-ORIENTED APPROACHES IN THE RURAL NONFARM ECONOMY
(for example, where the term “beneficiaries” was used). Value chain projects in ECA
(Armenia, Georgia, and Moldova) targeted multiple RNFE actors but reported on
incomes only for enterprises or beneficiaries. The projects targeting agribusiness
enterprises report increased sales and profits but lack evidence of increased
efficiency (as opposed to, for example, global price fluctuations) and do not report
on impacts along the value chain.

Value chain projects supporting food safety and quality were located in
transitioning and urbanized economies, but evidence is lacking that food safety–
related enhancements resulted in increased competitiveness. As documented in
IEG’s ICRRs, food quality and safety regulations were put in place (for example, in
Kazakhstan) or laboratories were built (for example, in Romania), but there is little
evidence of outcomes and their causal link to more competitive food industries. In
other cases, ambition was reduced (for example, Georgia) where the objective of
“developing the productivity and profitability of the private agriculture sector” was
changed to “improving agricultural production and access to markets.” On the other
hand, Croatia met the EU acquis conditions, including compliance with sanitary and
phytosanitary standards, and this is likely to have increased competitiveness.

PRODUCTIVE PARTNERSHIPS
Productive partnerships are a value chain approach in the Latin American and the
Caribbean Region designed and implemented differently than other value chain
projects. Launched in 2002, productive partnerships consist of agribusiness contracts
between a producer organization and one or more commercial partners, such as
companies from processing industries or wholesalers. By subsidizing producer
organizations and its members with training and technical assistance, the
government helps farmers meet the quality and quantity goals of these contracts.
Implemented mainly in urbanized economies, productive partnerships seek to help
producer groups overcome market barriers and gain stability through assured prices
while individual buyers receive consistent supplies of goods of a particular quality.
The World Bank provided $1.6 billion for 25 projects (including additional
financing) in 10 countries in Latin American and the Caribbean that include different
types of contractual models. Like Rural Livelihoods in South Asia, it is the model of
choice for the Agriculture GP in Latin American and the Caribbean with a steadily
increasing level of commitments compared with the second most frequent model. By
the end of the evaluation period, the model represented 75 percent of the RNFE
Latin American and the Caribbean portfolio.

Evaluations of productive partnerships show positive results with regard to
production and sales. Outcomes vary across value chains, with stronger results



                                                                                    29
CHAPTER 3
GROWTH-ORIENTED APPROACHES IN THE RURAL NONFARM ECONOMY
achieved for existing or mature cooperatives and for coffee and cocoa. Evidence
from evaluations (Collion 2012; FAO 2013; CIAT 2015) indicates that productive
partnerships are making an important contribution to the welfare of small-scale
producers and the growth of the RNFE more broadly through processing and
marketing activities. Yet, revenue and sales data are only available at the group
level, limiting the ability to analyze the relative benefits achieved by individual
cooperative members with different income levels. Nor does available data
elucidate distribution of revenues between producers, middlemen, aggregators, and
processors. To date, analysis has not generated clear lessons about benefits to the
poor of different modalities, commodities, and geographical and sociological
characteristics.

The success of productive partnerships is also constrained by a lack of
complementary support for the enabling environment, including infrastructure,
land, and finance (see chapter 4). Interviews with World Bank staff point to the need
for linkages with the formal financial sector or, as in Brazil, to better understand
constraints producer groups face in borrowing for productive purposes. In Brazil,
many cooperative members do not own land—it is a concession from the
municipality—so lack of collateral is a constraining factor. The need for coordinated
approaches to address multiple constraints was a finding of IEG’s Supporting
Transformational Change for Poverty Reduction and Shared Prosperity learning product
and the Industry Competitiveness and Jobs evaluation (World Bank 2016a, 2016d).

Gender in crop value chains. Factors such as access to assets, gendered education
differentials, and the nature and value of economic activities affect the way in which
men and women participate and gain in value chains. In particular, the benefits of
women’s participation in value chains are determined by their control of productive
resources and household-level decisions. Where women do not participate in
spending decisions, for example, a more gender-specific approach that targets
underlying gender issues is required (FAO 2010). In the World Bank, 72 percent of
value chain projects approved after 2008 include sex-disaggregated indicators,
compared with 38 percent between 2004 and 2008. The percent of projects that
reported conducting gender-sensitive consultations and that conducted a gender
diagnostic rose slightly, but half the portfolio lacked gender-sensitive value chain
diagnostics. Of the closed projects, half tracked gender outcomes, but of these, none
reported on economic benefits (four measured access to economic activities).
Reporting was mainly limited to participation in training or decision making as part
of committees.

PASTORAL LIVELIHOODS AND LIVESTOCK VALUE CHAINS

Over the evaluation period, most livestock value chain projects featured
competitiveness aims: increased productivity, profitability, sustainability, and
marketing. Half of these projects did not meet these aims as demonstrated by the 50
percent MS or higher rating of evaluated projects. Implemented in agrarian areas,
including in several fragile and conflict-affected areas, they have been effective in
reducing vulnerability, with a focus on small-scale herders. ICRRs for closed projects
reveal that small-scale herders located in poor areas benefited from enhanced animal
health, measured by increased survival rates, increased lactation, and access to
water points, stock route improvements, and market rehabilitation. But associated
welfare measures were applied only in two cases, and in these (Somalia and Yemen),
gains were too small to contribute to sustainable poverty alleviation.

Enhanced competitiveness could have been fostered by addressing such binding
constraints as land, productivity, and marketing, in addition to institutional and
political issues. IEG’s PPAR of the Pastoral Community Development Projects in
Ethiopia, found that services provided reduced vulnerability and promoted critical
savings, a more relevant approach would have included a focus on productive
aspects, by targeting assistance to key points along the value chain, including
veterinary services, water, herd and rangeland management, animal nutrition,
market information, and advisory services adapted for mobility (World Bank 2016b).
In the Kyrgyz Republic, attention was paid to legal, regulatory, and institutional
issues required for the effective management of pasture land (World Bank 2015).

Gender in pastoral value chains. In developing countries, women’s role in the
livestock sector varies. Although a customary division of labor often exists, it also
shifts due to economic conditions or labor availability (for example, migration).
IEG’s gender analysis revealed that the role of women was analyzed in 65 percent of
livestock projects during design but that only half include sex-disaggregated
indicators and only one-third indicate that they consulted women and men during
design. Sex-disaggregated indicators in the livestock sector measured women’s
access to market services and their participation in training, but not the accrual of
benefits in relation to men. Studies are needed to understand labor divisions, power
dynamics and women’s capacity to participate and negotiate in the market. Projects
should assess differences in ownership and access rights for livestock, land.

IFC’s Agriculture Value Chain Activities
IEG rated IFC’s value chain investments as mostly successful or higher in 67 percent of
cases in the agriculture sector, 60 percent of cases in food and beverages, and 60
percent of cases in retail and wholesale sectors. Although IFC’s value chain
approaches in the RNFE have been designed in the context of transitioning and
urbanized areas, IEG’s portfolio review found that in these areas, about half (47
percent) reach into rural or frontier areas. Examples include the expansion of a
leading food company into Brazil’s northeast, the expansion of discount food retail
stores in rural Mexico, increased sourcing of produce from smallholders in
Indonesia, and support for rural enterprise development in one of the poorest areas
of China. IFC’s RNFE reach into frontier and lagging areas has also been facilitated
by its partnership with the Global Agricultural Food Security Program (box 3.2).


 Box 3.2. Global Partnerships Have Helped Extend IFC’s Value Chain Support to Frontier Areas
 The Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GASFP) is a multidonor supported
 platform that arose out of the 2008 food crisis in response for the creation of an instrument
 to improve agricultural productivity, increase incomes, and ensure food and nutrition
 security in low-income countries. Hosted by the World Bank, and in partnership with the
 MDBs and Rome-based agencies, GAFSP has committed $1.3 billion in financing. GAFSP’s
 pillars of engagement are linked to the rural economy, by fostering a more sustainable,
 inclusive and productive farm economy. One of its pillars also includes a specific focus on
 improving rural nonfarm livelihoods. GAFSP has a public and private sector window, with
 the latter implemented by IFC. GAFSP has helped IFC take risks with an array of financing
 options that, when combined with the GAFSP grant, allow riskier investments in frontier,
 fragile, and conflict-affected areas. The GAFSP private sector portfolio displays
 characteristics that are distinct from the IFC RNFE portfolio: over three-quarters of the
 GAFSP private sector investments in the RNFE went to Sub-Saharan Africa, compared with
 14 percent in the IFC RNFE portfolio and the average GAFSP-IFC related investment is
 $11 million compared with $28 million in the IFC RNFE without GAFSP. GAFSP has helped
 IFC extend its reach to smaller clients. Its use of GASFP-financed advisory services has
 helped enable this, including through risk diagnostics for potential investments in Côte
 d’Ivoire, Mozambique, Myanmar, and Mali.

An examination of upstream and downstream linkages in the IFC value chain
investment portfolio reveals that IFC interacts along several points of the chain, and
that this integrated approach has been increasing over time. In the Food and Beverage
sector, this integrated support tends to have strong links to rural areas and smaller
urban centers and has had generally positive rural employment outcomes along the
value chains within the RNFE. This has included support for both farmers and SMEs
(in distribution, retail and marketing) along the value chain. Examples of these types

                                                                                CHAPTER 3
                                 GROWTH-ORIENTED APPROACHES IN THE RURAL NONFARM ECONOMY
of investments include the expansion of dairy supply chains in rural Colombia, the
wine sector in Moldova, rice value chains in India, and bread distribution in rural
Nigeria (including a focus on women-owned bakeries). An emerging lesson is that,
when targeted well, IFC’s investments in food and in agribusiness can exhibit
important rural nonfarm benefits that have potential poverty reducing effects.

On the other hand, in its agriculture sector, IFC has worked with some international
clients where its value addition has been weaker and benefits to generating rural
income and employment are not clear. Many of the evaluated projects in this group
were committed between 2006 and 2008, a period when private sector fund’s flow to
emerging markets was at its highest. IFC financing was often replaced by other
commercial financial institutions with equivalent investments (although loans were
usually of a shorter term), or IFC was prepaid shortly after the construction phase,
and the risk profile changed.

IEG’s review found that supporting corporations with substantial market power
may disadvantage small producers in the value chain. In project board documents,
systematic attention was not paid to identifying risks associated with market
structure—the potential for the creation or increase of monopsony or monopoly
power—or to its mitigants. Interviews with IFC staff indicate that this has been the
case where there has been paucity of value chain players, so that, without
intervention, “nothing will happen.” Yet the risk that margins for farmers or micro,
small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) get squeezed by more powerful actors is
real and can have tangible consequences for the poor’s income opportunities. For
example, in rural Nicaragua, in the context of a spreading rust outbreak that
threatened the livelihoods of smallholders, IFC’s client (a major multinational coffee
distributor) provided long-term finance, extension, access to rust-resistant hybrids
and a ready buyer for rural coffee farmers. However, it also locked farmers into a
package - once financed – that require them to accept the hybrid supplied and prices
set by the company’s suppliers for the duration of the agreement. From a longer-
term poverty perspective, value might have been added by complementary
measures to lower entry barriers for the fragmented smallholder sector by providing
independent access to finance, business development training; and for some, linking
capable farmers to higher-priced markets. (Other examples are referred to in
box 3.4).

Gender in IFC value chain projects. IEG’s gender analysis of the 57 closed and
evaluated IFC investment value chain projects found that 22 percent tracked female
employment, due to a Development Outcome Tracking System indicator introduced
during the second half of the evaluation period (all projects that tracked female
employment were approved after 2008). Even so, after 2008, only 40 percent of all


                                                                                     33
CHAPTER 3
GROWTH-ORIENTED APPROACHES IN THE RURAL NONFARM ECONOMY
projects in the RNFE portfolio tracked female employment. Of these projects, 11
recorded an increase in female employment in proportion to an overall increase in
the rate of employment, overachieving the set targets in each case. In a small
number of projects, there was a decline in employment, including female
employment.


 Box 3.3. IFC Agri-Food Investments and Their Links to the Rural Nonfarm Economy
 Positive examples of investments in local companies with strong up- and/or downstream
 linkages to the rural economy, although most production facilities were urban:
    An IFC investment in Russian fruit juice production was associated with 4,000 jobs,
     upstream employment, farmer income, and downstream benefits for distributors and
     retailers.
    An investment in an Indonesian food company associated with thousands of direct jobs,
     substantial upstream linkages, new demand for local farm inputs (shallots) from 7,000
     local farmers, and downstream links to 400,000 retailers (many SME) selling the
     product.
    An investment in Ukrainian poultry generated thousands of direct and indirect jobs.
    An investment in Colombian dairy linked to 2,885 milk suppliers and downstream
     clients.
 Less positive RNFE experiences involving large multinationals included:
    A Central American investment in a coffee trading company associated with negative
     job growth and financially disadvantageous contracts with over 25,000 farmers.
    An investment in a soft drink bottler in East Asia where its manual distribution centers
     did not work out and distribution chains were disrupted.
    An IFC investment in a South American multinational for vertically integrated
     production and processing of sugarcane and sugar beets which, while associated with
     large numbers of jobs, was cited by the Ministry of Labor for trapping cane-cutters in
     onerous conditions.


IFC’S FOOD DISTRIBUTION: WHOLESALE AND RETAIL

IFC’s wholesale and retail investments are based on the logic that modern retailers
invest in technologies and processes that enable them to achieve greater economies
of scale, create employment, and drive down costs for consumers. They are designed
to promote higher standards of quality for suppliers and invest in food safety and
traceability. At the same time, IFC recognizes that the spread of modern
supermarkets can lead to job losses at smaller shops. Yet the question of whether
these anticipated benefits to workers and consumers in rural areas are realized is not
answered through monitoring and evaluation. Of the 60 IFC Wholesale and Retail
investments made during the evaluation period, 25 had backward linkages into the
rural economy, of which 5 had been evaluated by IEG and included investments in

expanding supermarket chains and distribution to rural areas. None of these tracked
local employment or consumer costs.

IFC’S VALUE CHAIN–RELATED ADVISORY SERVICE ACTIVITIES
IFC’s RNFE advisory services were mainly linked to its Sustainable Business
Advisory (SBA). These services aimed to help develop markets in emerging
economies to promote sustainable business practices among owners and firms,
including individuals and small firms in the agribusiness and services sector.1 IFC
declares its intention to use advisory services to achieve inclusion “to catalyze the
development of markets that work for all members of society.” IFC advisory assisted
clients, often large firms, to improve the efficiency of their supply chains by creating
business opportunities for local suppliers, including local sourcing platforms and
community investment strategies. These activities included training, support for
supply chain linkages, and corporate governance. The overarching aim was to lower
barriers that prevent the broad deployment of good business practices to enable
profitable commercial outcomes while enhancing their environmental or social
value. In agribusiness, SBA aimed to improve food security by increasing
agriculture productivity and promoting sustainable agribusiness practices, often
pursued by working through “lead” or “anchor” firms in supply chains. In its
support to SMEs, SBA tried to improve the enabling environment, build capacity,
and increase the affordability of financial services for SMEs for growth and job
creation. SBA also supported Women in Business, to strengthen women’s role as
leaders, entrepreneurs, and economic stakeholders.

In general, IEG’s review of relevant advisory services found little in the project
design to ensure poor value chain participants were identified or assisted. IEG
found little attention to mechanisms that could leverage benefits for the poor.
Without explicit attention to the ability of the poor to take advantage of
strengthened supply chains, it is less likely that all members of society will benefit.
IFC’s mature and evaluated SBA advisory services mainly focused on IFC
investment clients - on how to improve quality and consistency of its inputs - and on
how to reduce supply chain risks. This approach typically did not include rural
producers, who are often the starting point of value chains. In such cases, SBA
services could not help rural producers capture market opportunities, obtain fairer
deals, and produce higher-quality products as a means to improve rural incomes
and employment.

Certification programs were quite common in the IFC SBA portfolio for RNFE, as
well as support for standards and regulations. Yet this approach typically omitted
rural producers, who are often the starting point of value chains. Thus, SBA could



                                                                                     35
CHAPTER 3
GROWTH-ORIENTED APPROACHES IN THE RURAL NONFARM ECONOMY
not help rural producers capture market opportunities, obtain fairer deals, and
produce higher-quality products as a means to improve rural incomes and
employment.

Despite IFC’s stated objectives of reaching the poor through its advisory services,
there was little in the project design of the advisory programs to ensure that these
groups were identified or helped. In almost all the cases, by design, IFC SBA
intervened in the supply chain at a point close to the large company. For example,
the design and focus of a cattle program in Brazil was to support 20 suppliers to an
IFC investment client to meet the client’s new cattle purchasing procedure. In a
dairy project in Uruguay, the program aimed to improve milk quality and
productivity, but there was no effort to determine if the small milk producers
benefited. Although IFC tried to help its clients, often large firms, improve the
efficiency of their supply chains by creating business opportunities for local
suppliers, including local sourcing platforms and community investment strategies,
IEG found little attention in projects to mechanisms that could leverage benefits for
the poor.

VALUE CHAIN FINANCE
According to the World Bank, a lack of food drying and storage in the immediate
postharvest period are the main drivers of food loss in developing countries. The
global food crises exposed the severity and consequences of food loss for the poor.
Studies suggest that one-third of food produced for human consumption is lost or
wasted, amounting to about 1.3 billion tons per year (van Otterdijk and Meybeck
2011). IFC’s Global Agri-Finance Advisory Program was designed to address this by
increasing the availability of value chain finance, promoting risk-mitigation
products, and building skills. The program involves collaboration across IFC’s
investment, advisory, and regional units in support of global food security. A key
area pursued in is warehouse receipt financing, which aims to provide short-term
finance to farmers and producers and offers an opportunity to reduce postharvest
losses. A well-functioning warehouse receipt system can provide broad benefits,
including permitting stored goods to be used as collateral; improving quality,
control, and inspection of commodities; enhancing marketing; and by helping to
establish commodity exchanges.

IFC clearly states its intention to use advisory services to achieve economic and
social inclusion “to catalyze the development of markets that work for all members
of society.” IFC advisory assisted clients, often large firms, to improve the efficiency
of their supply chains by creating business opportunities for local suppliers,
including local sourcing platforms and community investment strategies. Yet IEG’s

                                                                                CHAPTER 3
                                 GROWTH-ORIENTED APPROACHES IN THE RURAL NONFARM ECONOMY
review of relevant advisory services found little in the project design to ensure poor
value chain participants were identified or assisted. IEG found little attention to
mechanisms that could leverage benefits for the poor. Without explicit attention to
the ability of the poor to take advantage of strengthened supply chains, it is less
likely that all members of society will benefit.

Thus IFC’s Global Warehouse Finance Program (GWFP) is potentially highly
relevant: market studies show that the availability of warehouse financing currently
provides only between 0 and 7 percent of total financing needed in developing
country markets. The GWFP was established to address that gap and build the
capacity of local financial institutions to provide this type of financing. During the
evaluation period, the program—which included 12 transactions valued at
$272 million in Tanzania, Senegal, Mali, Paraguay, Vietnam, the Arab Republic of
Egypt, Indonesia, and a regional project in Middle East and North Africa—has
provided domestic banks with liquidity or risk coverage, backed by warehouse
receipts, that have then made available loans or guarantees to farmers, cooperative
unions, aggregators, exporters, or traders to meet their short-term financing needs.2

However, the program’s ability to help relatively less well-off farmers and value
chain participants to enhance their productivity within the rural economy is unclear.
Under the GWFP, it is not apparent to what extent IFC can influence client selection.
The participating bank may also require cash up front, thereby restricting the
amount of credit provided and the program reach. Reach indicators, such as the
reach of the GWFP to farmers or SME-oriented clients reveal further limitations. The
profile of the bank is the key determinant of additionality and the way reach is
measured, rather than the profile of the applicants. If the transactions involve well-
established clients that could have obtained credit from competing banks anyway, it
is possible for the GWFP financing to never reach underserved markets. Use of an
SME reach indicator is therefore not fully informative and needs be supplemented
by indicators of the profile of the issuing banks and further information on clients.
Recognizing that the GWFP is in its early stages, relies on a commercial approach
(and is thus demand driven) and does not create trade transactions, IFC could
increase its limited influence to increase the program’s impact on the rural poor by
indicating its preferred sectors or by refusing to finance some sectors or products.

Gender in IFC RNFE Advisory Services. Of the 63 evaluated advisory services, 40
percent had gender integration, mainly by including women in training activities.
Between the first and second period of the evaluation, the incidence of gender
integration doubled. However, most activities did not conduct a gender analysis,
with exceptions in FCS contexts, such as in Aceh and PNG. It is worth noting that in

GROWTH-ORIENTED APPROACHES IN THE RURAL NONFARM ECONOMY
IFC, only the Agribusiness department projects actively monitored female
employment starting in 2008.

Rural Tourism Value Chains
Rural tourism activities can occur across large and diversified value chains that have
traditionally been labor intensive, and they have the potential to be widely inclusive
of and environmentally sustainable. In developing countries, it can be an important
driver of growth and poverty reduction, but this is dependent on whether tourism
can generate employment, create linkages (between the farm and the nonfarm
sector), and stimulate local economic development while minimizing adverse
environmental and cultural impacts.

IEG’s country case studies and portfolio review revealed that rural tourism has been
relatively rare in the World Bank Group portfolio as a means to stimulate growth of
the RNFE and more generally alleviate poverty. Several of the country case studies
explored this topic and found that the sector can provide opportunities for rural
poverty reduction by ensuring that a more equitable and profitable share of the
benefits are enjoyed by those at the lower end of the value chain. Yet there has been
a lack of country-level analysis and investment. The sector is a good example of the
challenge of confronting inequities along the value chain and opportunities for
promoting youth employment (box 3.5).

Of the few rural tourism projects approved during the evaluation period, outputs
have been tracked, but few have reported employment or welfare effects. Projects
reporting employment effects (World Bank) or SME access and value chain linkage
support (IFC) were located in transitioning and urbanized economies. In the World
Bank, IEG identified 34 out of 6,263 projects that financed rural tourism activities, of
which 13 were closed and evaluated. Of these, pro-poor rural employment and
welfare effects were achieved in high capacity countries such as South Africa, where
hundreds of jobs were created on the Cape Peninsula, and in Kazakhstan, where
thousands of jobs were created around the country’s natural forest heritage. On the
other hand, reporting on ecotourism investments in agrarian economies was limited
to studies, training, and the development of tourism plans. In the few cases where
productive activities were financed, no information is available on the profitability
or sustainability of the rural enterprises (handicrafts, ecotourism, and so on).
Cultural tourism projects were the least successful. Trade and Competitiveness is
assuming a role in this area, in the regulatory environment, and in support for
SMEs, but it is too soon to evaluate.

                                   GROWTH-ORIENTED APPROACHES IN THE RURAL NONFARM ECONOMY

 Box 3.4. Tapping Touristic Opportunities to Support Youth Employment in Morocco
 In Morocco, opportunities for tapping entrepreneurial youth potential have been missed
 with the World Bank’s decision to drop its tourism project, rather than refine it. This
 missed opportunity was cited by multiple ministries in interviews. A World Bank study
 shows the magnitude of exclusion facing Moroccan youth, where 51 percent of 15–29 year
 olds are out of school and work. With limited prospects of a formal job, youth, especially
 the less educated, are seeking opportunities for self-employment. Morocco’s rich
 geography as well as its handicrafts provides ample opportunity to add value to the
 sector to alleviate poverty. Handicrafts need to be produced at scale and with consistent
 quality but marketing, packaging, and production is lacking. This is where the youth
 potential can be tapped because they have the technical fluency to help rural industries
 with e-commerce but not information about the activities that are ongoing in rural areas
 (that is, the argan sector).


In the identified RNFE portfolio, IFC financed 19 rural tourism investments, of
which 5 were mature and evaluated. Of these, 4 out of 5 were rated unsuccessful
due to poor financial performance, poor marketing, contractual delays, and
challenges associated with environmental compliance, including in vulnerable
habitats such as in the Seychelles.3 Of 142 Advisory Services projects supporting
tourism, only 16 explicitly provided market entry or MSME supply linkage support
to rural areas (an additional 36 provided support more broadly). Projects supporting
SME market access reported generally successful achievements related to increased
contracts signed, number of visitors, and revenues. However, employment was not
tracked, even though some projects were designed to track this. Fewer projects
sought to enhance supply linkages with SMEs in the rural economy, but services
provided to Sri Lanka, for example, demonstrate the potential of forging more
effective linkages between purveyors in rural areas and large hotel enterprises
(anchor investments). In Sri Lanka, advisory services linked 100 SMEs to large
hotels, creating jobs along the value chain that reached into the rural economy,
including restaurants, guest houses, and diver operators. Ecotourism projects
however did not generate similar benefits.

Agglomeration Approaches within the Trade and Competitiveness GP
The World Bank has committed $1.2 billion to projects that promote agglomeration
benefits across firms, mostly in Africa, most of which are ongoing and have not been
fully evaluated. These projects support spatially oriented approaches, such as
special economic zones, growth poles, and industrial clusters. IEG hosted a
discussion with the Center for Global Development based on their review of 20
agglomeration projects. The review showed weak implementation performance and
coordination challenges reminiscent of historic integrated rural development


                                                                                          39

GROWTH-ORIENTED APPROACHES IN THE RURAL NONFARM ECONOMY
challenges. The RNFE case studies reinforce these findings pointing to an
overestimation of intellectual clarity, a need to reduce technical complexity and to
make projects more flexible to economic circumstances. Agglomeration may ease
coordination failures and induce a critical mass of investment, but this does not
always occur as revealed by IEG’s RNFE case study in Mozambique, with regard to
the Nacala Corridor.

Synthesis Findings on the World Bank Group’s Poverty- and Growth-Oriented Approaches in
the RNFE
This and the preceding portfolio chapter have demonstrated that the approaches
currently being used within the RNFE are both binary and siloized. Projects
targeting the rural poor, implemented mainly in agrarian and transitioning areas,
have had considerable success in such dimensions as social empowerment, income
smoothing, and service delivery. However, although there are
detectable employment and income gains for the rural poor, the changes were
insufficient to sustainably lift large numbers of them out of poverty. Conversely,
value chain approaches have achieved targeted increases in production, revenues, or
sales, but reach to the rural poor is not evident (projects lack poverty targeting).
Across all three worlds of structural transformation, value chain projects yielded
technical results that translated into increased production and processing, but pro-
poor and gender-sensitive value chain analysis was lacking at design, along with
associated metrics for monitoring during implementation and evaluation. Such
analysis should seek to understand labor market segmentation, power, and the
terms of exchange along the chain to improve the terms and conditions of
employment for poor men and women. In these projects, there are likely secondary
effects within the rural economy, through labor smoothing and job creation, but
these effects have not been measured at the project level or through targeted
assessments.

  The Sustainable Business Advisory had its roots in an earlier IFC initiative launched in April 2006. In 2006, IFC started a
Sustainable Business Innovator Facility: a global, donor-funded program to pilot profitable businesses that had
environmental and social benefits. In late FY2010, building on lessons from the pilot projects funded by the Innovator
Facility, IFC consolidated its advisory business and created a new business line—the Sustainable Business Advisory—with
about 250 staff operating out of most of IFC’s offices. The Sustainable Business Advisory business line operated within the
context of several World Bank Group strategies and initiatives, including the World Bank’s Sustainable Development
Network, the Finance and Private Sector Development Network, and the Poverty Reduction and Economic Management
Network.

4. Country Strategy, Analytics, and Enablers
 Highlights
  As identified in the country case studies, some country programs reviewed are not pursuing an
    integrated strategic approach to developing the rural nonfarm economy as a vehicle to reduce
    rural poverty. Rural services have been delivered as part of sector programs but not as part of
    a spatial development approach to the rural economy that integrates an understanding of rural
    demographics, skills, mobility, remittance flows etc. Noted exceptions from the RNFE country
    case studies are Bangladesh and quite recently, in Indonesia.
  Critical to guiding integrated country approaches to the RNFE is the application of consistent
   diagnostics. The World Bank has been a leader in researching and documenting the rural
   nonfarm sector and in analyzing its relationship to poverty. But there is a substantial gap on the
   diagnostic and analytic side that has been addressed occasionally but not systematically. Given
   limited internal resources, past and ongoing diagnostic initiatives have relied on partnerships
   with other donors and the mobilization of external financing.
  Addressing binding constraints is key to linking the rural poor to the RNFE. World Bank–
   financed rural transport projects have not measured their contribution to local economic gains,
   in spite of intentions to achieve this in a third of all cases. Enhanced rural connectivity is being
   achieved through synergies between transport and agriculture—but mainly in transitioning
   economies. Basic literacy and skills are critical enablers in the RNFE; however, dialogue is
   lacking between agriculture and education experts, and although value chain projects include
   skills components, evidence of their effectiveness is lacking. Several rural education service
   delivery innovations could be tested elsewhere and more strategically applied. Sustainable
   delivery of financial services to the rural poor faces persistent obstacles. The delivery of
   sustainable, low-cost services requires further research, piloting, and scaling up of innovative
   models to reach underserved clients. World Bank support has extended a certain level of
   financial services to the poorest rural segments, but subsidization raises questions about
   sustainability, crowding out, and politicization. IFC investments often reach countries that have
   high exclusion rates, but only a fraction cater to the lower end of the retail segment.


Country Strategies and Rural Dynamics
IEG conducted ten country cases studies distributed across the three worlds and
supplemented this with a review of early Systematic Country Diagnostics. The
country case studies included Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Morocco,
Mozambique, Nicaragua, Rwanda, Tajikistan, and Ukraine. Overall, country
strategies focused more closely on improving access for rural communities to new
capital and markets for their goods and services, such as new roads and electricity
network, than on mechanisms geared toward understanding migration and
mobility, including commuting, or the more efficient management of remittances to
rural areas. Across all country categories, IEG’s field missions observed that rural

                                                 COUNTRY STRATEGY ANALYTICS AND ENABLERS
poverty was often framed as an “urban problem” in country strategies and the
analytical work that underpinned them. Rural poverty reduction was often seen as
a means to stem unsustainable rural-to-urban migration. For example, in Ukraine,
“off-farm job creation and improved public services in rural areas are needed to
prevent increased rural poverty and large-scale urban migration, together with
their associated social problems” (OECD and World Bank 2004, xviii). In Ukraine,
off-farm job creation and improved public services in rural area are needed to
prevent increased rural poverty and large-scale urban migration, together with
their associated social problems (World Bank 2003). In Mozambique, the
government is mindful of the high and growing risks associated with urban
unemployment and poverty, driven by rural migration and high population
growth, and the potential for social unrest (World Bank 2012b).

As such, rural services were generally delivered in situ. There were few instances
where country planning, including in country assistance strategies, country
partnership strategies, and more recently the Systematic Country Diagnostics had
performed a thorough diagnostic of migration (including seasonal) or other
population movement patterns (for example, commuting) to better understand
where and when assistance can best be delivered to serve the needs of the poor.
This finding also applies to pastoral areas, where in situ rather than mobile services
have been delivered.

The same is true for remittances - for countries whose rural poor are highly
dependent on them – and whose populations face a high risk of food insecurity due
to shocks or currency devaluation. In Tajikistan, remittances have accounted for up
to half of GDP and a quarter of rural poverty reduction. Until recently, most
strategy and project documents in Tajikistan retained a primary focus on farming
but the latest CAS includes an explicit discussion on the currency devaluation in
the Russian Federation and its impact on rural poverty.

The country strategies reviewed have only recently begun to refer to secondary city
development to promote greater rural-urban connectivity, and this has not yet
translated to investments in the field. By creating proximity to urban centers,
secondary cities have the potential to foster the “high-end” RNFE and accelerate
poverty reduction. Most of the countries covered in this evaluation maintain highly
centralized functional and fiscal assignments and political decision making, with
limited discretion granted to lower-level organs of government in service delivery.
The country studies suggest that the exploration of secondary city development,
initially through Analytical and Advisory Assistance, and then through lending is
something worth considering in the fight against rural poverty.

CHAPTER 4
COUNTRY STRATEGY ANALYTICS AND ENABLERS
In Morocco, there are two significant opportunities for households to move out of
poverty: through remittances from family living abroad and by proximity to
communities with relatively larger proportions of non-poor households. Out of a
population 33.5 million, 4 million live abroad, and remittances account for roughly
6.5 percent of Morocco’s total gross domestic product (de Haas 2014). Morocco’s
cities are the engine of the country’s growth and are consequently attractive for
rural residents seeking access to capital and markets. Neither the country
partnership strategy for 2010–13 nor the one 2014–17 make substantive mention of
the development challenges Morocco faces with regard to rural-to-urban migration
and rapid urban growth and resettlement (World Bank 2014). Interviews with
Moroccan government counterparts confirm that this is a development challenge
and that there is a need for better data to consider population change over time
when planning major infrastructure development projects such as roadways and
water pipelines. At the same time, both country partnership strategies reference the
importance of labor mobility in enhancing growth and improving job quality, with
a need to focus on progressively increasing formal sector employment that can
allow for greater introduction of income protection mechanisms. With these social
systems better in place, the country partnership strategy for 2010–13 in particular
notes that Morocco is liable to have a more mobile labor force and “workers that are
more likely to engage in higher risks higher return activities” (World Bank
2009b, 10).

Better analytics could facilitate a more nuanced understanding of the binding
constraints at the country level that limit the rural poor from participating in and
benefiting from the RNFE based on consistent, timely, and systematic data. Yet
consistent measurement and analytic frameworks have been largely missing from
the RNFE space. The work has taken place sporadically. Where it occurred, such as
in Latin American and the Caribbean in the mid-90s or more recently in South Asia,
it has influenced the way that practitioners have framed rural policy questions. For
example, data collected with World Bank support across 12 Latin American and the
Caribbean countries, presented in World Development Report 2001, showed that the
structure of the rural labor force had shifted, with some 50 percent of rural income
in these countries being derived from RNFE activities. The work cautioned that
“betting solely and predominantly on agriculture means condemning rural
inhabitants to conditions of endemic poverty, marginalization, and stagnation”
(World Bank 2001). As such, policy makers were encouraged to remove agricultural
biases that characterized rural development programs.

The World Bank has been a leader in helping document the characteristics and
nature of the rural nonfarm sector and in analyzing its relationship to poverty
reduction. In the late 1990s, the World Bank Development Economics Group (DEC)

began challenging the traditional view that the nonfarm was primarily a low-
productivity sector that produced low-quality goods, and that rural nonfarm
activities would decline as a country develops. It began to document the size and
heterogeneity of the sector, and it pointed to evidence that in many emerging
economies, the RNFE was expanding rather than declining (Lanjouw 2001). But the
research also showed that the mechanisms through which nonfarm activities can
influence poverty and inequality are varied and complex. Although the effects of
nonfarm activities can be pro-poor, and significantly so, the benefits may be felt
more indirectly via linkages between the nonfarm and the farm sector.

The rural investment climate assessments were born in the World Bank in the mid-
2000s as a response to the urban bias of investment climate assessments (ICAs), a
survey-based World Bank Group tool aimed at understanding constraints to
private enterprises. The ICAs were based on enterprise surveys typically conducted
in major cities, shedding virtually no light on the rural economy. The rural ICAs
(RICAs) were launched by Agricultural and Rural Development in recognition of
two facts: (i) nonfarm income, often derived from households or MSMEs,
constituted a growing share of rural income and a pathway out of poverty, yet little
was known about the nature or conditions of the activities; and (ii) rural enterprises
faced a different set of conditions than urban enterprises, due to seasonality, lack of
infrastructure, and remoteness. IEG examined the RICAs, considered the findings,
and reviewed the related country assistance strategies to determine policy uptake.

RICAs have provided a number of unique insights and have stood alone in
providing a picture of the constraints to rural enterprise development. Once
identified, these constraints have the potential to be key entry points for policy. In
Tajikistan, RICA data was a public resource used by the World Bank in its strategy
and projects, by other donors (with no comparable instrument), and by the
government, where findings were accepted given its strong methods. In Nicaragua,
the RICA was the basis for identifying constraints to rural entrepreneurs and was
judged by the CMU to be “important and effective.” RICAs also provided cross-
cutting lessons on developing the RNFE, as highlighted in The Rural Investment
Climate: It Differs and It Matters (World Bank 2006) and The Rural Development
Investment Climate: Analysis and Findings (World Bank 2008) and provided the basis
of subsequent research on such issues as gender as well.1

Challenges to RICA implementation. Launched as pilots and funded by trust funds,
RICAs faced implementation challenges due to their complexity, the number of
instruments used, delays, costs, inconsistencies in design, and limited demand
given these challenges. Although ICAs had constraints, RICAs required more
planning because of the logistical needs of rural surveys and the application of


                                                                                     45
CHAPTER 4
COUNTRY STRATEGY ANALYTICS AND ENABLERS
multiple tools (community, household, enterprise, and price surveys). They were
longer in duration and required specific survey skills. In some cases, they exhibited
flaws in implementation since their complexity was underestimated. Regional staff
and country teams resisted standardization of the diagnostics, preferring surveys
tailored to their own priorities. Although a second round of RICAs was more
standardized, a funding shortage prevented replication, so the data generated was
one-off. Where urban enterprise surveys were able to overcome resistance to
standardization through a central funding mechanism and support from a World
Bank Vice Presidency, the RICA team lacked this leverage. Not only did the
Agriculture and Rural Development sector board show limited appetite after the
pilots, but the Finance and Private Sector Department, which hosted the ICA, never
embraced it, nor did DEC, the current home of enterprise surveys. The program lost
steam, and only a trickle of RICAs followed.

At the same time as RICA, a World Bank–hosted research partnership, RuralStruc,2
which focused on the structural dimensions of liberalization, helped to debunk
myths about the poverty-reducing impacts of structural transformation in a
globalized world. The research had the potential to widely inform the way the
World Bank Group engages in the RNFE to reduce poverty through field-based
surveys and data gathering, but it was underused. It found that nonfarm
diversification mirrors economic transition, with low returns in the early stages and
higher returns later on. By deploying teams of local experts and researchers across
several countries and regions, the effort revealed that nonfarm activity was a
common response to high levels of risk in agricultural activities, engaged in by
75 percent of households and that the sector is often characterized by high levels of
self-employment, petty services, with few formal wage-earning opportunities.
Nonagricultural wage employment was a limited option, mostly found in areas
with resource endowments, infrastructure, and services. Self-employment was the
main option for the poor, divided into “positive diversification”—a full-time
activity with a significant contribution to household income—and “neutral
diversification”—minor activities used as a coping strategy. It found that proximity
to areas with high population density was insufficient to stimulate growth. Instead,
what counted was the combination of infrastructure, goods, and services needed to
foster rural-urban linkages. However, it was a one-off study, neither replicated nor
expanded. IEG found no evidence of uptake in RuralStruc countries.

The Living Standards Measurement Study-Integrated Surveys on Agriculture
(LSMS-ISA), funded by the Gates Foundation and led by DEC, has improved the
understanding of rural development in six pilot countries in Africa, particularly of
agriculture and the linkages between farm and nonfarm activities. The undertaking
is highly responsive to country needs and was identified in many of the Systematic

Country Diagnostics reviewed by this evaluation for subnational statistics or data
obtained from different geographical or agro-ecological zones. The LSMS-ISA
responds to the need to understand mobility and spatial dimensions of
development within the rural-to-urban continuum. Its relevance is also
underpinned by its focus on building capacity—in local line ministries and
statistical offices—to generate data on the agricultural economy on a recurrent
basis. In reference to the work, a director of DEC stated that “high-quality
household data are crucial to improving our understanding of poverty and the role
of agriculture in the livelihoods of the rural poor. But agriculture does not exist in a
vacuum, which is why these surveys cut across sectors and will provide a holistic
picture of rural incomes” (World Bank 2009a). But like others, this pilot, while more
systematic and rigorous than the RICA, is an expensive undertaking, is reliant on
trust funds, and includes only a very small subset of the World Bank’s client
countries.

The LSMS-ISA is yielding considerable insights on the RNFE at country level.
Using the data, McCullough (2015) constructed net profits of nonfarm enterprises
and calculated productivity and employment. The work finds important links
between the farm and nonfarm: the relative productivity of farm and nonfarm labor
is different depending on the country, and in some countries, farm work is as
productive as nonfarm work. A low level of human capital constrains productivity
in all activities.

Most RNFE jobs in industry involve agricultural processing and hence are linked to
farm productivity. In rural areas, manufacturing gains from agriculture
productivity growth and rural manufacturers benefit from demand from rising
farm incomes. Nagler and Naudé have conducted analysis of LSMS-ISA findings,
yielding more insights into the “push” and “pull” factors identified by DEC and by
RuralStruc (Nagler and Naudé 2014).3 These factors motivate participation,
constraints, characteristics, and performance of rural enterprises.

A new instrument, that is too early to evaluate, has emerged to examine the
enabling environment for inclusive agricultural value chains in client countries.
Enabling the Business of Agriculture includes indicators such as inputs, machinery,4
finance, transport, markets, information and communications technology, land,
water, and livestock (World Bank 2016). It sets out to identify regulations that
negatively affect agriculture and agribusiness to promote more inclusive growth of

COUNTRY STRATEGY ANALYTICS AND ENABLERS
The Rural Nonfarm Enabling Environment
Rural analytics, the literature, and IEG’s RNFE country case studies show that
enabling conditions for rural enterprise activity are critical to the poor’s ability to
participate in and benefit from the RNFE. The poor can be differentially constrained
by a lack of connectivity (infrastructure), resource endowments (land), finance,
public goods and services (electricity, power, and water), and low levels of human
capital and social capital (identity-based exclusion, including gender). Although the
relative weights of these constraints differs by country and area, the literature
suggests that these factors constrain the rural poor from exiting poverty. As
established in the approach paper, this evaluation covers four main themes (rural
roads, rural skills, rural finance and gender). It also reports the rural related
findings of IEG’s Access to Electricity Evaluation (2015) but notes that work on
water and sanitation (including rural water) and essential health services (including
in rural areas) are ongoing evaluations.

RURAL TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE RNFE
Enhancing rural accessibility is a major challenge in developing countries. About
900 million rural inhabitants are located more than 2 km from an all-season road.5 It
is widely recognized that improved rural roads increase access to services, markets,
and jobs, and therefore contribute to improved living standards (Roberts, Shyam,
and Rastogi 2006).

Several rigorous studies have shown that investments in rural transport
infrastructure significantly improve the likelihood of the rural poor accessing
nonfarm employment. In Peru, rural road building had positive effects on income
and income diversification, which were gained from increased access to
nonagricultural wages (Escobal and Ponce 2008). An International Food Policy
Research Institute study on rural roads in China, India, Thailand, Uganda, and
Vietnam reports employment effects, in the form of employment programs that
were more accessible to the poor, prior to building roads. In India, national
highway development produced a threefold increase in the share of income from
nonagriculture activities for rural inhabitants, a twofold increase in the per capita
trip rate for education, and a 50 percent increase in school enrollment (Fan 2009).

Yet evaluative evidence on socioeconomic impacts of rural transport infrastructure
is limited. Short-term effects are relatively clear: transport costs and travel time can
be reduced by improved road conditions (Khandker, Bakht, and Koolwal 2009;
Khandker and Koolwal 2011; Jacoby 2000). Yet, longer-term impacts, such as
increased profitability of firms (or increased employment in the agricultural and
non-agricultural sectors take time to materialize (Chandra and Thompson 2000;

Lokshin and Yemtsov 2005). They also depend on other conditions, such as the
level of motorization (Escobal and Ponce 2008). Hence, although traditional
economic rate of return analysis has been used to justify and report on
infrastructure investments, only a handful of rigorous studies have been conducted
to measure the socioeconomic impact of rural road improvements on living
standards.

IEG’s portfolio review reinforces the finding that most World Bank–financed rural
transport projects do not measure economic outcomes, and few use adequate
proxies, despite the fact one-third were intended to increase economic
opportunities for the poor. Between 2004 and 2014, the World Bank approved
financing for 232 rural transport infrastructure projects valued at $18.6 billion and
implemented in 74 countries. These were mainly implemented under the Transport
GP, but also include $1 billion of commitments under the Agriculture GP. Of the
closed projects (n = 99), most reported outputs (number or kilometers of roads built
or rehabilitated). Only half of all closed projects reported on road quality, and of
these, only four describe the metrics used to assess this (for example, international
road roughness index). One-quarter of the portfolio measured “access,” but only
five projects indicate the standard used to assess this (that is, the Corporate
Performance Indicator that defines access as 2 km away from an all-weather road).
Of those that reported on access, most did not indicate what the increased access
would yield in social or economic terms. The same applies for projects reporting
time savings.

Financing for rural transport infrastructure was highly concentrated in a few
countries, mainly in transitioning economies, with the exception of Ethiopia. About
a dozen countries received most of the funding with five countries (India, China,
Ethiopia, Brazil, and Argentina) receiving half of the total. Although this is in line
with total relative borrowing for countries like India and China, Ethiopia’s
investment is noteworthy, representing 25 percent of its total International
Development Association commitments over the evaluation period. Ethiopia has
one of the lowest road densities in Africa. The lack of RNFE growth is associated
with a lack of demand for services, partly attributable to low population density. As
such, Ethiopia has borrowed $1.2 billion to double its road network for its federal
trunk, link, and regional roads of high economic importance. As reported in the
project’s Implementation Completion and Results Report Review, the investments
have increased employment in rural road works and provided more affordable
means of transport and services. However, IEG’s case study points to poor
maintenance, unclear ownership, and lack of year-round access.




                                                                                    49
CHAPTER 4
COUNTRY STRATEGY ANALYTICS AND ENABLERS
Agricultural finance has been tapped in transitioning countries to increase rural-to-
urban and market connectivity. A total of $1 billion of agricultural lending was
used for road rehabilitation in 39 countries, with six receiving 50 percent of the total
finance (India, China, Democratic Republic of Congo, Brazil, Nigeria, and Malawi).
India and China provide good examples of strategic blending of their transport and
agricultural portfolios. In India, transport lending was used to improve trade-
related infrastructure, whereas agriculture finance supported local road and bridge
building, thereby facilitating market access for villages and promoting local
economic development. An impact evaluation shows that the agricultural
investments in roads have improved connectivity and market access, which in turn
has helped to generate a surplus of higher value crops and associated income gains.
Similarly, in China, transport lending has traditionally been large in size, focused
on highways, and implemented at the provincial level. Recently, agricultural
lending has been used to increase connectivity between provinces, counties, and
villages. ICRRs reported that these investments have stimulated local development,
improved access to markets, reduced travel time, and increased production due to
improved access to buyers and information.

Some agrarian countries with small International Development Association
envelopes have relied solely on the agriculture sector to support rural transport
infrastructure. In some cases, like Tajikistan, these countries receive most of their
transport financing from other donors. However, in Malawi and Guatemala,
smallholder producers suffer from weak input markets, low productivity, and lack
of market linkages. As such, agricultural finance has been used to unblock
connectivity constraints to increase competitiveness in agriculture areas. And in the
Democratic Republic of Congo, where water transport is the only means of moving
goods across two-thirds of the country, agricultural finance has provided critical
connectivity between farms in Équateur, consumers in Kinshasa, and the port.
Agricultural lending for rural road rehabilitation has also helped restore
connectivity after natural disasters (for example, in Tajikistan, where agricultural
finance was used to rehabilitate rural access roads destroyed by mudslides).

Agriculture projects that use a community-based approach also include the
upgrading of rural transport infrastructure, but none of the projects that referenced
intended economic impacts measured this. In total, these included the construction
or rehabilitation of 6,842 roads, 4,584 culverts, and 162 bridges; however, data on
road quality, location, or links to economic outcomes are lacking (for example,
access to markets, employment).

The case studies also highlight instances in which rural connectivity was neglected.
A large World Bank program for road rehabilitation in Nicaragua increased trade

along the Pacific Highway, but the corridors between Managua and the regional
capitals, where most of the poor live (including indigenous communities) are
unmaintained. Although connectivity between Managua and the regional capitals
may be less of an imperative than local economic development around them, these
roads need to paved and maintained.

RNFE SKILLS, TRAINING, AND INNOVATIONS IN RURAL EDUCATION
Evidence suggests that even relatively small gains in educational outcomes may
yield considerably improved employment prospects in the nonfarm sector
(Lanjouw and Lanjouw 2001; Lanjouw and Shariff 2004; de Janvry, Sadoulet, and
Zhu 2005; Rahut and others 2015). Rural youth lack foundational skills necessary to
compete for nonfarm employment. Most poor rural youth depend on smallholder
farming and nonfarm work. New developments in agricultural production and
marketing mean that rural job opportunities will be scarcer and will demand higher
skills. As such, the RNFE is becoming an important source of jobs for rural youth
who need skills upgrading. Many rural youths need to improve their literacy and
numeracy as a first step to benefit from RNFE skills programs (World Bank 2012a).

Skills development in the agriculture RNFE portfolio. Interviews revealed a need
to strengthen the nexus between education, skills development, agribusiness and
associated value chain activities as a tool to support the integration of the rural poor
into the RNFE. Interviews pointed to a need to strengthen links especially at the
country level, where dialogue is lacking between education, agriculture, and rural
ministries.

In the World Bank, the RNFE portfolio linked to the agriculture sector revealed that
financing for dedicated skills development along the value chains was available in
one out of every three projects. In the closed and evaluated projects, the results of
these activities were not measured. In transitioning and urbanized economies
(Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz, and Georgia), value chain projects
provided training to financial institutions to strengthen and diversify their rural
lending product portfolios. However, there is no information on uptake of the
financial products in the Implementation Completion and Results Reports.

The rural livelihood portfolio was an exception, featuring a high frequency of
projects in which training is coupled with job placement and rural income poverty
is addressed through skills and youth employment components. Projects focus on
demand-side interventions, providing poor youth with market-relevant training
and linking them to job placement opportunities. An Employment Generation and
Marketing Mission, set up by the Rural Development Department of the former state
of Andhra Pradesh, grew out of pilots tested through the Andhra Pradesh Rural

Poverty Reduction Project, evaluated by IEG. The ongoing Tamil Nadu
Empowerment and Poverty Reduction Project is the largest skills training program in
India, with 250,000 youth trained and over 80 percent placed. Based on these, skills
training is being integrated into other livelihoods projects elsewhere.

In IFC, most of the advisory service projects (53 of 63 evaluated) included training
activities. However, none measured their effectiveness. Training activities ranged
from enterprise to accommodation management, to food safety skills, to business
and even basic language training. Half of these projects were rated mostly
successful or higher, and, regardless of their relative success, most projects only
report the number of training events and the number of persons trained, by gender.
A few projects used satisfaction surveys.

Innovation in rural education service delivery in the education portfolio. Using
the metasector and theme codes, IEG observed that 11 percent of the 390 education
sector projects approved between 2004 and 2014 included an explicit focus on
delivering education to rural areas. The projects served 29 countries through
nationwide or sectoral support programs and support to rural areas. Of these, only
8 had a set of activities that specifically addressed constraints to education service
delivery in rural areas.

Although further work is needed to assess the effectiveness of the rural education
services delivered in the context of the RNFE, several innovations introduced by the
Education GP help the poor access basic rural education. These include innovative
cost-reducing features like the use of new school building technology—for
example, a light-gauge steel framework in Bhutan lowered the cost of transporting
building materials in mountainous areas. In China, a series of rural education
reform pilots used natural light to reduce heating costs, and morning snacks, hot
meals, deworming medication, and micronutrients have been provided to motivate
school attendance. Other efforts have been less successful, such as book rental
schemes, which increased access to educational materials but were challenged by
the use of lower-quality paper that increased wear and tear. School-based
management was often implemented in rural education projects. In rural areas,
projects have found that the lack of parent involvement in school activities is
associated with poor delivery and quality of education services (budgeting,
planning, and learning). This activity sought to improve the relationship between
schools and communities and aimed to give communities increased decision-
making powers over the local school. Another type of innovation was clustering, or
“cluster schools,” which provide a network for teachers, and multigrade
classrooms.

ACCESS TO ELECTRICITY

An estimated 1.2 billion people—16 percent of the global population – do not have
access to electricity (WEO, 2016) and another 1 billion suffer from inadequate or
unreliable service. More than 95 percent of those without electricity are in Sub-
Saharan Africa and South Asia, and they are predominantly in rural areas. IEG’s
evaluation World Bank Group Support to Electricity Access, FY2000-2014, found that
there are significant gaps in coverage to low-income countries, and that support for
off-grid electrification was low and sporadic (World Bank 2015b). However, several
good practices are highlighted where the World Bank helped to provide electricity,
at scale, nationwide, in Vietnam, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Indonesia,
Bangladesh, Rwanda, and Kenya. These experiences share common features:
adoption of a universal, least-cost roll-out plan using coordinated grid and off-grid
delivery systems; attention toward sector financial sustainability including the
commercial viability of service delivery providers; effective poverty targeting
schemes; and government commitment. Although not yet independently evaluated,
the World Bank Group’s Lighting Africa Program has supported delivery of last
mile electricity services by analyzing existing and potential distribution channels
and making available needed finance, including through financing facilities. IEG’s
rural nonfarm case study of Bangladesh highlights lessons from the World Bank’s
support there that extended access to electricity through off-grid Solar Home
Systems, supplemented by progress on extending the electricity grid. An impact
evaluation found that yearly per capita expenditure and yearly total income
increased, with a particularly strong impact on yearly nonfarm income. However,
the benefits of grid electrification were not equally distributed (Khandker, Barnes,
and Samad 2012).

RURAL FINANCIAL INCLUSION
IEG’s evaluation Financial Inclusion: A Foothold on the Ladder toward Prosperity found
that financial inclusion faces persistent obstacles in reaching the rural poor (World
Bank 2015b).6 Financial inclusion has the potential to benefit the rural poor through
an array of channels, ranging from payments to savings to insurance. Credit and
savings services can help smooth consumption in the face of variable income flows.
Insurance can protect against illnesses or job loss. Savings and credit may also help
the poor make investments to improve their housing or launch or expand a micro-
or small enterprise (Banerjee and Duflo 2007; Collins and others 2009; CFI 2009).
Informal services, though convenient, can be unreliable, risky, and costly (Collins
and others 2009; Roodman 2012).




                                                                                    53
CHAPTER 4
COUNTRY STRATEGY ANALYTICS AND ENABLERS
Reliance on brick-and-mortar branching of traditional financial institutions has
often not proven economical in rural areas. High transaction costs apply to the
supply and demand side, where it is costly and time consuming for the poor to
access financial services. There are additional risks at the lower end of the market,
including customers’ lack of formal credit history, formal identification, financial
literacy, and income volatility. The rural poor often depend heavily on informal
schemes ranging from moneylenders to cooperatives and rotating savings, but
these carry costs and risks because they operate outside the ambit of prudential and
consumer protection regulation (Collins and others 2009; Roodman 2010). Among
promising innovations are delivery models such as mobile, correspondent banking,
agent-based, and branchless banking. IEG’s financial inclusion evaluation
concluded that, to deliver sustainable, low-cost services, the World Bank Group and
its partners need to research, pilot, and scale innovative business models to reach
underserved rural clients (World Bank 2015). One example is a new (in 2016)
initiative involving the World Bank, CGAP (the Consultative Group to Assist the
Poor), IFC, and UK-AID, called Harnessing Innovation for Financial Inclusion,
which is intended to scale up branchless banking and modernize government and
retail payments, including remittances, to provide access to a broad range of
financial services to those people who do not have any or adequate access.
Although its focus is not explicitly rural, by aiming at the unbanked, it will
disproportionately benefit the rural poor.

IEG’s financial inclusion evaluation found that IFC investments often reach
countries that have high exclusion rates, but only a fraction of its support caters to
the very small retail segment of the microcredit market (World Bank 2015a). IFC
typically supports fully licensed banks, but also nonbank microfinance institutions,
which are highly relevant for the inclusion of the rural poor. In the countries where
IFC operates, microloans represent about 5 to 10 percent of the loan portfolios of
those banks that IFC supports with investments where microenterprises or poor
households are a declared beneficiary. The majority of IFC-supported banks (90
percent) have mixed portfolios; the rest are up to 10 times larger and go to clients
taking out significantly larger loans. This is not necessarily a bad thing as—at least
SMEs are likely to benefit from such loans—and eventually microenterprises may
benefit from the strengthening and deepening of the smaller end of the commercial
finance market. But it argues for better segmentation and targeting of the
microsegment. Within the microloan segment, IFC-supported banks issue loans
slightly larger than their peers, indicating that they do not necessarily cater to the
lowest end of the microcredit market. IEG’s evaluation found that monitoring and
transparently reporting the extent to which IFC’s loans reach the poor and
microenterprises is important going forward.

In the World Bank, support for rural financial access has taken the form of smaller
elements in larger projects, a many of which are only partially focused on rural
access to finance, and a number include sectors other than the financial sector. The
majority fell under the former Finance and Private Sector Board, but many also fell
under the former Agriculture and Rural Development. Vehicles for direct support to
rural finance institutions, or smaller microfinance or informal financial institutions,
are limited, and apex arrangements have been the typical approach—with mixed
success. In the case of Ghana, IEG’s PPAR of the Rural Financial Services Project
found that the World Bank was able to help establish regulatory guidelines for
rural banks through support to an apex bank, but it had only partial success in
establishing delegated supervision by the central bank to the apex bank. In
Bangladesh, the Second Poverty Alleviation Microfinance project targeted both rural
microfinance and urban microentrepreneurs through an apex funding and capacity
building institution. According to IEG, the objective of achieving market-based
funding was not achieved through the project, and the apex institution remained
subsidized.


 Box 4.1. A Patient and Multifaceted Approach to Expanding Rural Finance in Tajikistan
 IEG’s RNFE Tajikistan case study showed a patient and multifaceted approach to
 expanding rural financial services. In Tajikistan, IFC worked with the World Bank and
 other donors in promoting rural finance. IFC supported the transformation and
 strengthening of microfinance enterprises through advisory and, sometimes, subsequent
 investments. It used advisory services to improve the country’s financial infrastructure
 and regulatory environment related to credit bureaus. It also supported the development
 of leasing finance through its Agri-Finance and Regulatory Reform project, which helped to
 improve the legislative framework for leasing. Some of its advisory work was delivered
 regionally to central Asia, including a financial literacy initiative and piloting of an
 innovative technology for microlending. It also worked with the World Bank and donors
 to promote higher-level policy and institutional reforms. The World Bank delivered
 substantial financial sector Analytical and Advisory Assistance. In spite of many
 setbacks, until Tajikistan’s recent economic crisis, access to rural finance for farm and
 nonfarm rural uses was growing rapidly.

A key question raised in IEG’s examination of rural finance schemes, and more
broadly about subsidized microfinance, is that of sustainability and the need for a
consistent approach to subsidies. An IEG working paper based on multiple PPARs
concluded that “when subsidies are political and entrenched they are hard to
displace and it is insufficient for a project team alone to conduct dialogue on this
theme; it requires higher-level policy dialogue support between senior World Bank
staff and senior country officials” (World Bank 2015c).

CHAPTER 4
COUNTRY STRATEGY ANALYTICS AND ENABLERS
The RNFE portfolio review found that access to rural finance—as a core project
component—was concentrated in the Europe and Central Asia agriculture
portfolio, where credit was directed toward farm and nonfarm enterprises.
Evaluated projects in Europe and Central Asia sought to improve rural enterprise
access to finance, markets, and know-how. In Moldova, where access to capital was
a critical constraint, the World Bank helped extend access to formal finance to rural
areas and restructure savings and credit associations to provide greater access to
finance while providing oversight of the industry to ensure prudent management
and sustainable growth. The Implementation Completion and Results Report
Review found that a combination of advisory and financial services were effective
in stimulating private sector–based growth. In Armenia, the World Bank provided
support through a facility for small rural business including for rural financial
services such as credit for working capital requirements, long-term credit for
investment purposes, and leasing programs for processing equipment. In Kyrgyz,
key constraints to agri-food enterprises’ access to capital were addressed through
the formal banking sector using new risk-mitigation tools.

1 The Rural Investment Climate: Analysis and Findings shows the richness and potential of
RICAs through a deep analysis of results from Nicaragua, Tanzania, and Sri Lanka. It sheds
new light on how household characteristics shape decisions to set up an enterprise,
responses of entrepreneurs to constraints, and differences among communities. At the
household level, RNFE activity through self-employment is often simultaneous to wage
employment and farm labor, fitting within a broader livelihood strategy of managing risks.
Most enterprises are small, with over two-thirds employing household members. Higher
community income is associated with higher density and larger enterprise size. Enterprises
mostly sell locally; those that sell outside have higher productivity. Enterprise age and
entrepreneurship are positively correlated with productivity. Key constraints are costs,
availability, and procedures of finance; electricity and water access; cost and reliability; and
road quality and access. Regulations are of low concern and credit does not have a strong
effect on productivity. Social factors have a strong influence on choice and behavior. The
data also allowed for an examination of gender differences in the RNFE, including the
findings that non-farm entrepreneurship was found to be especially important for female
heads of household and more compatible with women’s domestic responsibilities than
wage or agricultural employment.
2See the the RuralStruc Program on the “Structural Dimensions of Liberalization,” an
initiative between the World Bank Sustainable Development Department, the French
government, and IFAD.
3There are “push” and “pull” factors in the RNFE. The need to cope with shocks,
agricultural seasonality, and (larger) household size (and associated surplus labor) can
push households into non-farm entrepreneurship, while market opportunities can pull
them farther in. Proximity to markets and quality of infrastructure enhance such
opportunities. Access to credit and markets, household wealth, and the education and age
of the head of household each are positively associated with the likelihood of operating a
non-farm enterprise. Rural enterprises, those headed by women, and those owned by
young people are less productive than urban enterprises, those run by males, and those
headed by older owners. In general, enterprises operated out of necessity rather than
opportunity were less productive. Enterprises cease operations because of low profits, a
lack of finance, or the effects of idiosyncratic shocks. Many enterprises operate only part of
the year, potentially due to seasonal farm employment of the operators.

World Bank mobilized a variety of donor support, including from the U.K. Department for
International Development, the Danish International Development Agency, the

5 The World Bank and other international organizations have employed a “rural access index”
using household surveys to determine road accessibility, defined as population living within 2
kilometers of an all-season road. Recent rural access index data with an updated methodology
indicates that 13.5 million Kenyans and 14.5 million Mozambiquans are unconnected to an all-
season road. See World Bank. 2015. “A New Measure of Rural Access to Transport: Using GIS

6 Financial inclusion is about having access to formal financial services. Those without a bank
account—or access to other formal financial services (such as a bank, credit union, cooperative,
post office, or microfinance institution)—are among the financially excluded. In practice, there
is a continuum of having no access to financial services, only informal services, a mix of
informal and formal services, and the use of exclusively formal services. Even so, for those with
access, the quality and cost of services varies tremendously.

5. Conclusions and Recommendations
The World Bank Group can do more to assist the rural poor to realize the potential
of the RNFE as a pathway out of poverty. Poverty, while declining, is increasingly
concentrated in the rural space. RNFE income is part of the solution to reducing
rural poverty. Yet for the poor to benefit from opportunities in the RNFE—including
opportunities presented by mobility—they will need to overcome a host of
connectivity, human, social, and financial constraints. Priorities will depend on the
state of a country’s structural transformation and its development trajectory, and
attention needs to be paid to the differentiated nature and characteristics of areas
within each.

Although the importance of the RNFE has been emphasized in World Bank Group
strategies, the World Bank Group has not demonstrated a strategic way of engaging
in the RNFE to alleviate poverty. Multiple GPs, global solution groups, and
communities of practices are engaged in activities in this space, but there is no
coordinating mechanism. Partnerships have strong potential but are underused in
the RNFE space.

This evaluation asked a key question: “How successfully has the World Bank Group
contributed to the creation of sustainable income-generating opportunities for the
rural poor within the RNFE?” And, what attributable effects has this had on
reducing poverty?” The evaluation found that the World Bank Group has a
bifurcated portfolio in this space, with a significant gap between poverty-oriented
and growth-oriented interventions. In general, projects with rural nonfarm income-
generating activities that have a poverty focus have been effective in reducing
vulnerability and increasing access to services but not in supporting sustained
income or employment gains that have lifted the rural poor out of poverty. These
approaches include rural livelihoods, community-based approaches with a
productive aim, and social safety nets with a productive inclusion theme. On the
other hand, projects with a growth aim, namely value chains, have achieved
increased sales, revenues, and increased income—but reach to the rural poor is often
not evident. While there are likely spillover or secondary effects, these are not
measured. Efforts to bridge this divide have asked projects adept at reducing
vulnerability to achieve income and employment goals that they were not originally
designed to deliver (for example, social safety nets). Another phenomenon observed
was “discontinuous change”: a shift from one approach to another with different
target groups but without a clear plan to fill the social or productive gap left by the
change.

                                                                               CHAPTER 4
                                                 COUNTRY STRATEGY ANALYTICS AND ENABLERS
IFC’s RNFE portfolio in the agricultural and food sectors is concentrated in
urbanized and transitioning economies. Nonetheless, a closer analysis showed many
projects aim to benefit frontier or rural regions. Where IFC’s investments in food
processing have had strong links to rural areas and smaller urban centers, they had
significant positive development outcomes and demonstrated links to the RNFE.
However, IFC often works with large, international clients where its value addition
has been weaker and the benefits to the RNFE less clear. In many instances, there is
little evidence generated on links or benefits to the rural poor. In addition, in some
cases, corporations with substantial market power may disadvantage small
producers in the value chain, suggesting a need for attention to market structure. In
spite of examples of where market power has adversely affected poor value chain
participants, the risks imposed by market structure and its impact on the poor and
related mitigants are rarely treated explicitly in project documentation.

Sex-disaggregated data across the RNFE portfolio increasingly records women’s
participation in World Bank Group projects. However, few record women’s access
to economic opportunities, and none record the distributional benefits by gender.
Value chain activities require better upfront diagnostics of women’s roles, including
their relative access to assets, markets, and services and their bargaining power with
actors across the value chains.

RNFE country case studies found that most of these had not pursued an integrated
strategic approach to developing the rural nonfarm economy to reduce poverty.
Bangladesh offers an important exception. Rural services have been delivered as
part of sector programs but not as part of a spatially oriented approach to the rural
economy (both farm and nonfarm). Such an approach would include an analysis of
such dynamics as rural-to-urban migration, remittances, and (in many countries)
increasing youth unemployment and aging populations. A broader review of RNFE
content in existing Systematic Country Diagnostic for agrarian and transitioning
countries found that there was good coverage of the topic, including an analysis of
the way that different income groups participate in farm and nonfarm employment
and associated binding constraints. Yet, specific conclusions were lacking on how to
more effectively use the RNFE as a poverty reducing platform, including to inform
forthcoming country partnership frameworks. Another finding at the country level
is that there are untapped opportunities to use partners to pursue a more integrated
approach.

Critical to guiding integrated country approaches to the RNFE is the application of
more consistent diagnostics of the rural private sector. The World Bank has been a
leader in researching the RNFE and its relationship to poverty. Yet a gap exists on
the diagnostic and analytics side that has been addressed occasionally but not


                                                                                      61

systematically. Pilot initiatives, financed by trust funds, have not been
institutionalized. Where country-level diagnostics have been conducted, they have
valuably informed strategies and programming.

Several enabling factors influence the participation of the poor in the RNFE. Rural
connectivity has been enhanced in transitioning countries that have strategically
used both transport and agriculture finance, but this has not occurred in agrarian
economies. Rural roads projects in a third of all cases aimed to link the poor to
economic opportunities but did not track this. Dialogue is lacking between the
Agriculture and Education GPs on how best to deliver market-relevant skills to rural
areas and there is a paucity of evidence on the effectiveness of skills training
components in value chain projects. Several innovations in the area of rural
education service delivery could be studied, tested elsewhere, and strategically
applied. IEG’s evaluation Financial Inclusion: A Foothold on the Ladder toward
Prosperity. found that the World Bank has extended a level of financial services to
the poorest segments of rural societies, but subsidization raises questions about
sustainability, crowding out, and politicization. IFC investments reach countries
with high exclusion rates—which often have substantial rural poverty—but only a
fraction cater to the lower end of the retail segments, which are more difficult and
expensive to reach and maintain.


Recommendations
Recommendation 1: At the corporate level, the World Bank and IFC should clarify
their approach to the RNFE, and as part of it, how the World Bank Group engages
across its institutions, GPs, and partnerships to promote nonfarm economic
development to reduce poverty in the rural space. As part of this approach, options
should be differentiated by the level of structural transformation and guided by
portfolio lessons.

Recommendation 2: To bridge the identified gap, the World Bank and IFC should
more flexibly and relevantly select and design projects in a manner tailored to the
specific stage and nature of a country or area’s structural transformation and
adapted to the needs and dynamics of the target rural population. To encourage
this, the World Bank Group should increase the pooling of knowledge and cross-
fertilization across GPs, regions, and units to build on and adapt ongoing
approaches and to develop new ones.

Recommendation 3: The World Bank Group should work to close knowledge
gaps about what works to reduce rural poverty within the RNFE. The World Bank

                                                           COUNTRY STRATEGY ANALYTICS AND ENABLERS
should conduct evaluations (either systematically, through a representative sample,
or through clusters) of poverty and growth-oriented projects to learn more about
mechanisms by which they influence the development of the RNFE and its impact
on poverty

Recommendation 4: IFC should include in its value chain analysis, and
monitoring and evaluation, a consideration of poverty and gender impacts,
including income and employment for the rural poor; either systematically, or on
a sample or cluster basis including through a strategic use of its external
evaluations. In its value chain projects, IFC should more explicitly articulate the
risks of market power and their mitigants in its project documentation.

Recommendation 5: In countries where the rural economy is a key part of the
solution to ending poverty, the World Bank Group should (in partnership with
donors and client countries) collect information on both formal and informal rural
enterprises and their constraints and performance to help better inform the
Systematic Country Diagnostic. RNFE diagnostics should include information for
household-based enterprises as well as micro, small, and medium enterprises. Local
capacity building and ownership is a critical part of this. This could be achieved by
extending existing enterprise surveys to strengthen coverage of secondary cities and
to include smaller enterprises in countries where existing surveys are limited in their
coverage. This could be complemented by household surveys building on the
experience of the LSMS-ISA on Agriculture to document entrepreneurial and work
experience in rural enterprises.

Recommendation 6: The World Bank Group should strengthen and deepen
gender analysis during project preparation of rural nonfarm projects and more
consistently use the results of this analysis, to address gender-related binding
constraints to female labor force participation in the RNFE. Project design should
incorporate measures to address these constraints, and select indicators to track
progress made toward gender-related economic outcomes.

Appendix H. Methodology
Theory of Change
The rural poor are often engaged in “last resort” nonfarm activities that are not
associated with high levels of labor productivity, whereas the nonpoor are engaged
in nonfarm activities with higher levels of labor productivity. Significant correlates
of these high-productivity occupations include human capital (education and skills),
physical capital (roads, power, and electricity), and access to finance social capital.
There are also large gender disparities in the rural nonfarm labor market. Targeted
development assistance, designed to strengthen the human, physical, financial, and
social capital of the poor, can increase the likelihood that the poor can gain access to
a wider variety or opportunities in the rural nonfarm economy (RNFE), including
more productive opportunities or an expanded, more diversified set of activities that
can help households to sustainably increase their overall standard of living. To
achieve these gains, rural nonfarm enterprises and services must be sustainable and
competitive which, in turn, requires investments that integrate the different parts of
the rural economy. Public sector investment in basic services plays an important role
in providing the enabling environment for these enterprises to grow and remain
profitable. Private sector development assistance can help identify gaps and to
reduce risk to incentivize scalable investment.

In the absence of an existing framework within the World Bank Group, IEG deduced
a logical framework describing the World Bank Group’s RNFE engagement
(figure H.1). The framework links a diagnostic understanding of opportunities and
constraints in the RNFE to a set of World Bank Group interventions designed to
address them. Clearly, the completeness and efficacy with which the World Bank
Group carries out different steps varies dramatically, and the evaluation shows
where there is work to be done or paths to be changed. The way forward for a given
economy depends on the initial country conditions and context, including the state
of structural transformation (that is, which of the three world’s one is in). The tools
for intervention range from strategic, analytic, and advisory work to work on broad
enabling conditions to specific investments. Figure H.1 also emphasizes the binary
nature of the portfolio, divided in major approaches between those focused on
poverty and those focused on growth. Furthermore, a dynamic theory of change
would allow for relevance, efficiency, and effectiveness to improve with learning
from each round of experience. Such learning and course correction would depend
on sufficient information being generated on interventions and their outcomes and

Key Evaluative Questions
The overarching question of this thematic evaluation is, “How successfully has the
World Bank Group contributed to the creation of sustainable income-generating
opportunities for the rural poor within the RNFE and what attributable effects have
World Bank Group efforts had on reducing poverty? To answer this question, the
relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability of the World Bank Group
interventions at all levels—strategy, project, portfolio, program, country, and
aggregate—were assessed. Table A.1 shows the set of questions to be explored as
well as the sources, methods, and expected constraints of the analysis.

Country-Level Analysis: Assessing the Direct and Enabling Support of the World
Bank Group and Partnership Efforts

The breadth of the World Bank Group portfolio selection for country case studies
was guided by an assessment of the specific country conditions, with regard to the
stage of development of both the country and areas of the country that may be
lagging.


                                                                                                                         211

Contribution analysis. A central challenge in evaluating the World Bank Group’s
effectiveness in promoting the development of the RNFE is that the World Bank
Group is never the only cause of observed outcomes and impacts. Instead, activities
contribute to observed outcomes that are also influenced by local and global
policies, events, and activities, both positive and negative. At the country level,
country case studies used contribution analysis (the plausible association of
interventions or programs to observed outcomes) while accounting for the various
other factors that may have positively or negatively influenced the contributions.
Such analysis was used to understand how World Bank Group has partnered with
other actors and institutions (including domestic institutions in the public and
private sectors and other donors), leveraged its investments, and created synergies
within the international aid community to help develop an inclusive RNFE with the
aim of reducing poverty.

The approach paper for this evaluation laid out a theory of change that has guided
the different levels of inquiry within the macroevaluation. Country case studies
tested this proposed theory against each country’s unique strategy and portfolio
assessments in addition to weighing in on the theory’s applicability across different
country and regional characteristics. Country cases to assess multiple theories—
nuanced to fit particular historical, political, social, and cultural circumstances—are
needed to guide World Bank Group support for poverty reduction as part of a
countries’ rural transformation.

Country Case Selection and Methodology

As stated in the guidance note “The Use of Country Case Studies in IEG Macro-
Evaluations,” country case studies can provide more contextually specific evidence
on factors of success and failure—a richer, more “textured” sense of how things
work in practice—by assessing a number of activities and circumstances operating
in tandem over time. Country case studies provide important details on patterns
within countries and across similar or contrasting country typologies. Case study
selection traditionally reflects a range of regions or income categories of countries,
but it can be strategically aligned with the initial understanding of the key
conditions influencing country strategy and outcomes in the focal area of the
evaluation. A multiple-country case study design can enable richer and more robust
learning if countries can be differentiated by a set of parameters relevant to the
anticipated effective development impact. These parameters are not only
characteristics of the countries but also determine how to respond to World Bank
Group interventions and should allow readers to draw lessons as a function of these
parameters.

This evaluation conducted 10 country case studies (including 9 field assessments).
Country selection was guided by a stratification of countries along the different
stages of agrarian transformation, as identified by countries’ current position the
“three worlds” (figure A.2) used by the World Development Report 2008. This
allowed the evaluation to draw on comparative cases. Data on labor movement and
agriculture’s contribution to gross domestic product was taken from the World
Development Indicators, among other sources. Country selection was also guided
by a stratified approach across the World Bank Group’s regions, weighted with
regard to the number of countries in each region and the variety of RNFE
interventions, including across World Bank Group institutions—a factor considered
to support the analysis of World Bank Group coordination, synergy, and
sequencing.

Core and Enabling Portfolio Identification

The World Bank has a larger role in generating rural nonfarm income-g
opportunities than has been identified by its sector and thematic codes. The RNFE is
not a sector but a prominent theme in the World Bank’s agriculture action plan. As
articulated in that plan, the development of the RNFE requires support across the
World Bank’s GPs. In the absence of an identified portfolio, the evaluation used the
theme code “rural nonfarm income generation,” which was applied by the World
Bank to 152 projects between 2004 and 2014. By deconstructing the activities (using
component analysis) linked to the code, the evaluation identified 529 World Bank
projects, valued at $35 billion, which have directly supported rural nonfarm income-
generating activities during the same period. A second-order screening tool

METHODOLOGY
involved examining all projects with an agriculture code approved during the
evaluation period. In parallel, the evaluation identified several areas of enabling
activities through literature review and past evaluations. Several thematic reviews of
enabling activities were conducted by identifying “rural” activities across three key
areas: rural transport infrastructure, education and skills, and access to finance.

Enabling Activity Identification Methodology

Based on the portfolio methodology used in IEG’s evaluation, Improving Institutional
Capability and Financial Viability to Sustain Transport (2012) IEG filtered and identified
projects approved between 2004 and 2014 that were within the Transport sector
board, were rural themed, and that had a “Rural and Inter-Urban Roads and
Highways” code or a “Roads and Highways” code (n = 162). It then filtered and
identified projects within the Agricultural and Rural Development sector board that
included a “Rural,” an “Inter-Urban Roads and Highways” (TI), or a “Roads and
Highways” (TA) sector code (n = 70).

Projects identified from the Transport sector board and the Agricultural and Rural
Development sector board constituted a portfolio of 232 projects, of which 139 were
closed at the time of this evaluation. IEG reviewed project appraisal documents
(PADs) of all 232 projects along with the Implementation Completion and Results
Reports (ICRs) and ICR Reviews of closed and evaluated projects in this portfolio.
Available Project Performance Assessment Reports (PPARs) for certain projects also
served as reference. Key lines of inquiry included (i) type of road; (ii) whether the
project reported on road quality; (iii) whether the roads addressed connectivity
issues (village to village, village to province, province to province, village or
province to a secondary city, and so on); (iv) links to economic or social aims; (v)
data and measurement; (vi) the existence of any complementarity of services; and
(vii) specific links to RNFE or income-generating activities.

A second screening process consisted of a thorough review of rural-themed projects
mapped to the Education sector board. IEG filtered and identified 390 projects
approved IDA/IBRD financing between 2004 and 2014 within the Education sector
board. Of these 390 projects, 42 projects were rural theme coded. IEG reviewed their
PADs, ICRs, and ICR Reviews, with a focus on innovative solutions to education
delivery in rural space. IEG further screened all projects in the Agriculture and Rural
Development sector board, examined the delivered skills and training activities, and
assessed the indicators reported in the result framework analyses in the ICRs to see
the causal links between the interventions and achieved outcomes.

From 6,347 International Finance Corporation (IFC) projects approved during the
evaluation period, IEG identified 1,481 projects in sectors contributing to the RNFE
based on commitments made in the World Bank Group agriculture action plan and
the IFC agricultural strategy action plans. IEG then reviewed all the 1,481 projects
and identified 612 that directly contributed to generating income opportunities in
the RNFE (see figure A.3).

Approaches to the RNFE and Three Worlds Analysis

Selected approaches were identified by IEG to categorize the World Bank project
intervention types based on component and sector analysis. IEG identified 14
approaches to project design (see figure A.4.).Then, the approach analysis was
combined with a three world’s analysis. The three world’s variable (agrarian,
transition, urbanized) was created by categorizing each country’s economy based on
the share of employment in agriculture over total employment. As a result, some
countries switch across time from one category to the other. In the case of Brazil and
India, the three world’s categorization was decided state by state instead of being

based on the national average. Note: For IFC, IEG used primary, secondary, and

Cross-Cutting Tools: Gender Analysis

IEG conducted a gender analysis of the RNFE portfolio for World Bank and IFC (box
A.1). It consisted of a thorough review of the key operational documents of 529
projects, of which 300 were closed and evaluated A comparative analysis was
conducted across the different RNFE approaches and a time variable was used to
diagnose change over time (using the first and second half of the evaluation period).
For IFC, IEG conducted a detailed review of IFC board documents and XPSRs for
the 120 closed and evaluated projects. Keywords such as “gender,” “women,”
“female,” or “vulnerable groups” were used to identify projects that addressed or
incorporated gender-related activities at design stage. In addition to this, the closed
and evaluated projects were also assessed to determine whether the Development
Outcome Tracking System (DOTs) indicators measured and reported on women’s
engagement in economic or noneconomic activities, as well as data provided in the
XPSRs and PCRs.

Box A.1. Gender Assessment Criteria for the RNFE Portfolio

Five criteria were applied to assess gender integration and gender effects in the RNFE Portfolio:

Gender in project development objectives: Project development objectives were screened
for keywords such as “women,” “female,” or “vulnerable groups” to assess the frequency
of reference to gender in development objectives.

Sex-disaggregated indicators: The results frameworks in PADs were examined to see
whether the project included a sex-disaggregated indicator.

Consultation with both men and women: PADs were reviewed to ascertain whether they
reported that both men and women were consulted to inform the design of the project.

Upfront gender analysis: PADs were reviewed to determine whether an overall gender
diagnosis was conducted to understand the relationships between men and women; their
roles; their access to services, markets, or assets; and limitations and opportunities to
address these aspects.

For closed projects that incorporated sex related indicators at design, results reporting
was assessed: Results reported was assessed to determine the related benefits reported to
have been accrued by women and men. Attention was paid to the results chain with
regard to reporting on social and economic outcomes, including process related ones
