                              Summary
                              For almost a decade now, the Forest Carbon
                              Partnership Facility (FCPF) has been supporting
                              efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation
                              and forest degradation (REDD+), in the global fight
                              against climate change. A key component of this
                              work has been to ensure the full and effective
                              participation of indigenous peoples (IPs) and civil
                              society organizations (CSOs) in REDD+ activities.
                              One of the most successful FCPF initiatives on this
                              front has been its Capacity Building Program for
                              Forest-Dependent Indigenous Peoples and Southern
                              Civil Society Organizations.


                              Since 2009, the Capacity Building Program (CBP) has helped dozens
                              of projects engage with local communities across Africa, Asia
                              Pacific and Latin America and the Caribbean. The aim has been
                              to provide forest-dependent IPs, other forest dwellers (OFDs) and
                              southern civil society organizations with information, knowledge
                              and awareness to enhance their understanding of REDD+, and
                              by extension their ability to engage more meaningfully in the
                              implementation of REDD+ readiness activities.

                              With $1.9 million in funding for 27 projects, Phase 1 of the CBP
                              wrapped up in June 2016. The second phase began in July 2016
                              and will end June 30, 2018. This report presents the results of
                              activities implemented under the first phase of the CBP, which
                              supported seven projects in Africa, six in Asia Pacific and 14 in Latin
                              America and the Caribbean. Based on reports from participating
                              organizations of the CBP, this report highlights key examples that
                              illustrate how the Program’s objectives were met.

                                                   Innovative CBP projects helped to enhance the understanding of climate change and REDD+
                                                   among forest-dependent IPs, OFDs, and southern CSOs, and improve their participation
                                                   in the preparation of REDD+ strategies, and in the implementation of REDD+ programs.
                                                   CBP projects also sought to enhance the participation of IPs and local communities in
                                                   international discussions on the role of REDD+ in climate change mitigation. This work
                                                   brought about a greater awareness and understanding of the views of forest-dependent IPs,
                                                   OFDs and southern CSOs related to REDD+ and the FCPF.

                                                   Based on these results, this report makes several recommendations intended to inform
                                                   and shape projects continuing under Phase 2 of the CBP, including:

Activities involved undertaking a process for free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) at
the level of the targeted communities, and the signature of a collaboration agreement
between OJEWP and traditional authorities of the collective lands. The activities built
the capacity for carbon measurement and the production of participatory maps, and
were developed in close collaboration with IP traditional authorities at various levels,
including Embera and Wounaan experts and technicians. The results of this work were
ultimately written up in a peer-reviewed article that appeared in the February 2017
edition of Ecosphere, an open-access journal of the Ecological Society of America.

Endorsing a ‘Training of Trainers’ Methodology Steered by Community Level Facilitators

• Various activities included components of capacity building aimed at preparing
trainers from indigenous or rural communities to lead subsequent training activities
themselves. An example of this type of approach was implemented by the Dalit Alliance
for Natural Resources (DANAR) of Nepal from 2013 to 2014. DANAR undertook a
REDD+ capacity building program targeting the Dalit people (who serve as a prime
example of non-indigenous forest dwellers in South Asia), IPs, women, and youth
from different organizations at the sub-national and community levels. The ‘training
of trainers’ program coached 250 REDD+ community-level facilitators who, in turn,
launched a local awareness campaign on REDD+ and climate change issues.

Engaging IPs in the Discussion of National-Level REDD+ Readiness

• From January 2012 to July 2014, the Nepal Federation of Indigenous Nationalities (NEFIN)
implemented activities to strengthen capacities on a variety of REDD+ themes identified
as crucial by several IP communities in Nepal. NEFIN adopted a two-tiered implementation
approach, developing capacity building and awareness raising at the national (Kathmandu)
and local levels (six districts: Khotang, Sindhupalchok, Sankhuwashabha, Dolakha, Dhading,
and Rolpa). By addressing the lack of meaningful participation by IPs in policy dialogues
and formulations, the ultimate aim was to boost the participation of indigenous and rural
communities dwelling in the Tarai Hill and mountain areas of Nepal in REDD+ readiness
consultation and decision-making processes. These activities included preparing and holding
a consultation meeting between IPs and the Social and Environmental Strategic Assessment
consultants’ team to present indigenous views on readiness issues. Activities also supported
the preparation of feedback from resource persons and indigenous leaders on the main outputs
of the national-level readiness process, including REDD+ social and environmental standards,
REDD+ strategy, and measurement, reporting and verification (MRV).

• From March to December 2013, the civil society organizations grouped in the REDD+
and Climate Change Platform of Cameroon implemented activities aimed at organizing and
mobilizing civil society organizations from 30 sub-districts of Cameroon to enhance full, direct
and effective participation of indigenous and local communities in the readiness process.
The focus areas involved monitoring and reporting on REDD+ actions including dynamics on
deforestation and forest degradation, sustainable forest management, conservation of forest
and biodiversity, enhanced forest carbon stock, and social, environmental, and governance-
related issues. These groups supported activities aimed to anchor REDD+ readiness in an
inclusive and participatory process. The activities allowed the REDD+ and Climate Change
Platform to reach communities at the local level by supporting the establishment of community
coordination structures and engaging in parallel capacity building activities. Such structures
would, at the same time, act as focal points at the community level for REDD+ and Climate
Change related initiatives. Some of the main activities included:

     A. Bringing together 331 civil society organizations engaged in REDD+ and climate change
     activities in Cameroon (IPs organizations, women’s organizations, youth organizations,
     among others).

     B. Setting up community coordination structures in 10 Cameroon regions, composed of 80
     female and male coordinators.

     C. Organizing 30 workshops in 30 sub-districts heads during which the civil society
     organization and REDD+ and climate change Platform Council representatives were
     designated. The workshop themes tackled included, among others: (i) general information
     on the REDD+ and Climate Change Platform, information, communication, and awareness
     on the Cameroon’s REDD+ process; (ii) free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) (iii) social
     and environmental standards; role of civil society organizations and the REDD+ Platform
     Council; and (iv) gender and climate change; and designation processes of Council
     Coordinators representatives to the REDD+ Platform Council. The analysis of social and
     environmental issues included the Participatory Methodology of Pygmies Indigenous
     Populations (Méthode d’Approche Participative des Populations Pygmées,).

                               (FIP). The results provided some conclusions on the state of
                               governance of REDD+ in Peru and generated recommendations
                               to improve the relevant processes. It also identified some issues
                               that would require more attention during the next REDD+ phases.
                               The participants recognized the existence of participation norms

	•	Ensuring active participation of forest-dependent
IPs, OFDs, and CSOs. Engagement with communities should ensure
a two-way dialogue that allows for feedback from communities and
demonstrates how that feedback has been taken into account. When
a series of meetings is planned, the same participants may need
to be available to ensure continuity and active engagement. The
content and results of the meetings should be clearly communicated
in advance to avoid misinformation and unrealistic expectations, and
to ensure that trust is maintained.


	•	Clear link to national-level readiness processes. In
REDD+ countries where capacities are weak and the engagement
of indigenous peoples, OFDs, and civil society is negligible, there
is value to sponsoring activities that aim to deliver straightforward
capacity building, and information sharing. Activities that attract
support should be those that have helped directly to overcome some
kind of challenge or bottleneck in the national-level REDD+ readiness
process.


	•	Putting special emphasis on the issues of land
tenure and livelihoods. Capacity building activities and regional

tenure in the context of REDD+.


	•	Recording and publishing results. Records of training
sessions and workshops (whether sub-national, national or regional)
should be prepared and publicly disclosed in a culturally-appropriate
way, including in local languages. Reports should clearly document
how views gathered have been taken into account during REDD+
readiness processes. This data should be gender disaggregated
where possible.


The key lessons learned and recommendations from this first phase
of the program will be integrated into the work going forward. At
a time when the FCPF’s Carbon Fund is supporting large scale
emissions reduction programs in an increasing number of countries,
it’s more important than ever to have indigenous peoples and civil
society involved, and the FCPF CBP continues to help make that
happen.                                                                           Charlotte Kesl /World Bank
