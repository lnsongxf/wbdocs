This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at t he bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name

        In the past, developers were allowed a blanket insurance policy
        that did not require purchase of insurance for every new project.
        In 2007, the Institute’s policies were revised; it now allows a
        blanket insurance that the developer adjusts, paying the

      differences annually. But the complexity of the process
      discourages its use. Most construction companies purchase
      individual insurance on a case-by-case basis for projects instead
      of globally for annual activities. This system is likely to be
      changed because of private sector complaints.

      Insurance premiums are based on the amount of coverage. The
      cost can range from 4.23% to 5.53% of the coverage amount.
      The completed form must be presented with copies of the

      the Colegio de Ingenieros Electricistas, Mecánicos e Industriales (CFIA). In
      that case, the designs are presented to CNFL for approval. Until they are
      approved and the Engineering Study is issued, no works can be done.

      Hire private company to carry out works in accordance with CNFL's
      plans

      The external connection works have to be done by a firm that has been
      authorized by CNFL to do medium voltage network construction work.
      There are 21 firms with such authorization in the capital city. Once the
      supply contract between the client and the authorized provider has been
      signed, it is filed with CNFL. It takes approximately 3 days to start the
      works and, once supervised, the construction can start. The construction
      cannot start if no initiation date has been determined by the CNFL.

      The internal wiring installation can be done by any electrician hired by
      the client, but it has to be supervised by the engineer responsible for the
      design of the electric installation. CNFL does not conduct any inspections
4     of the internal wiring. The internal wiring installation requires previous   26 calendar days     USD 17,500
      plans approved by an electric engineer authorized by Colegio de
      Ingenieros Electricistas, Mecánicos e Industriales (CFIA) and the works
      have to be supervised by the CFIA or by another electric engineer. No
      certificate of compliance with NEC rules is emitted nor can it be
      requested. The plans approved by CFIA will have to be filed with the
      CNFL by the time the meter installation is requested. Three transformers
      of 50 kVA have to be installed inside the client's private property. The
      client has to pay for them. They can be installed in a post inside the
      private property (it's not allowed to install them in public places) or in a
      transformers vault.

        Receive meter installation and final connection from CNFL

        The client has to request the meter. A donation document for the
        transformers (transferring ownership to the utility) is prepared and
        confirmed that no money is owed by the client. The payments that the
        customer has to make to CNFL have to be done in the Section of Electric
        Networks Design. The payment receipt has to be shown later in the
        office of Engineering Study to be able to go to this step (the Engineering
        Study).
         There is a guarantee deposit that is calculated according to the
        consumption. It represents one month consumption. The minimum
        amount of guarantee for the residential customer is ¢ 15.500, and for
        businesses the minimum amount is ¢ 25.000. This deposit is required for
        all clients requesting a new service. The deposit is refundable and after
        five years it begins to generate interests. It is reimbursed when the client
        terminates the service. The deposit covers the installation of the meter
   5    equipment with its materials. Additionally it covers the operation costs        3 calendar days   CRC 562,195.95
        and the service maintenance.
         Normally CNFL tries to both inspect the works and install the meter at
        the same time. CNFL charges between 2 and 3% of the cost of the works
        only for the reception and the powering. The responsible to pay this fee
        is the client. Therefore, this cost is normally included in the estimation of
        costs sent to the client. If the service requires power transformers or a
        specific meter, they are installed by CNFL without extra costs.
           The installation of the meter is exclusive responsibility of CNFL. The
        internal installation planes approved by the Engineers Association and
        the electrician's certification have to be sent to CNFL before the final
        powering.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

                    Costa Rica improved access to credit by adopting a new
                    secured transactions law that establishes a functional secured
                    transactions system and a modern, centralized, notice-based
DB2016              collateral registry. The law broadens the range of assets that
                    can be used as collateral, allows a general description of assets
                    granted as collateral and allows out-of-court enforcement of
                    collateral.

for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

                                      Mirage would initiate an in-court reorganization proceeding (solicitud de
                                     concurso) based on article 709 of the Civil Procedure Code. This procedure
                                     would involve the appointment of an insolvency administrator, who will be
                                   responsible for the day-to-day business of the company while an agreement is
             liquidation                                negotiated in-court with the creditors.

           reorganization)           agreement, and therefore the reorganization procedure would be converted
                                   into a liquidation procedure after the Mirage’s bankruptcy declaration is issued
                                       by the Court (Article 740 of the Code of Civil Procedure). The sale of the
                                                      secured assets will occur during this stage.


                               Insolvency proceeding of liquidation usually involved the end of business
                             operation for the company and the sale of its assets due to the lack of liquidity.
Outcome       piecemeal sale
                              Without these assets the company won’t be able to continue with its business
                                   operations (Articles 760 and following of the Civil Procedure Code)

                               A reorganization proceeding which is converted into liquidation, similar to the
                               case study, will take about three years. The preparation of the creditors’ claims,
                                 the appointment of the insolvency professionals, and the negotiation with
                                 creditors during the reorganization stage will last approximately 1.5 years.
                                   After this, assuming that there won’t be an agreement with BizBank, the
                                  liquidation proceeding will start in accordance with Article 709 Procedure
                                  Code. During this stage, the necessary steps towards a judicial sale of the

                                                proceeding would last about 1.5 additional years.

                                     This time estimate takes into account a decrease in time to settle in-court
                                      disputes in Costa Rica after the creation and full implementation of the

To make the data comparable across economies, several
assumptions about the worker and the business are
used.

The worker:
       Is a cashier in a supermarket or grocery store,
        age 19, with one year of work experience.
       Is a full-time employee.
       Is not a member of the labor union, unless
        membership is mandatory.
The business:
       Is a limited liability company (or the equivalent
        in the economy).
       Operates a supermarket or grocery store in the
        economy’s largest business city. For 11
        economies the data are also collected for the
        second largest business city.

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in

economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
