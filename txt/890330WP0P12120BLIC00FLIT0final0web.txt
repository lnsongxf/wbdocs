Foreword


I   n the past 10 years, the global community has come to understand that
    all citizens must be equipped with the ability to negotiate an increasingly
complex world of personal and business finance. The growth of markets
for insurance and risk, the expansion of banking, and the increasing need
to make one’s own employment all heighten the importance of financial
literacy and capability. This is true not only for people in middle- and high-in-
come countries, but also for those in poor countries. As Daryl Collins and
her coauthors show in their groundbreaking study, Portfolios of the Poor:
How the World’s Poor Live on $2 a Day (Princeton University Press, 2009),
poor families lead astonishingly complex financial lives. They manage to keep
food on the table, children in school, and plan for the future—all on small
and unstable incomes. They maintain elaborate financial portfolios, although
with uncertain success. They save and borrow small amounts often at high
cost and low return, which inhibits their ability to grow out of poverty. The
complexity, high cost, and modest returns that characterize the financial
arrangements of poor families are a serious cause for public concern, since
unproductive assets lead to lower growth and to poverty. These concerns
have only increased since the recent global financial crisis, which reinforced
the recognition that financial capability is an essential individual life skill.
       It is generally true that individuals with better financial knowledge make
better financial decisions. This simple correlation has prompted the develop-
ment of a wide range of financial education initiatives by governments, regu-
lators, and various private and civil stakeholders, sometimes combined with
financial consumer protection measures. The results of these early efforts
were not encouraging. Prior to the work supported under the Russia Trust
Fund for Financial Literacy and Education, research had found little evidence
that improving financial capability yields better financial behavior. Moreover,
the vast majority of studies had come from developed countries in North
America and Western Europe. Would these interventions work differently
among different populations in different environments? Is the relative lack
of success of financial capacity-building interventions due to poor design or
poor implementation, or is it possible that financial education of any kind will
actually do very little for financial capability?
       Happily, this previous research, together with the literature on behav-
ioral economics and finance, offered some insights into why education alone


                                                                                      ◾  xv

              may have limited effects on improving financial behavior, and demonstrated that
              improving behavioral outcomes would require a major revision in the design of
              policies and programs for financial capability. Partly this is already happening:
              pension plans are changing default options to take advantage of inertia and the
              status quo bias, and reducing the number of options to prevent the cognitive
              overload that creates indecision. Previous experience also pointed the way to
              new avenues for research—innovative interventions and policies that might
              prove successful where previous attempts had failed, for example, employing
              tools such as social marketing to influence behavior.
                  The Russia Trust Fund for Financial Literacy and Education was set up to
              address some of these concerns, and to support the advancement of financial
              literacy and capability in low- and middle‑income countries. Established in 2008
              with funding provided by the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation, the
              Trust Fund enabled the World Bank and the Organisation for Economic Co-oper-
              ation and Development (OECD) to conduct methodological, analytical, and policy
              work on financial literacy, capability, and education. The program has supported
              work on the definition and measurement of financial capability, methods, and tools
              to understand the impact of financial capability programs; and field research on
              interventions designed to enhance financial capability. These and other resources
              may be found at http://www.finlitedu.org/.
                  This volume presents the results of pilot projects financed by the Trust Fund.
              These include some truly pioneering research into new areas for financial capacity
              building, including the use of diaries to increase financial awareness, innovative
              methods for information provision, and new ways to deliver messages that encourage
              safer financial behavior, such as feature films, TV soap operas, and comic books.
              These methods open financial literacy to a much broader audience, and with poten-
              tially greater impact, than has been achieved through more conventional means.
                  This work is the culmination of the efforts of a very large number of people,
              not only from within the World Bank and OECD, but also dozens of researchers and
              academics, implementing partners, financial service providers, and policy makers
              spanning the globe from Latin America to Africa to Asia. The dedication of these
              diverse stakeholders to sharing information, testing new ideas, and learning from
              experience is already helping us realize our goal of greater financial security for all.
                  Above all, this work would not have been possible without the vision and guid-
              ance of Robert Holzmann and Richard Hinz. Robert was the originator and architect
              of the Russia Trust Fund program, and Richard managed the program following
              Robert’s retirement from the Bank. Their strong leadership made it possible to
              undertake the innovative research presented in this volume and in the many other
              books and research reports produced under the aegis of the Russia Trust Fund.

T   his is the final volume to come from a multiyear, multi-institution project,
    and it owes an enormous debt of gratitude to the more than 100 people
who generously gave their time, effort, and creativity to making this such
a success. Above all, we want to thank the staff of the Ministry of Finance
of the Russian Federation who brought the theme of financial literacy to
the agenda of the Russia G8 Presidency, and who charged the World Bank–
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) team
with producing this body of knowledge. Special thanks are due to the Vice
Minister of Finance, Sergey Storchak, who initiated the enterprise; and to
Andrey Bokarev, Director of the Department of International Relations within
the Ministry of Finance, who provided guidance throughout the process.
Others in the ministry who deserve recognition include Anna Valkova, Elena
Ilina, and Anna Zelentsova. We must also acknowledge the critical role played
by our World Bank colleague Andrei Markov as interlocutor and facilitator
throughout the project.
    The effort was launched with the intellectual contributions of partici-
pants at a November 2009 workshop in Washington, D.C. We would like to
thank the participants and contributors at this and subsequent conferences
in Cape Town, Montevideo, Paris, Washington, Saint Petersburg, Nairobi, and
New Delhi, who challenged and validated the methods and results presented
by the extended Trust Fund team. Some of the participants at these confer-
ences contributed in other ways as well, providing guidance and helping
shape the research. These include Gerrit Antonides, Sharon Collard, Billy
Jack, Olga Kuzina, Annamaria Lusardi, Lew Mandell, Christian Poppe, Robert
Walker, Alina Wyatt, and especially Elaine Kempson, our lead external advisor.
From the International Network on Financial Education, we would like to
acknowledge Diana Crossan, Jason Fichtner, Sue Lewis, and José Alexandre
Cavalcanti Vasco. The staff of the RAND Corporation, which developed the
Toolkit of Evaluation Methods—in particular, Angela Hung, Arie Kapteyn, and
Joanne Yoong—made a significant contribution to the overall effort. Last but
not least, we would like to thank our OECD colleagues and co-managers of
the Trust Fund program, particularly Adele Atkinson, Andre Laboul, and Flore-
Anne Messy, for the collaboration and intellectual stimulation they provided
throughout the process.

                   Most importantly, this work could not have been completed without the
              dedicated contributions of the teams represented by the papers in this volume.
              This was an outstanding example of a collective effort by the impact evaluation
              teams comprising regional World Bank staff, the staff of the Bank’s Development
              Economics Research Department, and the Social Protection and Financial Devel-
              opment Departments. These include Gunhild Berg, Miriam Bruhn, Aline Coudouel,
              Aidan Coville, Xavier Giné, Mary Hallward-Driemeier, Martin Kanz, Leora Klapper,
              Arianna Legovini, Vincenzo Di Maro, Rogelio Marchetti, David McKenzie, Margaret
              Miller, Douglas Pearce, Leopold Sarr, Peer Stein, and Bilal Zia. A small part of their
              contributions can be found in this volume and in the other publications available
              on the program’s web site (http://www.finlitedu.org/); but our gratitude extends
              far beyond the tangible outputs listed there.
                   Finally, we would like to acknowledge the heroic efforts of the team respon-
              sible for the administration of the Trust Fund in Washington. Above all, this includes
              Robert Holzmann and Richard Hinz, who created and managed the Trust Fund for
              most of its life. In addition, we are enormously grateful to Arup Banerji, Anush
              Bezhanyan, Nita Congress, Raiden Dillard, Inas Ellaham, Anya Maria Mayans,
              Amira Nikolas, Valeria Perotti, Laura Rawlings, Kinnon Scott, and Sophie Warlop
              for their input, support, patience, and guidance throughout the project. Without
              them, this report would not exist.

0.1	      BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION
Among the main lessons of the 2008 global financial crisis were the low level
of financial literacy of populations around the world, and the links between
financial capability and financial well-being. Klapper, Lusardi, and Panos (2013)
found that individuals with greater financial capability were significantly less
likely to report a negative income shock during 2009. Since then, governments
and policy makers in both developed and developing countries increased the
attention and resources dedicated to financial literacy programs as a way to
empower consumers in their interactions with financial markets. Many coun-
tries even developed national strategies for financial literacy and education,
putting the topic high on the respective government’s agenda (Grifoni and
Messy 2012). However, despite growing interest and investment in the topic,
the empirical evidence and understanding of what drives consumer financial
behavior has been limited. Policy makers have had no clear guidance on what
types of programs needed to be scaled-up to achieve results. In other words,
while there was general understanding that many people lacked knowledge
and skills about personal finance, there was no conclusive evidence on the
link between financial literacy interventions and improved consumer deci-
sion making.
    The field had an initial narrow focus on financial literacy defined mainly
in terms of knowledge and numeracy, as opposed to a broader definition that
includes the manifestation of this knowledge in skills, attitudes, and behavior.
The overly narrow definition led policy makers and researchers to ignore
more innovative interventions and to focus on school-based programs. Under
researched were interventions that utilize social marketing, technology, and
media; and interventions that employ behavioral treatments and multi-armed

              approaches. Moreover, there was rather little investment in monitoring and eval-
              uation (M&E) to inform a rigorous understanding of the real impact of these
              programs in the field. As of 2010, few financial education interventions had
              undergone rigorous impact evaluation. A realistic figure would put the share of
              rigorously monitored and evaluated interventions in the developed world below
              1 percent—and in the developing world, close to zero.
                  Furthermore, the few evaluations that did exist suffered a range of shortcom-
              ings, including the following:

                  ◾◾ A lack of understanding among program providers of the importance of
                    rigorous M&E for the design, implementation, and improvement of inter-
                    ventions
                  ◾◾ A lack of standard and relevant methods for M&E that go beyond generic
                    instructions on research methodology and address the concepts and
                    issues within a financial capability framework
                  ◾◾ The perceived high budgetary costs of rigorous M&E for new interventions
                  ◾◾ The public good nature of rigorous M&E, which produces knowledge that
                    can be consumed by others, but whose cost is borne by the provider of the
                    individual intervention
                  ◾◾ Resistance from program providers to an evaluation, as there is always the
                    risk that it may reveal unfavorable results and/or limited impact, conse-
                    quently threatening funding for program activities

                  Against this background, the Russia Financial Literacy and Education Trust
              Fund was established in the World Bank in October 2008. Its main objectives
              included the following:

                  ◾◾ The financing of field impact evaluations of competitively selected inter-
                    ventions across regions and income levels that explore causality between
                    financial literacy interventions and consumer financial behavior
                  ◾◾ The development of an M&E toolkit geared toward financial capability
                    interventions informed by Trust Fund–supported impact evaluations
                  ◾◾ The financing of evaluations for a set of interventions that conducted
                    comparative testing of effectiveness; i.e., comparing the effectiveness of
                    a specific intervention across countries or alternative interventions under
                    comparable settings in one country
                  ◾◾ The local capacity building in developing countries for the design and

0.2	      CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT
Earlier policy responses to help individuals make better financial decisions
predominantly focused on financial literacy, defined as knowledge and numeracy
(Lusardi and Mitchell 2006; Mandell 1997), which were driven by and led to a focus
on education programs to improve literacy levels. This was primarily motivated
by survey evidence documenting the correlation between financial literacy and
household well-being. For example, lower levels of financial literacy were found to
be negatively related with engagement in saving, credit, and investment (Hilgert,
Hogarth, and Beverly 2003), with planning for retirement (Lusardi and Mitchell
2007), borrowing at high interest rates (Stango and Zinman 2009), and with the
use of informal sources of borrowing (Klapper, Lusardi, and Panos 2012).
    However, while some financial education programs may have been effective
in improving literacy levels, evidence of their impact on actual behavior has been
inconclusive, if not exclusively bleak (Braunstein and Welch 2002; Cole and Shastry
2008; Gale, Harris, and Levine 2012; Mandell and Klein 2009). To investigate this
phenomenon and determine whether the relationship between financial educa-
tion, literacy, and desired outcomes is in fact causal, a number of scientific experi-
ments began in recent years, and even before the Russia Trust Fund program. The
results of these studies were mixed (Bertrand and Morse 2010; Cole, Sampson,
and Zia 2011). For example, Duflo and Saez (2003) conducted a randomized study
to measure the impact of a benefit fair on retirement plan enrollment, and found
small effects on take-up. Focusing on developing countries, Cole, Sampson, and
Zia (2009) conducted a randomized study in Indonesia to measure the impact of
financial education on savings; they also found no substantial impact. Similar find-
ings reporting on the limitations of financial education on behavioral outcomes
were found by Karlan and Valdivia (2011) in Peru and by McKenzie and Weber
(2009) in Uganda.
    Recent developments in the field of behavioral economics have led to
substantial changes in our understanding of financial and economic decision
making. Drawing on lessons from psychology, this field has produced a number
of experiments that help understand some of the psychological barriers that
prevent people from moving from knowledge and intentions to actions. This
literature generally maintains that, due to a number of cognitive, emotional, and
social factors, individuals often fail to make optimal decisions even in the pres-
ence of information. To list a few examples: there is evidence that people are loss
averse—that is, they attribute greater value to losses than gains (Kahneman and
Tversky 1979); have status quo preference—i.e., in the presence of many options,
they tend to avoid changing their course of action (Samuelson and Zeckhauser
4  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              1988); discount the long term in comparison to the present (Loewenstein and
              Prelec 1992); and are highly influenced by emotions and peers (Andrade and
              Ariely 2009; Kahneman, Slovic, and Tversky 1982).
                  Additional developments in decision making have come from a greater under-
              standing of financial behavior in the context of poverty. Experimental work in this
              area has found that many of these behavioral biases are even more pronounced
              among the poor (Banerjee 2000; Duflo 2006; Mullainathan and Thaler 2000). One
              key observation from this work is that poverty creates myopia, which refers to a
              focus on solving short-term problems without the ability or mental space to make
              decisions that take into account long-term implications. As a consequence, many
              decisions reached under poverty are detrimental for the future (e.g., high interest
              rate loans). In retrospect, what this literature suggests is that there is more to
              changing behavior than the traditional microeconomic model would predict.
              Simply providing individuals with financial education and access to instruments is
              insufficient, and additional or alternative behavioral treatment mechanisms might
              be necessary to improve outcomes.
                  These results from field experiments and behavioral research have led to a shift
              away from financial literacy toward a wider concept that includes “A combination
              of awareness, knowledge, skill, attitude and behavior necessary to make sound
              financial decisions and ultimately achieve individual financial wellbeing” (Atkinson
              and Messy 2012). The expansion of the definition in broad terms represents a shift
              in conceptualization and measurement from an explicit knowledge-based to an
              outcome-driven approach, focusing on the mechanisms that drive behavior. This
              approach guided the selection of the Trust Fund–supported impact evaluations.
              Yet even with this broader definition, problems in identifying effective interven-
              tions persist. In fact, a key challenge in adopting a more holistic definition is that
              the interventions become more diverse in their design and may follow different
              theories of change. As the range of interventions expands, careful thinking is
              required to develop a standard results framework and methods for evaluation that
              allow for accurate comparison of findings across projects and countries.



              0.3	      IMPLICATIONS FOR PROGRAM DESIGN AND
                        EVALUATION
              Financial literacy programs are designed to achieve outcomes through formal
              education, and assume a causal chain reaction from knowledge to skills to
              behavior. While these interventions may also include other delivery mechanisms
              to transfer education, the basic premise is that improving knowledge leads to
              desired outcomes. Financial capability programs, on the other hand, do not
              assume a particular relationship that derives in a linear fashion from education
              to behavior, and hence may either follow a noncognitive approach or combine
              financial education with other mechanisms.
                                                                                             Overview  ◾  5




        In addition to programs that employ standard classroom and workshop
models, interventions more widely encountered in recent studies include
edutainment, social marketing, personal counseling, consumer protection, and
behavioral treatments.
        Edutainment (educational entertainment) is a form of entertainment
designed to educate the audience through stories rather than explicit didactic
messages. It usually involves delivery of educational content through amusing
and emotional tales in TV films, soap operas, theater, computer-based games, and
others. Unique features of this intervention are that it can reach a wide audience,
appeal to emotions, and disseminate messages in a way that sticks to memory.
The field of public health has extensively and successfully used edutainment to
influence behavioral change in a number of areas, including nutrition, tobacco and
alcohol use, safe sex, physical exercise, and immunization. The application of this
nethod to consumer finance is still in the early stages of experimentation.
        To the authors’ knowledge, prior to the Trust Fund efforts, the only edutain-
ment program for personal finance was Makutano Junction in Kenya, a TV soap
opera funded by the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID).1 The
program, however, has never been evaluated. More recent examples that involve
evaluation include Trust Fund–financed experiments in South Africa, Nigeria, and
Kenya, where content-specific messages are integrated in a soap opera, a feature
film, and comics, respectively (discussed in section 0.6).
        Social marketing refers to the systematic application of standard commer-
cial marketing to alter preferences and influence a behavioral change. Though
similar to edutainment, social marketing is less focused on education and more on
persuasion through short messages. These include anything from print handouts
and billboards, to public service announcements linked to TV shows and films, to
celebrity endorsements, street theater, and formal in-school and in-workplace
presentations. Among many examples are initiatives involving health (anti-to-
bacco, safe sex), road safety (buckle up, wear bike helmets), the environment
(recycling, energy saving), and politics (voter participation in elections).
        In promoting responsible financial management, this mechanism is also at
its early stages of application. In a paper prepared for the Consultative Group
to Assist the Poor (CGAP), Lee and Miller (2012) reviewed 100 case studies in
which social marketing has influenced financial behavior; however, none of these
programs have been rigorously evaluated. To the authors’ knowledge, the only
intervention to date that employs social marketing coupled with a rigorous eval-
uation in the field of personal finance is the Trust Fund–financed experiment
in Kenya, which involves a national marketing campaign to promote savings
(discussed in section 0.6).

                   Personal counseling involves individualized and one-on-one training or
              assistance at a particular point in time. This method is best known from credit
              counseling designed to either avoid debt or to help individuals develop debt
              management and repayment plans. It differs from traditional financial education
              aimed at teaching more general concepts. Personal counseling is customized and
              targeted to a specific individual and topic, and is usually applied at the time when
              relevant. It may include interventions where an individual is directed to budget
              properly and develop expense plans, save for a particular goal, or establish and
              improve credit history, or to guide product selection. It is mostly useful in light of
              major life events, such as loss of job, unexpected reduction in income, domestic
              violence, etc.
                   For example, following the results of a baseline survey of financial capability,
              the United Kingdom’s Financial Services Authority (FSA) developed a pathfinder
              service offering individual information and guidance on a wide range of financial
              matters (such as budgeting, retirement planning, and choosing appropriate finan-
              cial products). This was delivered face to face, by telephone, and through an inter-
              active website, and was found to be effective (Kempson and Collard 2010). A more
              recent example includes a Trust Fund–financed experiment in India that involves a
              combination of standard classroom training with reminders sent through mobile
              phones and personal counseling through home visits (discussed in section 0.6).
                   Consumer protection refers to institutions, laws, and policies mandated by
              governments and organizations to ensure the rights of consumers, including the
              free disclosure of information. These rules are designed to protect consumers
              against predatory activities of businesses and financial service providers. Inter-
              ventions that involve consumer protection are considered a form of financial
              capability because they often involve mechanisms to direct individuals toward
              “better” decisions or provide them with information that will affect their behavior.
                   For example, in response to a survey that revealed low levels of capability for
              choosing from among a wide variety of financial products, policy makers in the
              United Kingdom developed a set of “decision trees” designed to assist consumers
              through the optimum pathway for selecting the appropriate products.2 A more
              recent example is a Trust Fund–financed experiment in Mexico that tests the
              impact of a program that modified product-specific disclosure statements about
              interest rates and other loan characteristics to help consumers better understand
              their choices (discussed in section 0.6).
                   Behavioral treatments are motivated by recent developments in psychology
              and behavioral economics. These are interventions that either help people over-
              come or harness behavioral biases. The most well-known interventions in this
              category are those involving “nudging,” which refers to programs designed to

push people toward better decisions by altering the choices they face (Thaler
and Sunstein 2008). This may take the form of a choice architecture, sending
reminders, providing incentives, or a combination of these, most commonly by
changing default options for retirement or savings plan enrollments, which take
advantage of the common inertia that people exhibit when confronted by finan-
cial decisions.
    Other types of behavioral interventions that have received attention lately
include programs that aim at influencing actions through “learning by doing,”
peer pressure, and social networks. The premise behind learning by doing is that
once individuals become users of formal financial systems, their interactions with
banking may provide the basis for learning and skills development. The assump-
tion behind programs that explore social networks is that both learning and deci-
sions may be spread from certain participants who receive a treatment to others
who do not but who are in contact or proximity with the treated individuals. More
recent examples include Trust Fund–financed experiments in Kenya, Uganda, and
Malawi, where researchers are investigating, respectively, the impact of learning
by doing through participation in automated savings accounts, social networks
on transferring practices, and activating mental accounting to improve savings
(discussed in section 0.6).
    Financial capability programs may come in different forms and follow
different theories of change. Understanding the differences among interventions
is important for proper evaluation and accurate interpretation of results. For evalu-
ation, having a clear understanding of the program’s objectives and its conceptual
framework is critical to developing a proper hypothesis, mapping variables along
the causal chain, and identifying indicators from inputs to outputs and outcomes.



0.4	      PAUCITY OF THE EXISTING EVIDENCE BASE
Prior to the Trust Fund, there was little rigorous empirical research designed to
identify the impact of financial capability interventions. While there was some
research on these issues, earlier studies can generally be characterized by a lack
of rigor. A comprehensive review of financial capability initiatives commissioned
by the FSA in 2008 concluded that “not only has there been relatively little work in
the past on financial capability in the United Kingdom or other countries, but also
that rigorous, credible policy evaluation showing the incremental impact of finan-
cial capability work is difficult to find” (Atkinson 2008). This was later confirmed
by another stocktaking exercise conducted by the Organization for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 2009, the conclusions of which were
presented at the 2009 OECD/International Network on Financial Education (INFE)
Conference in Brazil.
    In 2010, the World Bank and the RAND Corporation undertook another stock-
taking exercise under the Trust Fund program, built on the previous reviews by the
8  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              FSA and the OECD and aimed at capturing more recent studies. The review also
              aimed to expand the scope of the reviewed evaluations to account for alternative
              and broader financial capability interventions. The results confirmed the paucity
              of evaluations around financial capability programs in general and revealed the
              following:

                  ◾◾ Most of the evaluations lacked rigor and did not address the key princi-
                    ples of good evaluations related to internal and external validity, such as
                    confounding factors, selection bias, spillover effects, contamination, and
                    heterogeneity.
                  ◾◾ From the ones rigorously conducted, the majority applied experimental
                    methods, which are effective in determining cause and effect, but may fall
                    short in explaining how and why impacts were (or were not) observed and
                    may have uncertain external validity.
                  ◾◾ The majority of the evaluations lacked information about the intervention.
                    They also lacked details about the impact measures (most reported that
                    there was no change in financial literacy) or even the use of inappropriate
                    measures given the nature of the interventions.
                  ◾◾ Linked to the above points, the majority reached sweeping conclusions,
                    such as that financial education has no impact on financial literacy/capa-
                    bility. A closer look at these studies, however, reveals that their results
                    apply to that particular intervention, delivered in a specific way, to a partic-
                    ular audience, at a specific time, and by a particular agency; they do not
                    necessarily generate lessons that apply to other interventions and circum-
                    stances.
                  ◾◾ There was an overemphasis on measuring changes in knowledge, as
                    opposed to other outcomes, such as changes in attitudes, behavior, etc.
                  ◾◾ Most of the programs evaluated were workshop based.

                  The lack of evidence is common to many areas of public policy. Evaluation is
              undersupplied in large part because it is considered a public good and faces the
              classical free-rider problem. It creates knowledge that can benefit the public, but
              the costs are usually incurred by the provider. Even when mandated, however,
              evaluation may not be welcomed, because it is perceived to be costly and
              technically challenging, and can pose reputational risks. Considering that most
              programs, especially in developing countries, face budget constraints, diverting
              resources to research is a difficult decision for managers. Further, a well-de-
              signed evaluation is also challenging to implement. To be able to answer both
              the “what” and the “why,” evaluation often needs to employ a combination of
              quantitative, process, and theory-based approaches, and follow a well-defined

politically controversial, especially if it reveals that a program has not achieved
its intended impact.
     Lastly, as with any field in its infancy, there are a number of narrowly defined
research questions that need to be addressed. These questions often determine
program characteristics that are required to permit proper testing. Therefore,
in addition to evaluating existing programs, it is often important to work with
program developers to design innovative interventions in the understudied areas.



0.5	       SELECTED APPROACH: COMPETITIVELY SELECTED
           FIELD EVALUATIONS
The discussion in the previous sections highlights that the field of financial capa-
bility is relatively new and characterized by limited empirical evidence. Estab-
lished to tackle essential gaps in research, the Trust Fund evaluation program
developed three parallel initiatives:

     ◾◾ Funding of a number of individual and cross-country field evaluations that
       allow experimentation with different program designs and research tech-
       niques
     ◾◾ Development of a methodological and operational toolkit for M&E of finan-
       cial capability programs in low- and middle-income countries
     ◾◾ Capacity building for design and implementation of rigorous evaluations
       in client countries through a series of clinical evaluation workshops3

     To better understand the state of knowledge of program effectiveness, and
to identify gaps in literature to guide the funding of evaluations, the Trust Fund
undertook a stocktaking exercise in the early stages of program development
(briefly mentioned earlier in the chapter). This review was led by the World Bank
in collaboration with the RAND Corporation and other experts in the field. While
other reviews of financial capability programs had been conducted in the past,
they were limited in terms of the information provided about the reviewed evalu-
ations. The Trust Fund team focused on gathering information related to program
characteristics and performance, as well as the rigor of the evaluations.
     Based on a carefully selected sample of 129 evaluations, a number of
under-researched areas were identified. First, in terms of thematic coverage,
budgeting and saving were found to be covered most widely. Other topics that
are highly relevant were found to be underrepresented, such as financial capa-
bility related to credit, loans, investments, and the usage of insurance products.

              Second, the majority of the evaluations were found to focus on the delivery of
              education through workshops and seminars, followed by classroom and coun-
              seling. Alternative means of delivery, such as the use of media, marketing, behav-
              ioral treatments, or even mixed interventions, were found to be understudied.
              Third, the majority of evaluations either used process or randomized controlled
              trials. Very few employed mixed methods or examined spillover effects.
                  The review also revealed a gap in studies that compare the impact of inter-
              ventions across countries, contexts, and populations. Lastly, a large number of
              choice architecture interventions appeared to be under way, particularly in the
              field of commitment devices. However, studies appeared to treat behavioral
              economics methods as a distinct alternative to financial capability training, rather
              than adopting behavioral economics insights to improving financial capability.
                  This exercise helped the Trust Fund establish priority areas to guide invita-
              tions of proposals and selection of evaluations (table 0.1).

0.6	       FILLING THE GAPS THROUGH FIELD EVALUATIONS
The 17 field evaluations financed by the Trust Fund (16 of which are discussed in
this book, as the results from the remaining study were not yet available at time
of press) represent a highly coordinated approach across themes and countries
and involve a large number of clients and technical experts. All evaluations aimed
at addressing critical gaps in research by contributing both methodologically and
conceptually. This section provides a brief description of the individual designs
and their methodological characteristics. It discusses them in three broad cate-
gories: traditional financial education through schools and workshops, nontra-
ditional education through entertainment media and marketing, and financial
education through mixed interventions. For each set of studies, a box summa-
rizing the key aspects of each evaluation is provided; these summaries indicate
the corresponding chapter of this volume in which the evaluation is discussed at
length.
     On methodology, while the Trust Fund adopted an open view on research
design, all of the studies funded aimed to determine both causality and attribu-
tion. In most cases, this was satisfied through randomization, but other methods
for identifying counterfactuals were also adopted, especially in cases of media
and social marketing interventions where treatment is not easily excludable. In
addition, some studies supplemented the methodologies with qualitative and
process evaluation to explain how and why change occurs. Conceptually, the
evaluations intended to answer a diverse set of questions; while individually they
were designed to test specific theories, collectively they intended to contribute
to the same broader policy questions.


0.6.1	 Traditional financial education: schools, workshops,
and training seminars
Does formal financial education delivered through school curricula, workshops,
and trainings work in improving knowledge and desired outcomes? The six evalu-
ations described in box 0.1 explore this question.4
     As with most efforts to study the impact of policies, the main challenge in esti-
mating the effect of financial education on individuals’ knowledge and behavior is
establishing counterfactuals—that is, determining what would have happened to
those individuals in the absence of the intervention. Almost all design discussions
are concerned with this question; and in general, the more attention that can be
dedicated to the design of the project ex ante, the simpler and more robust is the
estimation of results ex post. All six studies discussed in this subsection achieve

tically significant with at least 90 percent confidence.

       Results: Impact on increasing knowledge and information-seeking behavior and reducing
        the risk of switching to costlier remittance products. No impact on changing frequency or
        levels of remittances.

  The study examined the impact of financial education targeting migrant workers and their remitting
  behavior in Australia and New Zealand. Training consisted of a two-hour session on reasons to
  remit, strategies for comparing costs, and information about different remittance products. Results
  show that the training led to increases in financial knowledge; migrants were more likely to know
  it is cheaper to send one large transfer than individual smaller ones, and more likely to know
  cheaper methods of remitting. The study also found that migrants changed behavior in response
  to knowledge gained; however, training was not found to change frequency of remitting, amount
  remitted, or the take-up of products.

       Data collection: Self-administered questionnaires
       Results: Impact on improving knowledge, attitudes, and behavior

  The study assesses the impact of high school financial education in Brazil. It includes nearly 900
  schools and 26,000 students. Administration of the program through schools allowed for a broad
  coverage of content in the curriculum. To control for quality of content, the educational material
  was developed by experts. Separate training was provided to a group of parents of the students
  to examine whether inside-the-household interactions influenced behavior. Results found that the
  program increased student financial knowledge by a quarter of a standard deviation, which led to
  a 1.4 percentage point increase in savings—a relatively large and economically relevant effect. A
  complementary workshop for parents induced children to save even more. Both current attitudes
  and forward-looking intentions to save improved.
                                                                                             (continued)

               DOES FINANCIAL EDUCATION AFFECT SAVINGS BEHAVIOR?

     Results: Impact on savings and attitudes related to financial management. Financial
      literacy levels did not improve.

The study measured the impact of a classroom financial literacy training on the take-up of
branchless banking and on savings behavior. The intervention consisted of a two-day training that
covered the role of formal banking in people’s lives and responsible borrowing, spending, saving,
and cash management. The experiment was conducted on a random sample of 3,000 clients of
branchless banking across two adjacent districts in the state of Uttar Pradesh. The results reveal
that the intervention had impact on savings and that attitudes related to financial management
improved, but overall financial literacy did not. This suggests that a causal chain reaction from
knowledge to behavior might not necessarily be required in such order to achieve desired
outcomes.

     Data collection: Face-to-face surveys
     Results: No results reported at this stage. The intervention is ongoing.

The study measures the impact of a mixed and multilayered intervention on savings behavior.
The program consists of three treatments: a classroom financial education training, followed by
reminders through mobile SMS and voice messages over a period of several months, and personal
counseling through physical visits to participants’ homes. It aims to measure the overall impact but
also to disentangle the separate effects from the individual treatments. The novelty of this study is
that it experiments with combining traditional financial education with behavioral treatments and
explores a multilayered intervention over a longer period of time as opposed to a single and one-
time treatment.

       Data collection: Face-to-face surveys
       Results: Impact on improving knowledge and savings rates, but no impact on credit card
        usage

  The study tested the impact of financial literacy training on savings and borrowing behavior and
  credit card usage patterns of credit card customers in Mexico City. It involved approximately 40,000
  bank consumers. The training course lasted for about four hours and consisted of four modules
  on savings, retirement, credit cards, and responsible use of credit. Results show a 9 percentage
  point increase in financial knowledge, and a 9 percentage point increase in saving outcomes, but
  no impact on credit card behavior, retirement savings, or borrowing. Moreover, administrative data
  suggest that the savings impact is relatively short-lived. The results point to the limits of using
  general-purpose workshops to improve financial literacy and decision-making patterns for the
  general population.

       Pathways to change: Group-based interactive financial literacy seminar

       Data collection: Face-to-face surveys and self-administered questionnaires
       Results: The study is still ongoing. Based on early observations, the intervention was
        found to improve budgeting and savings, reduce gambling, and decrease risk aversion.

  The study examines the impact of one-day financial education training on savings, financial
  planning, budgeting, and debt management. The purpose is to encourage individuals to seek more
  efficient financial vehicles, as well as to save and use credit wisely. The target population consists
  of members of burial societies and women’s development groups in the Eastern Cape area of
  South Africa. It uses a randomized experiment involving approximately 1,300 individuals. Outcome
  measures are obtained from a variety of sources, including individual surveys and administrative
  data. While the study is still ongoing, preliminary results show that the intervention had impact on
  budgeting skills and savings behavior, as well as on reducing gambling and decreasing risk aversion.
                                                                                      Overview  ◾  15




this through random assignment of beneficiaries to treatment and control groups.
Data are then collected to measure outcomes, in some cases combined with
qualitative and process evaluations.
    Random assignment requires that the evaluation objectives and methodolog-
ical development for data collection and analysis be in place before the program
is rolled out, and this requires collaboration with program providers early in the
process. Close collaboration among the learning and program staff is especially
important to address ethical issues, ensure compliance and tracking among both
treatment and control groups, and minimize attrition and spillover. The projects
discussed here adopt innovative methods to address these concerns.
    Furthermore, these projects are designed to provide additional insight on
whether different aspects of program design, such as content, delivery mecha-
nism, context, and duration, affect results. For example, the novelty of the Brazil
project (discussed at length in chapter 2) is that it evaluates financial education
incorporated across a number of subjects in the standard school curriculum
and delivered during three consecutive academic semesters. Although financial
education in schools has been studied before, this is the first time it has been
integrated so extensively in the school program of study. The two India studies
(one of which is the subject of chapter 4) explore the impact of classroom educa-
tion when combined and reinforced over time through reminders and personal
counseling. This, too, is different from evaluating single and one-time interven-
tions usually delivered in much shorter periods of time.


0.6.2	 Nontraditional financial education: use of mass media
and social marketing
As discussed earlier, lessons from psychology suggest that behavioral treatments
can be effective in achieving outcomes. The five Trust Fund evaluations described
in box 0.2 represent the first experiments that incorporate lessons from behav-
ioral psychology into financial capability programs.
    All of the studies summarized in box 0.2 experiment with different ways of
incorporating financial education into alluring stories or short messages trans-
mitted via mass media and social marketing campaigns or innovative technol-
ogies. Conceptually, the studies are designed to shed light on whether media
and marketing tools can improve individuals’ financial capabilities and improve
decision making, or whether school-based financial education material is more
effective when presented in a more entertaining way. Also, they provide valuable
insight into the extent to which these interventions, by appealing to emotions
and sticking to memory, lead to more effective decision making in the future.
Conversely, “learning-by-doing” experiments test the reverse hypothesis; that by
“nudging” and otherwise affecting behavior directly (e.g., enrolling in automatic
savings), individuals will become more interested in interacting with financial
institutions and a broader range of financial products.

  The study measures the impact of financial education on stock market participation and investment
  in Brazil. It involves an online stock market simulator that serves as a platform through which financial
  education is passed to participants and as a mechanism through which participants develop practical
  experience. A combination of education, warning, and reminders about good practices and learning-
  by-doing is expected to improve decisions over time. The study uses data of approximately 600,000
  investors. Understanding why people make the investments they do can help identify interventions to
  improve consumer protection and support development of capital markets.

  The study tests the absolute and relative impact of different program delivery mechanisms on
  the financial capability and behavior of Kenyan youth. It compares delivering education though
  classroom with that through comic books and radio shows. It uses a sample of 220 high schools,
  randomly assigned to two main treatment groups, a placebo group and a control. One novelty of
  this study is that in addition to completing both baseline and endline surveys, students are also
  asked to make financial decisions using real resources. This allows recording how actions differ from
  stated intentions, and how both stated intentions and actions change over time. Results show little
  evidence that the interventions improved financial literacy. Similarly they find no effect on stated
  and actual savings behavior. However, the study finds impacts on the likelihood that students want
  to start a business in the future.

The study measures the impact of a national marketing campaign launched by one of the largest
banks in Nigeria to encourage savings. It entails lottery prizes for individuals who open a savings
account and maintain a threshold amount in the account for 90 days during a period of three
months. The lottery is publicized through advertisements with celebrity endorsements and media
releases. The research assesses the extent to which the different components of the campaign
affect the take-up rate. It also measures the impact of “learning-by-doing”—the extent to which
interactions with banking motivate people to continue to save. Results report that during the
intervention there was improvement on savings behavior and on the usage of the bank’s other
financial products. However, there was no evidence that the incentive program led to persistent
changes after explicit incentives were removed.

The study involves a sample of 3,000 individuals in Nigeria to assess the extent to which a feature
film can promote responsible borrowing and improve savings. A basic premise on which the study
is developed is that emotions have an influence on actions, and while the emotional state might
be transient and short-lived, the decisions reached under the emotional state could potentially
provide the basis for future actions. To capture immediate actions, the experiment includes the
presence of microfinance institutions at the movie screening venues. Furthermore, to control for
spillover effects—that is, the extent to which individuals in the treatment and control groups might
talk to each other and share information—the experiment adopts a mix of individual and cluster
randomization.

       Pathways to change: Entertainment media (television soap opera)
       Thematic focus: Debt management

       Evaluation method: Randomized encouragement design
       Data collection: Phone and face-to-face surveys and qualitative focus groups
       Results: Improvement of knowledge and borrowing behavior

  The study investigates whether debt management may be improved through TV soap operas. To
  control for content quality, the project develops a soap opera storyline through focus groups. It
  involves around 1,000 randomly selected individuals divided into treatment and control groups.
  The treatment watches a soap opera with financial literacy messages, called Scandal!; the control
  watches a different show aired at the same time but with no financial literacy messages. Financial
  incentives are provided to ensure compliance. Results report that individuals assigned to watch
  Scandal! had higher financial knowledge on issues highlighted in the storyline. Scandal! viewers
  were more likely to borrow from formal sources, less likely to engage in gambling, and less prone to
  enter hire purchase agreements.




                    Mass media campaigns present a unique evaluation challenge and require
               innovative evaluation methods. First, because it is not possible to prevent people
               from watching television (it is not excludable), it is difficult to distinguish between
               treatment and control groups and to minimize spillovers. Second, because these
               interventions tend to be multidimensional and contain several levels of treat-
               ment, it is difficult to identify the specific program characteristics responsible
               for impact. The teams have developed novel mechanisms to maximize the sepa-
               ration between treatment and control, to motivate participation, and to design
               placebo treatments as falsification tests. These methods are explained in more
               detail in the relevant chapters.

               outcomes and addressing the methodological concerns discussed throughout
               this chapter, the five studies addressed in this subsection all explore a number
               of questions that have been peripheral to the field until recently. These topics
               include providing product-specific information disclosure, improving mental

BOX 0.3  Evaluations of interventions featuring combined methods

         SOCIAL NETWORKS, FINANCIAL LITERACY, AND INDEX INSURANCE:
        EVIDENCE FROM A RANDOMIZED EXPERIMENT IN KENYA (CHAPTER 6)

     Pathways to change: Comic books
     Thematic focus: Long-term planning; index-based weather insurance
     Target groups: Rural, small-scale farmers
     Evaluation method: Randomized controlled trial design and regression methods
     Data collection: Face-to-face and phone surveys
     Results: Impact on encouraging the take-up of index-based drought insurance

The study presents a randomized field experiment measuring the direct impact and social network
spillovers of providing financial literacy and discount vouchers on farmers’ decision to purchase
index-based drought insurance in Kenya. The experiment covers around 14 villages and uses comic
books as a delivery mechanism of financial education; the comic details the index-insurance product
and how it can help families protect themselves from the risk of drought. The study finds social
network spillovers to the provision of financial literacy materials, but no spillovers to the provision
of discount vouchers on farmers’ decision to purchase insurance. It further finds that financial
materials have spillover effects on farmers’ attitudes toward insurance but limited effects on
understanding as narrowly measured in the survey. These results provide suggestive evidence that
financial literacy materials are efficacious in encouraging take-up when farmers’ social contacts
similarly receive access to financial literacy materials.


   FINANCIAL (DIS-)INFORMATION: EVIDENCE FROM AN AUDIT STUDY IN MEXICO
                                (CHAPTER 8)

     Pathways to change: Product disclosure formats, and mobile SMS and telephone
      counseling
     Thematic focus: Savings and credit
     Target groups: Low-income consumers of credit
     Evaluation method: Randomized controlled trial design
     Data collection: Surveys and credit reports
     Results: Preliminary results suggest that disclosure and transparency improve the ability
      of consumers to select the best product out of several options and to identify the least
      expensive of several credit products offered.

The study measured the impact of product-specific information disclosure on financial decisions.
It assumes that the more transparent and relevant the information, the better consumer decisions
will be with regard to product selection. It involved development and testing of a series of alternate
product-specific disclosure formats, which were then used by low-income consumers in Mexico to
choose between a series of credit or savings products. The testing of formats was complemented
with financial education information delivered prior to the exercise to some participants, either
                                                                                           (continued)

  via SMS messages or by phone consultation. Preliminary results suggest that disclosure and
  transparency improve the ability of consumers to select the best product out of several options and
  the ability to identify the least expensive of several credit products offered. These findings point to
  potential benefits of focusing on product-specific information disclosure and consumer education.


          THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL EDUCATION ON FINANCIAL SERVICE USE:
         EVIDENCE FROM A FINANCIAL DIARIES STUDY IN UGANDA (CHAPTER 12)

       Pathways to change: Classroom training sessions
       Thematic focus: General financial education topics
       Target groups: Low-income households
       Evaluation method: Qualitative (financial diaries)
       Data collection: Face-to-face surveys
       Results: Qualitative findings suggest changes in knowledge, skills, and attitudes;
        however, they also indicate that they do not always translate directly into behavior
        change, at least not within a short time frame.

  The study uses financial diaries in combination with in-depth interviews in Uganda to understand
  and measure the financial capabilities of low-income households. It compares changes in
  knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behaviors of respondents in the treatment and comparison groups,
  highlighting situations where the former underwent a change that might be the result of the impact
  of the financial education. Results suggest that financial education affects knowledge, skills,
  and attitudes. Nevertheless, they also indicate that they do not always translate into behavioral
  change and affect decision making, at least not within a short time frame. However, there is some
  suggestion of change in savings behavior in terms of saving at home.


  INCREASING THE IMPACT OF CONDITIONAL CASH TRANSFERS THROUGH FINANCIAL
      LITERACY: EVALUATION PILOT IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC (CHAPTER 13)

       Pathways to change: Professional and peer trainings
       Thematic focus: Household and business financial management
       Target groups: Conditional cash transfer beneficiaries
       Evaluation method: Randomized controlled trial design
       Data collection: Surveys
       Results: No results reported at this stage. The intervention is ongoing.

  The study assesses whether conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs can be leveraged to deliver
  financial education and affect both knowledge and behavior. Evaluations of CCT programs have
  shown that they can be successful in increasing usage of health care and education services. This
  project explores the extent to which CCTs can improve financial capabilities. Working with around
  60 beneficiaries of the Solidaridad cash transfer program in the Dominican Republic, the study
  randomly selects one group of beneficiaries to participate in the training and another group that
  does not to serve as a control. The experiment is further divided into subtreatments to test whether
                                                                                              (continued)

training delivered by professionals versus peers has different effects. It also measures the relative
impact of business training versus soft job skills training on decreasing unemployment among
beneficiaries.


       DIRECT DEPOSIT AND COMMITMENTS TO SAVE IN MALAWI (CHAPTER 14)

     Pathways to change: One-on-one training; labeled banking accounts
     Thematic focus: Household and business financial management
     Target groups: Low-income agricultural wage earners and smallholder farmers
     Evaluation method: Randomized controlled trial design
     Data collection: Surveys
     Results: No results reported at this stage. The intervention is ongoing.

The study investigates innovative ways to address low levels of formal savings by leveraging
psychological mechanisms. The target population consists of low-income agricultural wage earners
and smallholder farmers in Malawi. It examines whether direct deposit of wages as opposed to cash
payments can help individuals match desired savings and expenditure patterns with actual behavior.
It also tests whether labeling particular bank savings accounts with particular expenditures and
labels (for example, college fund, car purchase, etc.) reinforces commitments to save.


      FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING IN UGANDA:
IMPACT AND NETWORK EFFECTS IN INFORMAL INDUSTRIAL CLUSTERS (CHAPTER 16)
     Pathways to change: Practice-based vocational training and classroom-based business
      training
     Thematic focus: Vocational and business training, and business network effects
     Target groups: Small-scale industries and business owners
     Evaluation method: Randomized controlled trial design
     Data collection: Face-to-face surveys
     Results: Very preliminary results suggest some short-term effects of training on financial
      literacy and technical knowledge, optimism, and adherence to technical standards, but
      not on core business outcomes. The intervention is ongoing.

The study explores the extent to which personal financial choices are affected by peers. It
consists of a randomized evaluation in Uganda to identify the impact of a comprehensive financial
management and vocational training program for small-scale industries, focusing on network
effects. The study identifies business networks and examines whether the enhanced knowledge
received through the training program spreads to other businesses and across networks, influencing
certain behavior among the untreated population. Potential positive spillovers would constitute
efficient ways to scale the impact of trainings and provide a natural source of leverage for these
programs.

              practice transfer. One study (discussed in more detail in chapter 13) also made
              use of the conditionality imposed by a cash transfer program to achieve changes
              in financial behavior among program beneficiaries.
                  Among other things, these studies expand the range of programs that can
              be used to improve financial capabilities. The evaluation approaches adopted
              encompass a range of methods, predominantly through random assignment to
              treatment and control groups, with closed-form data collection, although some
              studies combine these methods with qualitative and process techniques. These
              methods are presented in more detail in the respective chapters.



              0.7	      LESSONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS
              This section outlines some general lessons that can be inferred from the Trust
              Fund–supported evaluations. Some of these lessons and suggestions for future
              work have to do with the design and orientation of further research, and some
              concern the design and implementation of policies to enhance financial capability
              and behavior.


              0.7.1	    Process of implementation
              Close collaboration with the measurement component of the Trust Fund
              activities strengthened the orientation and impact of learning. The Trust
              Fund consisted of two main components—the first to define and measure what it
              means to be financially capable (through survey development), and the second to
              learn how one can achieve financial capability (through evaluation). The learning
              half benefited enormously from the measurement half: the goals of programs to
              enhance financial decision making have been shaped by a better understanding
              of what financial capability really entails. This experience suggests that future
              activities in this field ought to be built on both measurement and evaluation simul-
              taneously. The measurement work defined financial capability and identified the
              levels of financial capability in a population and among different target groups;
              program evaluation identified the interventions needed to improve financial capa-
              bility. Policy makers need information on both identification of targets and appro-
              priate policy measures to address them.

              Rigorous evaluation of existing programs is important; however, the knowl-
              edge generated may not address critical research gaps. To test new and
              refined theories, evaluations must encourage and support the development
              of innovative interventions. The objective of the Trust Fund was to finance the
              impact evaluation efforts, not the interventions. It was assumed that programs
              existed and that through systematic solicitation, interventions that permitted
              different types of hypothesis testing would be identified. On the contrary, it was
              a challenge to identify programs that responded to specific research constraints.
                                                                                        Overview  ◾  23




The theory to be tested often determines the design of the program. For example,
to compare whether a program is more effective when delivered through comics
than through traditional classroom textbooks, an existing program would have to
be identified that entailed the delivery of the same financial education content
through these two mechanisms while targeting the same audience. Such programs
are often absent in practice. Therefore, after gaps in the literature are identified,
it is often necessary to partner with researchers and program providers to either
design new or modify existing interventions to respond to the necessary research
characteristics.

It is critical to clearly identify knowledge gaps to target financing in priority
areas. A systematic review of the existing and ongoing literature including both
survey-based and experimental work helped identify the existing knowledge and
knowledge gaps and describe how the proposed work is related to or builds on
prior efforts. While this may sound obvious, when the Trust Fund joined the inter-
national efforts, there had been no systemic review of evaluations in the field—at
least not sufficient to provide detailed information related to the characteristics
of program design and delivery, or methodological approaches. To address this
void, the Trust Fund undertook a stocktaking effort based on which a number of
gaps emerged, both on the methodological and conceptual fronts. Building on
this exercise and maintaining a database of these studies is a valuable resource
to minimize duplication of effort and to ensure that resources are invested in
priority areas, that the results from different studies can be combined to inform
the broader policy questions, and that future work builds on the existing studies
to explore their implications fully.

Collaboration among policy makers, program staff, service providers, and
those responsible for learning helps enhance validity. The design and imple-
mentation of innovative, appropriate, and sustainable interventions to advance
financial capability require coordination among the various key stakeholders in
the process. This is especially true of the private sector, whose participation is
vital, and who will not be encouraged to participate in activities that are inim-
ical to or even peripheral to their interests. Thus, programs must be designed
to be “incentive compatible”: that is, the interests and objectives of all stake-
holders, including both consumers and private service providers, should be taken
into account when designing programs. Programs must provide or enhance the
services consumers believe best suit their needs, as well as encourage consumer
take-up. This is often a challenge for researchers, especially when conducting
studies specifically designed to test hypotheses and generate findings. Strong
collaboration with stakeholders during project development is crucial for appro-
priate research design, proper implementation, and adequate inferences made
from the data collected.

              0.7.2	    Research methodology
              When feasible, mixed methods for evaluation should be adopted to answer
              both whether X causes Y and to understand why and how. In choosing impact
              evaluation methods, it is important to think about causality, as well as why and
              how a program works or does not work. Otherwise, even after a highly rigorous
              approach is adopted, results could be inadequate—or worse, could misguide
              policy. Take, for example, a randomized assessment to measure the impact on
              savings of a financial education seminar delivered to employees of a company
              that finds no significant impact. Such a result could be interpreted to suggest
              that the program does not warrant replication. In contrast, it could be that minor
              aspects of the intervention affected the outcome, such as the time of day the
              seminar was delivered, the motivation of the particular teachers, or a number
              of other unobserved factors. In other words, knowing whether a program works
              or does not is only half the battle. Understanding why it does not work helps
              improve program design. In this view, employing mixed-method approaches, such
              as relying on randomized controlled trials when feasible but also supplementing
              them with qualitative and process techniques, helps tell a more complete and
              useful story.

              When evaluating multidimensional interventions, it is important to isolate
              the specific aspects of programs that are responsible for change. This is
              especially relevant for media-based and marketing interventions that often entail a
              number of treatments administered at the same time. For example, one of the key
              aspects of these interventions is relying on alluring stories to appeal to people’s
              emotions. In this case, it is difficult to precisely estimate whether the outcome
              of interest is driven from the actual quality of the content delivered, the channel
              of delivery, the extent to which the audience favors the actors involved, or other
              factors. One solution is to include placebo groups, “sham treatments” designed to
              have no effect; however, the more complex interventions are, the more difficult
              and costly it becomes to develop multiple and layered treatments. The evaluation
              of comics as a delivery mechanism in the Kenya example (chapter 5) employs a
              similar approach. For these interventions, combining qualitative and quantitative
              methods can be particularly valuable for identification of outcomes. When feasible,
              it is useful to include a “Latin square”–type design, in which different combinations
              of interventions or components can be tested. These evaluations require larger
              samples, because they aim to answer many questions simultaneously.

              Conduct comparative examinations to measure the relative impact of
              programs and projects delivered in different settings or across different
              target groups. External validity is often ignored. Programs may be carefully evalu-
              ated to establish causality, but it is important to understand whether the program
              will work elsewhere, or among a different group of participants. Moreover, finding
              that a program works does not make it the ideal program. One should evaluate not
                                                                                          Overview  ◾  25




only whether a particular program works, but whether it works better or worse
compared to other programs. It is especially important to experiment with nontra-
ditional modes of delivering financial education and information, including utiliza-
tion of technology, marketing, and behavioral treatments. Of equal importance is
comparing delivery methods or alternative versions of the same delivery method
against one another, and testing one delivery method in different contexts. This
will help in understanding whether a program works across settings, and whether
it works better or worse when disseminated through different delivery channels.

The relevance of quality and intensity or dosage of the service (e.g., educa-
tion and information) delivered should be explored. What is the quality of
the financial education and information delivered? Research to date has not
established the extent to which the outcomes are driven by content as opposed
to other aspects of the program structure. Most studies, though not all, do not
include content development or content testing as part of overall program devel-
opment and evaluation. Having relevant and engaging financial education mate-
rial significantly explains differences in financial literacy (Mandell and Klein 2007).
As such, the quality and relevance of the content to the target audience should
be an integral part of the research design.
    Related is the examination of the intensity and duration of exposure to
education and information. How much education and information is optimal, and
how often should it be reinforced to affect behavior? Is a program with fewer but
more intensive contact more or less effective than a program with more contacts
for shorter duration? Is a program of six months’ duration twice as effective as
one that lasts three months? Studies should also look at changes in impact over
time—i.e., at what point do marginal benefits from exposure to education and
information start to decrease, and how long do effects last?

Insights from psychology and behavioral economics continue to yield
important lessons for intervention design and implementation that should
be incorporated and tested. A behavioral perspective suggests explanations
for behavioral biases that affect financial decisions. Psychological factors such as
overconfidence, loss aversion, status quo preference, and hyperbolic discounting,
among others, have been found to influence financial decision making. Deriving
from Kahneman and Tversky’s Prospect Theory (1979), which was among the
first acknowledgments of deviation from the classical full-information utility
maximizing model, this literature is indisputably important to consumer financial
decision making. However, aside from a couple of studies funded by the Trust
Fund, not much has been done elsewhere in incorporating these insights in
developing and testing new theories and models. It is therefore of crucial impor-
tance to further study this area and examine the types of behavioral biases that
affect decisions, to develop a theoretical framework to collect data around the
psychology of financial decision making, and to experiment with designing inter-
ventions that help overcome such biases.

              There is insufficient information about costs and cost-effectiveness to
              assess the feasibility of scaling up. It is one thing to experiment with inter-
              ventions and determine whether a program works, and another to determine the
              extent to which that particular intervention is scalable, especially from a budget
              point of view. Information about cost-effectiveness is essential to help policy
              makers in developing countries allocate scarce resources, and should be inte-
              gral in rigorous impact evaluation. Interventions can either be compared with a
              single intervention or a small set of similar interventions or with an agreed-upon
              benchmark representing the assumed willingness of policy makers and program
              providers to invest.


              0.7.3	    Identification of impact
              Evidence suggests that financial capability has an impact on consumer
              financial decision making, but results are somewhat mixed, pointing to
              certain areas that require further investigation. Of the 17 Trust Fund projects,
              12 are complete and have reported results as of the date of this volume; these are
              reported on in chapters 1–12. The remaining five are still undergoing implementa-
              tion or endline analysis, although most have reported on preliminary findings and
              observations; four of these are discussed in chapters 13–16.
                  Overall, the results from this set of projects suggest that financial capa-
              bility enhancement—whether achieved through traditional classroom models
              or through innovative ways that utilize media, mobile technology, entertain-
              ment, or behavioral treatments—can be effective in both improving knowledge
              and awareness, and in changing behavior. Yet generalizing from each individual
              impact study to other settings and populations is a challenge, as is the case with
              impact studies in general. As with any randomized experiment, the more rigorous
              the experiment, the more likely the study is to sacrifice external validity. However,
              the results from the completed studies combined with preliminary observations
              from the ongoing studies seem to suggest that, in general, financial capability
              enhancement programs work better when:

                  ◾◾ financial education content is targeted and relevant;
                  ◾◾ they address consumers at “teachable moments”;
                  ◾◾ they are entertaining and appeal to emotions; and
                  ◾◾ exposure to information is longer term.

                  Evidence strongly suggests that one-time interventions (such as short
              courses or workshops) can have an impact in the short term, but effects tend
              to fade over time. This has important policy implications in the field of financial
              capability, because programs are generally aimed at altering long-term behavior.

0.8	      CONCLUSION AND PROPOSALS FOR NEXT STEPS
The Trust Fund financing of impact evaluations for a diverse set of interventions
has yielded some insights concerning the presence and alleviation of constraints
to improved financial decision making. But it has also clarified that rigorous
research is necessary for impact evaluations to generate useful lessons and help
improve programs in the longer term. This requires the engagement of technical
experts at early stages of project development, including at the level of hypoth-
esis creation and intervention design. For many of the Trust Fund–financed evalu-
ations, the provision of technical expertise was among the most valuable aspects
of the program.
    The Trust Fund program component that funded the 17 evaluations had three
goals: (1) to assess the effectiveness of interventions designed to improve finan-
cial capability and to ultimately yield better financial decisions; (2) to move beyond
traditional financial education and explore whether other alternative mechanisms
are effective in achieving desired outcomes; and (3) to address specific gaps
in literature identified by researchers as crucial for generating a more conclu-
sive body of knowledge to guide policy. For all these dimensions, the research
targeted poor segments of populations in resource-scarce environments.
    The program made its main progress in conducting a systematic review of
existing and technically sound evaluations to identify research gaps both theo-
retically and methodologically. This stocktaking exercise represents one of the
first efforts in the field to generate a database of evaluations that reports on
both intervention and research characteristics. Furthermore, the program was
successful in promoting evaluations of new and innovative interventions beyond
traditional financial education. This was triggered by an outcome-based and
agnostic approach that conceptually did not hold predispositions on the path-
ways needed to achieve good outcomes but instead explored different theories
of change. Research scope was thus expanded to include a variety of innovative
programs that had not been addressed by previous studies, such as the utilization
of media, marketing, and behavioral treatments in program design.
    Final results and preliminary findings from the 12 completed and 5 ongoing
Trust Fund–supported research projects provide valuable insights that need to be
further explored by the research community to be able to offer more conclusive
evidence. The following lessons are especially important:

Financial capability may be achieved through different interventions;
programs that utilize mass media and social marketing tools promise to be
especially effective. Results suggest that financial capability programs, whether
delivered through schools and workshops or through more innovative methods
such as mass media and marketing, can be effective in changing both knowledge
and behavior. Alternative interventions, such as using TV soap operas, films, and
promotion campaigns, prove to be especially effective. For these interventions,
28  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              two features are presumed to affect the outcome. First, they can be more enter-
              taining and have the capacity to transmit messages through appealing stories
              that stick to the memory; and second, they can serve as mechanisms through
              which messages can be repeated and reinforced over time, keeping the audience
              engaged in treatment for longer than traditional financial education mechanisms
              do (e.g., soap operas can last for months or years).

              The quality of the content delivered affects outcomes. Results tend to
              suggest that financial capability programs work better when the content is rele-
              vant, targeted at the right audience, and delivered at teachable moments. While
              this might seem an obvious point, most financial capability programs, devel-
              oped by both program providers and researchers, do not tend to focus much on
              developing the financial education content. The stocktaking exercise conducted
              by the Trust Fund finds that most of the programs in the field either use similar
              financial education material or develop generic curriculum that encompasses key
              concepts on financial management without tailoring the subject to the targeted
              audience or the specific setting.

              Financial behavior improves even in the absence of improvements in finan-
              cial literacy. Trust Fund research finds that programs can be effective in changing
              individual decision making even in cases where the financial literacy of partic-
              ipating individuals does not improve. This speaks to the importance of paying
              more attention to the mechanisms that drive behavior, whether knowledge or
              behavioral treatments. If the policy objective of a program is to improve savings
              rates, for example, providing financial education might not be necessary, and in
              certain cases might not be cost-effective. Interventions that employ media and
              marketing tools could improve savings rates without following a cognitive route.
              This does not suggest that financial education should not be promoted, but rather
              that interventions other than traditional financial education are available to policy
              makers to help people make better financial choices.

              Impacts from one-time interventions fade over time, and reinforcement
              is required to sustain behavioral change. Results suggest that improvement
              of financial capability among the poor is extremely difficult, especially when the
              improvement in question refers to longer-term behavior change and habit forma-
              tion. The results from Trust Fund and other studies suggest that while interventions
              may be successful in influencing immediate post-intervention behavior, the effects
              tend to fade over time. This observation is in line with research in other areas that
              focuses on mechanisms to change decision making—e.g, in health (promoting a
              healthy lifestyle) or energy (changing consumption patterns). This is not a demon-
              stration that the financial capability interventions are not effective, but rather that
              treatments might need to be repeated over time to maintain their effect.

                  The Trust Fund supported a wide range of interventions in many different
              contexts that have yielded information of great value to policy makers and
                                                                                       Overview  ◾  29




program staff alike with respect to the orientation, content, and effective delivery
of financial capability information across the developing world. Nowhere before
have the research and policy communities joined forces in such a coordinated
manner to understand these lessons so comprehensively and rigorously. But
even this comprehensive effort leaves many questions unanswered. In moving
forward, the focus areas for the next generation of research need to be identified.
This chapter recommends investing in the following priority research areas:

 1.	 Explore interventions other than financial education. The limitation of
      traditional financial education in changing consumer financial behavior is
      well documented by research and is confirmed by the results from Trust
      Fund projects. And even if they work, they typically have high treatment
      costs per individual. In contrast to traditional and classroom-based financial
      education, interventions that utilize mass media or social media (tele-
      vision programs, radio commercials, mobile phones and other new tech-
      nology, etc.), social marketing techniques (promotion campaigns, etc.),
      and behavioral treatments (reminders, choice framing, peer pressure, etc.)
      have often shown promise to be effective in influencing consumer choices,
      have mostly low treatment costs per individual, and can be taken rapidly to
      national scale. A main condition is high technology penetration which is met
      nowadays in most low- and middle-income countries. This suggests that
      future research needs to further explore the scope and limitations of these
      interventions to better understand what specific mechanisms work better
      and in which settings.
 2.	 Explore the difference between financial literacy and financial capa-
      bility and conduct comparative research to measure the relative
      impact on consumer decision making. These two terms, while to an
      extent used interchangeably in the literature in recent years, mean different
      things and may have different objectives and outcomes. Achieving financial
      literacy means improving knowledge that may improve decisions for some
      financial outcomes—e.g., budgeting or specific investments. Achieving
      financial capability means improving financial decisions for the same or,
      perhaps, other outcomes—e.g., increasing the savings rate or asking for
      financial advice. This conjecture emerges strongly from both the financial
      measurement work as well as from impact pilots, but the differences and
      overlaps with regard to policy interventions (say, classroom intervention
      versus mobile phone reminders) and their effectiveness are little known.
 3.	 Identify interventions with long-term impacts, such as the Trust Fund
      Brazil project to improve financial education in school. The Brazil pilot
      (discussed in chapter 2) has focused on increasing financial literacy as
      well as financial outcomes (saving) and may have long-term effects. These
      effects require (1) relevant high-quality material/textbook developed by
      experts, (2) well-trained and highly motivated staff (through incentives),
30  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




                    (3) multiple treatments over a longer period (three consecutive academic
                    semesters), and (4) the involvement of parents.
                4.	 Explore the importance of intensity or dosage of the service deliv-
                    ered. There is little evidence on how much education and information is
                    optimal or cost-effective and how often it should be reinforced to achieve
                    desired outcomes. Studies should be developed to look at optimal dosages
                    for different interventions and examine timing and repetition effects—i.e.,
                    whether impacts diminish as the time spent in classes or exposure to
                    messages declines and how long effects last.
                5.	 Focus on the sustainable long-term behavior change. Results from the
                    Trust Fund suggest that most interventions that find impact usually refer to
                    short-term impact. Individuals generally tend to regress to former (pre-in-
                    tervention) behavior. It is not enough for researchers to identify interven-
                    tions that succeed in controlled clinical trials; they must also show that the
                    impact detected can continue over time, otherwise an intervention cannot
                    be deemed successful and suggested for replication. Future research
                    should focus on the maintenance stage: i.e., ways (or additional treatments
                    needed over time) to help individuals maintain behavior in the longer term.
                6.	 Apply behavioral treatments to address the limitations and biases of
                    individual decision-making capacity to ensure effective policy design.
                    The recent revolution in behavioral economics research has provided a range
                    of empirical evidence that contradicts the rational agent model, suggesting
                    that people often behave in contrast to their best interest and that they are
                    very sensitive to the way choices are framed. This is especially relevant in
                    the field of decision making and personal finance. Future research should
                    therefore explore this area further and examine how behavioral models can
                    inform personal financial decision making. Specifically, it should examine
                    what types of behavioral biases affect choices, in what contexts, and how
                    to collect data around behavioral characteristics. Furthermore, it should
                    examine the interaction between individual behavioral characteristics and
                    external environmental factors that might influence behavior.
                7.	 Integrate cost-effectiveness analysis in research design to inform
                    scale and sustainability. Scientific research must report on both the
                    impact of an intervention on desired outcomes and on the cost of devel-
                    oping and delivering the intervention. This is especially important for low-
                    and middle-income countries, because if a program is deemed effective
                    but expensive, countries might not have the means to deliver at scale. It
                    is understandable that in the early stages of research, when “successful
                    interventions” have yet to be identified, it might not be necessary to invest
                    in cost-effectiveness analysis (especially if no impact is detected). However,
                    as the second-generation research in this area advances, it is crucial that
                    studies that find impact report on benefits and costs. They must present
                                                                                               Overview  ◾  31




      cost-effectiveness ratios in terms of treatment cost of desired outcome per
      individual (or similar measures). Studies are also encouraged to focus on
      cost comparisons between alternative interventions, such as the cost of
      traditional financial education programs versus alternative methods.

ABSTRACT
     Remittances are a major source of external finance for many developing
     countries, but the cost of sending remittances remains high for many migra-
     tion corridors. International efforts to lower costs by facilitating the entry of
     new financial products and new cost comparison information sources rely
     heavily on the financial literacy of migrants. This chapter presents the results
     of a randomized experiment designed to measure the impact of providing
     financial literacy training to migrants. Training appears to increase finan-
     cial knowledge and information-seeking behavior and reduces the risk of
     switching to costlier remittance products, but does not change either the

1.1	INTRODUCTION
International migration from a poor to a rich country is perhaps the single act
most likely to succeed in dramatically increasing the income of an individual
(see, e.g., Clemens, Montenegro, and Pritchett 2008; McKenzie, Gibson, and
Stillman 2010) as well as that of family members remaining behind (see, e.g.,

              Gibson, McKenzie, and Stillman 2013; Yang 2008; Yang and Martínez 2006). The
              most direct channel through which international migration can lower poverty
              for household members remaining in a developing country is through remit-
              tances. However, high costs of sending remittances limit the amount received by
              remaining household members from a given remittance transfer, as well as the
              incentives of migrants to send remittances if such transfers are effectively taxed
              by these high transaction costs. Lowering the cost of sending remittances has
              thus become one of the most discussed areas for policy intervention in recent
              years (see, e.g., World Bank 2006), in part because doing so is viewed as politically
              uncontroversial compared to efforts to increase opportunities for migration.
                      Two of the main policies to lower the costs of remittances have been
              regulatory reform to allow the introduction of new financial products, and
              efforts to increase the disclosure of the costs of remitting via each product,
              pioneered by Mexico (www.remesamex.gob.mx) and the United Kingdom
              (www.sendmoneyhome.org1). However the efficacy of policies to reduce the cost
              of remitting and spur competition by allowing new product entry and increasing
              disclosure of costs relies heavily on the ability of migrants to understand how to
              use the different methods available for remitting and the costs implied by each
              method. While systematic evidence on the financial literacy of migrants is scarce,
              the data available suggest migrants often lack knowledge of the components of
              a remittance cost, the methods available, or how to compare methods (Gibson,
              McKenzie, and Rohorua 2006; Gibson et al. 2007). There therefore seems to be
              promising scope for financial literacy training to change remitting behavior.
                      There is also growing interest from policy makers in providing financial literacy
              training in this area. Much of the focus on financial literacy training for migrants
              and their families has traditionally been on either integrating immigrants into
              the financial system in the destination country through content that focuses on
              building knowledge of banking services and covering basic household budgeting
              and savings topics (LIRS 2006), or content focused on encouraging remittance
              receivers to better use the money they receive, as is the focus in the content of
              the Microfinance Opportunities/Freedom from Hunger Global Financial Education
              Program.2 However, a number of countries have also started focusing on teaching
              the migrants themselves more about the costs and details of different methods
              of remitting; these include migrant-sending countries such as Indonesia and the
              Philippines, and pilot programs for seasonal migrants from the Pacific Islands
              working in Australia and New Zealand. However, to date, there is no rigorous
              evidence on the effectiveness of such programs.

    This chapter presents the results of a randomized experiment designed to
measure the impact of providing financial literacy training to migrants in Australia
and New Zealand—countries that had recently launched a remittance cost
comparison website (www.sendmoneypacific.org) for sending money to the
Pacific Islands, and, in the case of New Zealand, where regulatory reform had
led to the introduction of new remitting methods. The training taught migrants
the different elements that make up the cost of sending remittances and how to
compare costs across methods; explained how different methods of remitting
work, including alerting them to the presence of new methods; and also covered
content on comparing costs of different methods of short-term credit financing
for immigrants. The experiment was carried out on three different groups that
had differing levels of existing education and financial knowledge, and differing
intensities of remitting. The first group was Pacific Island migrants in New Zealand,
who remitted relatively frequently and had relatively low education and financial
literacy at baseline. The second group was East Asian migrants in New Zealand,
who had low frequencies of remitting but relatively high education and finan-
cial literacy; and the final group was Sri Lankan migrants in Melbourne, Australia,
who remitted relatively frequently and had relatively high education and financial
literacy levels.
    We find the training led to increases in financial knowledge of the Pacific
Island and East Asian migrants, but not of the Sri Lankans, which is consistent
with such training being most important for those with either low knowledge or
low experience. This increased knowledge was coupled with changes in behavior,
with Pacific Island and East Asian migrants being more likely to use information
to compare the costs of remitting across different methods, and the Pacific Island
sample being less likely to switch remitting channels to methods that were not
obviously better. However, we find no changes in the frequency of remitting, nor
in the amount remitted. The Pacific Island training also contained information
on the costs of different forms of credit. This did not succeed in increasing use
of credit cards from a low base, but did lead to an increase in hire purchase
loans during a period when they were a relatively good deal, and to individuals
setting up rotating savings and credit associations (ROSCAs) to avoid high-interest
payday loans. Unfortunately, the comparison of the Pacific Island group with the
other two groups is hampered by the fact that few of the East Asian sample
regularly sent remittances, while attrition was high and unbalanced by treatment
status for the Sri Lankan sample. The results are thus cleanest for the sample the
content was developed for in the first place, the Pacific Island group.
    One implication of these results is that simply informing remitters about
remittance costs, which is a relatively cheap and uncontroversial intervention,
will not necessarily lower average costs from remitters switching to cheaper
methods. Instead, governments targeting reduced average money transfer costs
may need to address other barriers, which may include excessive regulation and
exclusive arrangements made by state-owned entities that deter new entry into
36  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              remittance corridors.3 Another implication is that the case for providing financial
              literacy training for migrants needs to rest on criteria other than the financial
              savings from cheaper remittances—such as the improvements in their capabil-
              ities from being more informed customers and the potential savings from other
              aspects of financial management, such as choice of debt levels and instruments.
                      The remainder of the chapter is organized as follows: section 1.2 provides the
              background to the randomized experiment, in terms of the surveys and financial
              literacy training that were carried out and the context of the remittance corridors
              studied. In section 1.3, the results of the experiment are described, focusing on
              financial knowledge, information seeking, remittance frequency, amounts and
              methods, credit use, and qualitative evaluations from the study participants.
              Section 1.4 contains the discussion and section 1.5 the conclusions.



              1.2	          BACKGROUND CONTEXT, THE SAMPLE, AND THE
                            FINANCIAL LITERACY INTERVENTION
              The cost of remitting money has fallen dramatically in a number of migration corri-
              dors over the past 15 years due to increased competition, new product offerings,
              and the advent of price-comparison websites. For example, Profeco, Mexico’s
              consumer protection agency, started reporting weekly the cost of sending money
              from several cities in the United States to Mexico in 1998, and Hernández-Coss
              (2005) reports that the cost of sending US$300 fell from approximately US$32 in
              1999 to US$12 by 2003; by September 2011, one could send US$300 for US$3.60
              using Bank of America’s account-to-account or cash-to-cash products.4
                      Nevertheless, costs of sending money are still high when sending along other
              migration corridors, with transfer costs between several African countries costing
              15–20 percent on a US$200 transaction in 2011.5 This was also the context in work
              that we did examining remittance costs in the Pacific in the mid-2000s, where
              we found the costs of sending money from Australia or New Zealand to several
              Pacific Islands was in the range of 15–20 percent on a typical $NZ 200 transaction
              (Gibson, McKenzie, and Rohorua 2006; Gibson et al. 2007; McKenzie 2007). This
              work also revealed that while costs were high on average, there were lower-cost
              possibilities available—such as the use of debit cards to make automated teller

                For example, the New Zealand government–run bank with a mandate to serve low-income
              customers (KiwiBank) is not active in providing a remittance product for migrants. One
              likely reason is that KiwiBank branches are all in post offices, which already act as agents
              for an existing money transfer operator, Western Union.

machine (ATM) withdrawals—that were not being used, and that few migrants
had heard of such methods. Moreover, although a typical remittance transaction
incurs both a fixed fee and an exchange rate commission, the latter component
was often opaque, leading to migrants often comparing methods of remitting
purely on the basis of the fixed-fee component.
    Spurred by these research findings, the Australian and New Zealand govern-
ments and their aid agencies, along with the World Bank, worked to try and lower
the costs of remitting in the region. In New Zealand, this resulted in a change
in excessive anti–money laundering regulations, thereby allowing banks to give
migrants an ATM card for themselves and one for their family back home without
the bank having to verify the identity of the second cardholder in person. Westpac
Bank was the first to release a new product under these revised regulations, with
the Westpac Express prepaid debit card targeted at migrants launched to positive
reviews (Stock 2009). Also, these organizations launched a new website for both
Australia and New Zealand (www.sendmoneypacific.org), based on the successful
sendmoneyhome website in the United Kingdom. This website provides detailed
information on the cost of sending remittances from Australia and New Zealand
to the Pacific Islands by various channels and is updated regularly.
    However, despite the introduction of new products and a new information
source, the take-up of the Westpac Express product and the volume of trans-
fers using it have not been as high as hoped for (Pacific Islands Forum Secre-
tariat 2011). One plausible reason suggested for this was lack of financial literacy.
Only 12 percent of Pacific Island migrants in our sample had heard of this card
at baseline, and less than half of them had ever used any source of information
to compare the costs of sending money across different methods. Coupled with
increasing policy interest in providing financial education to migrants, we there-
fore decided to conduct a randomized experiment to measure the impacts of
doing so on financial knowledge and remitting behavior of migrants.


1.2.1	    The sample
The Westpac Express card and www.sendmoneypacific were both designed for
Pacific Island migrants in New Zealand. However, to examine whether training
that focuses on understanding how to remit and to compare prices is also effec-
tive for other migrant groups, we decided to also consider other migrant groups.
Since migrants are a rare population, especially when focusing on migrants
from specific countries, obtaining a representative sample can be prohibitively
expensive (McKenzie and Mistiaen 2009). We therefore decided to recruit study
participants through intercept points where migrant populations are known
to congregate, mimicking the approach that would typically be used by policy
makers and financial institutions trying to reach migrant populations. This has
the advantage of making our results relevant for the population most likely to be
the subject of financial literacy efforts, even if it does not allow measurement
38  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              of the impacts on migrants not found in these locations, who are typically less
              connected to their home countries (and less likely to remit).
                   Our first group consists of Pacific Islanders living in urban areas in the upper
              North Island of New Zealand. Approximately one-third of the recruitment was from
              attendees at a Pacific cultural festival in Hamilton, which drew participants from
              up to 60 miles away (including South Auckland, which has the largest concentra-
              tion of Pacific immigrants). The remainder was recruited from the main Pacific
              outdoor market (which operates every Saturday morning) in South Auckland, and
              from churches in Auckland and Hamilton. The church-based recruitment tended
              to bring in older participants, whereas the cultural festival participants were typi-
              cally in their 20s. The Pacific Islanders were predominantly (three-quarters) from
              Tonga; with the remainder born in Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Fiji, Australia, and
              New Zealand. In the Pacific Island community, even second-generation migrants
              send remittances due to the ongoing linkage with extended families in the Islands
              (Lee 2003); thus, we did not rule out any Australian- or New Zealand–born partic-
              ipants.
                   The second group was chosen to be the other main immigrant group in New
              Zealand, East Asians. Chinese and Korean participants from Auckland (four-fifths
              of the total for the East Asian group) were recruited from five different churches
              located in north, west, and central Auckland; and from a tai chi group and a
              Chinese health organization, both located in northern Auckland. The remaining
              Chinese participants were from Hamilton (60 miles south of Auckland), where they
              were recruited from several churches and from preexisting research networks of
              the Chinese team leader (who was based in Hamilton). In no case did any one
              church or locality contribute more than one-seventh of the sample. This sample
              was restricted to first-generation migrants.
                   The final group in our study consists of first-generation Sri Lankan migrants
              in Melbourne, Australia.6 They were recruited through snowball sampling. Initially,
              20 people were selected from various Sri Lankan organizations (both formal and
              informal) in Melbourne. These organizations were selected to represent different
              demographic and economic groups, in terms of length of time residing in Australia,
              method of migration (skilled, family reunification, and student), education level,
              ethnicity (predominantly Sinhalese), and location in the greater Melbourne urban
              area. Each individual from these organizations was asked to provide names and
              contact details for five individuals who could be interviewed; out of the 100
              potential participants identified this way, 80 on the seed list agreed to partici-
              pate in the baseline survey. In turn, when the interviews were conducted with
              these 80 people, they were asked to provide further referrals, leading to another



              6 
                We also planned a sample of Pacific Island migrants in Sydney, Australia, but the field
              leader in charge of this process experienced health problems partway through the recruit-
              ment and training which led to this sample strata being dropped from the study.

129 people who were interviewed. Some of the participants who were obtained
through the second round of referrals were uncomfortable with the questions
on financial information and remittances, and refused to provide any contact
addresses—which ruled them out from being invited to the training or partici-
pating in the four follow-up surveys.
    In order to ensure that the surveys and financial literacy training were
conducted in the most effective and culturally appropriate way, we recruited indi-
viduals from these same migrant populations to lead the fieldwork for each of
the component studies. In fact, each of these team leaders had a Ph.D., two in
economics and one in psychology (but specializing in field studies of migrants); so
the level of training and skill for the providers of the financial literacy intervention
is likely to be atypically high. Each of the team leaders recruited local assistants
who were individuals drawn from the same population groups that were being
studied. The questionnaires, PowerPoint presentations, and any written material
handed out was available in English, Korean, and Mandarin for the participants in
the East Asian group, and in English for the Pacific and Sri Lankan groups (English
is the language of schooling throughout the Pacific, and the Sri Lankan group
members were highly educated, even if English was not their first language).


1.2.2	     Baseline survey, randomization, and financial literacy
           levels
Respondents were recruited December 2010–January 2011 (Pacific Island sample),
December 2010–February 2011 (East Asian sample), and January–March 2011 (Sri
Lankan sample). The resulting sample sizes were 349 Pacific Islanders, 352 East
Asians, and 209 Sri Lankans. A baseline questionnaire collected information on
their use and awareness of different remittance methods; their financial literacy,
with specific emphasis on knowledge relevant to remittances and use of financial
instruments; and their background characteristics.
    Within each of the three samples, we formed eight strata, based on three
baseline characteristics: (1) reported frequency of remitting (remitting at least
every three months or not), (2) knowledge of the saving in transaction costs from
bundling two remittances of US$100 into a single remittance of US$200, and
(3) knowledge of which credit card user would face the highest finance charges
based on different repayment patterns. Individuals were then randomized by
computer into a treatment group, which was invited to financial literacy training;
and a control group, which was not.
    Table 1.1 displays the baseline characteristics of each of the three samples
by treatment status. For each sample, an F-test cannot reject joint orthogonality,
confirming that we did not get an unlucky draw and that randomization succeeded
in achieving balance on baseline characteristics.
    We see the three migrant groups differ from one another in a number of
important ways.
40  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




                  ◾◾ The Pacific Island migrants are younger and less educated than the other
                    groups, with almost half aged under 35 and only 9 percent having a univer-
                    sity degree. Thirty-nine percent are male, and just under half have a parent
                    or child in a Pacific Island home country. They are relatively frequent remit-
                    ters, with 59 percent remitting at least once every three months, with a
                    mean remittance amount of $NZ 299 and a median of $NZ 200.
                  ◾◾ The East Asian migrants are older, with only one-third under age 35;
                    and more settled, with only one-quarter having immigrated in the past
                    five years. Forty-three percent are male, and 57  percent have university
                    degrees. They are infrequent remitters, with only 6.5  percent remitting
                    within the past three months, despite 66 percent having a parent or child
                    remaining in the home country. The few remittances that do occur are for
                    relatively large amounts, with a mean (median) of $NZ 4,235 ($NZ 1,000).
                  ◾◾ The Sri Lankan migrants differ in being majority male (73  percent); they
                    have the highest education and employment rates, with 59  percent
                    having a university education. They are also relatively frequent remitters,
                    with 55  percent remitting at least every three months, a mean (median)
                    remittance of $NZ 1,525 ($NZ 675), and 75 percent having a parent or child
                    remaining in Sri Lanka.

              These differences across groups likely in part reflect the different immigra-
              tion categories of migrant entry: Pacific Islanders tend to immigrate to New
              Zealand through family reunification and special concessionary migration quotas
              (McKenzie, Gibson, and Stillman 2010), whereas the Asian migrants to New
              Zealand typically entered through points systems that reward skills and wealth.
              The Sri Lankan migrants are typically individuals who entered Australia either as
              students or as a result of civil conflict in Sri Lanka, qualifying under Australia’s
              points-based migration system.
                  The baseline survey asked three questions to measure remittance-specific
              financial literacy, as well as two questions on broader financial literacy related to
              credit (see annex). Baseline financial literacy was lowest among the Pacific Island
              migrants: only 49 percent knew it was cheaper to bundle remittances as a single
              transaction than to send separately (and pay the fixed fee twice); only 5.7 percent
              knew that the prepaid ATM card was the cheapest method of remitting; and only
              3 percent knew that the remittance fee consists of an exchange rate commission
              and a fixed fee. Knowledge of the available methods of remitting was also rela-
              tively low, as migrants were asked whether they had heard of each of 10 different
              methods of sending money (Western Union, Melie Mei Langi, Travelers Cheque,
              etc.), with the mean respondent having heard of only 3 such methods. Financial
              literacy related to credit was also relatively low, with only 41  percent knowing
              that someone who pays only the minimum payment would pay the most on credit
              card fees; only 3 percent were able to correctly calculate the annual percentage
              rate (APR) on a two-week payday loan.

                  Baseline financial literacy rates were higher among the Sri Lankans and East
              Asians, reflecting their much higher education levels and greater use of credit
              cards and checking accounts. Sixty-five percent of the East Asians and 78 percent
              of the Sri Lankans knew it was cheaper to bundle remittance transactions, and
              over 40  percent of both groups were able to correctly calculate the APR on a
              two-week payday loan. However, knowledge of the components of a remittance
              fee was still low, with only 12 percent of the East Asians and 18 percent of the
              Sri Lankans knowing the correct answer to this question. As with the Pacific
              Islanders, these migrant groups only claimed to have heard of 3 or 4 possible
              ways of sending remittances out of a list of 10–12 methods.


              1.2.3	    Potential savings from greater financial literacy
              The remittance methods available to the participants had transaction costs that
              ranged from almost zero to over 15 percent for a typical transaction at the start
              of the intervention. The greatest potential gains appear to be for the Pacific Island
              migrants in New Zealand, as a result of substantial heterogeneity in costs and
              lower typical remittance amounts. For example, at baseline, spending $NZ 200
              (the median transaction) to send money to Tonga (the main destination) would
              attract transaction costs of 15  percent using a bank transfer, 11–12  percent
              using either Western Union or MoneyGram, 8 percent using the major indigenous
              money transfer operator (Melie Mei Langi), or just 5 percent using the Westpac
              Express prepaid remittance card. Moreover, one Internet-only provider (KlickEx)
              had transaction costs of less than 1 percent, although no participants had ever
              used this method. Since the most common methods used were Western Union
              and Melie Mei Langi, bundling two transactions into one would save the fixed fee
              of $NZ 8–14, while switching from one of these methods to the Westpac Express
              card would save $NZ 6–12 per $NZ 200 transaction.
                  There was less variation in costs for the East Asians in New Zealand, and,
              with few migrants remitting, less potential gains to be had. For money transfers
              to China, the transaction costs for sending $NZ 200 varied between 14 percent for
              both Western Union and the most expensive indigenous money transfer operator
              (Global FX) and 10 percent using the cheapest money transfer operator (Conver-
              gence Group). Some of the Chinese money transfer operators would only transfer
              a minimum of $NZ 1,000, for which the transaction costs were as low as 3 percent.
              Since the cost of remitting falls as a percentage of the amount remitted due to
              the fixed-fee component, and the median amount remitted for the few East Asian
              migrants who were remitting was $NZ 1,000 at baseline, the percentage cost of
              remitting ranged from 3 to 6 percent.
                  For the Sri Lankan participants in Australia, spending $A 200 on a remittance
              would attract transaction costs of 16  percent using a bank transfer, 9  percent
              using Western Union, 5 percent using MoneyGram, and just 3 percent using any
              of the cheapest indigenous money transfer operators (FastCash, Remittance
                                 1.  The impact of financial literacy training for migrants  ◾ 43




Plus, or Serandib). For their median remittance amount of $A 500 ($NZ 675), the
transaction costs would range from 11 percent using a bank transfer, 5–6 percent
using MoneyGram or Western Union, 4  percent using Kapruka, and 3  percent
using FastCash, Remittance Plus, or Serandib. One money transfer operator that
began operations after the intervention started, Cash Express, had costs for a
$A 500 remittance of just 2 percent. Since the most common methods at baseline
were Kapruka and FastCash, there were relatively limited gains to be had from
switching providers for this sample.


1.2.4	    The financial literacy intervention
The financial literacy training content was originally developed by the authors in
collaboration with the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs and piloted on a Pacific
Island population in 2009. The material begins with a discussion of the different
reasons people remit and the different factors that enter into the choice of
method of remitting, such as cost, speed, convenience to the sender and to the
receiver, familiarity, trust, and other services offered by the financial provider.
The main focus is then on understanding the components of remittance costs,
teaching strategies for reducing these costs, and highlighting sources of infor-
mation for comparing costs and learning about new remittance products. This
included explaining the fixed-fee and exchange rate commission components of
the cost and illustrating how much they vary across different providers, showing
how the transaction costs fall with the amount sent so that bundling smaller
transactions into one large transaction saves costs, and providing information
about the sendmoneypacific website for comparing costs and about the Westpac
direct debit card as a new product.
    The remittance material was then adapted for the East Asian and Sri Lankan
populations. Since sendmoneypacific does not cover remittance transactions for
these remittance corridors, both groups were given instructions and shown how
to obtain rates and the expected amount received on the Western Union website,
plus ANZ Bank online and fxcompared.com for the Sri Lankans, and MoneyBookers
for the East Asians in New Zealand.
    Initially we had planned that the financial literacy training would focus just
on remittances, but inspection of the baseline survey data from the Pacific Island
group indicated that very few of the participants had credit cards, and a lack of
awareness of this credit channel was corroborated by qualitative discussions with
participants. For the Pacific Island group only, we therefore expanded the material
covered in the financial literacy training to also include comparisons of sources of
credit, especially in terms of their annual percentage rate of interest. The teaching
material was based on examples of advertisements for payday lenders and other
short-term finance companies that used prominent sports stars to target Pacific
Islanders (e.g., figure 1.1a). The participants were taught how to calculate credit
interest rates so they could compare the annual cost of a payday or short-term

                loan or hire purchase with the cost of obtaining the same funds either as a cash
                advance or a purchase with a credit card.
                    The randomly chosen survey respondents were then invited to the financial
                literacy training sessions, which were held at multiple times and venues to ensure
                maximum participation from those who were invited. These were typically held
                at churches, community centers, and sports clubs and were usually for groups of
                about 30 at a time and took about two hours. In addition to a presentation of about
                25 PowerPoint slides, written material was handed out and there were worked
                examples and continuous discussion with the community. As noted above, the
                presenters were all members of the immigrant groups themselves to break down
                any cross-cultural communication barriers. It was emphasized that the aim of
                the training was not to advocate for any one particular remittance provider but
                instead aimed to help the participants become more informed consumers who
                could shop around for better remittance deals (see figure 1.1b as an example).
                    The attendance rate for the training session was 148 out of 177 for the
                Pacific Island treatment group (84 percent); 3 members of the control group also
                attended (1.7  percent), accompanying friends in the treatment group. For the
                East Asian migrants, attendance was 112 out of 179 (63 percent) in the treatment
                group, with 26 of 173 (15 percent) in the control group attending; these latter were
                friends from the same churches as the treatment group participants. Among the
                Sri Lankans, the attendance rate was 60 out of 107 (56 percent) for the treatment
                group, and none from the control group. All analysis will be based on intent-to-
                treat effects, using the random assignment to be invited to training.

1.2.5	      Follow-up surveys
At the end of each of the following three months after the financial literacy
training, all respondents from the baseline survey were given a short follow-up
survey on their remittance activity during the past month along with questions
on major financial actions taken during the previous month, such as applying for
a credit card. In addition, the one-month survey asked several financial literacy
questions in order to measure whether financial knowledge had increased with
the literacy training. Six months after training, all participants from both the treat-
ment and control groups were invited back to community forums. A final round
follow-up survey was conducted at the start of this forum, after which both treat-
ment and control groups were given information on the main messages of the
training course and information on new products and developments in the market
that had occurred since the original intervention.
    Table 1.2 shows the attrition rates by survey round and ethnic group sample.
Attrition rates are lowest for the Pacific Island sample, averaging 5 percent at one
month, 9–10  percent at two and three months, and 14  percent at six months.
In no survey round can we reject balance between treatment and control
groups. The East Asian sample has attrition rates of 9  percent at one month,
17 percent at two months, 23 percent at three months, and then 75 percent at
six months, again balanced by treatment status. The Sri Lankan group had the
highest attrition, with 45  percent of the treatment group already attriting by
month 1 compared to 29 percent of the control group, and 76 percent attrition
in the six-month follow-up. The high attrition was attributed by the survey leader
to refusals to give contact details by some participants, along with discomfort

              discussing financial matters by some of the sample, which the invitation to the
              training may have exacerbated. Sri Lankans with lower education levels and with
              lower baseline financial literacy were more likely to attrit, although this differen-
              tial attrition did not vary with treatment status. Despite the use of door prizes
              and gifts to their community groups, the six-month attrition was high in the East
              Asian and Sri Lankan groups since these surveys were done in community events,
              which had very low attendance for these groups.7 We therefore do not use the
              six-month survey data for these two samples. Given these attrition rates, we view
              the evidence as most reliable for the Pacific Island group and for the short-term
              outcomes for the East Asians.



              1.3	RESULTS
              To estimate the impact of financial literacy training on different outcomes of
              interest, we estimate the following equation:
                                                                                s
                          Outcomei,t = a + b * Treati + c * Outcomei,0 + ∑s=1 δsdi,s + εi,s

              where Treati is a dummy variable indicating assignment to treatment, and we
              control for the lagged outcome variable where possible (McKenzie 2012) and
              dummy variables, di,s for randomization strata (Bruhn and McKenzie 2009) in
              order to maximize power. Robust (white-corrected) standard errors are reported
              in parentheses under the coefficients in the tables.


              1.3.1	     Impact on financial knowledge
              Table 1.3 examines whether the financial literacy training succeeds in increasing
              the knowledge migrants have about the costs of remitting and of using credit.
              We see large short-term impacts on financial knowledge for the Pacific Island
              sample—they are 16  percentage points more likely to know it is cheaper to
              bundle remittances into a larger transaction, 52  percentage points more likely
              to know the ATM/prepaid debit card is the cheapest method of remitting among
              the options asked about, 29  percentage points more likely to know that only
              paying the minimum on a credit card is more expensive than paying more than
              the minimum, and 29 percentage points more likely to know that payday loans are
              more expensive than credit cards or hire purchase. All of these impacts are signif-
              icant at the 1 percent level; as a result, the average knowledge score, which is a
              mean of these four questions, also shows a positive and significant effect. There

              incentive design plus all aspects of the study had received prior ethical approval from the

is some suggestion of a decline in this knowledge on several questions at the
six-month follow-up survey, but even at six months migrants who were assigned
to training are more likely to understand the exchange rate commission and to
know that payday loans are more expensive than credit cards or hire purchase.
Consistent with other studies of financial literacy (Carpena et al. 2011), we find
no impact on computational measures of financial literacy such as the ability to
correctly calculate the APR on a payday loan or to understand compound interest
(which was not taught in the course).
     We also see some increases in financial knowledge about remittances for
the other two groups: East Asian migrants are 12 percentage points more likely
to know that it is cheaper to bundle remittances into a larger transaction, and
10  percentage points more likely to know the cheapest method for remitting.
Sri Lankan migrants saw an increase in knowledge of the cheapest method, but
no increase (from a high base) in knowledge on remittance bundling. The Sri
48  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              Lankan results should be caveated by the high and differential attrition rates.
              Recall that credit issues were not covered in the financial literacy training for the
              other two groups. Consistent with this, we find no increase in knowledge about
              credit among the East Asians (and the questions were not asked in the Sri Lankan
              sample).


              1.3.2	     Impact on information seeking and budgeting
              Our follow-up surveys asked each month whether respondents had used any
              source of information to compare the costs of remitting across methods or prod-
              ucts, and if so, what information source they had used. Since our intervention
              focused on the use of several Internet comparison sites, we are particularly inter-
              ested in whether participants use the Internet more to compare remitting costs
              as a result of the intervention. Finally, our surveys at one month and six months
              also asked whether individuals always keep track of how much they spend each
              month. The financial literacy course made no mention of doing this, and we would
              thus not expect to see effects. It therefore serves as a check on reporting bias, to
              ensure that individuals who attended training are not just reporting that they do
              more of every perceived desirable financial behavior.
                  Table 1.4 examines whether the increase in knowledge about the costs of
              remitting leads to changes in behavior. We see that in the short term, assignment
              to training leads to the Pacific Island and East Asian migrants being more likely
              to use information to compare remitting costs and to be more likely to use the
              Internet to compare costs, with no impact on keeping track of monthly expenses.
              However, the strongest impacts are found in the month right after the training,
              with no impacts on the use of the Internet at three or six months. The impacts
              are positive, but not statistically significant for the Sri Lankan sample, which may
              reflect imprecision due to the smaller sample size, or the impacts of differential
              attrition by treatment status, or perhaps that the effects are weaker for this group
              since the majority already used one of the cheapest methods anyway.


              1.3.3	     Impact on remitting frequency and amount
              Next we examine whether the financial literacy training had any impact on either
              the likelihood of sending remittances or on the total amount remitted. Ex ante it
              is not clear what direction we should expect the effect of financial literacy training
              to be—the content on bundling transactions together into a few, less frequent,
              larger transactions would be expected to reduce the frequency of remitting
              while having no impact on the total amount sent; whereas content that stresses
              cheaper methods of remitting may lead individuals to be more willing to make
              smaller transactions and therefore increase frequency and potentially also lead
              to individuals sending more remittances (Aycinena, Martínez, and Yang 2010;
              Gibson, McKenzie, and Rohorua 2006).

Note: See table 1.3.




     Table 1.5 shows that the financial literacy training had no significant impacts
on either the likelihood of remitting or on the total amounts remitted for any
of the three groups. Moreover, in some cases, these are relatively precise zero
effects. For example, averaging observations over all four follow-up surveys for
the Pacific Island sample, the point estimate on the monthly frequency of remit-
ting is −0.02, with a 95 percent confidence interval of (−0.077, +0.036). That is, we
can rule out that the training had large positive effects on remitting frequency,
and also rule out large negative impacts. Remittance amounts have more vari-
ation, but even so, we have a point estimate for the Pacific Island sample of an
increase of $NZ 4, with a 95 percent confidence interval of (−$NZ 63, +$NZ 71) for
total remittances over six months—which is small both in absolute terms and
when compared to the median annual income of $NZ 20,000–30,000 for Pacific
Islanders in our sample.


1.3.4	         Impact on remitting channel
Even if immigrants do not change their frequency of remitting or the amount
remitted, they may still benefit from the training if it causes them to change
the method they use to remit. In table 1.6, we examine whether migrants in

                   our samples use a different method of remitting in any of the follow-up surveys
                   compared to that which they had used in the 12 months prior to the baseline
                   survey. We see that in the Pacific Island sample, 16 percent of the control group
                   use a different method at least once during the four follow-up surveys, and finan-
                   cial literacy training leads to a significant reduction of this, halving the rate of
                   switching to new products. Recall that the training introduced these migrants
                   to a new product, the Westpac Express prepaid card, but we see no increase in
                   usage of this among those treated. Instead, the main effect appears to be fewer
                   individuals switching from Western Union or Melie Mei Langi to use either Mana
                   or Epokifo’ou, two less used methods. Mana is a church-based money transfer
                   method with a low fixed fee ($NZ 5–8) but an unfavorable exchange rate, so that
                   for the median remittance it is the most expensive of the money transfer opera-
                   tors. Moreover, Mana is not included on the sendmoneypacific website. Epokifo’ou
                   is a money transfer organization that had very similar costs to Melie Mei Langi for
                   much of our sample period, and that was slightly cheaper than Western Union.
                   So the main effect seems to be to stop people from switching to methods that
                   provide little or no benefit to switching, or for which it is less easy to track costs.
                           We find no significant impact on switching methods for the other two groups.
                   For the East Asians, this in part reflects the low frequency of remitting overall,
                   meaning that there are a small number of transactions to look at switching over.
                   For the Sri Lankans, most immigrants were using a relatively cheap method at

baseline, implying relatively little to be gained from switching (and also we have
the caveat of high and unbalanced attrition).


1.3.5	        Impacts on credit
Finally, we examine whether the credit portion of the financial literacy training led
to individuals being more or less likely to have certain forms of credit in our final
survey round. We restrict our analysis here to the Pacific Island sample, since the
other two groups did not have credit covered in their financial literacy training,
and because these other two groups had such high attrition in the final round
survey.
     Table 1.7 shows the credit impacts of the financial literacy training. We do
not see any significant impacts on individuals having checking accounts, savings
accounts, or ATM cards. Despite the emphasis in training on the Westpac prepaid
card being the cheapest method to send, and credit cards being a cheaper source
of financing, we do not see significant increases in usage of either. Despite (or
perhaps as a result of) media coverage of the high cost of payday loans (e.g.,
Waikato Times 2012), we find no one in our sample who said they had applied for
a payday loan. This may be genuine, or reflect reluctance to admit use of this form
of credit (Karlan and Zinman 2008). What we do see are positive and significant
impacts on obtaining hire purchase loans and on other loans. Qualitative discus-
sions reveal that the hire purchase loans were the result of special promotions

                   loans were extended family ROSCAs, which respondents said they had set up to
                   avoid the high costs of payday loans. Taken together, this suggests some potential
                   positive impact of the training, although since we do not measure any reduction
                   in use of other, more expensive forms of credit, this use of cheaper forms of credit
                   may lead to an increase in credit usage—which is of uncertain overall welfare
                   effect.

                                been?
                   Individuals who attended training were asked in the one-month follow-up
                   whether it had been useful, whether they would recommend it to friends and
                   family, what the most useful topic was, and whether they had changed behavior
                   as a result. Among the Pacific Island group, all participants said it was very
                   useful and that they would recommend it to others. The topic rated most useful
                   was on the different costs and methods of sending money, with a number also
                   mentioning information on credit cards as useful. Sixty percent of respondents
                   said they had changed behavior as a result, with the main change being the use
                   of the website to compare costs, and asking around for better rates. For the East
                   Asians, 80  percent of those attending said it was useful and 75  percent would
                   recommend it to others, with the most useful knowledge being about remit-
                   tance fees. Only 21 percent said they had changed behavior, mostly in terms of
                   examining the costs of sending money. Among the Sri Lankan sample, 91 percent
                   of those answering the follow-up survey said the training had been useful, but
                   only 2 people in the Sri Lankan sample who had attended training said they had
                   changed their behavior as a result. These direct reports are therefore consis-
                   tent with the empirical results, suggesting that there was a knowledge increase,
                   and some changes in information-seeking behavior for the Pacific Island group in
                   particular, but no big changes in remitting behavior.

1.4	DISCUSSION
The training did succeed in increasing financial knowledge about the components
of remittance costs and in getting people to search for more information about
the costs of sending money. It was fairly cheap to deliver—courses were typi-
cally taught in churches or other community spaces; and once the content was
developed, the main costs were the time of the trainer, and snacks and refresh-
ments for those attending—for an approximate cost of $NZ 20–30 per attendee.
Given these low costs, the benefits observed in knowledge and behavior may be
enough to justify providing this course.
    Nonetheless, despite the emphasis on the Westpac prepaid debit card as
the lowest cost of remitting, and credit cards as a low cost of obtaining credit
for the Pacific Island sample, we do not see any impact on these outcomes. The
final round survey asked people why they were not using the cheapest method of
remitting; 41 percent replied that another method was more convenient for them,
and 55 percent that another method was more convenient for the receiver. The
latter is consistent with Gibson et al. (2007), who show the geographic spread of
ATM facilities in Tonga covers a lower share of the population than Western Union
offices. Further evidence of the lack of take-up of low-cost technologies in the
Pacific Islands comes from two other methods: the Internet-only money transfer
operator KlickEx had the lowest costs overall but was unused by participants
throughout our study. In October 2011, KlickEx linked with a major mobile phone
provider, Digicel, to offer remittance transfers into a mobile wallet in Tonga,
Samoa, or Fiji which could then be withdrawn as cash, again at very low transac-
tion costs. To date, this new method seems to have very low take-up.
    One reason that convenience may win out is that the amounts saved through
better financial literacy may just be too trivial to warrant action. This is especially
the case for the East Asians (who tend not to remit that much, and when they
do, remit large amounts), and the Sri Lankans (who were using cheap methods
to start with). But even for the Pacific Island sample, the savings from switching
to one of these cheapest methods might amount to $NZ 6–12 per $NZ 200 trans-
action, which may only merit the costs of learning a new method and trying it
out if people remit very frequently. Given that the baseline survey revealed an
average frequency of remitting for the Pacific Island sample of five times per year,
the annual saving from switching to the cheapest methods is just $NZ 30–60.
The scope for changes in ultimate outcomes may be greater for financial literacy
transactions that focus more on saving and budgeting behavior, or those that
allow people at risk of obtaining expensive credit to avoid very expensive loans
(e.g., Bertrand and Morse 2011).

              1.5	CONCLUSIONS
              Our results show that simple financial education training for migrants can change
              their knowledge about the costs of remitting and lead them to look around more
              regarding prices. There is also some suggestive evidence from the Pacific Island
              sample that coupling this with information on different sources of credit may help
              migrants avoid some of the most expensive forms of credit. Nevertheless, we find
              no big changes in ultimate outcomes—migrants avoid switching to more expen-
              sive or less transparent remittance channels, but do not change the amount or
              frequency of remitting.
                  Thus, despite simply informing remitters about remittance costs being a
              relatively cheap and uncontroversial intervention, it will not necessarily lower
              average costs from remitters switching to cheaper methods. Instead, govern-
              ments targeting reduced average money transfer costs may need to address other
              barriers, which may include excessive regulation and exclusive arrangements
              made by state-owned entities that deter new entry into remittance corridors, and
              financial access on the receiving country side. It is also possible that the mere
              process of providing transparent information on the costs of remitting by different
              methods will lower costs through competition, without migrants needing to switch
              providers. For example, transfer fees from New Zealand to the Pacific Islands have
              fallen since the launch of sendmoneypacific—although how much can be attribut-
              able to the website rather than other market events is an open research question.
                  As far as financial education itself, though, a further implication of this work
              is that the case for providing financial literacy training for migrants needs to rest
              on other criteria than the financial savings from cheaper remittances, such as the
              improvements in their capabilities from being more informed customers, and the
              potential savings from other aspects of financial management such as choice of
              debt levels and instruments. Experimenting further with additional content on
              budgeting, saving, and debt management seems a fruitful area for policy refine-
              ment.

ABSTRACT
     This chapter demonstrates that a high-quality financial education program
     targeted at youth can improve financial knowledge, attitudes, and behavior.
     We collaborate with a national partnership of major financial and educa-
     tional actors in Brazil to conduct a large-scale randomized evaluation of a
     comprehensive financial education program for high school students. The
     study spans 6 states, 868 schools, and approximately 20,000 students aged
     15–17. The program increases student financial knowledge by a quarter of a
     standard deviation and shifts the distribution of financial proficiency scores
     rightward. The change in knowledge leads to a 1.4 percentage point increase
     in savings—a large and economically significant effect. A complementary
     workshop for parents induces their children to save even more. Both current
     attitudes and new forward-looking indexes of intentions to save and financial

              2.1	INTRODUCTION
              Navigating today’s financial markets can be a difficult task. Financial systems have
              grown in complexity and sophistication, often outpacing the capacity of individ-
              uals and families to make informed financial choices (Lusardi and Mitchell 2007;
              Lusardi, Mitchell, and Curto 2010). Personal financial decisions are further compli-
              cated by the rapid infusion of cleverly marketed consumer products that are often
              coupled with expensive credit and installment plan offers. These advancements
              have heightened the risk of misplaced or misinformed spending decisions that
              can lead to real and long-lasting financial burdens on household budgets. Indeed,
              the personal bankruptcy rates even in developed countries such as the United
              States have skyrocketed, increasing by as much as 20  percent annually during
              the recent financial crisis (Administrative Office of the United States Courts 2012).
                  The policy response to these troubling trends has been to introduce proac-
              tive measures on both the supply and demand sides. On the supply side, many
              countries now have consumer protection bureaus that are tasked with ensuring
              financial providers adopt and adhere to transparent consumer disclosure laws.
              On the demand side, there has been a significant push to educate the public
              on financial matters through various financial literacy programs, though rigorous
              evidence on their effectiveness remains scarce (Cole, Sampson, and Zia 2011).
                  This chapter makes a significant contribution to the literature by experimen-
              tally testing a comprehensive approach to financial education for youth in Brazil.
              We collaborate with a national partnership of major financial and educational
              actors in Brazil and study the causal impact of their state-of-the-art financial
              education program for high school students. We measure changes in financial
              knowledge, preferences, and attitudes toward current and future financial deci-
              sions, and also saving and spending behavior.
                  We focus our study on youth for a number of important reasons. First, good
              financial habits formed at an early age are likely to benefit schooling, employ-
              ment, and standards of living throughout adulthood. Second, well-informed
              students have the opportunity to affect not only their own financial choices, but
              also to act as agents of change in their households’ financial decisions. Third,
              behavioral evidence suggests that individuals display anomalies in their prefer-
              ences and that these anomalies may be related to variations in cognitive ability.
              In a study of Chilean high school students, Benjamin, Brown, and Shapiro (2012)
              find evidence that small-stakes risk aversion and short-run discounting are less
              common among those with higher standardized test scores. This raises the
              question of whether improving knowledge and understanding of intertemporal
                                                    2.  Financial education and behavior formation   ◾ 61




choices for youth can lower the demands on cognitive resources and improve
current and future financial decisions and attitudes. Further, the focus on youth
leverages their learning capacity as students who are primed to absorb, recall,
and apply learning in school. Finally, despite the potential benefits of financial
education for youth, we simply do not know what works; and the few existing
studies either show conflicting results, are too narrowly focused, or suffer from
important identification concerns.1
        To date, our study is the largest randomized evaluation in the financial educa-
tion literature, with a sample of six Brazilian states—São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro,
Ceará, Tocantìns, Minas Gerais, and the Federal District; 868 public high schools;
and approximately 20,000 students. As part of the study design, schools were
first stratified by state, pair-wise matched by school and community character-
istics, and then randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. The study
spanned three academic semesters, from August 2010 to December 2011,
and data were collected in three rounds consisting of baseline (August 2010),
follow-up 1 (December 2010), and follow-up 2 (December 2011).
        The financial education program included study materials, teacher training,
monitoring, and participation awards. Unlike typical financial education programs
that involve external instructors providing one-off classes on financial education,
our program spanned 18 months; was delivered by regular teachers; and was
integrated in classroom mathematics, science, history, and Portuguese curricula.
The instruction used new textbooks with interactive classroom exercises on
financial education themes, take-home exercises such as creating household
budgets with parents, and role-playing assignments such as visiting local markets
and organizing class graduation parties. The curriculum was complemented by
extensive teacher training, web learning tools, and instructor handbooks. The
textbooks and implementation strategy were developed in collaboration with
representatives of the financial and education sectors. Finally, schools with high
levels of survey participation received awards and public recognition. As such,
the program’s intensity of treatment was much stronger than for other financial
education interventions.
        The results show significant improvements in financial knowledge, attitudes,
and behavior. Specifically, we find a quarter of a standard deviation increase in
the financial knowledge of students, as measured by an SAT-like financial profi-
ciency test. Importantly, the entire distribution of scores shifts to the right with
students at all levels of capability showing marked improvements in testing. The
knowledge gains help students improve their current financial behavior, with a
statistically significant increase of 1.4  percentage points in savings and signifi-
cant improvements in the likelihood of making budgets and negotiating prices and
payment methods.

                  While these changes in current behavior are important, as many students in
              our sample have part-time jobs and hence the option to save, of equal importance
              are their preferences and attitudes toward future financial decisions. To better
              understand this potential, a local education survey firm specializing in school-based
              evaluations helped develop and test two new forward-looking indicators of finan-
              cial behavior in our sample—student financial autonomy and intention to save. The
              financial autonomy index aggregates a series of questions designed to measure
              whether students feel empowered, confident, and capable of making independent
              financial decisions and influencing the financial decisions of their households. The
              intention to save index includes a series of questions that identify preferences over
              future and hypothetical savings and spending scenarios. The analysis finds strong
              and statistically significant treatment effects on both these measures, with an
              effect size ranging between 0.08 and 0.12 of a standard deviation.
                  Next, we turn to the household and investigate treatment effects on parents
              of high school students in two distinct ways. First, we measure “trickle-up”
              impacts of our financial education treatment for students. Many of the take-home
              exercises involved interaction with parents, such as making household budgets or
              researching and comparing interest rates on savings accounts. We survey parents
              and identify several important findings. As proof of concept, we find that parents
              in treatment schools are significantly more likely to report that their children
              discuss financial matters with them at home and that they volunteer to help orga-
              nize household budgets. In addition, we detect improvements in parental finan-
              cial knowledge on standard financial literacy questions used in the literature. And
              finally, we find significant improvements in parental financial behaviors, with an
              increase of 0.67 percentage points in savings and improvements in the likelihood
              of keeping household budgets.
                  We also study household-level effects through a standard adult workshop
              on financial education for parents. This involved a DVD-based intervention where
              parents in treated schools were randomly assigned to either a financial educa-
              tion screening or a health education screening. Although the attendance at these
              workshops was low, we detect further improvements in the savings rates of
              students from families that attended the financial education workshops. Hence,
              these workshops helped parents reinforce the messages taught to the students.
                  Overall, our study shows that financial education can be an effective tool
              in improving financial outcomes of students when delivered in a comprehensive
              manner and over a significant period of time. Also, key complementary benefits
              can be derived by involving the entire household—students and parents—as indi-
              cated by our trickle-up and parents’ workshop impacts. Finally, it is important
              to distinguish our study from others in the literature based on scope and scale.
              Specifically, the large sample size and breadth of coverage through six of the
              most populated states in Brazil provides strong support for the external validity
              of our findings and the generalizability of the results. Moreover, our careful eval-
              uation has led to significant and real policy impact as the Ministry of Education

in Brazil has recently agreed to expand the financial education program to 3,000
new schools across the country after reviewing evidence from our study. Other
countries in the region have approached us and our country partners so that they
can learn and adopt a similar program in their respective education systems.
    This chapter proceeds as follows. Section 2.2 summarizes the literature
on financial education for youth and details the Brazilian context. Section  2.3
discusses the financial education curriculum, and section 2.4 presents the
research and sampling methodology as well as the study timeline. Section 2.5
describes the data collection, and section 2.6 presents summary statistics and
analysis on process evaluation. Section 2.7 discusses the main results, section 2.8
discusses the impact of our study, and section 2.9 concludes.



2.2	      BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT

2.2.1	    Financial education for youth
There is a growing literature on financial education and its determinants for youth,
but much of the evidence comes from developed rather than developing coun-
tries. A consistent finding among these studies is that financial literacy tends to
peak among adults in the middle of the life cycle, and is significantly lower among
youth. In the United States, for example, those in the prime age group (25–65) tend
to perform about 5 percent better on financial literacy questions than those under
25 (Lusardi and Mitchell 2011). Strikingly, Lusardi, Mitchell, and Curto (2009) find
that less than a third of American teenagers (ages 12–17) possess basic knowl-
edge of interest rates, inflation, and risk diversification. Mandell (2006) notes
that there is even evidence that youth financial literacy has been declining in the
United States since the late 1990s. Similar evidence comes from Australia, where
Beal and Delpachitra (2003) identify low levels of financial literacy among youth.
    Perhaps in response to such trends, policy makers around the world have
made financial education for youth a priority, with many school-based initiatives
now part of education reform. Yet the impacts of such school programs on finan-
cial knowledge and behavior are still not well understood and even contradictory.
For example, Bernheim, Garrett, and Maki (2001) employ a difference-in-difference
approach to analyze the impact of state high school financial education mandates
on savings behavior in the United States; they find that mandates appear to effec-
tively increase exposure to financial education and have a significant subsequent
effect on future saving. However, Cole and Shastry (2009) replicate and extend the
analysis using a much larger sample from U.S. census data and find, in contrast, no
significant impact of high school financial education on future saving.
    Other studies have also shown mixed results. Carlin and Robinson (2010) study
the effects of a financial literacy course for high school students in the United
States that involved role-playing fictitious budget situations following 19 hours
64  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              of financial training that included credit card management, taxes, budgeting, and
              simple investments (Junior Achievement Finance Park). The simple pre-post anal-
              ysis shows that training raised completion rates (successfully crafting a balanced
              budget) from 5 percent to over 50 percent, and savings increased fourfold from
              pretreatment levels. At the same time, however, treated students were worse
              at judging a health insurance plan that had higher monthly premiums but lower
              out-of-pocket costs. Similarly, Walstad, Rebeck, and MacDonald (2010) study the
              effects of a DVD-based curriculum for high school students on financial knowledge
              (Financing Your Future). The five video segments cover such topics as savings,
              money management, banking, credit and debt, and investing, and comprise six
              hours of instruction. They find that students who participated in the education
              program showed a significant gain in financial knowledge (as measured by pre-
              and post-test scores) compared to students in a matched control group, but they
              do not study subsequent behavior change.
                  Randomized evaluations of school-based financial education programs are
              scarce; in fact, we are aware of only two other such studies. Berry, Karlan, and
              Pradhan (2012) conduct an evaluation of a program offering voluntary after-
              school clubs in Ghana for primary and junior high students in 135 schools over a
              10-month period. The study randomly assigns a group of fifth and seventh graders
              to a social and financial treatment and another to basic training. It is not clear
              how exposed students are to financial decision making at such a young age, and
              eliciting reliable and consistent responses in this age group is generally difficult;
              hence there are some measurement concerns. The treatment is also short and
              participation voluntary. The findings are unsurprisingly muted—while the study
              identifies some effects on saving, there are no improvements in financial knowl-
              edge, test scores, or social and psychological measures.
                  Another experiment is a study among 17- to 19-year-old high school students
              in Italy. Becchetti, Caiazza, and Coviello (2011) offer a 16-hour-long course on
              finance over three months and find positive effects on financial knowledge.
              However, a follow-up study (Becchetti and Pisani 2012) cautions that these
              increases may be due to students adapting to repeated financial literacy tests
              rather than conceptual learning.
                  One other recent study is an evaluation of financial education in German high
              schools. Lührmann, Serra-Garcia, and Winter (2012) evaluate 90-minute financial
              education sessions delivered to 14–16-year-old students in lower-stream high
              schools. While their findings show significant improvements in financial knowl-
              edge and a hypothetical savings scenario, their follow-up period is very short,
              only one to three weeks after the intervention. Furthermore, schools are chosen
              to receive financial education sessions based on how busy teachers feel they are
              with students prior to the end of the academic year; this raises serious selection
              concerns since teachers in control schools may also be dealing with relatively
              poorly performing students or other unobserved underlying student, class, or
              school characteristics. Finally, their sample size is extremely small—less than
                                          2.  Financial education and behavior formation   ◾ 65




50 schools in the entire sample, some of which they had to drop. Such a small
sample raises concerns about the external validity of the findings.
    While the lack of strong evidence on the impact of financial education for
youth is striking, one key lesson that emerges from this work is that financial
education tends to be more effective when it is targeted to the specific needs
and desires of the audience. For instance, Varcoe et al. (2005) evaluate a program
(Money Talks) in which teenagers in various settings (including juvenile halls,
migrant education programs, pregnancy and parenting programs, public high
schools, and youth groups) were solicited with regard to topics, format, and when
and where to receive financial education information. The curriculum took the
form of four newsletters targeted to 13–18-year-olds which covered different
topics, including savings habits, shopping tips, car costs, and money values.
The authors find positive changes in both knowledge and behavior, although
self-selection and the requirement of a parent-signed permission slip raise some
important identification concerns. The apparent success of the targeting strategy
behind this program, however, seems to be corroborated by Mandell and Klein
(2007), who highlight the importance of motivation and goal setting in increasing
the relevance of financial education for youth.
    The importance of targeting has been borne out in studies outside the youth
segment as well. For example, Duflo and Saez (2003) find positive impacts of
a financial education program focused on retirement savings for university
employees. Similarly, the only currently completed randomized evaluation of
a financial education program for households in developing countries (Cole,
Sampson, and Zia 2011) finds significantly greater effects of financial education on
the likelihood of opening a bank account for household heads with low education
and below-median baseline levels of financial literacy.
    Against the state of the existing literature on financial education, our study
fills an important gap by focusing on financial education in high schools and using
rigorous methodology. Specifically, our study brings together: (1) a randomized
evaluation methodology, (2) a comprehensive financial education intervention
that lasted three full semesters over 18 months, (3) a very large sample size (868
schools and nearly 20,000 students), (4) widespread coverage over six states
in Brazil, and (5) a unique set of forward-looking outcome measures developed
specifically for the youth segment of the population. As such, our study offers
new insights into the impact of financial education for youth.


2.2.2	    The Brazilian context
Brazil’s low saving and investment rates and low levels of awareness on financial
matters among the population have triggered a national policy response led by
the financial sector. National savings are around 16  percent of gross domestic
product (GDP) overall, and levels of financial awareness are low. A survey
conducted by the Instituto Data Popular in 2008 shows that 82 percent of Brazilian
66  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              consumers are unaware of the interest rate when borrowing money. Against this
              background, the financial sector recently introduced the idea of financial literacy
              as a mechanism to improve awareness and understanding, build personal finance
              skills, stimulate savings, and broaden the use of financial services, with the goal
              of improving consumers’ ability to make decisions that are beneficial to their
              financial well-being.
                  The early steps in the establishment of a national policy of financial educa-
              tion were taken in the mid-2000s. In 2007, the Supervisory and Regulatory
              Committee of Financial Systems, Capital Markets, Private Insurance, and Social
              Welfare (COREMEC) approved the creation of a working group to develop and
              propose—under the coordination of the Brazilian Securities and Exchange
              Commission (CVM [Comissão de Valores Mobiliários])—a National Strategy for
              Financial Education. This group included representatives from public financial
              institutions including CVM, the Central Bank, and pensions and insurance regu-
              latory agencies (Superintendência Nacional de Previdência Complementar and
              Superintendência de Seguros Privados). The group also included civil society insti-
              tutions and select private sector institutions such as the Brazilian Association
              of Financial and Capital Markets (ANBIMA [Associação Brasileira das Entidades
              dos Mercados Financeiro e de Capitais]), Brazilian Securities, the Brazilian Securi-
              ties, Commodities, and Futures Exchange (BM&FBOVESPA), and the Federation of
              Brazilian Banks (FEBRABAN [Federação Brasileira de Bancos]). After the working
              group fulfilled its purpose, a new committee, the National Committee on Financial
              Education (CONFEF), which includes ministers of education, justice, finance, and
              social security, was created to spearhead the financial education agenda.
                  The National Strategy was launched in 2010 with the goal of fostering a
              culture of financial education in the country, enabling citizens to make sound
              financial decisions, and contributing to the efficiency of financial markets. Its
              scope is national, targeting children, youth, and adults; and its goals ambitious,
              involving a large sector of actors and a multiplicity of delivery mechanisms for
              financial education.
                  In parallel with the National Strategy, a Pedagogical Support Group (GAP
              [Grupo de Apojo Pedagógico]) was established in 2008 to bring in the federal
              Ministry of Education and the municipal and state secretariats of education to
              work together with these financial institutions. The GAP also included the National
              Council of Education Secretaries (CONSED [Conselho Nacional de Secretários de
              Educação]) and the National Union of Municipal Directors of Education, (UNDIME
              [União Nacional dos Dirigentes Municipais de Educação]). The GAP’s creation was
              a critical step in mobilizing the development of a school curriculum for basic and
              high school education and planning for its introduction in public school educa-
              tion. The priority for the collaboration between top educators and financial sector
              experts was the design of the high school program, the first program that would
              be piloted to ascertain its value in youth’s behavior formation and their ability to
              serve as a vehicle for social and household change. The plan was for financial
                                           2.  Financial education and behavior formation   ◾ 67




education to be introduced not as a separate subject, but as material teachers
could use to supplement their regular school curriculum.
     In 2009, the World Bank was asked to evaluate the impact of the high school
pilot program, with the objective of applying rigorous economic research methods
to establish the causal impact of financial education on student and household
financial knowledge, attitudes, and behavior. The results would be used as an
independent assessment to inform improvements to, and the eventual national
scale-up of, the program. CVM coordinated the pilot project, with collaboration
and support from BM&FBOVESPA, ANBIMA, FEBRABAN, Instituto Unibanco, and
Citi Foundation. The World Bank worked with the GAP to agree on study proto-
cols, including scale of the pilot to ensure statistical power, geographical scope
to ensure external validity, experimental design to ensure unbiased results, and
roll-out of the pilot to ensure feasibility. The World Bank partnered with the Center
for Public Policy and Education Evaluation (CAEd [Centro de Políticas Públicas
e Avaliação da Educação]) for its experience and expertise in the design and
implementation of student education surveys in Brazilian schools. The pilot was
launched in 2010 according to the agreed protocols.



2.3	      FINANCIAL EDUCATION CURRICULUM
The financial education curriculum consists of didactically innovative material
designed to capture the interest of young adults and be relevant to their lives.
It consists of 72 case studies that can be integrated into regular school subjects
such as mathematics, Portuguese, science, geography, and history. The decision
to incorporate financial education into other subjects instead of forming a sepa-
rate class was taken in collaboration with the federal ministry of education.
     In contrast to typical seminar-based financial literacy programs that are
delivered in one shot and vary in length from 90 minutes to a few hours, the
case study–based program in our study provides material for between 72 and
144 hours of teaching (1–2 hours per case study), spread out over one and a half
school years (three semesters).2 The material is interactive and includes exer-
cises that the students complete with their parents (e.g., household budgeting
and planning).
     The program trained teachers in advance through an introductory seminar
that lasted one to two days and a reference DVD, and made available a training
website with distance education material which remains active throughout the
program. Teacher training was also important for generating interest and support
for the program, which ultimately led to a large fraction of teachers applying the
financial education material in class (see section 2.6.1). The intensity and scope of



 The material was developed by the GAP; the complete outline of the curriculum is in

annex B to this chapter.
68  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              the intervention is significantly stronger than is the case in other financial educa-
              tion programs or evaluations.
                  The student textbook is divided into three blocks and covers nine themes:
              family life, social life, personal property, work, entrepreneurship, large expen-
              ditures, public goods, country economy, and world economy. These themes
              were chosen to provide a solid foundation of knowledge on financial issues
              and to address the specific financial education needs of high school students.
              More specifically, the program aimed at providing students with tools to over-
              come financial challenges they were facing or were about to face, such as family
              finances, entry into the labor market or further studies, and preparing for financial
              independence.
                  The themes are taught through 72 didactic situations that include theoretical
              and applied content, exercises and activities, as well as self-evaluative questions.
              These case studies make use of texts, stories, images, and tables to convey the
              material in an accessible way. They also contain “experiment” sections designed
              to make the material relevant to students’ daily life. For example, when discussing
              the international economy, students are asked to identify the imported products
              they use in everyday life. Each case study concludes with a short outline of what
              students are expected to learn.
                  The first three themes (family life, social life, and personal property) introduce
              students to the concepts of budgeting, separating personal and family expendi-
              tures, and differentiating between fixed and variable spending. These concepts
              are similar to those used in standard financial education programs for adults, but
              adapted and simplified for the youth audience. For example, instead of making a
              household budget for which the student may not yet be responsible, students are
              instead asked to involve their parents in discussing and writing out a household
              budget. Not only do such exercises promote student financial education, they
              also promote dialogue on financial matters between students and their family
              financial decision makers.
                  The work and entrepreneurship themes discuss professional growth and
              practical issues in starting and running a business. Students are asked to think
              about their professional ambitions and talents and relate them to different sorts
              of jobs or business opportunities. Concepts such as gross and net income, struc-
              tural unemployment, retirement planning, and the main aspects of the creation
              and execution of a good business idea are analyzed.
                  In the large expenditures theme, students experience situations that involve
              large financial outlays, such as home purchases or planning a school graduation
              party. One of the exercises involves students in fundraising, planning, and orga-
              nizing an end-of-year class celebration.
                  The public goods theme addresses several issues related to the use and
              financing of public goods and services, among them the payment of taxes,
              government efficiency, corruption, and basic economic notions of the nature of
              public goods.
                                             2.  Financial education and behavior formation   ◾ 69




     Finally, the country economy and world economy themes expose students
to aspects of the national and international economies that are relevant to their
personal lives. Some of the important concepts discussed with students are infla-
tion, the law of supply and demand, the concept of minimum wage, supervisors of
the national financial system, imports and exports, international economic blocs,
and measures of a country’s well-being.
     Teacher guidelines explain how to integrate the financial education case
studies in the regular curriculum. These can be used in any order at the discretion
of the teacher, but with strict guidelines on exposure of conceptual material.



2.4	        RESEARCH DESIGN, SAMPLING, AND TIMELINE
This section discusses our research design, sampling methodology, and project
timeline.


2.4.1	      Research design
The study was designed in advance of program implementation as a randomized
control trial to ensure that the causal effects of the program could be measured
accurately and precisely. The scale and scope were defined to ensure that the
study would have enough statistical power to measure and detect impacts on
all dimensions of interest and enough coverage to have strong external validity.
Finally, variation in treatment was introduced to better understand household
dynamics.
     The study evaluates two interventions in public high schools, one targeted to
high school students and one to their parents. Treatment for the student interven-
tion was assigned at the school level; treatment for the parent intervention was
assigned at the individual level within student treatment schools.3
     Student treatment schools received financial education material and teacher
training. Control schools did not receive any material or training, but participated
in surveys and testing in the same manner as the treatment schools. One 11th
grade class in each school participated in the pilot program and study. These
classes moved on to the 12th grade by the end of the study, the last year of
high school. Students in the sample were between 15 and 18 years of age at the
start of the intervention, with high repetition rates explaining the age variation. In
schools that had more than one section in the 11th grade at the start of the pilot,
the school chose which section would participate in the study.
     In year two, parents of students in treatment schools were invited to partici-
pate in a school workshop. At the workshop, they were directed to watch either a

schools.

              financial education video (workshop treatment group) or a health education video
              (workshop control group) through random assignment. Parents learned which
              video they had been assigned to watch only after they arrived at the workshop.
              The purpose of the parents’ workshop was to reinforce the messages taught to
              students in class, and to measure the combined impact of parent and student
              interventions on household-level financial outcomes and decision making. The
              reason for showing a health education video to the control group was that our
              counterparts did not think it was logistically and politically feasible to invite only
              certain parents within a school to a workshop but not others. We do not expect
              the health video to have an impact on financial outcomes.
                      The figure below summarizes the study design:

              2.4.2	        Sample selection and randomization for student
                            intervention
              Brazil is divided into 26 states and a Federal District. The Federal District and five
              states were part of the study, including three of the most populous and developed
              states (São Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Rio de Janeiro), and two states (Ceará and
              Tocantins) that represent the less developed areas of Brazil. In 2009, the Federal
              District had the highest GDP per capita in Brazil (US$28,951). Minas Gerais, Rio
              de Janeiro, and São Paulo are located in the southeast, with GDP per capita of
              US$8,289, US$12,524, and US$14,872, respectively.4 Ceará and Tocantins are
              located in the northeast and north of Brazil with GDP per capita of US$4,399 and
              US$5,960, respectively.
                      In April and May 2010, the education secretariat in each state assembled a
              list of public high schools that volunteered to participate in the financial educa-
              tion pilot program, totaling 815 schools. We divided these schools into treatment
              and control groups through stratified and matched randomization as soon as we
              received each list, so that the teacher training for treatment schools could be
              organized and conducted before the midyear school break in July. São Paulo, the
              state with the largest number of schools, sent four separate lists on different
              dates. Also, one of the project’s partner institutions (Instituto Unibanco) provided
              us with an additional list of 101 public schools that it partnered with in Rio de
              Janeiro, São Paulo, Minas Gerais, and the Federal District.




              4 
                   Currency rates as of June 2013 are used: R$1 = US$0.416916; US$1 = R$2.39883.

     For each list, we first stratified schools by whether they were located in a
municipality with above or below the median number of financial institutions per
capita. Within strata, we formed matched pairs of schools and randomly assigned
one school in each pair to be in the treatment group and the other to be in the
control group. We matched on the following school and municipal variables
to improve balance on these characteristics across the treatment and control
groups: GDP per capita of the municipality where the school is located, savings
volume per capita of the municipality where the school is located, number of
students in the school, number of teachers in the school, school drop-out rate,
and school continuation rate (percentage of students moving on to the next
grade).5 We chose these variables since they may be correlated with the impact
of the material on financial knowledge, attitudes, and behavior. We were not able
to match on variables collected through our surveys because the randomization
had to take place before the baseline survey to enable the program to train the
teachers on time. Municipal-level variables used in the randomization come from
the Brazilian Statistical Institute (IBGE [Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatís-
tica]) and refer to 2009. School-level variables used in the randomization are for
2008 and were provided by the Federal Ministry of Education (2009 data were not
yet available at the time of randomization).
     Randomization was done by the authors by computer, implying that any
differences across the treatment and control groups are due to pure chance.
After the randomization was completed, we had to move three control schools
to the treatment group manually, since some states requested that at least one
school in each school district participate in the program. We chose these schools
at random among the schools in the school district and drop them and their pairs
from the analysis. Also, after the randomization was completed, but before the
program was implemented, we discovered that 12 schools indicated by the Insti-
tuto Unibanco decided not to participate in the pilot. We drop these schools and
their pairs from the analysis. In addition, five schools had accidentally been listed
twice (three were on both the state ministry and Instituto Unibanco lists, and two
were duplicated on the state ministry lists). We randomly chose which entry to
drop (along with its pair). Another six treatment group schools from São Paulo did
not participate in any of our surveys for unknown reasons. We drop these schools

  For Ceará, we did not have numbers of teachers, drop-out rates, and continuation rates,
so we matched on the remaining variables only. For Tocantins, we did not have drop-out
rates and continuation rates, so we matched schools on the remaining variables only. Also,
since all schools in the Federal District and in Minas Gerais (Juiz de Fora) were located in the
same municipality, we only matched on school-level variables in these states. For the Rio
de Janeiro and São Paulo schools from the Instituto Unibanco list, we stratified by financial
institutions per capita, but only matched on school-level variables not municipality-level
variables, since many of these schools were located in the same municipalities, restricting
the possible matches for the remaining schools.

              from our sample along with their pairs. In the end, we are left with 868 schools for
              the analysis—432 in the treatment group and 436 in the control group. Table 2.1
              lists the number of schools in each state. Most schools are located in São Paulo,

              2.4.3	           Sample selection for parents’ intervention
              For the implementation of the parents’ workshops, treatment schools sent in a
              list of current students enrolled in the class receiving financial education during
              the spring of 2011. Only schools that sent the list were included in the study, as
              this was taken as a signal that they were willing to implement the workshop. We
              used these lists instead of relying on information from earlier surveys because of
              potential student turnover from one school year to the next.6 A total of 264 treat-
              ment schools provided a list, totaling 8,534 students.
                      We matched the lists with data from the baseline parent survey on the basis
              of the student’s name, and stratified and randomly assigned parents in each
              school into treatment and control groups. We used the following strata: (1) no
              baseline information on parents, (2) parent had low baseline financial literacy,
              and (3) parent had high baseline financial literacy. We defined the level of base-
              line financial literacy based on the number of correct answers to the two finan-
              cial literacy questions asked on the survey. About 41 percent of parents did not
              answer any question correctly. We classify these parents as having low baseline
              financial literacy. Parents who answered one or two questions correctly are clas-
              sified as having high financial literacy.
                      Each school that provided a list of their students received two separate
              lists in return: one with the names of the students whose parents would watch
              the financial education video during the school workshop (treatment group) and

                According to official statistics for school year 2009 from the National Institute for Educa-
              tion Studies and Surveys, the average repetition rate was close to 25  percent and the
              drop-out rate was almost 10 percent in our sample.

one with the names of students whose parents would watch the health video
(control group). Schools were provided the financial education and health videos
and parent exit questionnaires. Each school was responsible for organizing and
implementing the workshop at a time of its choosing and administering the ques-
tionnaire at the end of the workshop.


2.4.4	    Study timeline
The study was designed and agreed on in December 2009 and launched in the
spring of 2010. The sample selection and randomization for the student inter-
vention occurred in April–May 2010. The baseline survey was conducted in early
August 2010 among students and parents in both treatment and control schools.
The financial education program was rolled out immediately after. By mid-August
2010, teachers began using the financial education materials in the classroom.
The program continued until November 2011 for a total of three school semesters.
    Over the course of this study, two rounds of follow-up surveys were
conducted. The first follow-up survey was implemented in early December 2010,
four months after the program started. The results of this survey measure the
short-term effects of the program. A second follow-up survey was implemented
in December 2011 to assess the longer-term impacts.
    The parent intervention was introduced in May 2011, and parent outcomes
recorded through an exit survey and the December 2011 follow-up survey.



2.5	      DATA COLLECTION AND OUTCOME MEASURES
For the data collection, we partnered with CAEd of the Federal University of
Juiz de Fora, a research institute and survey firm with extensive experience in
designing and implementing knowledge tests in Brazilian schools. CAEd has a
wide network of supervisors and surveyors across Brazil, and was able to imple-
ment the survey across the schools in our sample at the same time.
    Survey implementation took three days in each school during each survey
round (baseline and both follow-ups). On the first day, CAEd staff administered a
financial knowledge test and distributed parent questionnaires to students. The
students were asked to take the parent questionnaire home, ask one of their
parents to fill out the questionnaire, and return it on one of the following days. On
the second day, students filled out a self-administered questionnaire measuring
financial attitudes and behavior. The third day provided an opportunity for any
student who had missed one or both of the previous days to fill out the test and/
or questionnaire. The student tests and questionnaires were administered in the
classroom as a regular school exam—i.e., distributed to students, supervised by
the surveyor, and collected by the surveyor at the end of the allocated time.
74  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              2.5.1	     Outcome measures
              The surveys included a financial knowledge test and behavioral questionnaire,
              which were the main instruments to collect data on outcome measures. The test
              was tailored to the program’s material and objectives.7 Teachers were not privy
              to it at any point prior, after, or even the day of the tests; and CAEd proctors were
              present in classrooms for the entire duration. The financial proficiency of students
              was then calculated based on performance on this knowledge test, with scores
              ranging from 0 to 100.
                   To assess the impact of the financial education program on future financial
              attitudes, new measures of financial autonomy and intention to save for students
              were developed. These measures are relevant to the age group of interest to
              signal current as well as future financial decision-making potential. Although
              high school students may not be exposed to a full range of financial decisions,
              a large proportion of them are in the labor market or have other type of income.
              Many have the opportunity to use mobile phones and credit cards, and to make
              purchases in installments. They also must decide to stay in school, and plan for
              their future studies and employment. Furthermore, financial education provides
              students with a knowledge base that will allow them to make more informed
              financial decisions in the future.
                   The financial autonomy measure captures student confidence, indepen-
              dence, and willingness to participate and influence household financial decisions.
              The survey asked students the extent to which they agree or disagree with state-
              ments on (1) reflexive autonomy, such as “I like to think carefully before deciding
              to buy something”; (2) emotional autonomy, such as “I am prepared to talk about
              money with my parents”; and (3) functional autonomy, such as “I always try to
              save some money to do things I really like.” Their responses were then aggregated
              into an index on financial autonomy (Micarello, Palacios, and Burgos 2012).
                   The intention to save measure aggregated responses to questions on (1) atti-
              tudes toward future behavior, such as “In my opinion, saving money every month
              is extremely beneficial”; (2) subjective norms and expectations, such as “My family
              has the habit of saving money every month”; and (3) perceptions of controlling
              one’s behavior, such as “I believe I can save a little money every month.”




              7 
                Identical tests were administered in treatment and control schools. Tests were
              constructed using item response theory (which is also used to construct the GRE and SAT
              in the United States). This implies that a series of equivalent questions were used to test
              the same concept, leading to different combinations of questions on each test. The ques-
              tions that each student received were thus likely to be different in each survey round, and
              different students within the same class received different questions. This minimizes the
              risk that students simply remember the question and correct answer without truly under-
              standing the question; it also reduces the scope for cheating. Item response theory ensures
              that tests results are comparable across students and across time.
                                          2.  Financial education and behavior formation   ◾ 75




    The student surveys also included a series of questions on current financial
behavior, asking for example whether students keep track of expenses, whether
they make a budget, and how much they save.
    The parent questionnaires were kept short (about two pages) to increase the
probability that parents would be willing to fill them out. These surveys included
questions on sociodemographic characteristics, measured financial literacy
through standard questions used in the literature, and elicited parents’ finan-
cial behavior regarding budgeting and savings. The surveys also asked whether
parents talk to students about financial matters and whether students help orga-
nize the household budget.


2.5.2	       Survey participation
Table 2.2 shows the number of schools, students, and parents who participated
in the surveys at baseline and at follow-up. At baseline, 866 out of 868 schools in
our study sample participated in the survey, although two of these schools did
not implement the financial literacy test and the parent questionnaire. In each
follow-up survey, about 40 schools did not implement the survey. Reasons for
non-implementation varied and were mostly related to scheduling difficulties. The
schools that did not participate in the follow-up surveys were different in each
round, so we have follow-up data for most schools from either follow-up 1 or
follow-up 2.

76  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




                   After realizing that survey participation had dropped between baseline and
              follow-up 1, we provided incentives for survey completion during follow-up 2.
              Both treatment and control schools where more than 75 percent of the students
              completed at least 80 percent of the survey questions were entered into a lottery
              for 1 of 25 computers. Despite this incentive, we did not have a higher number of
              schools participate in follow-up 2 than in follow-up 1. However, a greater number
              of students within the participating schools answered the surveys in follow-up 2
              than in follow-up 1. The number of students surveyed per school in follow-up 2
              is still lower than in the baseline (about 22 versus 28 students per school). One
              reason for this decline in the number of students per school is that drop-out rates
              are quite high in our sample (about 10 percent per year).
                   The numbers in table 2.2 also illustrate the fact that student rotation is
              quite high in our study sample. The majority of students in follow-up 1 were also
              present in baseline (follow-up 1 was implemented in the same semester as the
              baseline, about four months apart). However, only about 60 percent of students
              in follow-up 2 were present at baseline (follow-up 2 took place about 16 months
              after baseline). With respect to the financial education program, this high rotation
              implies that more than a third of the sample was not exposed to the material for
              a full three semesters, but rather for only one or two semesters.8
                   The participation in the parent questionnaire was quite high, considering that
              this questionnaire was self-administered at home. About 88 percent of students
              returned parent questionnaires at baseline. In the follow-up surveys, the partici-
              pation rates in the parent questionnaire dropped to about 76 percent.



              2.6	       SUMMARY STATISTICS, ATTRITION, AND PROCESS
                         EVALUATION
              Table 2.3 displays preprogram summary statistics of school and student char-
              acteristics for treatment and control schools. The school-level variables are for
              2008 and were provided by the Federal Ministry of Education. As a result of the
              school matching and randomization procedures described in section 2.4, the
              preprogram school characteristics are the same on average in the treatment and




               This high turnover of students in our sample needs to be interpreted in light of a
              8 


              systematic problem of school retention that characterizes secondary education in Brazil.
              Schwartzman (2010), compiling data from 1998 to 2008, shows that 21.3 percent of high
              school students repeat at least one year, either for lack of achievement or because they
              drop out. Comparing the same figure to countries with similar socioeconomic levels—
              such as Chile with 3.18  percent repeaters in secondary education and Argentina with
              13.43  percent—and even to countries with lower socioeconomic levels—such as Peru
              with 5.62 percent of repeaters and Colombia with 2.70 percent—shows how complex the
              student retention problem is in Brazil.

passing rate is 74 percent.
     The remaining variables in table 2.3 were collected through the baseline
survey conducted in August 2010. Student background characteristics show
that 56  percent of students participating in the study were female, 67  percent
had some form of income (from work or from parents), and about 35  percent
were working at baseline. Additionally, 33 percent were beneficiaries of the Bolsa
Família government cash transfer program, indicating that they belonged to
low-income households. On the parent side, about 60  percent of the students’
parents had less than a high school education. In terms of financial behavior, about

              45 percent of students reported that they saved at least some of their income,
              only 11 percent made a list of their expenses every month, but 75 percent nego-
              tiated the price or payment method when making purchases. Overall, the data in
              table 2.3 indicate that students’ background characteristics, as well as financial
              knowledge and behavior, were the same across the treatment and control groups
              at baseline—as expected, since treatment status was randomly assigned.


              2.6.1	     Take-up and process evaluation
              Following school assignment to treatment and control groups, the program
              distributed textbooks to treatment schools and organized training sessions for
              the teachers. The vast majority of treatment schools received the financial educa-
              tion textbooks and distributed them to students. In both rounds of the follow-up
              survey, we asked school principals as well as teachers and students a series
              of questions regarding implementation and usage of the financial education
              program. Follow-up 1 spans the first semester of the program, while follow-up 2
              covers the second and third semesters.
                  Table 2.4 shows that over 95 percent of treatment school principals report
              that they received the textbooks for the first semester, and 93  percent report
              receiving them for semesters 2 and/or 3. The large majority of teachers also say
              that students received the textbooks (i.e., the books were actually distributed
              to students): 94  percent and 92  percent in follow-up 1 and 2, respectively. On
              training, 78  percent of teachers report that they received training on how to
              use the financial education material in the first semester, and 65 percent report
              receiving it in the second/third semesters.
                  In terms of usage, 87 percent of students report that teachers actively used
              the financial education textbooks in classrooms in the first semester, though a
              drop-off occurs in semesters 2 and 3, with 74 percent of students reporting usage.
              The  percentage of principals reporting that financial education was taught in
              school remained high throughout the study period: 93 percent for all semesters.
                  Schools in the control group did not receive textbooks or teacher training
              through the financial education program studied in this chapter. However, they

may have implemented other types of financial education. The principal and
teacher questionnaires were only applied in treatment schools during the first
follow-up survey; but during the second follow-up survey, control schools also
answered these questionnaires.9 In this survey, 16.6  percent of control group
principals reported that the school had a financial education program, and
11 percent of control group teachers reported receiving some training related to
financial education. We do not have detailed information on the financial educa-
tion program implemented in control schools. However, only 5 percent of control
group principals reported that the school received a textbook with financial
education material, suggesting that these programs may be less intensive than
the one studied in this chapter.
     We supplemented this quantitative analysis with qualitative work in the form
of teacher focus groups, which were organized with our Brazilian counterparts.
The purpose of these meetings was to learn how teachers implemented the
program, how material was integrated into the regular curriculum, and how the
contents and/or delivery could be improved for future implementation.
     Six such meetings were held in September and October 2011, with teachers
and educators from all six states. All meetings were conducted in facilities
provided by the state education departments and meals were provided. The
meetings were generally well attended (more than 200 educators attended in
São Paulo), and lasted an average of four hours each.
     In all states, the teachers and educators greatly approved of the textbooks
and the financial education program. They said that the material allowed students
to learn by themselves, that students loved the case studies and felt that they
connected well with their daily life situations. The teachers also complimented
the clarity with which concepts were conveyed in the books. One teacher
commented, “What motivates me the most about this project are the books. The
content is directly related to students’ lives and helps to insert them in a highly
competitive market society. I learned a lot from the material, and similarly to what
happened to my students, it has helped me to plan better for the future.”
     In terms of implementation, most teachers employed work group strategies
to teach the material, where students were divided into small groups and asked
to work on different tasks. Examples of such tasks varied from identifying steps
for opening a small firm to creating a school market. Several teachers reported
assigning projects to students related to fundraising and organizing their own
graduation party. Other teachers reported undertaking field trips to local markets,
universities, and companies to learn how they operate. Others used various forms
of media to explore the topics in the textbook, such as computer simulations and
videos.



 The student questionnaire did not include questions on program implementation in
9 


control group schools in either follow-up survey.

                  While these qualitative responses are incredibly encouraging for the program,
              the teachers also reported some difficulties in implementation. For instance,
              some teachers expressed concern at the lack of resources to complement the
              financial education textbooks. Many felt they did not have enough time to learn
              the material themselves before it was due to be taught to students. Some even
              felt they had to give up some core curriculum time so they could learn the mate-
              rials through training.
                  Other concerns were more logistical. Teachers from all states felt that it
              was difficult to obtain timeline information about the project. Since the project
              delivery was decentralized, many teachers and educators reported not being
              able to identify a central resource for logistical inquiries. Similarly, some teachers
              said they were only told of the follow-up surveys a few days prior and had little
              time to accommodate the surveys in the class schedule. Finally, some teachers
              expressed concern about the continuity of the curriculum given the high turnover
              rate among students.
                  Overall, the teachers and educators felt the financial education program was
              valuable, that the textbooks were extremely relevant, and that they as well as
              their students enjoyed the new learning opportunities afforded to them.


              2.6.2	    Take-up of parent workshops
              For the parent workshops, we asked schools to mail the filled-in parent exit
              questionnaires back to us after the workshop, and we determine which schools
              implemented the workshops based on our receipt of these questionnaires and
              on our random assignment. We received 1,553 filled-in parent questionnaires
              from 109 schools, implying that parent workshops did not take place in the other
              153 schools (the school either did not organize the workshop or parents did not
              attend the workshop). When planning the parent intervention, our counterparts
              had cautioned that attendance rates may be low, since parents of public high
              school students in Brazil tend not to participate in school events.
                  Comparing the lists of current students we received from schools before the
              workshop to the filled-in exit questionnaires gives an average attendance rate of
              46 percent across the 109 schools that returned questionnaires. The attendance
              rate does not differ across parents who were randomized into the treatment and
              control groups. Parents did not know whether they had been assigned to watch
              a financial education or health video until the video was screened at the work-
              shop—i.e., the decision to attend was independent of treatment status. Hence, in
              our impact analysis of the parent workshop, we only keep students and parents
              if the parent attended a workshop. The interpretation of the results is applicable
              to families that in general are more interested in school events and respond to
              school invitations.

2.7	       RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Based on the random assignment, the impact of the program is measured as the
difference in average outcomes in the treatment and control groups. The results
presented in figures 2.1 and 2.2 are statistically significant at the 1 percent level
(unless otherwise stated), with standard errors clustered at the school level.
Annex A presents full regression tables. We include school pair dummies in all
specifications and control for baseline values of available dependent variables, as
per Bruhn and McKenzie (2009) and McKenzie (2011). When baseline values have
missing observations, we replace these with 0 and include a dummy variable indi-
cating that the observation was missing.10 Finally, note that results from the first
and second follow-up surveys are not fully comparable due to changes in class
composition from one year to the next.


2.7.1	     Student financial proficiency
The impact of the financial education program on student financial proficiency is
economically and statistically significant. Test scores indicate that the average
level of financial proficiency is significantly higher in the treatment group than in
the control group in both follow-up 1 and follow-up 2, as shown in figure 2.1a. The
differences are of 4 points and 3 points, respectively, or a 5–7 percent increase
in financial knowledge. This is equivalent to a quarter of a standard deviation
increase, which is a substantial effect size.
      Further, test scores improve across the distribution, benefiting low- and
high-achieving students. Specifically, the proportion of students who perform
exceptionally well increases by 28  percent, and that of students performing
exceptionally poor decreases by 26 percent. This effect represents a rightward
shift in the distribution of test scores for treated schools compared to control
schools, as shown in figure 2.2. Hence, the financial education program helps
poorly performing students improve significantly, and high-performing students
to do even better. These distributional effects are important and show that the
program benefited students along a broad performance spectrum rather than
being driven by any one category, and that the curriculum speaks to the learning
needs and interests of all types of students.




  To account for the parent workshops that were held prior to follow-up 2, we complement
10 


our analysis by running regressions with two independent treatment variables: the first
indicating treated students and parents who were assigned to the financial literacy work-
shop, and the second indicating treated students and parents who were assigned to the
health literacy workshop. These variables are compared to the control group in the regres-
sion analysis, and the coefficients remain statistically significant for both treatments. The
F-tests for differences in coefficients between the two treatments are not significant for
our outcomes of interest (except one parent financial literacy question).

                    2.7.2	         Saving and spending behavior
                    Next, we investigate saving and spending behavior and identify significant
                    improvements in both. Note first that in our sample almost two-thirds of students
                    had some type of income and about 38–42  percent were in the labor market.
                    Hence, these students faced decisions on how much to save and what to spend
                    their money on, whether to make a monthly list of expenses, and whether to
                    negotiate price and/or payment methods when making a purchase. Their choices
                    offer key insights into the spending behavior of youth whose purchases of mobile
                    phones, clothes, and fashion accessories may be driven by factors other than
                    financial planning and foresight.

        The analysis indicates strong treatment effects on all these dimensions. Specif-
ically, students in the treatment group increase savings and exhibit significantly
improved spending behavior relative to the control group. A higher proportion of
students in the treatment group saved at least some of their income (49 percent
in treatment compared to 44  percent in control at follow-up 1; and 46  percent
compared to 40 percent, respectively, at follow-up 2). Not only does the propor-
tion of students saving increase, but the actual savings amounts per student
increase significantly also, by 1.4 percentage points in follow-up 2 (14.3 percent
of income saved in the treatment group as compared to 12.9 percent of income
saved in the control group).11 These results are shown in figures 2.1b and 2.1c.
        We find significant treatment effects on spending behavior as well. The results
show that 16  percent of students in treatment schools make a list of monthly
expenses as part of a budgeting exercise, compared to 13 percent in the control
group in follow-up 1. These numbers are 17 percent and 14 percent, respectively,
in follow-up 2, as shown in figure 2.1d.
        Additionally, a higher percentage of students in the treatment group say they
often negotiate prices or payment methods when making a purchase (78 percent
in treatment compared to 74 percent in control in follow-up 1; and 77 percent and
74 percent, respectively, in follow-up 2). These results are plotted in figure 2.1e.

      This question was not asked in follow-up 1.

              2.7.3	    Student financial autonomy and intention to save
              In addition to improvements in current saving and spending behavior, we iden-
              tify positive treatment effects on forward-looking indexes of financial autonomy
              and intention to save. Specifically, the average financial autonomy score for
              students in the treatment group is 51 compared to 49 in the control group in
              follow-up 1; and 52 compared to 51, respectively, in follow-up 2. In addition, we
              find that students in the treatment group have a higher measured intentioned to
              save (51) than those in control group (49) at follow-up 1, and 53 compared to 51 in
              follow-up 2. These results are presented in figures 2.1f and 2.1g. Normalizing these
              effect sizes, they range from 8 percent to 12 percent of a standard deviation.


              2.7.4	    Student participation in household finance
              Finally, we investigate whether financial education has any impact on students’
              current participation in household finances using data collected through the
              parent questionnaires described in section 2.5.
                  We find that a significantly larger percentage of students in the treatment group
              talk to their parents about finances and participate in organizing the household
              budget. First, figure 2.1h shows that 71 percent of students in treatment schools
              participate in household financial decisions compared to 67  percent in control
              schools in follow-up 1, and 74 percent compared to 70 percent in follow-up 2.
                  Figure 2.1i shows similar positive treatment effects for students helping orga-
              nize household budgets.
                  Overall, we find strong and statistically significant evidence that the financial
              education program was effective in improving financial knowledge, current and
              future financial behavior, and participation in household finances and budgeting.


              2.7.5	    Impact of student intervention on parent outcomes
              Because the student financial education program included take-home exercises,
              such as making a budget that required the participation of parents, we examine
              whether the program has any trickle-up effects on parents’ financial knowledge
              and behavior.
                  Our results show no impact of the student financial education on parents’
              financial knowledge in follow-up 1. Financial knowledge is measured through
              two standard questions on inflation and interest rates. However, in follow-up
              2, parents of treatment school students are significantly more likely to answer
              these questions correctly than parents of students in control schools (see
              table 2A.5 in annex A). These effects are statistically significant at the 10 percent
              level. In follow-up 2, we also detect a positive and statistically significant differ-
              ence in financial knowledge of budgeting between the two groups: Compared to
              68 percent of parents in the control group, parents of students in the treatment
              schools are 6.3 percent more likely to understand the composition of a budget.
                                           2.  Financial education and behavior formation   ◾ 85




This is a promising result, as budgeting was keenly taught in the student curric-
ulum, including a take-home exercise where students were asked to make a
household budget in consultation with their parents.
    When examining the impact of student financial education on parents’ finan-
cial behavior, we detect no effects in follow-up 1, but again see several posi-
tive impacts in follow-up 2. The percentage of parents who save more than zero
increases from 76 percent in control schools to 78 percent in treatment schools.
The average percentage of income saved increases from 12  percent in control
schools to close to 13  percent in treatment schools. Both of these effects are
statistically significant at the 5 percent level. Parents in student treatment schools
are also more likely to list monthly expenses in a budget, with an increase from
37 percent of parents in the control schools to 39 percent of parents in the treat-
ment schools.
    These results indicate that the student financial education has a significant
trickle-up impact, or spillovers, to parents. The next section discusses whether
the parent workshops reinforced this effect.


2.7.6	    Impact of parent workshops
Some parents of treatment school students participated in a financial education
workshop that took place between the first and second follow-up surveys. This
workshop was designed to raise awareness among parents about the importance
of financial education and to encourage them to interact more with their children
on financial matters—thereby leveraging and reinforcing the material students
were taught through the program. Of the treatment schools, 109 volunteered to
hold a parent workshop, and 46  percent of parents in these schools attended.
These parents were randomly divided into two groups: a treatment group that
watched a financial literacy video on the benefits of saving and budgeting, and a
control group that watched a health video on the benefits of adopting preventa-
tive measures for a number of diseases.
    To measure the impact of the parent workshop, we compare outcomes of
parents who attended and also the outcomes of their children across the groups
that watched the financial literacy video and the health video. We only include
parents who actually attended a workshop in this analysis, excluding parents in
the same schools who were invited but did not come to the workshop. Parents
who went to the workshop have different baseline characteristics from those
who did not attend. They are more likely to be recipients of the Bolsa Família cash
transfer program, and fathers are less likely to have completed at least some
secondary education—suggesting that they are from relatively more disadvan-
taged households. Drop-out rates are also higher in schools that held a parent
workshop. These differences imply that the parent workshop results are not
representative of the full sample, although they are valid for the group of parents
who attended a workshop (and the corresponding students).
86  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




                  We find no significant improvements in parents’ financial behavior as a result
              of watching the financial literacy video—parents who watched this video are no
              more likely to make a budget or improve savings behavior compared to those who
              watched the health video.
                  The lack of significant impact of the parent workshop may be due to the
              relatively low intensity of the treatment or other constraints parents face in
              responding to the information. The exposure to financial education material
              through the DVD was relatively short, and the workshops included no supple-
              mentary discussions. This is consistent with the existing literature on financial
              education (see, e.g., Cole, Sampson, and Zia 2011).
                  The remarkable result from this intervention, however, is the impact of the
              parents’ workshop on student behavior. The parent workshops significantly
              increase the savings rate among students by 2.5  percentage points. Specifi-
              cally, students whose parents participate in the health literacy workshops save
              on average 13.5 percent of their income. In comparison, students whose parents
              participate in the financial literacy workshops save 16  percent of their income.
              This difference is statistically significant at the 5 percent level. Hence, parents are
              able to use their improved knowledge to reinforce the school messages with their
              children.




              2.8	        IMPACT OF THE STUDY
              The findings of this study are being used to guide policy discussions on the impact
              of financial education in schools. The audience includes financial institutions
              and education sectors in Brazil and several other interested countries. In fact,
              the Brazilian Ministry of Education has recently approved a continuation of the
              program. The program will be scaled up to 3,000 public high schools as part of
              two federal programs: Ensino Médio Inovador and Mais Educação. Brazilian stake-
              holders also decided to develop financial education textbooks and a pilot project
              for primary schools, as well as a financial education program targeted toward
              female beneficiates of Bolsa Família and retirees. Several other countries in the
              region have expressed interest in the Brazilian experience to learn and adapt the
              program to their respective environments and school systems.
                  As an initial indicator of policy impact, the results of the study were widely
              covered in the national media of Brazil—in newspapers, radio, and television.
              Journalists from the largest news outlets in the country, such as O Globo, Valor
              Econômico, Folha de São Paulo, and Agência Estado reported on the potential of
              such a program in improving national saving behavior.
                  A simple back-of-the-envelope calculation on economywide impacts of our
              intervention complements this positive press coverage. We start by assuming
              that the 1  percentage point increase in the savings rate is channeled into
                                               2.  Financial education and behavior formation   ◾ 87




domestic investment (note that we ignore compounding over the years).12 Brazil’s
current investment stands at 18  percent of GDP, and it supports an economic
growth rate of 3.5 percent on average. Dividing the investment share of GDP by
the economic growth rate results in an incremental capital-output ratio of 5.14.
Hence, a 1  percentage point increase in savings and investment would yield a
one-fifth of a percentage point increase in GDP. With a $2 trillion economy, this
results in a $4  billion annual increase—a substantial amount. Clearly, this is a
simple calculation and does not account for several macro factors. An even larger
evaluation and macro-simulation would make this estimation stronger; however,
the ballpark improvement in the economy is substantial and definitely outweighs
the entire cost associated with the intervention several times over.
      Another way to assess the impact of our study is to compare it to similar
studies in the literature. Unfortunately, the literature that studies financial
education in schools is extremely small, and many of the existing studies are
fraught with identification concerns as discussed in section 2.2.1. But there are
school-based studies outside the realm of financial education that are important
for comparison purposes. The type of education interventions in secondary
schools that have been tested through random control trials include the provi-
sion of school resources, monetary incentives to students, and student tutoring.
In general, these studies identify improvements in student learning during the
periods studied, although some studies do not find the effects to be statistically
significant.
      Perhaps the most comparable study to ours is one in Brazil that provides
financial resources and access to technology to Brazilian high schools—Projeto
Jovem de Futuro. Using a randomized control trial methodology, the study
finds improvements in test scores in Portuguese by 34 percent and in math by
55 percent. These are substantial effect sizes, but in standard deviation terms,
these effects are not very large. Another randomized evaluation of computers for
education in Colombia among 97 schools and 5,201 students finds improvements
of 0.017 standard deviations in Spanish and 0.008 standard deviations in math
(Barrera-Osorio and Linden 2009). Providing monetary incentives to students also
tends to improve test scores. Perhaps the most well-known studies in this area
are Angrist and Lavy (2009) and Angrist et al. (2002). In the first study, Israeli
students are provided cash incentives to pass their graduation exams; while
the mean estimates are positive, they are not statistically significant. In the
second study, lotteries are used in Columbia to distribute vouchers to partially




  A caveat here is that not all savings may be channeled into investment, particularly if
12 


individuals save at home and not in financial institutions. In addition, an increase in saving
represents a loss in consumer spending, which the simple calculation here does not take
into account.
88  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              cover the cost of private secondary schooling for 1,600 students who maintain
              satisfactory academic progress. Three years after the lotteries, winners are
              about 10 percentage points more likely to have finished eighth grade, and score
              0.2 standard deviations higher on achievement tests, although the latter result is
              only marginally significant. Finally, direct tutoring is beneficial in improving test
              scores too—a randomized evaluation in Chile finds that providing a three-month
              program of small group tutoring to fourth graders using college student volun-
              teers increases reading performance by 0.15–0.2 standard deviations (Cabezas,
              Paredes, and Quezada 2011).
                  Compared against this literature, our finding of an improvement of 0.2–0.24
              standard deviations in financial proficiency lies in the very top end of statistically
              significant improvements in test scores.



              2.9	CONCLUSION
              This chapter makes an important contribution to the literature by demonstrating
              that a financial education program targeted to youth can both increase knowl-
              edge and improve attitudes and behavior. We believe this is due to two factors:
              (1) the quality and intensity of the program; and (2) the quality, scope, and scale
              of the study.
                  Brazil embarked on an extraordinary experience with financial education that
              has attracted national and international attention for its scope, innovation, and
              results. The ambition is to move policy practice from small targeted interventions
              to a multi-arm program to improve the intertemporal decisions and economic
              outcomes of a whole nation. Innovation in design is a central element of this
              program, with a coalition of financial institutions working with the best educa-
              tors to develop creative and interactive didactical tools to transform the way
              young people think about their life choices. The early results are impressive: the
              approach is effective in improving what high school students know, their current
              saving and spending behavior, and their attitudes toward investing in their future.
              Furthermore, educating parents further improves impact on students.
                  The early lessons from this experience are important for Brazil and for the
              rest of the world. First, increasing knowledge may lower the demands on cogni-
              tive resources and help reduce anomalies in intertemporal choice. Second, finan-
              cial education can be understood more widely as the life skills needed for making
              better intertemporal decisions, being aware of opportunities ahead, and plan-
              ning to take advantage of them. As such, financial education can strengthen the
              effectiveness of policies aimed at economic growth and poverty reduction. Third,
              the partnership between the highly educated and resourceful facets of Brazil’s
              financial and private sectors with the less resourced education system can play
              a transformative role in making public schools an exciting place for learning and
              personal growth, and improving the prospects for equality of opportunity for all.

Fourth, educating parents can strengthen their involvement in their children’s
education and generate powerful dynamics within the household. Adult educa-
tion is thus an important element in children’s education and poverty reduction.
Finally, once brought to scale, this program has the potential to improve national
savings rates and, potentially, the rate of economic growth.

Note: Robust standard errors, clustered at the school level, in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate
significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively. SD = standard deviation. Columns 1 and 2 use
data from follow-up waves 1 and 2, respectively. The number of students and schools included in the
sample fluctuate within a wave because not all students answered every question; and they fluctuate
across waves because of student turnover across the school years. The outcome variable in this table
is a student financial proficiency score, which aggregates financial knowledge questions included in
the surveys. All regressions control for baseline outcomes and include school pair dummies. When
baseline outcomes have a missing value, they are replaced by 0 and a dummy variable indicating such
missing values is included.

Note: Robust standard errors, clustered at the school level, in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significance at the
10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively. SD = standard deviation. Odd- and even-numbered columns use data from follow-up
waves 1 and 2, respectively. The number of students and schools included in the sample fluctuate within a wave because
not all students answered every question; and they fluctuate across waves because of student turnover across school
years. The outcome variables in this table are an indicator variable equal to 1 if the student saves a positive fraction of
income; the actual percentage of student monthly income that is saved; an indicator variable equal to 1 if the student
makes a list of all monthly expenses; and an indicator variable equal to 1 if the student negotiates either the price or
the payment method when making purchases. All regressions control for baseline outcomes and include school pair
dummies. When baseline outcomes have a missing value, they are replaced by 0 and a dummy variable indicating such
missing values is included.

tion or health education workshop. Since workshop assignment was not revealed in advance, the analysis only includes
parents who attended; all parents who were invited but did not attend are excluded. Data in this table are from follow-up
survey 2, since the parent workshops occurred between the two follow-up survey waves. Four parent outcomes are
presented in this table: a budgeting question that tests the knowledge of a budget; an indicator variable equal to 1 if
the parent has formal savings such as a current account, savings account, debit card or checks; the actual fraction of
monthly income that is saved; and an indicator variable equal to 1 if the parent makes a list of all monthly expenses. In
addition, two student outcomes are presented: an indicator variable equal to 1 if the student has any savings; and the
actual fraction of monthly income that is saved. All regressions control for baseline outcomes and include parent work-
shop stratification dummies. When baseline outcomes have a missing value, they are replaced by 0 and a dummy variable
indicating such missing values is included.

ANNEX B: DETAILS OF THE FINANCIAL EDUCATION
CURRICULUM

2B.1.1	 General description
The material provided to teachers and used in the school financial education
program in Brazil includes (1) a student textbook, (2) a student exercise book, (3) a
teacher guidebook, and (4) a teacher training DVD. This material was developed
by the GAP. This annex describes the content of the student textbook in detail.13
        The student textbook is divided into three blocks and covers nine themes.
Each theme is taught through case studies/didactic situations, consisting of theo-
retical and applied content, activities and self-evaluative questions. The case
studies make use of texts, stories, images, and tables to convey the material in
an accessible way. They also contain “experiment” sections that are designed
to make the material relevant to students’ daily life, and conclude with a short
outline of what is expected from the student in terms of learning.
        The rest of this annex describes each of these blocks and the inclusive themes.


2B.1.2	 Block 1
The first block discusses three themes: everyday family life, social life, and
personal property.


THEME 1: EVERYDAY FAMILY LIFE
In everyday family life, students are exposed to common situations where they
have to make decisions that affect their family’s financial well-being. This theme
is covered in seven sections, which are described below:

          —— Record expenses regularly
          —— Know where you spend money

          —— Classify expenses as fixed or variable

  The student exercise books and the teacher guidebooks and DVDs were meant to support
13 


the material covered in the student textbooks and did not offer new material of their own.
The student exercise book provided assignments to students based on material taught
through the textbook. Similarly, the teacher guidebook and DVD provided instructions on
teaching and assessment methods for the course material, as well as examples of how to
integrate the financial education curriculum into regular school learning.

              The third block discusses three themes: public goods, the country’s economy,
              and the world economy.


              THEME 7: PUBLIC GOODS
              In public goods, students address several issues concerning the use and financing
              of public goods and services. This theme is covered in seven sections, discussed
              below:

                1.	 Everything has a price

      —— Link the public duty to pay taxes with the government’s duty to provide
         public services
 6.	 Corruption
      —— Corruption affects the lives of everyone because it reduces the money
         the government can to invest in public services
      —— Check public accounts through public records
  7.	 Taxation
      —— Link the public duty to pay taxes with the government’s duty to provide
         public goods and services
      —— Understand the purpose of different taxes paid by citizens
      —— Develop and engage in a campaign to provide incentives for citizens to
         pay their taxes


THEME 8: THE COUNTRY ECONOMY
Students are exposed to several aspects of their country’s economy that are rele-
vant to their personal lives, including the concept of inflation, the law of supply
and demand, the concept of minimum wage, and the basics of the national finan-
cial system. This theme is covered in seven sections, discussed below:

              THEME 9: THE WORLD ECONOMY
              Students are exposed to several aspects of the world economy that are relevant
              to their personal lives, such as the concept of imports and exports, international
              economic blocks, and measures of a country’s well-being. This theme is covered
              in seven sections, discussed below:

U  nderstanding and
   improving household
investment behavior in Brazil

ABSTRACT
     As equity markets develop rapidly around the world, especially in emerging
     markets, investing in the stock market is now within reach of a growing
     segment of the population that did not previously have access to these finan-
     cial instruments. This opens new opportunities for households to diversify
     their assets and investments, and at the same time provides liquidity to the
     market. However, this also introduces potential for consumer risk and capital
     market volatility if inexperienced investors make uninformed or irrational
     investment choices. This study explores the effectiveness of an online stock
     market simulator as a tool to overcome investor biases and improve perfor-
     mance through a “learning-by-doing” training experience. Using data from
     about 40,000 simulator participants, we find (1) mixed effects for exposure
     to the stock market simulator on behavioral biases; (2) a weak relationship
     between behavioral biases and performance, and training in the simulator
     and performance; and (3) a strong link between extended participation in the
     simulator and transition into the actual stock market. The results suggest that
     learning by doing can motivate investors to participate in the stock market.

              3.1	      INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION
              In the next 20 years, an estimated 2 billion people will enter the formal financial
              system (Demirgüç-Kunt, Beck, and Honohan 2008). Access to a broader range of
              financial instruments offers households an opportunity to diversify their assets.
              As financial access improves, it becomes increasingly important to understand
              the mechanisms that drive household investment choices. This is important both
              to improve consumer protection (ensuring that investors make fully informed
              decisions that do not expose them to unintended risk) and to fulfill a broader
              economic development objective of improving savings rates to drive investment
              and strengthen capital markets. Drawing from the current literature on behav-
              ioral finance, this study has been designed together with the Brazilian Securi-
              ties, Commodities, and Futures Exchange (BM&FBOVESPA) to test a range of
              interventions to understand why people make the decisions they do and identify
              how to reduce common investor biases observed in the stock market to improve
              consumer protection and ultimately increase capital market efficiency. In this
              chapter, we present an analysis of BM&FBOVESPA’s “learning-by-doing” stock
              market simulator—a teaching tool to familiarize new investors with the stock
              market; however, this represents one part of a larger evaluation aimed at identi-
              fying and overcome a broad range of stock market barriers to entry and investor
              behavioral biases that is outlined in more detail in annex A to this chapter.


              3.1.1	    New investors create new challenges
              During the transition to deeper capital markets, two concerns arise. First, despite
              the potential value in diversifying savings and investment products to spread risks
              and maximize returns, households often choose not to, exhibiting suboptimal
              and irrational investment choices. Evidence on savings and investment holdings
              in the United States shows that, despite the potential equity premium that can
              be achieved through participation in the stock market, and the predictions from
              expected utility models indicating that almost everybody should hold stocks
              described by Haliossis and Bertaut (1995), nearly 20 percent of households at the
              80th percentile of the wealth distribution do not invest in public equity (Camp-
              bell 2006). As wealth increases, understanding the motivation behind household
              choices to climb the savings and investment ladder from liquid savings accounts
              to bonds, property, and equity will help tailor interventions aimed at strengthening
              financial inclusion and ensuring that households maximize the benefits provided
              through access to the right investment instruments. Conversely, overconfident
              or ill-informed investors may choose to begin using new financial instruments
              prematurely and expose their portfolios to unintended risk. It is thus important
              to make sure that investors on both ends of the spectrum are investing wisely,
              and ensure that adequate information and support are provided to facilitate these
              investment decisions.
              3.  Understanding and improving household investment behavior in Brazil  ◾ 107




     The second concern is that common investor biases may reduce the oppor-
tunity for investors to use financial instruments to enhance their own welfare.
Evidence shows that overconfident or ill-informed investors with limited financial
literacy are much more likely to make costly investment mistakes; they (1) trade
too frequently, (2) are not sufficiently diversified, and (3) sell winning stocks too
early and hold onto losing stocks for too long (Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Teoh 2002).
New investors could reduce their susceptibility to these common investment
mistakes by investing amounts in diversified instruments such as index funds. As
the range of financial products for potential investors steadily broadens, these
opportunities bring with them increased risks and potential pitfalls that have
consequences both for household welfare and the stability of financial markets
more broadly. However, few new investors know about these financial products
or their benefits for risk management. There is thus significant scope for finan-
cial education to ensure that the right investment products are chosen and used
effectively to allow for calculated risk taking while reducing costly investment
mistakes among new investors. For instance, the possibility of buying products
automatically diversified (like exchange traded fund [ETFs]) and/or products with
characteristics that deter high-frequency trading (e.g., increasing trading fees)
may help investors overcome these biases.


3.1.2	     Savings and investment in Brazil
The study focuses on Brazil, a context in which these issues are particularly
relevant. Indeed, over the last two decades, Latin American countries, including
Brazil, have been at the forefront of reforms to foster capital market development.
Despite the reform effort, capital markets in Latin America remain underdeveloped
relative to other regions with similar economic conditions (De la Torre, Gozzi, and
Schmukler 2007). Total value of stocks traded as a percentage of gross domestic
product (43.2 percent in Brazil) falls short of comparable emerging economies like
China (136.6 percent) and South Africa (93.5 percent).1 In particular, Brazil faces
the challenge of a culture of high short-term consumption and indebtedness—
even Easter eggs can be bought in installments (Economist 2011). Notably, Brazil’s
savings rate has fluctuated at around 17 percent of gross domestic product over
                                                                –50 percent.
the last decade, a number that contrasts sharply with China’s 45­
     As the Brazilian economy grows, understanding how to introduce a new class
of investors to the stock market, while at the same time ensuring that investors
are not exposed to unnecessary risks, will become critically important. Under-
standing constraints to participation as well as common behavioral investment
biases within the market can help inform market participants and policy makers in
Brazil and other emerging economies in developing consumer protection policies

              that will increase access to new financial tools while mitigating the risks associ-
              ated with poor investment decisions.


              3.1.3	     The research agenda
              Against this backdrop, a large research program has been designed to address a
              core research question: What interventions are most effective at improving
              participation in the stock market and reducing biases in investor behavior?
              In particular, a broad program of impact evaluation studies has been designed to
              address and disentangle the different constraints and market failures hypothe-
              sized to be affecting investor participation and behavior, including physical (finan-
              cial education, financial and nonfinancial entry costs, transaction costs, access)
              and psychological constraints (such as self-control, time-inconsistent preferences,
              inertia, menu costs, peer effects). The findings of the study will add to the liter-
              ature by measuring the effectiveness of new modes of financial education. The
              study will test multiple hypotheses regarding barriers to effective participation in
              financial markets within a unified framework, leading to better understanding not
              only of which investor biases are most prevalent but also how targeted education
              and product offers can mitigate these biases, as well as illustrating a framework
              in which impact evaluations can be used to make real-time operational decisions
              in the private sector.
                   This research program has three main components: (1) testing the effect
              of an online stock market simulator as a learning-by-doing financial literacy tool
              to improve knowledge and investor behavior; (2) reducing the barriers to stock
              market participation offers to randomly selected groups of potential investors
              participating in the simulator; and (3) providing financial information and details of
              investment products through a stock broker online platform to individual inves-
              tors with the aim of reducing investor biases.
                   This chapter presents and discusses the first set of results from this research
              program. In particular, it focuses on the first component, testing the effect of
              an online stock market simulator as a learning-by-doing financial literacy tool to
              improve knowledge and investor behavior.2
                   BM&FBOVESPA offers people the opportunity to practice trading stocks in an
              environment that replicates real-time stock data (with a short delay) and simulates
              the experience of participating in an online “home broker” system that allows real
              investors to trade directly from their home computer through a stock broker inter-
              mediary. The simulator, called Simulaçao, includes a wide range of investment
              products and offers investors the opportunity to build portfolios from current
              stock options. Participants receive a start-up account with fictional Brazilian reais
              in order to participate. The motivation for developing this simulator tool was to

overcome informational barriers to participation by exposing potential investors
to the activities related to investing in the stock market without exposing them to
any real risk—and in so doing, educate potential investors through a learning-by-
doing experience on how to participate in the stock market.
    The chapter studies the investment behavior of simulator users using data
from Simulaçao in 2011 and 2012. Matching these with data from Brazil's actual
stock market for the same period offers a unique opportunity to track both expo-
sure and performance in Simulaçao along with transition rates into the actual
stock market. In particular, we first analyze basic descriptive investor behavior
in the simulator. We then report on the presence and extent of common investor
biases, the details of which are explained in the following section. The main objec-
tive of the analysis is to assess how the use of the simulator influences trading
decisions and simulated portfolio outcomes to see if simulator participation
translates into improved investment decisions. Finally, we study how the use of
the simulator and behavior within the simulator environment affect entry into the
stock market.
    Our results identify correlations between increased exposure to the simu-
lator and behavioral biases, portfolio performance, and transition into the actual
stock market. We find that higher exposure to the simulator has mixed effects on
users’ behavioral biases.
    The results indicate that higher exposure to the simulator may have posi-
tive effect on user performance (in the simulator), although the evidence is not
robust. The relationship between behavioral biases and portfolio performance
is mixed, and the results suggest that selection biases might be driving the esti-
mated correlations.
    Finally, high exposure to the simulator as well as a high return in the 2011
simulator is associated with a higher probability of users entering the stock
market. Our estimates suggest that the experience with the simulator may have
a relevant effect on take-up.
    The chapter is organized as follows. In the next section, we provide a litera-
ture review to motivate the questions and interventions. In particular, we review
the available evidence on education constraints to financial market participation,
and investment biases among small households with limited financial literacy. We
then describe the online stock market simulator Simulaçao. The following section
poses the main research questions and describes the methods used to address
them. We follow this by describing the simulator and actual stock market data
used in this chapter. The last two sections present and discuss the results and
draw some policy conclusions based on these findings.

              3.2	        WHAT DRIVES INVESTMENT DECISIONS: A REVIEW
              Measuring household investment is challenging, and the data requirements for
              accurate measurement are often hard to collect. Many households have compli-
              cated finances, with multiple accounts at different financial institutions facing
              different tax treatments and possibly including illiquid investments such as
              ownership in businesses and real estate in addition to traditional publicly traded
              investments such as mutual funds, individual stocks, and bonds. Even households
              that wish to provide data may have some difficulty answering detailed questions
              accurately. In what is perhaps the most comprehensive review of the financial
              decisions of households available to date, Campbell (2006) presents several inter-
              esting facts based on data from the 2001 U.S. Survey of Consumer Finances.
                     Investment choices are strongly correlated with education, age, income,
              wealth, and gender. The influence of wealth on investment choices is illustrated
              in figure 3.1 (taken from Campbell 2006). Households initially use their savings for
              “safe assets” such as savings accounts, and progress to vehicles and real estate;
              while investment in equity has an approximately linear relationship with wealth
              percentiles. Particular interest has been in understanding the “participation
              puzzle” highlighting that, although economic theory suggests that all households
              should hold at least some portion of stocks in their portfolio, the empirical evidence
              runs contrary to these predictions. Stock market participation is extremely low

(less than 50 percent) among households below the 50th percentile of the wealth
distribution. But perhaps more strikingly, the evidence indicates that even some
of the wealthiest households do not hold stocks (for example, 20 percent of U.S.
households at the 80th  percentile of the wealth distribution do not own any
stocks). While similarly detailed data are not available for an emerging market,
descriptive evidence suggests that these patterns are much more pronounced
in less developed financial markets. This lack of financial diversification implies
significant welfare losses due to limited financial market participation.
    Understanding market frictions and deviations from expected utility maximi-
zation have come to the foreground as explanations for the observed empirical
departures of household investment decisions from the theoretical predictions
of how households should allocate their assets. While people respond to financial
and nonfinancial incentives and barriers to entry (in line with utility maximization
theory), it is also clear from the research in behavioral economics that individuals
deviate from the standard (neoclassical) full information choice model by exhib-
iting nonstandard preferences, beliefs, and decision making (DellaVigna 2009).
    At the conceptual level, an important distinction needs to be made between
the choices that lead to market entry and participation, and the drivers of asset
allocation and investment decisions once a household participates in the financial
market. The broader impact evaluation explores the effect of (1) financial and time
costs, including fixed entry, variable trading, and per period costs; (2) financial
literacy/knowledge; and (3) psychological barriers to stock market participation,
while further exploring behavioral biases within the stock market and the effect
of these on performance (see annex A). In this chapter, we specifically explore
the effectiveness of the stock market simulator as a learning tool to overcome
knowledge constraints to stock market participation and mitigate investor behav-
ioral biases.



3.3	       BARRIERS TO PARTICIPATION IN FINANCIAL MARKETS
To understand the role of information and financial education in overcoming
barriers to participation in financial markets, our study draws on existing research
on barriers to stock market participation and the adoption of less complex finan-
cial instruments (such as savings accounts and insurance products).


3.3.1	     Financial education
Although a number of nonexperimental studies have been conducted in the past,
until recently there has been very little rigorous evidence on the causal relation-
ship between financial literacy and consumer behavior when it comes to invest-
ment choices. Strong correlations between financial literacy and participation in
the stock market are well known (Van Rooij, Lusardi, and Alessie 2011); however,
experimental evidence is not as compelling—leading to an effort to find new
112  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              methods for delivering financial messages, such as the use of computer games
              for children to learn how to run a business. The value of practical training as a
              component of learning has been emphasized since the seminal work of Dewey
              (1938). Despite this, many programs aimed at promoting financial capabilities do
              not explicitly incorporate practical training into their program, as this is often
              seen as an expensive and logistically challenging component of teaching and
              little rigorous evidence exists as to its relative value. A recent study of financial
              education in Brazilian schools—conducted through a collaboration with several
              Brazilian financial institutions and the Development Impact Evaluation's Devel-
              opment Economics Research Group of the World Bank—is the first of its kind,
              highlighting how effective a financial literacy program can be when theory and
              messages are linked directly to practical activities to promote “learning by doing,”
              finding significant increases in student knowledge and savings rates (Legovini,
              Bruhn, and Zia 2013).
                  In another example of exploring new, effective ways to present financial
              information, evidence from a randomized study aimed at using financial informa-
              tion to deter people from using payday lenders showed strong results when the
              messages were linked to behavioral cues (Bertrand and Morse 2010). For example,
              by expressing interest rate repayments as a dollar amount, framing the repay-
              ment over a longer time horizon, and comparing this to alternative credit options,
              payday lender use decreased by 5.9 percent and average loan size decreased by
              US$55, or 23 percent.


              3.3.2	    Investor biases
              The literature has identified several biases that affect investor behavior, resulting
              in suboptimal investment strategies when participating in the stock market. Here
              we cover only a sample of the most common biases observed.
                  The disposition effect—the tendency of individual investors to hold onto
              losing stocks and sell winners too quickly to realize gains—has been shown to
              be an important driver of individual trading decisions. Kahneman and Tversky’s
              (1979) prospect theory, combined with Thaler’s (1981) “mental accounting’’ frame-
              work, have been considered the leading explanation for the disposition effect.
              The main element of this theory is a utility function that is concave (risk averse)
              in the domain of gains and convex (risk loving) in the domain of losses, both
              measured relative to some reference point. Mental accounting provides a way
              in which investors set reference points for the accounts that determine gains
              and losses. The main idea is that decision makers tend to segregate different
              types of gambles into separate accounts, and then apply prospect theory to each
              account, ignoring possible interactions. Investors with a disposition effect have
              been shown to underperform investors who do not exhibit these biases (Seru,
              Shumway, and Stoffman 2010).
             3.  Understanding and improving household investment behavior in Brazil  ◾ 113




    Although financial theory prescribes investors to hold diversified portfolios,
many retail investors hold concentrated portfolios with only a handful of stocks
(Barber and Odean 2000). Underdiversification has been linked to a lack of sophis-
tication (Goetzmann and Kumar 2008) and preference for skewness, but to date
the evidence on this relationship is still mixed (see, e.g., Cremers and Petajisto
2009). Prior research suggests that retail investors can substantially reduce their
risk (without a reduction in returns) by holding more diversified portfolios (Goetz-
mann and Kumar 2008).
    Retail investors trade actively (without a gain in performance), even though
standard finance theory suggests a buy and hold strategy when investors do
not have private information. Active trading has been linked to overconfidence,
whereby investors overestimate either their abilities or the quality of their private
knowledge. Overconfident investors trade excessively, paying high transaction
costs without additional gains from active trading (Barber and Odean 2000). Retail
investors also exhibit a preference for local stocks. They tend to hold a dispro-
portionately large portion of their investments in domestic stocks, stocks head-
quartered in geographical locations in which the investor resides, and stocks in
the sector in which the investor works. The preference for local stocks has been
linked to familiarity bias, whereby investors overweight local stocks because they
are more familiar and comfortable with them.
    While these biases are well known, there has, to date, been no systematic
randomized controlled trial designed to test the effectiveness of targeted infor-
mation and investment offers aimed at mitigating these biases and lengthening
investor investment horizons in the stock market.



3.4	      LEARNING BY DOING VERSUS LEARNING BY LOSING
The literature that delves into the relationship between financial expertise (experi-
ence) and performance in the stock market has identified the three most common
mistakes (or behavioral biases) investors make in the stock market: underdiver-
sification (more risk for a given return), high turnover (high trading costs), and
disposition effect (see Campbell, Ramadorai, and Ranish 2012). It is argued that
most of these mistakes can be avoided, and that learning from experience seems
to be an effective device to minimize mistakes. Campbell, Ramadorai, and Ranish
(2012) use data from the Indian equity market to investigate whether investors’
experience affects behavioral biases and performance. Their main findings are
the following: (1) “account performance improves with account age,” (2) holders
of older accounts are less prone to incur behavioral biases, and (3) underperfor-
mance due to behavior mistakes tends to reduce in the long run. All three findings
point to a positive effect of experience on reducing behavior biases and improving
performance.
114  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




                      This chapter follows similar steps as it aims to uncover the relationship
              between behavior biases and performance using similar indicators. However,
              unlike all evidence available to date, the objective here is to test whether prac-
              ticing in a fake stock market (the simulator) helps users avoid those common
              mistakes and perform better. The idea is to check whether the simulator can be
              regarded as an effective learning tool by individuals who most likely do not have
              a strong financial knowledge. In this scenario, individuals can try different things
              without incurring a real loss. In fact, this could stimulate the simulator users to
              adopt strategies they would not follow in the real world. Therefore, it must be
              remembered that the structure of incentives individuals face in the simulator and
              in the actual stock market are markedly different.
                      Despite the different incentives—and our analysis does not consider a time
              dimension that could allow one to control for users’ fixed effects—some of our
              findings are in line with Campbell, Ramadorai, and Ranish (2012), as discussed
              below.



              3.5	          THE STOCK MARKET SIMULATOR: SIMULAÇÃO
              BM&FBOVESPA offers people the opportunity to practice trading stocks in an
              environment that replicates real-time stock data (with a short delay) and simu-
              lates the experience of participating in an online “home broker” system that
              allows real investors to trade directly from their home computers through a stock
              broker intermediary. Simulaçao includes a wide range of investment products and
              offers investors the opportunity to build portfolios from current stock options.
              Participants receive a start-up account with fictional Brazilian reais in order to
              participate. The motivation for developing this simulator tool was to overcome
              informational barriers to participation by exposing potential investors to the activ-
              ities related to investing in the stock market without exposing them to any real
              risk—and in so doing, to educate potential investors through a learning-by-doing
              experience in how to participate in the stock market.
                      The simulator is complemented by an array of other financial literacy activ-
              ities BM&FBOVESPA offers potential investors with the aim of teaching people
              how to use the stock market to make better use of their money. These activities
              are organized under an umbrella website called Quer ser socio?3



              3.6	          RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND METHODS
              From the literature, we see that, beyond demographics and wealth levels, selec-
              tion into the stock market may be driven by lack of knowledge/awareness of

the value and optimal use of financial products linked to equity markets. In addi-
tion, investment biases such as overconfidence, underdiversification, and the
disposition effect play an important role both in people’s portfolio decisions as
well as their investment performance; this may be mitigated through experience.
    Financial education through experience can potentially reduce information
barriers related to stock market participation and protect small investors from
making standard investment mistakes that expose them to increased risk. Thus,
improved investor behavior has potentially far-reaching consequences by reducing
exposure to unintended risk and improving investor risk-adjusted returns, while
promoting economic development by strengthening capital markets through the
more efficient distribution of resources.
    Against this backdrop, the study poses the following main research ques-
tion: How effective is a learning-by-doing financial education tool at improving
knowledge and investor behavior, and reducing barriers to participation in the
stock market? In particular, the study tests whether increased simulator expo-
sure is associated with improved investment decisions and a higher probability of
entering the stock market.
    The chapter studies the investment behavior of simulator users using 2011
data from Simulaçao. In addition, data from the actual stock market in Brazil is
also available for the same period covered by the simulator data and used to
define our evaluation strategy.
    We run three main specifications:

	                              Yi = μ + β1Sim + X’iγ + εi 	(3.1)

where Yi refers to the investor’s behavioral bias—disposition effect or diversifica-
tion—and Sim corresponds to an individual’s exposure to the simulator. Here we
consider three measures of exposure: number of trades in the simulator, number
of days traded in the simulator, and length of use of the simulator. The vector of
controls Xi includes an individual’s age, gender, and dummy for state of residence;
and εi is the error term. The objective of this exercise is to check whether there
is a correlation between exposure to the simulator and the common behavioral
biases analyzed in this chapter. The hypothesis we will be testing is that individ-
uals with a higher exposure to the simulator would be less likely to incur behavior
biases.
    The second model tests how exposure to the simulator and behavioral
biases affect the returns and risk of portfolio holdings in the simulator. We use
two measures of returns: the adjusted returns and the Sharpe ratio. The model is
specified as follow:

	                           Ri = μ + β1Sim + β2Yi + X’iγ + εi 	(3.2)

where Ri is a measure of portfolio risk, and Sim, Yi, Xi, and εi are defined as before.
The returns are taken as a proxy of how these individuals would have performed
in the actual stock market had they behaved in the same way as they did with
116  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              the simulator. Finally, we estimate participation equations to test whether the
              simulator encouraged people to invest in the actual stock market. To make things
              simple, we run a simple ordinary least squares regression to estimate a linear
              probability model. Although the model has some shortcomings, such as the
              linearity assumption and the fact that the predicted probabilities can go beyond
              the [0, 1] range, the coefficients of the regression give the marginal effects
              straightforwardly.

              	                            Pi = μ + β1Sim + X’iγ + εi 	(3.3)

              where Pi is an indicator function that takes the value of 1 if individuals used the
              simulator in 2011 and are observed in the actual stock market in 2012 (but they
              were not in the stock market in the previous years 2009–11); and 0 if they used
              the simulator in 2011, but have not been observed in the stock market in 2012 or
              previously (2009–11).
                  Although the analysis does not allow us to follow the same individuals over
              time, we can at least compute variables that inform us of the intensity of use of
              the simulator. In that sense, all these variables have a time component as they
              indicate, for instance, how many trades a user made with the simulator, and
              the number of days a user traded on the simulator. We are therefore able to
              tell whether those individuals who used the simulator more intensively in 2011
              performed better or worse than those who used it less.



              3.7	      DESCRIPTION OF THE DATA
              The subsample contains information on each individual simulated transaction
              during 2011. Consistent with the literature, we aggregate the intraday transac-
              tions per user and firm. For instance, if in a given day a user traded the stock of
              a certain company more than once, we computed the net balance of that daily
              transaction so as to have only one daily observation per user and company. In
              total, around 517,000 transactions were made by about 40,000 individuals; this
              amounts to an average of 12.7 transactions per individual. Not all individuals
              registered for the simulator used it; indeed, about two-thirds of the registered
              individuals in 2011 ended up using the simulator. The database analyzed in this
              chapter is the subsample of registered individuals who used the simulator in 2011.
                  Three measures were developed to capture exposure to the simulator:
              (1) the number of days traded in the simulator; (2) the number of trades made in
              the simulator; and (3) the length of use of the simulator, given by the difference
              between the last date the user was active on the simulator and the first date he
              or she used the simulator.
                  We then compute three behavioral biases and investor characteristics that
              have been shown empirically to be associated with lower investment perfor-
              mance. These are the disposition effect, underdiversification, and overconfidence
             3.  Understanding and improving household investment behavior in Brazil  ◾ 117




proxied by overtrading. The disposition effect is a behavioral tendency of inves-
tors to sell shares whose price has increased, while holding onto shares that
have dropped in value—a manifestation of loss aversion. Underdiversification
is a tendency of investors to hold nondiversified portfolios, subjecting them to
uncompensated idiosyncratic risk (Goetzmann and Kumar 2008). Overtrading (or
turnover), a signal of overconfidence, appears when investors trade too much,
incurring excessive trading costs without any additional gain in performance
(Barber and Odean 2000).
     Table 3.1 provides descriptive statistics on the subsample and is divided in
three blocks. The first block reports statistics for all users, and the second and
third blocks present statistics for (1) individuals who used the simulator in 2011
but did not invest in the actual stock market in 2012, and (2) individuals who used
the simulator and invested in the actual stock market in 2012.
     The first three rows show the behavioral biases variables computed with
data from the simulator and from the stock market, both in 2011. According to the
table, the average user shows a turnover of 17 percent, tends to hold a relatively
well-diversified portfolio, and has a disposition effect of 10 percent. The numbers
in the second and third blocks are similar, but there is an indication that individ-
uals who invested in the actual stock market have a high turnover rate. Since this
variable captures overconfidence, this result is not really unexpected: it seems
to suggest that those who are overconfident would find it easier to make the
transition from the simulator to the actual stock market. As for the diversification
variable, because of the way this variable is constructed, the higher the value of
this variable, the more concentrated a user’s portfolio.
     The following four rows summarize exposure to the simulator. The number
of trades tells how many times a user set up an order (or transaction) in the
system. By taking into account only the executed orders, this variable provides an
underestimate of the exposure of the user to the simulator.4 Based on table 3.1,
an average user sets up about 17 orders; given that this variable is highly posi-
tively skewed, the median number of trades in the simulator is about half of
that (8 trades). Figure 3.2 illustrates the distribution of this variable for male and
female users, with 86 percent of the users being male. The figure shows that men
used the simulator more often than women. This holds for the entire distribution.
The distribution of trades for male users exhibits first-order dominance over the
female distribution. As with the turnover variable, there is an indication that users
who invested in the stock market used the simulator more frequently.
     The other two variables that summarize user exposure to the simulator are
the total number of days a user traded in the simulator, and the length of use of
the simulator. The latter is computed as the difference between the first and last

              skewed, the median of the number of days and the length of use are lower than
              the mean—3 and 7, respectively. Figures 3.3 and 3.4 present the distribution of
              both variables for male and female users. As before, the distribution for male
              users exhibits first-order stochastic dominance. These findings suggest that men
              traded not only more times, but spent more days with the simulator in compar-
              ison to women.
                      Table 3.1 also reports the total number of stocks held by an investor to
              capture portfolio diversification (see, e.g., Goetzmann and Kumar 2008). As can
              be seen, the average number of stocks held by a user is exactly the same in all
              three blocks.
                      With regard to the demographics, it can be seen that the users who invested
              in the stock market in 2012 were relatively older and predominantly male. Inter-
              estingly, only 6 percent of the users who invested in 2012 were female, a propor-
              tion that is substantially lower than 15 percent—the rate of female participation
              in the simulator.
                      Finally, to compute returns within the simulator, we use stock market infor-
              mation obtained from Compustat Global and match them to all stocks traded in
              the simulator using their corresponding ISIN (International Securities Identifica-
              tion Number) codes.6 The Compustat Global database provides daily stock price
              information adjusted for dividends, splits, and repurchases for both active and
              delisted companies. It accounts for 98 percent of global stock market capitaliza-
              tion. For the analysis, we use risk-adjusted returns computed as the difference
              between the stock return and the value-weighted market return. The market
              return is computed using all stocks trading at a given point in time. In the anal-
              ysis, we also use the Sharpe ratio—i.e., the average excess returns divided by
              the standard deviation of average returns over the sample period, where excess
              returns are computed as portfolio returns of the investor minus the returns on a
              government bond. Table 3.2 presents descriptive statistics for the adjusted return
              and Sharpe ratio as well as for the participation dummies.
                      In addition, we compute three dummy variables that inform us whether the
              simulator user has previous experience in the actual stock market in one of these
              years. To carry out the analysis, we merged the simulator data set with the actual
              stock market data from 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012 as we have the same user
              identifier in both data sets.
                      The first dummy (exper1) takes the value of 1 if the individual participated in
              the stock market in only one of the years between 2009 and 2011, and 0 other-
              wise. The second dummy (exper2) takes the value of 1 if he or she participated
              in the stock market in two of those years; the third dummy (exper3) takes the
              value of 1 if the user participated in the stock market in all three years. With these
              dummy variables, we are able to estimate a participation (take-up) equation to

check whether the simulator is an effective tool in reducing barriers to stock
market participation, and to control for previous experience in the stock market
in some of the regressions.
     According to the table, only 3  percent of the simulator users were in the
stock market in 2009. This number increases by almost 1 percentage point in 2010
and then jumps to about 9  percent in 2011 and 2012. The dummy variable Ind
gives us the proportion of simulator users who participated in the stock market
in 2012, as it takes the value of 1 if the individual traded in the stock market in
2012 and 0 if he or she did not do so in 2012 or in any of the previous years under
study (2009, 2010, or 2011). Since the simulator data are from 2011, we can use
this variable to test whether, after practicing with the simulator, people moved to
the actual stock market in the subsequent year.
     The last three rows of table 3.2 present descriptive statistics for the Sharpe
ratio and risk-adjusted return. For the Sharpe ratio, we also report the mean of a
truncated distribution, as this measure requires that a stock be held by an indi-
vidual a minimum number of days to (in our case, 30). Note that even though the
truncation implies a reduction of the sample size by about 9 percent, the standard
deviation drops sharply. Figure 3.5 shows the histogram for the truncated distri-
bution of the Sharpe ratio. As with the Sharpe ratio, we also report two sets of
descriptive statistics for the risk-adjusted return. The truncation makes the mean
even more negative and narrows the distribution as measured by the standard
deviation. Figure 3.6 illustrates the truncated distribution of this variable.

3.8	RESULTS
The results section is organized in three parts. First we present the results on
whether exposure to the simulator is correlated with behavioral biases. We are
not able to test whether individuals’ behavior changes over time; however, we
test in the cross-section of simulator users whether those more exposed to the
simulator are more or less affected by any type of behavioral bias. The second
part focuses on how behavioral biases correlate with returns and with the Sharpe
ratio. Finally, we provide the results from the estimation of participation to stock
market equation. We present two main sets of estimates. In the first set, we have
the biases variables on the right-hand side; in the second, we replace the biases
by exposure to the simulator variables. We do not keep both vectors of regressors
in the same model due to the high correlation between some of these variables.


3.8.1	     Does experience in the simulator reduce behavioral
           biases?
The hypothesis we test is whether those users who use the simulator more are
more or less likely to make mistakes, such as realize gains too early (disposition
effect), underdiversify, or overtrade (turnover). Since there are many potential
reasons for selection bias, all results should be interpreted as correlations. In
addition, we do not present the results for turnover bias as collinearity between
this bias variable and exposure to simulator variables is by construction very high.
     Table 3.3 presents the results for the disposition effect. The simulator vari-
ables used in the specifications are noted in the heading of each column. For
instance, in the first column, the simulator corresponds to the number of trades
in the simulator; in the third column, it is the number of days. For each different
simulator variable, we provide two sets of estimates. In the first column, we
have a simple linear model, while in the second column we test for nonlinearities
between the exposure to the simulator variables and the behavioral biases of
interest. We do that by simply including a second-order polynomial of the simu-
lator variable in the regressions.
     Two main patterns emerge. First, the more a user uses the simulator (as
measured by number of trades), the more he or she tends to show a disposi-
tion effect. However, this is not confirmed by the other measures of exposure
to the simulator. The other interesting insight is that we find some support for a
nonlinear relationship between the exposure to the simulator variables and the
two measures of behavioral biases.7 This suggests that users make more mistakes




 Although the coefficient of the squared term is not statistically significant in the last
7 


column, it is jointly significant with the linear coefficient at the 1 percent level −F(1 2284)
= 9.16.

                    as they are more exposed to simulator. However, after a certain level of usage,
                    they seem to learn and mistakes start to be less frequent. In other words, after
                    some level of exposure to the simulator, individuals may develop the skills that
                    help them reduce the incidence of behavioral biases. For example, if we compute
                    these threshold levels of exposure based on the estimates in table 3.3, we can
                    infer that users who traded more than 375 times, or have an experience (length
                    of use) higher than 149 days, would be less affected by the disposition bias as
                    they use the simulator more. In fact, except for the measure “length of use,” the
                    thresholds are surpassed for only the top 1  percent of users.8 The correlations
                    suggest that the great majority of users would need more training to minimize the
                    frequency of mistakes due to behavioral biases.
                               We report the results for the diversification effect in table 3.4. Given that
                    a low value for this variable means that the user holds a more diversified port-
                    folio, the story we get from the coefficients of the regressions is one in which
                    users become more diversified the more they use the simulator. However, the
                    relationship between the simulator variable and the diversification effect seems
                    to be a concave one. This suggests that users would settle on some restricted
                    set of stocks (more concentrated portfolios) as they use the simulator more. For
                    example, users who traded more than 236 times, or used the simulator for more

than 50 days and for a time range of at least 164 days, would shift from a more
diversified portfolio to a more concentrated one. One possible interpretation of
this is that users buy several different stocks when they are novices, and then
start to focus on a smaller group when they have more experience and familiarity
with the stock options. Campbell, Ramadorai, and Ranish (2012) draw on Cremes
and Petajisto (2009) to provide a different interpretation. According to them, there
is some support for the “idea that skilled investors hold concentrated portfolios.”
Although we are unable to control for skills in our regressions, our results could
be seen as suggesting that more training in the simulator pays off as individuals
learn. The accumulation of learning (or skills) would be translated into a more
concentrated portfolio.


3.8.2	       How important is simulator exposure and behavioral
             biases on portfolio performance?
This section investigates whether exposure to the simulator variables and the
behavioral biases variables affect the (adjusted) returns of users of the simulator.
The adjusted returns are computed as the difference between the returns the
users make with the simulator and the returns of the actual stock market. We
compute investor returns as in Barber and Odean (2000). We first create a time
series of day-end portfolio holdings of each stock for each investor. We then
126  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




                    compute the weights of each stock in the portfolio by dividing the value of a given
                    stock by the total value of all stocks in the investor’s portfolio on that day. To
                    compute the portfolio returns of each investor, we then multiply day-end weights
                    of each stock by that stock’s return over the next day. With this computation,
                    we ignore intraday trades. Once the return for each investor is computed, we
                    subtract from it the daily returns of the market.
                         Figures 3.5 and 3.6 present the distribution of the Sharpe ratio and adjusted
                    return for simulator users, respectively. As expected, the risk-adjusted returns
                    have a slightly negative mean, with most of the distribution around 0. That is, the
                    majority of investors underperform the market but only by a small margin. Simi-
                    larly, the Sharpe ratio is distributed with a mean close to the market Sharpe ratio.
                         When we study the correlation between the behavioral bias measures and
                    the adjusted returns (in tables 3.5 and 3.6), we find that there is an association.
                    In particular, users who are more diversified and who trade more (turnover) show
                    higher adjusted returns. Interestingly, of the few demographic variables we have,
                    it seems that age is negatively associated with returns. In contrast, table  3.5
                    suggests that there is no clear association between exposure to the simulator
                    and returns. Table 3.6 includes indicators for previous experiences in the stock
                    market, but the results are exactly the same.

     In table 3.7, we run the same specifications with the Sharpe ratio as with the
dependent variable. The Sharpe ratio is significantly associated with all the expo-
sure measures; in particular, exposure to the simulator leads to higher Sharpe
ratios. The results suggest that an increase of 25 trades result in an increase in
the Sharpe ratio of 0.03. Given that the market Sharpe ratio since 2005 has been
0.35, what we find is an economically significant result. In terms of behavioral
biases, disposition and less diversified portfolios are correlated with a smaller
Sharpe ratio, while users who trade frequently seem to be able to achieve a
higher risk-adjusted return. As with the adjusted returns, table 3.8 presents the
results with the experience dummies as controls. In fact, the coefficient for one of
the dummies is positive and highly significant in all regressions. This suggests that
simulator users with at least one year of experience in the stock market tended
to have higher Sharpe ratios.

                   3.8.3	       Does the simulator encourage the “right” people to
                                participate in the actual stock market?
                   We use a linear probability model to estimate users’ decision to participate in the
                   actual stock market. As explained in the methods section, the dependent variable
                   is defined as a dummy that takes the value of 1 if the simulator user (in 2011) is
                   in the actual stock market in 2012 and 0 if he or she does not participate in 2012
                   or in any of the previous years (2009–11). The model includes age, gender (male),
                   and state of residence, exposure to the simulator variables, indicators of returns
                   in the simulator, as well as the behavioral biase variables as predictors. Due to
                   high correlation between some variables on the right-hand side of the model, we
                   opted to run separate regressions.
                         The main results are in tables 3.9 and 3.10, where we present the results of
                   the main specifications on an unrestricted sample of simulator users (table 3.9)
                   and restricted to users with more than five trades (table 3.10). We discuss the
                   results together, as they were consistent across the two samples. There is some
                   evidence of a nudging effect from the simulator. Exposure to the simulator is
                   indeed associated with a higher probability of entering the market. Using the

estimates in table 3.9, we find that an increase of 30 trades leads to an increase
in the take-up probability by 0.5 percentage points. The magnitude of this coeffi-
cient is fairly relevant in this context, given that the average take-up is less than
3 percent. We also find the Sharpe ratio to be associated with higher take-up. This
finding suggests positive selection, with investors who perform well on a risk-ad-
justed basis to be more likely to participate in the market. There is some evidence
of learning and financial sophistication, with investors recognizing and improving
upon their investment acumen. At the same time, we find volatility to be asso-
ciated with higher participation, suggesting that investors who trade and invest
in lottery-type stocks may be drawn to the market for the wrong reasons. More
empirical work needs to be done before we can disentangle the different forces at
play. In terms of biases, the only clear association is with turnover effect. In other

              3.9	CONCLUSION
              This study explores the effectiveness of an online stock market simulator as a tool
              to overcome investor biases and improve performance through a learning-by-
              doing training experience. Using data from about 40,000 simulator participants,
              our findings offer several insights. First, exposure to the stock market simulator
              has some effect on behavioral biases; however, our results are not conclusive
              regarding the size and magnitude of this effect. It seems that simulator users
              are more affected by a disposition bias as they use the simulator more often.
              However, if simulator use is very heavy (which is the case for only 1 percent of the
              users in our data set), then the disposition bias would be reduced by exposure to
              the simulator. For diversification, we find that learning from the simulator drives
              users to hold a more concentrated portfolio.
                  In terms of the relationship between behavioral biases and measures
              of performance, our results are not conclusive. While there is a clear associa-
              tion, some biases are correlated with higher adjusted returns, while others are
              correlated with a decrease in measures of performance. Exposure to the simu-
              lator does not necessarily affect measures of performance in our data. However,
              an interesting result is that exposure to the simulator is correlated with a higher
              Sharpe ratio.
                  When we look at the link between participation in the simulator and tran-
              sition into the actual stock market, we find quite a strong relationship. We find
              support for a simulator nudging effect, as exposure to the simulator is asso-
              ciated with a higher probability of entering the market. In addition, there is
              evidence of both positive and negative selection into the stock market. Indeed,
              investors who have a higher Sharpe ratio in the simulator tend to enter more,
              but investors with higher volatility in the simulator display the same pattern.
              More empirical work needs to be done to disentangle the different forces at play
              on this dimension.
                  Overall, our results suggest that learning by doing can be a powerful tool
              to motivate investors to participate in the actual stock market. At the same
              time, learning by doing might not be enough to overcome behavioral biases. As
              such, learning by doing tools might have to be complemented with more specific
              training to avoid the risk of investors entering the market but not being ready to
              adopt an optimal investment behavior.

ANNEX 3A: DESCRIPTION OF THE BROADER IMPACT
EVALUATION RESEARCH PROGRAM
A large research program has been designed to address a core research ques-
tion: What interventions are most effective at improving participation in
the stock market and reducing biases in investor behavior? A broad program
of impact evaluation studies has been designed to address and disentangle the
different constraints and market failures hypothesized to be affecting investor
participation and behavior, including physical (financial education, financial and
nonfinancial entry costs, transaction costs, access) and psychological constraints
(such as self-control, time-inconsistent preferences, inertia, menu costs, peer
effects). The findings of the study will add to the literature by measuring the effec-
tiveness of new modes of financial education. The study will test multiple hypoth-
eses regarding barriers to effective participation in financial markets within a
unified framework, leading to better understanding of not only which investor
biases are most prevalent but also how targeted education and product offers
can mitigate these biases, as well as illustrating a framework in which impact
evaluations can be used to make real-time operational decisions in the private
sector (table 3A.1).
    This research program has three main components: (1) testing the effect
of an online stock market simulator as a learning-by-doing financial literacy tool
to improve knowledge and investor behavior; (2) reducing the barriers to stock
market participation offers to randomly selected groups of potential investors
participating in the simulator; and (3) providing financial information and details of
investment products through a stock broker online platform to individual inves-
tors with the aim of reducing investor biases.

                   Here we discuss in more detail barriers to entry and investor biases.


              3A.1	      Financial and time costs
              Direct financial costs as well as the costs associated with the time taken to learn
              about financial products play an important role in the decision to participate in
              financial markets. Participation costs can be broken into three categories: (1) fixed
              entry costs (such as any registration fees, the cost of time required to register,
              and any training and gathering of information required to make investment
              decisions); (2) variable trading costs (such as broker transaction fees, bid/ask
              spreads and custody fees); and (3) per period costs (such as the time required to
              review and reallocate portfolios, the associated complications in tax filings, and
              commensurate increase in time required that come with owning stocks). Each of
              these costs has the potential to price smaller investors out of the market. Viss-
              ing-Jørgensen (2002) for example shows that a US$50 annual cost associated with
              the required time and effort to continuously review stock holdings can explain
              nearly 50  percent of nonparticipation rates in the U.S. stock market. In Brazil,
              high fixed costs of participation mean that few investment options are targeted
              to lower-income individuals, thus effectively excluding this group from accessing
              suitable investment products—resulting in 61 percent of Brazilian stock investors
              being concentrated in the highest income group.9
                   Of particular interest in this study is the relationship between participation
              costs and other factors that may influence investor choices to determine the rela-
              tive importance of these different barriers to entry. Cole, Sampson, and Zia (2011)
              find that subsidizing the cost of opening a bank account by US$15 can increase the
              probability of opening a bank account by 12 percent, whereas providing a finan-
              cial literacy course for a similar cost (US$17) has little to no effect on opening an
              account, further enforcing the importance of financial barriers to entry. However,
              the case for financial education to support stock market participation may be
              stronger given the more sophisticated context and greater uncertainty related to
              this investment.


              3A.2	      Psychological barriers
              Demographics, financial education, and participation costs, while important, fail
              to fully explain investor choices. Even when people are fully aware of what the
              best action to take is, behavioral elements such as procrastination, time-incon-
              sistent preferences, and self-control influence decisions (Ariely 2009; DellaVigna
              2009). For instance, precommitment products have been shown to effectively

              The highest income group is class A, according to the income classification commonly used
              in Brazil.

overcome self-control problems and dramatically increase savings rates by using
contractual agreements to specify payment frequencies and amounts to be paid
by investors, effectively enforcing time consistency and removing the influence of
future temptations (Ashraf, Karlan, and Yin 2006).
    Behavioral factors are especially important in the decision to participate in
more complex financial markets such as the stock market. In contrast to simple
investment products, such as savings accounts or insurance, participation in the
stock market is associated with significant uncertainty. The participation decision
therefore involves not only a simple cost-benefit trade-off, but also individual atti-
tudes toward risk and uncertainty, and confidence in one’s ability to pick high-re-
turn investments.
    Risk-averse individuals are less likely to invest in the stock market. In fact, a
common approach to measure an individual’s risk aversion is to ask whether he
or she invests in the stock market. However, when we consider uncertainty as a
possible deterrent to stock market participation, an important distinction arises
between general risk aversion and ambiguity aversion. While risk aversion (usually
measured by eliciting choices between lotteries with different payoffs and proba-
bilities) captures an individual’s general dislike of taking gambles, ambiguity aver-
sion measures the aversion to “unknown risks” (Barsky et al. 1997).
    This is an important concept in understanding the decision to participate in
the stock market as opposed to traditional investments: risk-averse individuals
may simply dislike participating in markets with uncertainty and would always
chose a safe investment over one with variable outcomes. Ambiguity-averse
individuals, on the other hand, refrain from investing in the stock market simply
because they lack information about the probabilities of gains or losses (i.e., finan-
cial education or information about the returns of alternative investments). Even
when returns in the stock market may be superior to those of alternative invest-
ment, ambiguity-averse investors choose the former when they are ill informed
about stock market investments, avoiding the uncertain bet. This has important
implications for the ability of financial education to lower barriers to entry.
    In addition to the extent of information individuals have about financial risks
and returns, the way information is provided also plays an important role. For
instance, presenting consumers with fewer options has been shown to increase
take-up of both loans and retirement savings—a finding that is consistent with
the hypothesis that larger investment menus can trigger choice avoidance in
consumers (Bertrand et al. 2010). To overcome both choice avoidance and inertia,
the use of default options in retirement savings has been shown to increase
employee enrollment from 49 percent to 86 percent (Madrian and Shea 2001).
    Peer effects also play a potentially important role in investment choices. By
lowering the barriers to entry for a particular group of people, their peers become
significantly more likely to participate in savings products (Duflo and Saez 2003).
Similarly, people who socialize or have neighbors who invest in stocks are also
more likely to invest themselves (Hong, Kubik, and Stein 2004).

                      This study will draw on this body of knowledge on entry barriers by developing
              interventions directed to address these specific points by, for instance, varying
              the financial costs of participation, introducing targeted educational campaigns
              to overcome information constraints, and adapting the way in which this infor-
              mation is provided (e.g., simplifying the set of investment options offered to over-
              come choice avoidance or including information about similar investor profiles to
              leverage the influence of peer effects).
                      The fact that (1) regulatory barriers such as high start-up and participation
              costs (financial and nonfinancial) create a disincentive to active participation in
              the market; (2) people may not have the required knowledge to correctly choose
              the most effective investment strategy (information constraint); and (3) people
              are aware of the value of diversifying their assets to include stocks but choose
              not to for a variety of behavioral reasons such as choice avoidance, self-control
              problems, peer effects or ambiguity aversion.
                      As discussed above, this question fits within a broader research objective. In
              particular, we will test, through randomized experiments, several incentives and
              offers/products to reduce investor biases and barriers to stock market participa-
              tion.10 The research question addressed in this chapter constitutes an important
              first step in the implementation of the broader research program.

ABSTRACT
    Financial literacy training is growing in popularity across the developing
    world. Recent research results, though, have failed to find a significant
    impact from training on savings behavior. We experimentally test the impact
    of financial literacy training when paired with a branchless banking program
    that reaches those who do not have easy access to traditional banking. The
    intervention consisted of a two-day training on a random sample of 3,000
    clients served by a branchless banking facility across two adjacent districts
    in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India. The results reveal that the intervention
    had a significant impact on savings: savings in the treatment group increased
    by 29 percent (US$30) within a period of one year. Our results also indicate
    that attitudes related to financial planning improved after the intervention,
    but there was no impact on overall financial literacy. These findings suggest
    that financial education, when paired with branchless banking, can improve
    savings and behavioral outcomes, even when it does not significantly affect
    financial knowledge.

              4.1	INTRODUCTION
              In a rising number of developing countries, thanks to innovations in technolo-
              gy-based branchless banking, formal banking has expanded its outreach to previ-
              ously unbanked populations, including some of the most vulnerable segments. A
              recent study shows that between 500 and 800 million of the world’s poor now
              have access to finance (Deb and Kubzansky 2012). However, there is also evidence
              indicating that the majority of these individuals are not prepared to interact with
              the growing complexities of financial products and services. Scholars focusing
              on both developed (Lusardi and Mitchell 2006) and developing countries (Cole,
              Sampson, and Zia 2011) have documented low levels of financial literacy, including
              low knowledge and skills around basic concepts of personal financial manage-
              ment as well as low understanding of more general banking practices.
                  A growing literature suggests that financial literacy is correlated with house-
              hold well-being, including participation in savings, credit, investments (Hilgert,
              Hogarth, and Beverly 2003), and planning for retirement (Lusardi and Mitchell
              2007). Therefore, along with the increased focus on financial inclusion, a growing
              number of countries are developing national strategies for financial education
              and making more investments in related programs (Grifoni and Messy 2012). The
              basic premise behind these initiatives is that improved access, complemented
              with financial knowledge, will lead to responsible financial behavior among
              consumers. However, in order to provide more concrete policy directions in terms
              of program design, there is a need to establish causality between financial educa-
              tion and behavioral outcomes and, to the extent possible, examine the impact of
              the former on a number of variables along the causal chain.
                  To date, the evidence from field experimental research in analyzing the cause
              and effect of financial education has provided mixed results in both developed
              and developing countries. Duflo and Saez (2003) measure the impact of a benefit
              fair on retirement plan enrollment among employees of a university in the United
              States, but found small effects on enrollment. In a development context, Cole,
              Sampson, and Zia (2011) looked at the impact of financial education training among
              the unbanked in Indonesia, also finding no substantial effect on savings behavior.
              On the other hand, in Brazil, Bruhn et al. (2013) look at high school ﬁnancial educa-
              tion incorporated in the standard curriculum during three academic semesters,
              and report impact on financial literacy, attitudes, and behavioral change (based on
              self-reported data). Though not focusing on personal finance, Karlan and Valdivia
              (2011) examined the impact of business education on female entrepreneurs in
              Peru and found a significant increase in participants’ engagement in some of the
              activities included in the training, such as separating money between business
              and household, reinvesting profits, and maintaining records of sales and expenses.
                  One of the reasons for the lack of consistent findings could be that most
              poor people are often not familiar with formal savings programs. About 2.5 billion
              adults—just over half of the world’s adult population—do not use formal financial

services to save or borrow (Chaia et al. 2009). Many of these people participate in
other savings options, such as rotating savings and credit associations (ROSCAs),
but the majority do not opt for formal savings. This may be due to the lack of
knowledge about formal banking’s benefits or to the difficulty of access, since
most banks are not near the poor and do not offer services for low-level deposi-
tors. Doorstep banking—also called “last mile” banking, as the bank reaches out
to those who cannot make it to the banks—can often be found in retail shops,
through agents that live in or near the villages, or through mobile banking vehicles,
or even mobile phones, such as those being pioneered by M-Pesa and M-Kesho
(Demombynes and Thegeya 2012). Doorstep banking makes it easier for people
to handle formal savings accounts, though it is a new and still poorly understood
idea.
    There are some advantages to formal banking. Unlike village savings programs,
banks offer privacy from family members and other villagers, decreased risk of
theft or default, and reliability. When financed by nongovernmental organiza-
tions or through government regulation, they can also be low cost or even free
of any charges. Dupas and Robinson (2013a) find that giving female micro-enter-
prise owners in Kenya access to this type of low-cost savings account increases
savings, productive investment, and food expenditures.
    Sometimes unique savings programs offer the best chance for households
to save. Duflo, Kremer, and Robinson (2011) experimented with alternative money
storage options by encouraging farmers to spend money at harvest time on
fertilizers for the next season, which were then delivered for free. The program
was found to increase fertilizer usage. Brune et al. (2011) gave Malawi farmers
either normal savings accounts or commitment savings accounts with which the
farmers had to specify when money could be withdrawn. The rate of deposits was
high for the commitment savings accounts and almost twice that of the normal
accounts. Similarly, Ashraf, Karlan, and Yin (2006, 2010) introduced commitment
savings accounts in the Philippines for those who already had savings accounts
and found increased saving rates.
    The experimental literature suggests there is reason to be skeptical about
financial literacy. We present a randomized field experiment in India to measure
the impact of a financial education program, delivered in conjunction with doorstep
banking, on savings behavior among low-income households. The methodolog-
ical and conceptual contribution of the study is thus to experimentally explore the
causal relationship between financial education and savings, and between financial
education and financial capabilities, in combination with branchless banking.
    We find that the financial education intervention had a significant impact on
savings. Individuals who received the training saved 29  percent more than the
control group. Moreover, we find improvements on attitudes related to finan-
cial planning, but we do not find impact on financial knowledge. These findings
suggest that financial education can improve behavioral outcomes, even if it does
not affect overall financial literacy.
142  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




                   In common with hypotheses put forward in the literature on financial literacy
              training, we also look at heterogeneity analysis and discover three interesting
              findings. First, financial attitudes improve more among less educated individuals.
              Second, increased interest in financial matters and a shift from informal to formal
              savings are found among individuals more financially educated at baseline. Third,
              the intervention was less effective for more impatient individuals.
                   We also discuss some of the mechanisms behind these results and show
              that the treatment effect is not merely given by a substitution from other forms
              of savings to the doorstep banking account, but, on the contrary, the program
              crowded in other formal savings as well.



              4.2	       EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN

              4.2.1	     The program
              The doorstep banking and financial literacy training was conducted in cooperation
              with FINO Paytech Foundation, a for-profit financial services company based in
              India and specializing in offering technology-based banking transactions. FINO
              works with different financial institutions to enable access to financial services
              for previously excluded segments of society by offering last mile service delivery
              through a number of portable devices, including biometric smart cards, hand-
              held devices, and micro-deposit machines with biometric authentication. The
              model FINO employs to reach out to households in rural areas is based on busi-
              ness correspondents, also known as bandhus, who are permanently based in the
              villages where FINO operates and serve as the focal point, or contact person,
              between the financial institution and community members. This model helps
              introduce the bank to the poor, who usually are not familiar or comfortable with
              traditional banking institutions, through a more personal interaction. To date,
              FINO has trained more than 10,000 bandhus, serving over 58 million customers,
              and it is adding close to a million clients per month (Forbes India 2012).
                   While doorstep banking has had enormous success in expanding access, as
              many studies that look at the impact of branchless banking have shown, access in
              and of itself does not make individuals financially more aware or literate (Thyaga-
              rajan and Venkatesan 2008, India; Dupas et al. 2012, Kenya). For example, out of
              the sample of 3,000 individuals randomly drawn from FINO’s administrative data-
              base who had signed up for FINO bank accounts and were observed over a period
              of two months, 88 percent were found to have made no transactions, with only
              10  percent holding a positive balance.1 While there could be many factors that


              1 
                Source: Administrative data shared by FINO. Such a picture also reflects the fact that
              bandhus received around Rs 20–25 for signing up each client and so have an incentive to
              sign up as many clients as possible, not just those with a strong interest in banking.

account for this shortcoming—including lack of financial resources, potential lack
of effective access, lack of trust in branchless banking, and behavioral biases—
concern exists among many researchers and policy makers that low levels of
financial literacy are a major constraint. In the case of FINO, it is important to
note that most of the individuals who signed up for bank accounts were provided
instructions on how to use the portable cards and on the types of transactions
they could make; also, they had ongoing access to the bandhus for any question.
However, it is likely that these FINO clients did not have a general understanding
about the benefits of responsible financial management or about basic concepts
of personal finance. Also, irregular presence of FINO bandhus might result in low
transactions by limiting access to transaction points.
    The financial literacy curriculum was developed in collaboration with FINO.
The intervention consisted of a two-day financial education training program,
delivered through a video (two to three hours per day) in a classroom setting,
followed by interactive discussions on the presentation. It was implemented
between May and August 2011 across two adjacent districts in the state of Uttar
Pradesh. Table 4.1 illustrates the contents covered by the training, which mostly
focused on three topics: the role of formal banking in people’s lives; responsible
borrowing, spending, and saving; and cash management. Overall, the training
material was standard and based on classic modules used in other financial
literacy interventions; the only difference was that the beneficiaries were also

              told more about how to use the FINO bank card. The content of the training was
              developed by FINO under the overall guidance of the evaluation team, while the
              video was designed in collaboration with a company specialized in street plays
              and movie production. Professional trainers employed by FINO delivered the
              training, and the bandhu who served the area was present to engage the clients
              in the workshop discussions.


              4.2.2	Hypotheses
              Our key hypothesis is that financial education can indeed be effective in changing
              savings behavior among existing FINO account holders from low-income house-
              holds. More specifically, we are interested in (1) the impact of the financial
              education training on savings rates; and (2) the impact of the financial education
              training on financial knowledge, budgeting skills, and attitudes about good money
              management. The breakdown of the analysis in these two dimensions will allow
              us to examine in more depth the impact of the intervention along the variables in
              the causal chain.
                  Furthermore, in order to understand whether there might be alternative and
              more cost-effective ways to deliver the message that saving is important, we try
              to investigate which elements are required for the success of the program. For
              this purpose, we introduced a cross-cutting intervention consisting of a simple
              10-minute house visit to stress the importance of saving in formal instruments
              during the postharvest period (when people have more money), followed up by a
              monthly five-minute phone conversation to remind people to save. Besides high-
              lighting the importance of saving and the benefits of formal savings, this post-
              harvest intervention also included the setting of savings goals and the delivery
              of information about expected dates of bandhu presence in the area. Hence,
              we test whether a simple intervention is as effective as the classroom financial
              literacy training; we also check whether the postharvest reminders can leverage
              the effect of the training.


              4.2.3	      The sample
              The experiment was conducted on a random sample of individuals in villages
              where FINO operates. Villages were randomly selected to either receive the
              training or receive no training. Individuals from treatment villages who had FINO
              bank cards were then randomly selected to be offered the financial education
              training.
                  The program was rolled out with the clients of 200 bandhus who were working
              in the villages of the two experiment districts of Varanasi and Azamgarh in Uttar
              Pradesh. These bandhus were selected from the list of all FINO agents using a
              distance-based dropping method to prevent contamination between treatment
              and control groups. From a pair of bandhus who were located in villages very close
              to each other (less than 1.25 kilometers), one bandhu was randomly dropped to
                                       4.  Does financial education affect savings behavior?  ◾ 145




minimize spillovers; bandhus whose own service areas were far apart (more than
10 kilometers) were also dropped to make data collection and training easier.
These 200 bandhus were then randomly assigned into treatment and control
groups, and for each bandhu, 25 clients were randomly selected through FINO’s
client records updated in January 2011. Using these FINO records, a prebase-
line randomization check was undertaken to ensure that the sample was well
balanced with respect to available demographic and account activity information.
The results of the balance test showed that before the baseline there were indeed
no observable differences between treatment and control FINO clients.2 Finally,
from the list of 25 clients, a sample of 15 clients per bandhu was drawn for the
survey interview.3 So, in total, 3,000 households were selected for the baseline
survey, which took place in April 2011; the endline was collected one year later
in April 2012. Around November 2011, the sample was further divided, assigning
half of the treatment and half of the control groups to receive the postharvest
intervention (house visit and reminder phone calls). As a result, four groups were
formed: pure control, pure treatment, only postharvest intervention, and treat-
ment plus postharvest intervention.



4.3	DATA

4.3.1	Questionnaires
The questionnaires were designed to determine clients’ knowledge of financial
behaviors and tools, and thus collected detailed information on various indica-
tors assumed to play an important role in household financial well-being. They
covered the following topics: household demographics, such as the number of
family members, age, educational attainment, income, primary and secondary
occupation; household ownership of assets; household expenditures, savings,
and borrowings; respondent perceptions and behaviors about budgeting, involve-
ment in household financial matters, and financial knowledge and attitudes; and
respondent time and risk preferences. Additionally, a module on FINO services

   The variables included in the prebaseline balance test were: percentage female; share of
clients in the age groups 18–24, 25–59, and 60 and above; and share of clients who made at
least one transaction in the six-month period before February 2011.
3 
  Buffers of 10 clients per bandhu were kept to ensure that, for each bandhu, the target of
15 clients could be surveyed. The first 15 clients (based on the sorting of randomly assigned
client identifications) per bandhu were treated as the priority, and the buffer was only used
in the extreme case where, in spite of every effort, the survey team was unable to find the
client from the original list.

                  was added in the endline survey to assess the experience of the clients with the
                  branchless banking delivered by FINO.


                  4.3.2	      Outcome variables at baseline
                  Table 4.2 presents descriptive information to show how rural households in our
                  sample saved at the time of the baseline survey. To estimate savings, we rely on
                  self-reported data—i.e., the respondents’ recall of the balance amount in each
                  formal account and informal savings tool.
                         In April 2011, mean formal savings were Rs 4,376 (US$51) or about twice the
                  average monthly income, while mean informal savings (mostly home savings
                  or savings in self-help groups) amounted to only Rs 619—showing that, in our
                  sample, formal savings are more prevalent than informal savings. Even though

technically the entire sample had no-frills savings accounts served by FINO, only
87 percent of households reported having an account through FINO, suggesting
that some clients were either not aware they had FINO accounts or did not under-
stand what they were signing up for when they opened the account.
     Noticeably, even though about 94  percent of households reported having
a formal savings account at baseline, only 59  percent had a nonzero balance,
suggesting that other constraints than access to bank services limited savings
amounts. Considering only FINO accounts, the figures are worse: only 24 percent
of households appeared to use the account for savings by keeping a nonzero
balance.4 Such baseline levels present potential scope for financial education
training to help develop better saving behaviors.
     Almost 60  percent of FINO account holders also had at least one other
formal savings account. About 51  percent had an account in a nationalized
bank, 6 percent in a post office, 5 percent in a private bank, and 2 percent with
a nongovernmental organization (the categories are not mutually exclusive). This
picture is similar to the percentages presented by Demirguc-Kunt and Klapper
(2012) based on the nationally representative Global Findex data set in India. They
showed that in 2011 between 22  and 56  percent of the population (with exact
percentages depending on income quintile) had an account at a formal financial
institution. The fact that half of the respondents had a national bank account
suggests that, while banking may be difficult, considered unimportant, or expen-
sive in the areas where FINO operates, people are interested in obtaining formal
savings despite the extra costs. This finding also reflects that in 2006 the Reserve
Bank of India imposed on all commercial banks the introduction of free no-frills
accounts (Thyagarajan and Venkatesan 2008). Thus, in the study area, the extra
cost of keeping another formal account consists mostly of the traveling cost of
reaching the nearest bank.5
     To define our indicator of financial literacy we follow the approach introduced
by Cole, Sampson, and Zia (2011) and Carpena et al. (2011). The former presents
the first nationally representative measure of financial literacy in a developing
world, while the latter identifies “three distinct dimensions of financial knowl-
edge”: financial numeracy, basic awareness of financial choices, and attitudes
toward financial decisions. Thus, our questionnaire covered different aspects of
financial literacy, including budgeting skills, interest in financial matters, basic
financial numeracy, financial product awareness, and financial attitudes.
     Budgeting quality refers to the skills of making a budget, writing it down, eval-
uating it as helpful, and being able to stick to it. Interest in financial matters covers

                 responses regarding involvement in household financial matters and self-as-
                 sessed understanding of information related to financial products. Table 4.3 pres-
                 ents the summary statistics for these first two measures of financial literacy. In
                 the baseline, budgeting quality appeared to be particularly low: 73 percent of the
                 respondents did not make a budget and, even when they did, they mostly kept it
                 only mentally. A considerable fraction of individuals (24 percent) also reported not
                 being involved at all in financial matters and not being actively interested in finan-
                 cial topics (48 percent). When asked about their understanding of financial prod-
                 ucts, almost half of the respondents stated that, in general, they rarely or never
                 understood financial information, especially on loan and savings products. Even
                 though these percentages might not represent a particularly alarming picture,
                 they still signal a generalized lack of financial understanding and involvement.

                     Table 4.4 presents descriptive statistics regarding financial knowledge and
                 compares our results to the findings of Cole, Sampson, and Zia (2011) from rural
                 India and Indonesia and of Carpena et al. (2011) from urban India.
                     The first measure of financial numeracy is based on the study by Cole,
                 Sampson, and Zia (2011), which is in turn very close to the work of Lusardi and
                 Mitchell (2006), who pioneered the research on financial literacy. It includes a
                 question on compound interest, along with one on interest rates versus inflation
                 (see table 4A.1 in the annex to this chapter for details). The main purpose of these
                 questions is to test respondents’ understanding of basic economic concepts (i.e.,
                 inflation, interest rate, and compound interest) that are considered indispens-
                 able for making financial decisions. For this reason, we rename our measure of
                 financial numeracy as “understanding of basic economic concepts.” Our indicator
                 appears to be in line with previous estimations: in our sample, the mean share

of correct answers is 71  percent; it was 70  percent in the Cole, Sampson, and
Zia (2011) sample representative of the Indonesian population and 42 percent for
their sample of 1,500 poor households in rural Gujarat. Thus, our sample is more
comparable with average samples in other developing countries than with Indian
subsamples of poorer laborers in subsistence agriculture.
    Second, to define basic awareness of financial choices, we follow the paper
by Carpena et al. (2011); they define this indicator as the “knowledge of funda-
mental financial planning concepts, as well as details of financial products, [such
as] understanding of deposit insurance or of the purpose of a household budget”
(Carpena et al. 2011, 13–14) (see table 4A.1). Since, in this case, the comparison
150  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              is with a subsample from urban India, the means in our sample variables are on
              average lower than the means showed in Carpena et al. (2011), especially for
              more complicated concepts such as deposit insurance.
                   Finally, financial attitudes are also measured, as in Carpena et al. (2011), by
              presenting hypothetical situations to respondents and asking them about the
              financial products or financial advice they would suggest in the given scenario
              (see table 4A.1). Some of these questions have an ascending range of correct
              answers, so they are coded as continuous variables from 0 to 1 with 1 equal to
              the best financial option and 0.5 weight on the second best option. Again, with an
              average mean of 0.68, our measure of financial attitudes is on average lower than
              the one presented by Carpena et al. (2011) based on an urban subsample.


              4.3.3	     Socioeconomic background of clients and balance
                         test
              Respondents in our sample are of relatively low socioeconomic status. House-
              hold heads are mostly males and are on average 45 years old; about 40 percent
              of them are illiterate. Households are mostly Hindu and have an average of six to
              seven members, of which four are adults. About 70  percent of the households
              own land, with income from harvest and livestock contributing about 45 percent
              of total income. At baseline, the income from primary and secondary occupations
              was on average only Rs 1,079 (US$20)—slightly above the poverty threshold (the
              state poverty line for rural Uttar Pradesh in 2010 was fixed at Rs 663). The mean of
              total household income was Rs 2,028 (US$38), while the mean of total household
              expenditures was Rs 1,773 (US$33); this suggests that, on average, households
              did not manage to save much. In fact, about 50 percent of households resorted to
              loans, with the average loan amount equal to Rs 4,839 (US$90).
                   Table 4.5 presents the results of the balance test relative to all basic house-
              hold characteristics. The baseline variables seem well balanced, except for the
              total number of outstanding formal loans. In order to avoid any bias that might
              arise in estimating treatment effects, we include all unbalanced variables as
              controls in the empirical analysis.6




               Other variables unbalanced at baseline are whether the client has at least secondary
              6 


              education, whether the client had a loan, the number of females in the household, whether
              the client had a non-FINO bank account, and the level of overall financial literacy. These
              variables are included as controls in all regressions.

              4.4	          IMPACTS ON SAVINGS AND FINANCIAL LITERACY

              4.4.1	        Summary statistics of the outcome variables
              The first outcome of interest is whether the program caused any increment in the
              amount of the following types of savings: FINO savings, formal savings (including
              FINO, post office, and other commercial bank accounts), non-FINO formal bank
              savings, savings in other nationalized banks, informal savings, and total savings.
              All savings amounts are capped at the 99th  percentile in order to eliminate
              outliers. The second outcome of interest is whether the intervention resulted in
              any improvement in the different indicators of financial literacy described above.
              Each indicator is expressed as the average of the answers belonging to the same
              dimension of financial literacy. Table 4.6 shows the relevant summary statistics
              and includes all households present in both the baseline and endline surveys.
              Columns 1–3 give values for the pre-intervention, while columns 4–6 refer to the
              post-intervention. All standard errors reported are adjusted for clustering at the
              village level (bandhu service area).7
                      Column 6 gives a first approximation of the impact of the financial literacy
              training on savings; the difference between treatment and control endline savings
              measures is always positive and statistically significant, in spite of the fact that
              the control group seems to improve along with the treatment group. To mini-
              mize measurement errors and show only the effect of training, we repeat the
              comparisons including only pure treatment and pure control (i.e., excluding the
              beneficiaries of the postharvest intervention). As expected, the difference is even
              starker in this case: the treatment group increases total savings on average by
              154 percent, while the control group experiences an increase of 66 percent. The
              fact that the control group improves as well is not so surprising if we take into
              account the fact that Uttar Pradesh is one of India’s states that is growing more
              rapidly than others. The control group also improves in financial literacy. This
              could be because people are replying to the same questions again. Looking at the
              significance levels of column 3 of table 4.6, it is clear that controlling for baseline
              values is important as not all the financial measures were perfectly balanced at
              baseline—in spite of the fact that randomization was successful and significant
              differences appeared only at a rate equal to that given by chance.

              4.4.2	      The estimation method
              For our estimation, we employ an analysis of covariance specification (Bruhn and
              McKenzie 2009; McKenzie 2011).8 We regress the outcome indicator on the treat-
              ment status of household h controlling for the baseline value of the indicator:

              	                        Yh POST = α + βTh + ηYh PRE + δXh PRE + εh POST	(4.1)

              where X represents household control variables unbalanced at the baseline and
              standard errors are adjusted for clustering at the village/bandhu level. The treat-
              ment effect is thus estimated by β.
                   As in similar studies, the take-up rate for the financial literacy training was less
              than full. Defining a client as having attended the program if he or she attended
              class for at least one hour, class attendance was irregular with only 80 percent of
              the invited ever attending class. Table 4A.2 presents a list of baseline character-
              istics that might have influenced attendance status in the treatment group. There
              are no noticeable differences in savings or financial literacy levels between those
              who attended and those who were offered the class but did not attend; the only
              exception being that attendees had more positive financial attitudes. Also, clients
              who attended seem to be more likely to be females and older.
                   To take into account imperfect compliance, in addition to the standard ordi-
              nary least squares (OLS) intention-to-treat (ITT) regressions that estimate overall
              impacts, we also employ instrumental variable (IV) regressions that use the initial
              assignment (the ITT) as an instrument for actual treatment to assess the treat-
              ment effect on the treated (ToT). In explaining our results, we focus on the ITT
              estimates while we present the ToT parameters for comparison.
                   Finally, differential attrition between the treatment and comparison groups
              could potentially bias our results. To minimize attrition, the survey team under-
              took a rigorous search for tracking back the baseline sample (including pre-end-
              line house visits) and, in some cases, used the help of the bandhus to relocate
              the households. These efforts ensured a low attrition rate: attrition was only
              2.8  percent and 2.1  percent, respectively, in the comparison and treatment
              groups. Furthermore, the baseline characteristics of households that left the
              sample were similar in the treatment and comparison groups, suggesting that the
              factors leading to attrition were the same—and, consequently, that attendance
              and treatment status were unrelated (the results of the estimation regressing
              attrition on treatment assignment are shown in table 4A.4). Therefore, attrition is
              unlikely to be a problem in our estimation strategy.



               As a robustness check, we also replicated the estimation regressing the change in the
              8 


              outcome indicator (post-intervention value in levels minus pre-intervention value in levels)
              on the treatment status, controlling for the baseline value of the indicator (YPOST − YPRE = α +
              βT + δXPRE + ηYPRE + ε POST, as in Banerjee et al. 2007). Such a robustness check gave the same
              results, confirming the validity of our estimates.

4.4.3	       Estimates of the average impacts on savings
Table 4.7 displays the average impacts of the financial education intervention on
increments in the savings amount. These estimates show a positive and substan-
tial treatment effect both in the ITT specifications (panel A) and in the ToT (IV)
specifications (panel B).
     Looking at the ITT specification, the program caused an increase in total
savings of Rs 1,647 (about US$30) from April 2011 to April 2012, which equals
an increase of 29  percent compared to the endline total savings in the control
group. Considering the IV specification, the effect of training attendance is even
higher and equal to an increase in total savings of almost Rs 2,000 (about US$38),
or 35 percent compared to the control group. The effect is robust to the different
specifications and even though the magnitude changes slightly depending on the
regression, the treatment effect remains positive and significant. Foremost, the
increment does not seem to be determined only by a marketing effect on FINO
savings because formal non-FINO savings also grew substantially. In fact, still
considering the ITT estimates, the program increased FINO savings by Rs 88 and
formal savings other than FINO by Rs 1,559. Therefore, given that the program
was mostly aimed at increasing savings, it appears to be quite effective.
     Table 4.8 shows that the postharvest intervention did not have a significant
effect on savings. It was successful only in increasing FINO savings by an extra
Rs 56 (Rs 122 in total, compared to an increase of Rs 66 for those who were
assigned to receive only the training), possibly because the delivery of information

                    about the expected dates of bandhu presence or the actual presence of the
                    bandhus helped improve delivery of the FINO service. The relative ineffectiveness
                    of the reminder intervention suggests that even if the postharvest is a relevant
                    period to boost attention toward savings (Duflo, Kremer, and Robinson 2011) and
                    even if reminders have been found to be effective in previous field experiments
                    in Latin America and Asia (Karlan et al. 2012; Kast, Meier, and Pomeranz 2012), a
                    simple targeted phone call is not as successful as a two-day training class with
                    video-illustrated lessons and interactive discussions to underline the importance
                    of savings and ensure that the contents are internalized.


                    4.4.4	       Estimates of the average impacts on financial literacy
                    Table 4.9 illustrates the average impacts of the financial education intervention
                    on improvements in different aspects of financial literacy. It shows that the only
                    dimension of financial literacy that appears to have been positively affected by
                    the treatment is financial attitudes. The IV estimates show that the intervention
                    increased the financial attitudes indicator of individuals in the treatment group by
                    3 percent, compared to the endline mean in the control group.
                         This result is somewhat in line with what was previously found in the liter-
                    ature; in particular, it can be related to the conclusions of Carpena et al. (2011),
                    which highlighted positive effects of financial literacy on financial attitudes and
                    basic financial awareness. The exception is that our intervention did not seem
                    to have any effect on financial awareness. However, this may be due to various
                    reasons that might not ensure comparability of the results. First, a problem that
                    has undermined our ability to identify a significant impact is that the survey was
                    answered by the FINO client only when he or she was available; in the remaining
                    cases, it was answered by the other most knowledgeable person in the house-
                    hold. Therefore, we repeat the estimation on the restricted sample of clients who

responded to both the baseline and endline surveys because—even though this
might be a selected sample—we need to check whether the absence of a signif-
icant impact on financial knowledge can be attributed to measurement error. As
shown in table 4.10, the new results confirm our previous findings and, as before,
the only significant treatment coefficient is the one on financial attitudes. The
magnitude of impact is now higher and equal to a 4 percent (ITT) to 5 percent (IV)
increase as compared to the endline value in the control group. It could also be
because our financial education training was tailored differently than previously
evaluated financial education programs, as it was more focused on increasing
savings and less oriented toward improving financial knowledge. In fact, even
restricting the measure of financial knowledge to include only the questions
that must have been well underlined in the training does not modify our results
(column 6 of tables 4.9 and 4.10).9

  We include in this indicator the following questions: question 2 on financial numeracy;
questions 1, 2, and 4 on financial awareness; and questions 1 and 4 on financial attitudes.
Thus, we exclude the following questions: question 1 on financial numeracy, because it
involves numerical skills the training did not cover; question 3 on financial awareness,
because it deals with the concept of deposit insurance which was not explicitly included in
the training program; and questions 2 and 3 on financial attitudes, because they are framed
in a very subjective way. See table 4A.1 for the detailed list of questions.

                       Our findings are also similar to the results of Doi, McKenzie, and Zia (2012),
                   who find a positive and significant effect of financial education on financial atti-
                   tudes and financial awareness; however, they use an indicator of awareness that is
                   more relaxed than other measures of financial knowledge and assess it by asking
                   respondents only whether they have heard about different financial products.
                   Interestingly, the authors redefine financial attitudes as “applied financial knowl-
                   edge,” since the questions included in this indicator deal with real-life situation
                   where an individual could use in practice his or her financial understanding—for
                   instance, to suggest an appropriate financial product to someone who is worried
                   about meeting expenses if sick.
                       Finally, table 4.11 replicates the results using standardized indicators to ensure
                   the comparability of the effects. Normalized scores for each dimension of finan-
                   cial literacy are calculated like school test scores, by first summing the results of
                   each question belonging to that dimension and then standardizing by subtracting
                   the mean pre-intervention score of the comparison group and dividing by the
                   standard deviation of the pre-intervention scores of the comparison group as in
                   Banerjee et al. (2007). The ITT estimates show that the intervention increased
                   the average score for financial attitudes of individuals in the treatment group by
                   0.09 standard deviations (equal to a 4  percent increase). The IV estimates are
                   similar and just slightly higher in magnitude: the effect on financial attitudes for
                   those who attended the training is equal to a 0.11 standard deviation increase or
                   a 5 percent increment. This result is very close to the increment estimated using
                   the mean value of financial attitudes.

4.4.5	Heterogeneity
To test for heterogeneity in the treatment effect based on observable character-
istics, we run the following set of regressions:

	                  Yh POST = α + βTh + γTh × TRAITh + ηYh PRE + δXh PRE + εh POST	(4.2)

where TRAIT is the vector of background characteristics along which theory would
predict heterogeneity in the treatment impacts and where X also includes TRAIT
among the controls. The effect of the treatment for the subgroup of people with
a given trait is given by the sum of the coefficients β and γ, and if γ is significantly
different from zero then there is evidence of heterogeneity in the treatment effect
for that trait. Since the ITT estimates are more relevant for policy impacts and
since the IV estimates are close to the ITT ones, we only show the tables with the
ITT estimates for this heterogeneity discussion.10 For comparison purposes, we




  The ITT estimates are more relevant for policy impacts because people cannot be forced
10 


to attend, and policy makers need to know what would be the overall effect of treatment
taking into account that not everyone assigned to treatment might comply. In addition,
even though in our case attendance is orthogonal to treatment, the sample of those who
160  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              also choose to use the standardized measures of financial literacy instead of the
              mean values (the tables using the mean values are in annex B).
                    We estimate equation 4.2 for the following different baseline characteristics:
              client education (at least secondary), the baseline measure of overall financial
              literacy, client gender, client time preferences, the baseline level of household per
              capita total expenditures, and an indicator for having a formal savings account
              other than FINO at baseline.11
                    In line with analysis conducted by Cole, Sampson, and Zia (2011), who found
              that a financial education program had a modest effect and positively influenced
              financial behaviors only for those with limited education and financial literacy, we
              also test the role of education and baseline financial literacy to check whether
              our sample offers a similar picture. Tables 4.12 and 4.13 show the heterogeneous
              treatment impacts on savings increments and on improvements in financial
              literacy, respectively. For education, there is no heterogeneity in the treatment
              effect on savings, but there is indeed heterogeneity in the treatment effect on
              financial attitudes. In particular, more educated people seem to have changed
              their attitudes less than other clients in the treatment group; this confirms find-
              ings by Cole, Sampson, and Zia (2011) about greater effects of financial education
              on the less educated. On the contrary, the heterogeneous impact of baseline
              financial literacy runs in opposite direction to what would be expected based on
              Cole, Sampson, and Zia (2011) results. In our sample, those with better baseline
              financial literacy positively and significantly improved their interest in financial
              matters by 0.2 standard deviations (0.08 + 0.12); they even slightly increased their
              basic understanding of basic economic concepts by 0.11 standard deviations
              (0.06  +  0.05). Also, they significantly decreased their informal savings by Rs 80
              (−18 and −62, table 4.12). This finding might indicate that a sufficient prior famil-
              iarity with financial concepts helps in learning more during a financial education
              program.
                    Similar to Dupas and Robinson (2013b) on health savings, we also control for
              heterogeneity in treatment impacts for gender and time preferences. Tables 4.14
              and 4.15 show the results of this additional test. There is no heterogeneity for
              gender, but there is a strong heterogeneous effect for time preferences. Specifi-
              cally, more impatient individuals (those with higher discount rates) improved their
              financial attitudes significantly less compared to an average client in the treatment


              attended is a selected sample with peculiar characteristics different from those of the
              average population.

                The tables shown focus only on the treatment effects, but the selected characteristics
              11 


              have significant direct effects, too. In particular, education and baseline financial literacy
              are significantly and positively correlated with endline savings and financial capability
              measures, being impatient decreases savings, females have less endline savings in national
              bank accounts and score worse in financial literacy, and those with higher baseline expen-
              ditures increased their financial numeracy skills.

group and even scored worse in budgeting skills. Accordingly, they also saved
significantly less than average and their total savings after the training increased
only by Rs 195 (Rs 754 − Rs 559, about US$3). This result is in line with the Dupas and
Robinson (2013b) findings on the importance of time preference bias in influencing
saving behaviors. In fact, the authors showed that a simple safe box significantly
helped people in rural Kenya save more through a mental accounting effect; such
a basic technology was not useful for people with present-biased preferences who
managed to save only when facing social pressure through a savings device with a
strong social commitment feature (a health pot at a ROSCA).
    Finally, we test for heterogeneity in the treatment effects based on baseline
expenditures (per capita total expenditures) and on whether the client already
had another formal account other than with FINO. Tables 4.16 and 4.17 show that
there is almost no heterogeneity in expenditures, while there is a heterogeneous
impact for those clients who also had a non-FINO formal savings account. It
seems that those who already had a formal non-FINO savings account increased
their interest in financial matters by 0.19 standard deviations (0.27 − 0.08) and
they even slightly improved their overall financial knowledge (i.e., only including
the questions that must have been stressed in the training) by 0.01 standard
deviations (0.14 − 0.13). Moreover, after the training, they also saved more, expe-
riencing an increment in total savings equal to Rs 2,544 (Rs 2,012 + Rs 532). Thus,
these results possibly indicate that the intervention was more effective in influ-
encing the behavior of the clients who already had an exposure to formal savings
bank accounts, rather than those who were linked with the banking system for
the first time through the no-frills savings account served by FINO.


4.4.6	    Estimates of the average impacts on household
          wealth
Table 4.18 shows the average impacts of the financial literacy training on consump-
tion. Interestingly, clients in the treatment group decreased their unnecessary
expenses in cigarettes, tobacco, beetle nuts, and alcohol. This effect is statisti-
cally significant, but not economically relevant since the decrease corresponds to
only US$0.5. Nonetheless, it is a remarkable finding, and the low magnitude might
be due to the short time frame of the evaluation or to general underreporting of
tobacco and alcohol expenses. Such results suggest that the intervention was
successful in increasing savings at least in part through boosting commitment to
save and improving money management.
    Table 4.19 completes the results on household wealth, illustrating the average
impacts of the intervention on loans and assets. As expected, there are no signif-
icant effects on total loans and assets sold after the intervention, demonstrating
that clients did not increase savings through costly actions—i.e., by borrowing
money or disinvesting. On the contrary, it seems that after training, individuals in
the treatment group bought more assets.

4.5	         DISCUSSION OF THE RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Our key finding is that the financial education program increased total savings on
average by 29 percent (as compared to the endline savings of the control group).
The success of the intervention in increasing savings is in line with the fast-growing
literature on savings in developing countries that has established that even the
poorer are not simply “too poor to save.” Collins et al. (2009) document that poor
families in Bangladesh, India, and South Africa save resources through a wide
variety of informal or semi-formal savings devices. Banerjee and Duflo (2007),
looking at household survey data from 13 countries, find that extremely poor
households do not use all of their income to afford necessities. Similarly, evidence
from bank expansion in developing countries suggests that improving access to
the formal financial sector increases savings and income (Aportela 1999; Bruhn
and Love 2009; Burgess and Pande 2005). Still, we try to explore various reasons
that might have contributed to the increment in savings in our sample.
     First, this success might be due to the fact that the program was delivered in
conjunction with a doorstep banking service, and it might just have worked as a
marketing campaign for the FINO account. Indeed, the FINO account offered the
major advantage of not only being without fees, but also accessible to clients in
their village and thus free of traveling costs. As Schaner (2011) underlines, even
if one considers the benefits of formal savings versus home savings (Rb > Rh),
166  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              individuals might still be averse to saving formally when savings are small because
              bank accounts also have a fixed transaction cost and the difference between
              Rb and Rh might not be attractive enough to outweigh it. However, when the trans-
              action cost is reduced, individuals who were already using a bank account will
              make more deposits and withdrawals, while other individuals who were not using
              bank accounts will start to use them. Eventually, such increase in account use is
              likely to lead to higher formal (but not necessarily total) savings levels. In fact, in
              a parallel and preliminary study about the effect of financial literacy training on
              use of FINO accounts on the same sample, Sarr, Sadhu, and Fiala (2012) find that
              the numbers of withdrawals and deposits significantly increased after the inter-
              vention. However, even offering a formal banking service for free might not be
              enough if the quality of service is not ensured and trust issues are not addressed.
              For example, Dupas et al. (2012) emphasize that efforts to expand financial access
              will effectively achieve financial inclusion only by comprising a communication
              component that brings awareness of the various financial options available.
              Accordingly, their randomized experiment suggests that entry costs (including
              opening fees and the administrative hassle of opening an account) explain only
              about one-fifth of the low banking rates observed in their sample from rural Kenya.
                    Thus, our financial education program might have been successful just
              because it worked as a marketing campaign for FINO and helped improve famil-
              iarity with and perception of quality of the bandhu service. During our endline
              survey, we asked respondents a full set of questions regarding their satisfac-
              tion with the FINO account, and we use the responses to investigate how much
              the marketing of FINO services has contributed toward the program’s impact
              on savings. Table 4.20 shows how the results change for average impacts on
              savings increments when we control for ex post quality of service.12 The effect
              of the financial education program on FINO savings is diminished in magnitude,
              but nonetheless retains its significance; this suggests that the program indeed
              had a direct impact on savings, apart from the indirect effect it might have had
              by increasing familiarity with and perception of quality of the FINO service. Most
              importantly, the significant and positive effect of the financial education program
              on average total savings for the treatment group (OLS estimates) and especially
              for those who attended the training (IV estimates) remains unchanged—and even
              the magnitude of the coefficient is very close to the one in the estimation that
              does not control for quality. On the other hand, table  4.20 provides evidence
              suggesting that the quality of service is an important determinant of the amount
              of FINO savings. Table 4.21 shows that there is indeed a substantial heterogeneity
              of impact depending on the frequency with which FINO agents visited the village:

those who were assigned to treatment and were visited by a bandhu in the last
three months increased their FINO savings by about Rs 200. (For other types of
savings, there was no impact heterogeneity depending on the frequency with
which FINO agents visited the village.)
     The second, and we believe more plausible, explanation for the success of
our intervention is that the 29 percent increase in total savings is linked to the
4 percent improvement in financial attitudes. This indicator of financial literacy
might represent “applied financial knowledge,” as coined by Doi, McKenzie, and
Zia (2012); and it might be a proxy for the important ability of making appro-
priate financial decisions in everyday life. Also, it might more generally measure

              the degree of familiarity with and confidence in the financial system since the
              questions are mostly about suggesting financially appropriate savings devices
              over more informal solutions. According to this approach, financial attitudes
              might be a proxy for trust in the formal financial system, and thus might really
              be crucial for achieving an effective financial inclusion. For instance, Dupas et
              al. (2012) maintain that lack of trust is the first reason justifying why people,
              in rural Western Kenya, did not begin saving in their bank accounts even when
              an account was offered for free. This hypothesis can explain well why not only
              FINO savings increased, but also savings in other nationalized bank accounts
              showed a positive and significant increment. Additionally, FINO bandhus accept
              only deposits in the basic no-frills account and do not offer term deposits, which
              are savings products with significantly better returns (approximately 3–4 percent
              higher). These term deposits are usually offered by other public and private
              sector banks, which might have attracted the savings of the newly financially
              literate FINO clients.
                   Another possible reason for the success of the intervention is that the
              program was so focused on responsible financial behavior (including savings and
              borrowing) that it directly contributed to boosting attention and commitment
              toward savings, in addition to its effect on financial attitudes. This hypothesis is
              consistent with a growing body of literature on savings in developing countries
              that underlines the power of facilitating the mindset of saving money (Dupas and
              Robinson 2013b).
                   Finally, we have to note that the endline survey was collected only 9–10
              months after the financial education training was provided; thus, the savings
              increase might be temporary. The welfare effects of a temporary change may
              still be high, but future work is needed to confirm if the training is effective in
              changing long-term outcomes.

FINANCIAL
KNOWLEDGE
INDICATOR                                                  QUESTIONS
Basic economic        1) “Suppose you need to borrow Rs 5,000. Two people offer you a loan. One loan
understanding         requires you pay back Rs 6,000 in one month. The second loan also requires you
                      pay back in one month Rs 5,000 plus 15% interest. Which loan would you prefer?”
                      2) “Imagine that you saved Rs 1,000 in a savings account, and were earning an
                      interest rate of 1% per year. If prices were increasing at a rate of 2% per year, after
                      one year, would you be able to buy more than, less than, or exactly the same
                      amount as today with the money in the account?”
Financial             1) “Do you think the following statement is true or false? For a farmer, planting one
awareness             crop is usually safer than planting multiple crops.”
                      2) “Shanti is preparing a budget for her household. Which of the following needs to
                      be included in the budget? Income only, Expenses only, Both.”
                      3) “If you have a savings account in a bank and the bank closes down for some
                      reason, will you get your money back?”
                      4) “Manoj recently borrowed some money from a local moneylender. He needed
                      this money to buy some clothes for his children for Diwali. Do you think that
                      Manoj’s loan is a productive or an unproductive loan?”
                      1) “Ramesh does plastering on tall buildings. It is a dangerous job, and he is wor-
                      ried that if he is injured his family’s income will become inadequate to meet their
                      needs. If Ramesh comes to you for advice, what would you suggest among: i. Take
                      up some other (different) work; ii. Purchase health/life/accident insurance; and iii.
                      Increase savings?”
                      2) “Vimla has a very bright child who is currently in secondary school, but will
                      probably do well in university. She is worried how her family will pay for the child’s
                      education. If Vimla comes to you for advice, what would you suggest among: i. Buy
                      child life insurance policy; ii. Borrow money from a moneylender; iii. Open a sav-
Financial attitudes   ings account in a bank; iv. Save at home; and v. Discontinue education?”
                      3) “Naresh currently drives a rented auto rickshaw. He wants to purchase his own
                      auto rickshaw but does not have the money and is considering taking out a loan
                      for the same. If Naresh comes to you for advice, would you suggest for him to take
                      out a loan or not?”
                      4) “Sajid recently got married. He and his wife are considering buying a TV. They do
                      not have enough savings and will need to take out a loan. Sajid has two options: he
                      can take out a loan from the moneylender and a relative and get a bigger amount
                      of loan to buy a big TV, or he can take a loan only from a relative and buy a smaller
                      TV. What would you advise Sajid and his wife?”

          in Kenya
Can cartoons improve the effectiveness of
financial education?

5.1	BACKGROUND

5.1.1	     Rationale and key objectives
Kenyan youth face an uncertain and volatile financial landscape, with high
un- and underemployment, questionable long-term job prospects, and little
or no protection against the vagaries of ill health and injury. On the other
hand, young Kenyans have more opportunities to invest in and plan for their
futures than perhaps any earlier generation: market liberalization and a stable
macroeconomy have facilitated steady growth in recent years, educational
and training options abound, and access to financial services has expanded
considerably (FinAccess 2011). It is essential to give this population the tools
and financial capability needed to grasp these opportunities.
    This chapter is an evaluation of a financial capability project that seeks
not only to inform young Kenyans about financial facts and options, but also
to induce them to change the way they think about and make financial deci-
sions. In a context in which it is often difficult to see beyond the short term,
we focus on encouraging long-term planning as it relates to investment in
education, training, and small business creation; and precautionary financial
behavior such as saving, asset allocation, and insurance against uncertain
events.

180  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




                  In addition to fostering a culture of financial sophistication and responsibility,
              a key objective of the project was to compare two alternative mechanisms for
              delivering the messages and information that we hope will yield these results. In
              particular, we compare in-person delivery of a structured course of materials with
              a series of weekly comic book episodes that personalize, contextualize, and make
              pertinent to the target population the lessons of the course.


              5.1.2	    Key activities
              Reaching and communicating with young people is a challenge, particularly when
              the material could be construed as dry and technical. We worked with two Kenyan
              organizations that have sought to help young Kenyans prepare themselves for
              economic opportunities through innovative means.
                  Well Told Story is a for-profit company that publishes a monthly comic book
              called Shujaaz, read by upwards of 600,000 young people across the country; as
              well as producing a radio program broadcast on about 20 radio stations nation-
              wide featuring the lead character of the comic book.
                  Junior Achievement Kenya (JAK), is a local NGO engaged with about 250 high
              school–based youth clubs and associations through which a range of educational
              and behavioral interventions are conducted.
                  The key activities that we jointly engaged in include the following:

                  ◾◾ Development of financial education materials. Using JAK’s existing
                    Company Program materials that have been used over the last four years
                    to develop entrepreneurial knowledge and skills among Kenya’s youth, we
                    developed a curriculum that covers a range of financial skills, both at the
                    business and individual/household levels.
                  ◾◾ Integration of financial education lessons into the Shujaaz storyline.
                    Storylines for the comic exhibiting situations that illustrate the lessons
                    central to the financial education materials described above were devel-
                    oped. These storylines involved the regular Shujaaz characters—both
                    heroes and villains—with whom readers are already familiar, and who
                    serve as role models (or anti-role models, accordingly).
                  ◾◾ Production of radio clips. Additionally, special audio clips were produced
                    that included financial education material that closely relates to that in the
                    comics and the JAK lessons. These segments were integrated with the
                    regular radio shows and delivered by CD to study participants to ensure
                    high rates of exposure.
                  ◾◾ Delivery of JAK programs. JAK has delivered the Company Program in
                    school clubs for four years, as well as a less intensive generic program
                    called It’s My Business. The augmented version of the Company Program,
                    including individual and household-level skills and behavior change mate-
                    rials, was provided over a two-month period to selected clubs, with a focus
                                                                          5.  Comic FX in Kenya  ◾ 181




       on students in the last two years of high school, who typically are between
       16 and 20 years of age.
     ◾◾ Distribution of Shujaaz comics. Shujaaz is currently distributed through
       a network of M-Pesa agents on a monthly basis.1 However, as part of
       this project, we arranged for independent delivery of the comic and the
       CD directly to participating schools. The materials were disseminated to
       selected JAK clubs to be used as part of the club’s activities, again with a
       focus on students in the last two years of school.
     ◾◾ Measurement. We collected data to assess the impact of the financial
       education material and the relative impact of the different delivery mech-
       anisms. In particular, we undertook baseline and endline surveys across
       club participants to measure financial capability; we measured financial
       decision-making skills using responses to exogenously engineered finan-
       cial innovations such as a lottery.
     ◾◾ Analysis and dissemination. We conducted statistical analyses of the
       data we collected and prepared a report of our findings. We will present
       our findings at conferences and seminars, and through the Internet, espe-
       cially in collaboration with the World Bank as requested.




5.2	       PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

5.2.1	     Area of focus

FINANCIAL LITERACY TOPIC
The materials we presented through various media focus on increasing the finan-
cial sophistication and long-term planning capability of young adults. In addition,
we demonstrated the use of financial tools as instruments that facilitate the
expansion of real economic activity and income generation, as well as risk mitiga-
tion and consumption smoothing.


DELIVERY MECHANISMS
Financial education materiald were delivered in a classroom lesson environment,
through a comic book format, and via prerecorded radio shows delivered by CD.
     JAK’s Company Program focused on business development and entrepre-
neurship, which for this project was augmented as mentioned above with addi-
tional information and skills for personal and household financial management.

182  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              The material was delivered to club members either by local business executives,
              university students/graduates, or teachers from the school who had received the
              relevant training.
                   Well Told Story publishes a monthly comic book that typically includes three
              or four themes targeted at youth readers. In the past, these themes have included,
              for example, prudent business practices, the new Kenyan constitution, and tips on
              animal husbandry. The lead character in the story is an itinerant disc jockey who
              communicates with youth over the airwaves. Capitalizing on this, Well Told Story
              expands the reach of the messages in the comic by producing a complementary
              radio show featuring this character and others from the storylines; listeners can
              call or text in feedback and questions. These shows are aired by about 20 radio
              stations across Kenya. Finally, readers and listeners can be linked through social
              networking sites such as Facebook, which enable further sharing of experiences.
                   The financial education material described above was included as one of
              the storylines in the Well Told Story publications that are delivered to clubs at
              selected schools. Each week, a new financial theme was developed and included,
              while maintaining a fluid and connected storyline. These entries mix both sugges-
              tive advice through the evolution of the stories (planning ahead turns out to pay
              dividends, poor business strategies can lead to failure, etc.), as well as specific
              instructions on how to perform certain tasks (how to open a bank account, start
              a business, etc.).


              TARGET GROUPS
              Our target population included high school students in the last two years of
              school, who are typically aged between 16 and 20 years old. We implemented the
              project in JAK clubs, which operate in 217 high schools across Kenya. Students
              in forms 1–4 (U.S. equivalent grades 9–12) are eligible to join these clubs, which
              hold weekly instructional meetings that cover a range of topics and issues. Club
              membership ranges from 20 to 40 students per class, and clubs can be separated
              into lower (first and second) and upper (third and fourth) classes for instruction.
                   Descriptive statistics regarding the schools—which include boarding and day
              schools, boys’, girls’, and coeducational school, etc.—are presented below. A map
              showing the geographic distribution of schools is also presented (figure  5.1). In
              Kenya, the average adult has no high school education—mean years of schooling
              for those over age 25 is 7.0—but children today can expect, on average, to reach
              within a year of graduating from high school; i.e., the expected number of years of
              schooling for those now under age 7 is 11.0.2 Thus, while our sample of students
              is definitely not representative of the entire Kenyan population, we believe it is
              likely to provide good predictive information for the population of young Kenyans

whose financial and entrepreneurial behaviors we hope to influence. In addition,
while club participation is undoubtedly nonrandom, the students who participate
in this project could be argued to represent a segment of society for which finan-
cial education could be especially productive.
    The schools in our sample were located across the country, from the capital
(Nairobi) to the remote eastern part of the country, and from the coastal areas
to Lake Victoria, and thus provide a rich and diverse sample to study. Figure 5.1
illustrates the location of the 217 participating schools.
    Table 5.1 shows the school distribution by region. The Western and Rift Valley
regions had the highest concentrations of schools.
    The schools exhibit heterogeneity in two potentially important dimensions
relating to gender and boarding status, as summarized in table 5.2. Of the schools
in our sample, 36  percent are girls-only schools, 29  percent are for boys only,
and 34 percent are coeducational. Additionally, 33 percent of schools have day

              5.2.2	         Specific objectives
              Our goal was to understand which of the methods of delivering financial educa-
              tion that we assessed was best able to provide young Kenyans with the tools to
              grasp the opportunities they face, and to change their proclivity to actually reach
              out and take hold of those opportunities. Thus, part of the role of financial educa-
              tion might be to empower individuals to feel that they can, through prudent and
              creative financial decisions, take steps that will lead them to a better life and—for
              some of them—to a life out of poverty.
                   Our specific objectives in attempting to achieve this ambitious goal were as
              follows:

                   ◾◾ To develop and administer two alternative mechanisms for developing
                       financial skills and capabilities
                   ◾◾ To measure indicators of financial knowledge, attitudes, and behavior
                   ◾◾ To use these indicators to assess the relative impacts of each mechanism
                       separately and when used in combination
                   ◾◾ To document the challenges and opportunities for improvement associated
                       with the implementation of each mechanism
                   ◾◾ To understand the experience of consumers (i.e., students in this case),
                       and the potential long-term impacts of the interventions
                                                                     5.  Comic FX in Kenya  ◾ 185




5.3	        EVALUATION METHODOLOGY

5.3.1	Approach
We planned to combine a randomized control trial with quasi-experimental quan-
titative techniques to address the objectives outlined above. The interventions
were randomized across Junior Achievement Clubs, as described below.
    We described above the population of student clubs supported by JAK at
high schools across the country. These clubs were randomly assigned to one
of four treatment groups—comic, JAK, placebo, and control—as illustrated in
table 5.3. The interventions focused on third form students (11th graders in the
U.S. system), of whom there were an average of 21 students per club, so each cell
includes about 1,140 target students.

    As shown in column 1 of the table, a total of 60 clubs received weekly Shujaaz
comics plus a CD with a prerecorded radio show with financial educational mate-
rial. As shown in column 2, 54 clubs received the JAK augmented Company
Program on a weekly basis. As shown in column 3, 52 clubs received weekly
Shujaaz comics that did not contain the financial education material. Finally, as
noted in column 4, 51 clubs represented a pure control group, with no financial
education delivered either through the Company Program or through Shujaaz.
In addition, all four treatment groups received Business Daily newspapers that
covered macroeconomic news articles. These newspapers were distributed in
order to measure the extent of treatment exposure of the students in each of the
treatment groups.


5.3.2	Implementation
The project was implemented in 217 schools with JAK clubs in five regions in
Kenya (Nairobi, Western, Eastern, Rift Valley, and Coast). Each JAK club has an
average of about 21 student members each, and meets once every week on
a specific day after regular school hours, designated as “club hours.” These
groups formed the unit of randomization of the alternative delivery mechanisms
we tested.
    The implementation time frame for this project was as follows:

5.3.3	    Program intervention
The baseline survey was conducted in 217 of the 236 schools targeted for inclu-
sion in the project. We were unable to reach the remaining 19 schools due to
school exam schedules or, in some cases, refusal of the school to participate in
the research.
    In schools with clubs with more than 30 students, a random sample of
30 students was chosen to be interviewed. In schools with smaller clubs, all club
members who were present were interviewed.
    As part of the interview, each student was asked to write a short (25 words
or less) essay. When all students had been interviewed, a sample of respondents
                                               1,500 (about US$18) each on the
was selected to “win” a financial award of K Sh 
basis of their writing sample. Although winners were chosen at random, only
students who had submitted a writing sample were eligible. The purpose of this
design was to make the winners feel that they had earned the money in some
sense, so as to more closely approximate a real-world financial event.
    If there were 20 or more respondents, 10 were randomly chosen to receive
the award; if there were 13 or fewer respondents, all students won; if there were
14–19 students, half were chosen as winners. The strategy was adopted so as to
avoid a situation in which nearly but not all JAK members won the award, which
could easily have created tension within the group.
    The students who won the award were asked to allocate their winnings
across three potential buckets: cash, bank account, and mutual fund account
in the Nairobi Stock Exchange. The latter two options would be inaccessible to
the student for a three-month period, and were held under the custodianship of
Digital Divide Data and JAK. Because schools do not allow students to hold cash
on school grounds, if they chose to receive cash, it would be held by the school
bursar until the school holidays.
188  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




                  Following the complete analysis of the baseline data, schools were randomly
              assigned to one of four groups—comic, JAK, placebo, and control—through strat-
              ification with respect to specific school characteristics, including region, school
              gender (boys, girls, or mixed), and status (boarding or nonboarding).
                  In our analysis of the baseline data, we found a reasonable degree of financial
              knowledge (if not capability) among JAK students. Since JAK is an entrepreneur-
              ship club, we believe that students who are already financially knowledgeable
              and capable may self-select into the JAK clubs. Therefore, we broadened the
              sample during the endline survey to include non-JAK students (at the same school
              in form 3). We printed additional comic books for comic and placebo treatment
              schools to distribute to non-JAK third form students.
                  Although we do not have baseline data on these students, we will compare
              those in the treatment and control schools. Of particular interest will be the
              students in schools that receive the comic treatment (and the placebo), compared
              with students in the control schools. Non-JAK students in schools that receive the
              JAK treatment will be of less interest (because they are not directly exposed to
              the treatment). However, we hope to learn about the spillovers, if any, associated
              with the JAK treatment.
                  Treatment materials were developed and finalized during the months of April
              and May. The comic treatment materials referred to as the “Janjaruka” series
              (which translates to “be smart about your money”) included six editions; the
              placebo comics included six editions (special editions for this project that had no
              financial education); there were six editions of the JAK treatment material referred
              to as “Know Your Money.” In addition, all of these treatment materials, including
              for the control group, included six editions of the Business Daily newspapers, with
              selected articles on macroeconomic topics.
                  With the delivery of the treatment materials to the schools, we also delivered
              official letters to students who had chosen to open a bank or mutual fund account.
              These letters had full information regarding student account numbers, how to
              access accounts to deposit money, restrictions on withdrawing money from the
              account for a period of three months, and contact information for further inquiries.
                  Bank accounts were opened with the Kenya Post Office Savings Bank during
              the baseline because it offered a specific youth product (a Smata account) meant
              for youth between 12 and 18 years of age. This account allows more flexibility and
              autonomy to enable youth to manage their accounts themselves than do other
              banks in Kenya. Also, they are conveniently located throughout the country and
              were easily accessible to the students in our study. All bank accounts came with
              ATM cards that would allow students to withdraw and deposit money into their
              accounts. In accordance with the research structure, students were informed that
              they would not be allowed to withdraw money from the accounts until August 1,
              2012, but were allowed to deposit money into their accounts prior to that date.
              In addition, on August 1, all students who opened a bank account received a
              10 percent interest on their initial deposit into their account.
                                                                      5.  Comic FX in Kenya  ◾ 189




     Mutual fund accounts, referred to as balanced funds, were opened with
Zimele Asset Management Company Ltd. The Zimele Balanced Fund is invested
in shares of companies on the Nairobi Stock Exchange and interest instruments
such as treasury bills, treasury bonds, and commercial paper, among others. It is
ideal for medium- to long-term investment. As with the Kenya Post Office Savings
Bank, we decided on this specific organization because it offered flexibility and
easy accessibility for the students.
     Following the treatment intervention, the endline survey was conducted
from mid-October till mid-November 2012. The endline survey was to cover
both Junior Achievement students (referred to hereafter as JAK students) in the
217 schools covered in the baseline survey; as well as non–Junior Achievement
students (referred to hereafter as non-JAK students) in 162 schools. Due to last-
minute changes in the Kenyan school calendar, we were able to cover 207 schools
of the 217 schools for JAK surveys and 38 schools out of the intended 162 schools
for non-JAK surveys.
     We were unable to cover more schools, especially for the non-JAK surveys,
due to two major obstacles with the Kenyan school calendar. First, the final
semester of the school year started three weeks late due to a teachers’ strike that
resulted in all schools being closed, thus delaying the start of the endline survey
by a month and half. Second, because of the already shortened semester, the
newly adjusted survey start date conflicted with the Kenyan Secondary Certifica-
tion Examination schedule, which started October 15, and with form 3 students’
final semester examination. For this reason, we had to cover more schools within
a tight schedule and, in some cases, outside of school hours.
     Table 5.4 shows the breakdown of JAK and non-JAK schools surveyed, orga-
nized into five geographically defined groups.
     The endline survey differed slightly for each treatment group; it contained
additional questions regarding the treatment that a particular school received.
These questions were developed in order to test the exposure of the student
to the actual treatment materials that were delivered to the schools. In addi-
tion, we interviewed the baseline survey winners separately, asking them ques-
tions regarding how they spent the money they won in the previous term, who

                 mutual funds account provided they had chosen to set up an account.
                     We also had a short essay competition in this round of the survey where,
                 as in the baseline sample, students were selected to “win” a financial award
                        1,500 each on the basis of their writing sample. Although the choice of
                 of K Sh 
                 winners was made randomly, only students who had submitted a writing sample
                 were eligible.
                     Table 5.5 reports indicators of the distributions chosen by the 2,067 base-
                 line JAK winners and the 1,890 JAK winners and 368 non-JAK winners from the
                 endline. In the baseline, about one in five winning students chose to take all their
                 winnings in cash, while 10 percent put all their winnings in a bank account. One
                 in three winners split the total between cash and a bank account, and 26 percent
                 chose all three vehicles. Of all the money allocated in prizes, about 88 percent
                 was split almost equally between cash and bank account (46 percent for cash
                 and 41 percent for bank account), and 12 percent was invested in the mutual fund
                 option.
                     In the endline, about one in five winning JAK and non-JAK students chose to
                 take all their winnings in cash, while 10 percent and 3 percent, respectively, of JAK
                 and non-JAK students put all their winnings in a bank account. Almost none of the
                 JAK or non-JAK students chose to put all their money into a mutual fund. One in
                 four JAK winners and one in five non-JAK winners split the total between cash and
                 a bank account; and 20 percent and 25 percent, respectively, of JAK and non-JAK
                 students chose all three vehicles. Of all the money allocated in prizes, about

and 41  percent for bank accounts for JAK and non-JAK students, respectively),
and 6.7 percent of JAK students and 8.0 percent of non-JAK students invested in
the mutual fund option.
     Following the endline survey, bank accounts and mutual fund accounts were
created for the students who won this round of the survey; information about
account numbers, access to accounts, and restrictions on withdrawal were
communicated accordingly.



5.4	RESULTS
We present results on four outcomes: one intermediate outcome on financial
literacy and three on behavior (both stated and actual) and aspirations.


5.4.1	       Impact of the interventions on financial literacy
We measure financial literacy using six questions that are standard in the litera-
ture (table 5.6). Questions gauge whether students understand the concepts of
interest rates, inflation, stock markets, insurance, and banking. Below we present
the results of regressions showing the impact of the JAK and JAK + comic inter-
ventions on the likelihood of students responding correctly to these questions.
     The row corresponding to the constant in table 5.6 shows the fraction of
students in the control and placebo arms who answered the questions correctly.
As the table shows, there is considerable variation in the financial knowledge of
the control group, ranging from 36 percent for the stock market returns question
to 86 percent for the interest rates question. Students in the JAK only and JAK +
comic arm are more likely to answer this question correctly, but the differences
we measure are statistically insignificant. For the inflation question, 64 percent
of the control students answered correctly. The same fraction of students in the
JAK only arm answered this question correctly; the percentage of JAK + comics

              students who answered correctly is 5 percentage points lower. The latter differ-
              ence is statistically distinguishable from no difference with 95 percent confidence.
              We find no significant difference for the stock market returns, insurance, and
              banking service fees questions. Across all study arms, 36  percent, 68  percent,
              and 52 percent of students answered these questions correctly. For the portfolio
              choice question, 61 percent of the control students answered correctly. A similar
              fraction in the JAK + comic arm answered correctly, compared to 56 percent of
              the JAK only students. This latter difference is statistically significant.
                  Overall, aside from the negative impacts on the inflation question for the
              JAK  + comics and the portfolio question for the JAK only students, we find no
              effect of the interventions on other measures of financial literacy.


              5.4.2	     Impact of the interventions on stated and actual
                         savings
              We turn to an examination of whether the interventions changed the financial
              behavior of students. All students were eligible to compete in an essay competi-
              tion, in which about one-third of them would win about US$18. Before the compe-
              tition, students were asked how much of those winnings they would be willing to
              allocate to three categories: cash, bank account, or mutual fund account. Winners
              of the competition were then asked directly how much they actually wanted to
              allocate to these three categories.
                  Table 5.7 shows regressions measuring the impact of the interventions on
              both stated savings for all students and actual savings for competition winners.
                  Columns 1 and 2 show the results for stated savings, while columns 3 and 4
              show the results for actual savings. We include an interaction term to measure
              any differences in behavior depending on students’ stated goals. At baseline,
              students were asked whether they had any goals. A follow-up question asked the
              student to indicate what the goal is. We then categorized the goals into long-term
              goals such as starting a business or going to college versus short-term goals such
              as purchasing electronics.
                  In column 1, we estimate the negative effects of the JAK only and JAK + comic
              interventions on stated savings; these differences are not statistically significant.
              In column 2, we add the interaction with the long-term goals indicator. While the
              interaction with the JAK + comic indicator is positive, suggesting that the inter-
              ventions only work for those with long-term goals, the coefficient estimates are
              small and statistically insignificant.
                  Columns 3 and 4 present the results for actual savings. Once again, we do
              not find any statistically significant differences in the actual savings of the inter-
              vention arms relative to the control group. The interaction with the long-term goal
              indicator suggests that students with such goals actually save less than students
              with short-term goals. However, the point estimates are again imprecise.
                  Overall, we find no effect of the interventions on stated or actual savings.

5.4.3	      Impact of the interventions on aspirations
Finally, we examine whether the interventions change the goals of the students.
We asked the same question about goals at the endline survey. Table 5.8 shows the
results of this examination. In particular, we estimate the likelihood of purchasing
electronics, starting a business, making money, education, and other goals on the
indicators for each of the intervention arms.
       Students in the intervention arms are less likely to indicate purchasing elec-
tronics as a goal. While about 37 percent of control students indicate this as a

              goal, only about 32 percent of the students in the comics arm report this as a goal
              at endline. The comics arm is also more likely to report wanting to start a business
              than the control group. Just over a quarter of control students report wanting to
              start a business at endline, compared to more than 32 percent of the students
              in the comics arm. This difference is statistically significant. However, we find no
              effects at all for the JAK only intervention.



              5.5	         POLICY IMPLICATIONS
              We find little evidence that the interventions implemented here improved the
              financial literacy of the students. It is important to point out that the absence of
              an effect is not because of very high levels of financial knowledge. Across the
              six questions, an average of only 60 percent of students answered the questions
              correctly.
                  Similarly, we find no effect of the interventions on stated and actual savings
              behavior. However, we do find impacts of the comics intervention on the likeli-
              hood that students want to start a business in the future. In addition, students in
              this arm are less likely to state a goal of purchasing electronics such as a mobile
              phone/tablet.
                  One potential explanation for these null results is that take-up of the inter-
              ventions may be low. In results not reported, we find some heterogeneous effects
              with large positive effects among students with greater exposure to the treat-
              ments. Future research should seek to improve exposure to the treatments as
              well as the content of the treatments.

ABSTRACT
    We present a randomized field experiment measuring the direct impact
    and social network spillovers of providing financial literacy and discount
    vouchers on farmers’ decision to purchase index-based drought insurance.
    To examine this, we form clusters by grouping together geographically prox-
    imate households. Clusters were then randomly assigned to receive either
    a high or low intensity of each of the following treatments: financial literacy
    materials and discount vouchers for the price of insurance. We find social
    network spillovers to the provision of financial literacy materials, but no spill-
    overs to the provision of discount vouchers on farmers’ decision to purchase
    insurance. Specifically, receiving financial literacy materials when 60 percent
    or more of their neighbors also receive financial literacy materials increases
    the likelihood that a farmer will purchase insurance by 4.3  percent (stan-
    dard error 2.5  percent); while receiving financial literacy materials when
    40 percent or less of their neighbors also receive financial literacy materials
    decreases the likelihood that a farmer will purchase insurance by 2.6 percent

                  (standard error 2.5 percent). Looking at the discount vouchers, we find significant
                  own effects of receiving discounts on the price of insurance on farmers’ take-up
                  decision, but negligible social network effects. Our results provide suggestive
                  evidence that financial literacy materials are efficacious in encouraging take-up
                  when farmers’ social contacts similarly receive access to such materials.




              6.1	INTRODUCTION
              Agriculture in developing countries is characterized by a high dependence on
              weather and limited irrigation. Weather shocks are a major source of income fluc-
              tuation for rural households involved in agricultural activities. Research suggests
              that households are not fully insured against income shocks.
                  Weather index–based insurance products provide a means by which poor
              households can hedge against these risks. A significant advantage of the design
              of index insurance products is that, since payouts are based on measured rainfall,
              they can be calculated and disbursed quickly and automatically without the need
              for households to formally file a claim. This in turn reduces transaction costs,
              which would otherwise tend to drive up the price of the insurance. Fast payouts
              are also likely to be valued by policy holders in an environment where households
              are poor and often liquidity constrained. A second advantage is that the product
              is free of the adverse selection and moral hazard problems that often plague
              insurance markets. This is because payouts are based only on publicly observed
              data, rather than private information reported by the person filing the claim.
                  Despite these benefits however, demand for index insurance has been low
              (Cole et al. 2010; Giné, Townsend, and Vickery 2008; Giné and Yang 2009). One of
              the reasons for the weak demand may be lack of understanding of the product.
              If potential buyers misunderstand or underestimate the probability and amount
              of payouts, there will be little demand and little or no impact on farmer behavior.
              Conversely, if farmers overestimate the frequency and amount of payouts, they
              are likely to be disappointed and fail to purchase insurance again in the future.
              Financial education can help mitigate these problems.
                  Evidence from Malawi (Giné and Yang 2009) and India (Giné, Townsend,
              and Vickery 2008) suggests that a lack of comprehension of index insurance
              indeed dampened demand for it. Index insurance, with its complicated triggers
              and payout schedules, is a particularly difficult product to explain—even more
              so than standard insurance. There are very few studies that rigorously examine
              the effects of different means of providing information on insurance products
              on take-up of insurance (a notable exception is McPeak, Chantarat, and Mude
              2010). Social networks could also play a role in individual farmer demand for index
              insurance.
                  Studies have found that social networks play critical roles in determining a
              variety of individual and aggregate economic outcomes, ranging from transmitting

information about job networks (Beaman and Magruder 2009; Granovetter 1973,
1995), the basis for trade in noncentralized markets, and the provision of mutual
insurance in developing countries (Fafchamps and Lund 2003), to mention but
a few. An increasingly popular technique to identify social network effects has
been to use randomized experiments (e.g., Angelucci and De Giorgi 2009; Ange-
lucci et al. 2010; Duflo and Saez 2003; Godlonton and Thornton 2012; and Miguel
and Kremer 2004), wherein a random subset of members of a social network are
provided with some intervention to change their behavior. The random variation
in the behavior of some members of the social network thus induced is used
to instrument the average behavior in the group. Under conditions presented in
Imbens and Angrist (1994), an instrumental variables estimator identifies a local
average treatment effect that measures the impact of the intervention beyond
the targeted group—the peer effect.
    This chapter presents a randomized field experiment that measures the direct
impact and social network spillovers of providing financial literacy and discount
vouchers on farmers’ decision to purchase drought insurance. We find suggestive
evidence that social networks play an important role in their decision to purchase
drought insurance. Receiving financial literacy materials when 60  percent or
more of a farmer’s neighbors also receive financial literacy materials increases
the likelihood that a farmer will purchase insurance by 4.3 percent (standard error
2.5 percent). In contrast, receiving financial literacy materials when 40 percent or
less of a farmer’s neighbors receive them decreases the likelihood that a farmer
will purchase insurance by 2.6  percent (standard error 2.5  percent). Discount
vouchers, on the hand, have strong individual effects on purchase. Reducing the
purchase price of insurance by 10 percent increases take-up by 1.3 percentage
points (standard error 0.39 percentage points). There are, however, no spill-
overs from the provision of discount vouchers on farmers’ take-up of
insurance. Our results imply that financial literacy materials are efficacious in
encouraging take-up when farmers’ social contacts similarly receive access
to financial literacy materials.
    The remainder of the chapter is organizes as follows: section 6.2 describes
the setting and the experiment, section 6.3 discusses the results, and section 6.4
concludes.

The study was carried out with coffee farmers in Ruırı
prone areas in eastern Kenya. The enumeration area covered 14 villages: 12
             ˜ ˜ ˜ and 2 villages in Ntima. Interviewers first visited all coffee-growing
villages in Ruırı

              households within the enumeration area and collected some basic information
              about the household: their global positioning system (GPS) coordinates, farm size,
              number of coffee trees, and contact information.
                   Following the census, households were grouped together into clusters based
              on geographic proximity. Each household had a block with a 60-meter radius
              drawn around its GPS marker. All overlapping blocks became part of the same
              cluster. Households that were isolated were added to the nearest cluster.
                   Enumerators then revisited the households and administered a baseline
              survey. Table 6.1 presents some summary statistics of our study population.
              Seventy percent of our study households are headed by men. The average age
              of the household head is 49, with 7 years of education. We define “somewhat
              patient” as equal to 1 if the respondent prefers to receive KSh 1,250 (US$15.63) in
              a month to KSh 1,000 (US$12.50) today. Almost half (47.6 percent) of the respon-
              dents report understanding what insurance is. Figure 6.1 gives the chronology of
              the study.
                   We test two interventions: a comic on index insurance and discount vouchers
              for the purchase of insurance. Randomization of treatment intensity was done
              at the cluster level and was orthogonal across treatments. After completing the
              baseline survey, enumerators administered the interventions. Each household
              was randomly assigned to receive a comic or not, depending on what comic
              intensity the household’s cluster was assigned. Each household was also given
              the opportunity to take part in a drawing for a voucher on the price of insurance.
              Households in high voucher intensity clusters had a 3 in 5 chance of drawing a
              50 percent voucher, a 1 in 5 chance of a 25 percent voucher, and a 1 in 5 chance
              for a 0 percent voucher. Households in low voucher intensity clusters had a 1 in 5
              chance of drawing a 50 percent voucher, a 1 in 5 chance of a 25 percent voucher,
              and a 1 in 5 chance of a 0 percent voucher. Enumerators also completed a base-
              line survey with survey households. Figure 6.2 illustrates the experiment design.

                  6.3	RESULTS
                  This section presents estimates of the causal effect of receiving a comic and
                  a discount voucher on farmers’ decision to purchase insurance. Further, since
                  treatment intensity was assigned randomly at the cluster level, we can estimate
                  the social network effects of being in a high-intensity comic cluster or a high-in-
                  tensity voucher cluster. We estimate:

                                BuyInsij = β1Comicij + β2Comicij × ComicIntensityLevelj
                     + β3 ComicIntensityLevelj + γ1Voucherij + γ2Voucherij × VoucherIntensityLevelj
                                            + γ3VoucherIntensityLevelj + ϵij

              clusters with treated households in low-intensity clusters. We find a modestly
              positive effect of comics on the likelihood of purchasing insurance and a strongly
              significant positive effect of voucher provision on the likelihood of purchasing
              insurance. A 10 percent discount in the price of insurance increases the likelihood
              of purchase by 1.3 percentage points (standard error 0.39 percentage points).
              In column 2, we compare treated clusters with control clusters; thus, treated
              and control households in treated clusters are grouped together. We find that
              households in low comic intensity clusters are less likely to purchase insurance,
              though this effect is imprecisely estimated. Households in high comic intensity
              clusters are more likely to purchase insurance by 3.7 percentage points (standard
              error 2.3 percentage points), and households in high voucher intensity clusters
              are 0.29 percentage points more likely to purchase insurance for every 10 percent
              discount on the price of insurance (standard error 0.17 percentage points).
                  Finally, in columns 3 and 4 we interact individual treatment with the intensity
              assigned to the cluster. Column 3 shows that receiving a comic in a high-inten-
              sity comic cluster increases the likelihood that a farmer will purchase insurance
              by 4.3 percentage points (standard error 2.5 percentage points) while receiving
              a comic in a low-intensity comic cluster decreases the likelihood that a farmer
              will purchase insurance by 2.6 percentage points (standard error 2.5 percentage
              points). Drawing a 50 percent discount voucher in a high voucher intensity cluster
              increases the likelihood a farmer will buy insurance by 14.9 percentage points
              (standard error 4.6 percentage points), while drawing a 50 percent voucher in a
              low voucher intensity cluster increases the likelihood that a farmer will purchase
              insurance by 9.3 percentage points (standard error 4.9 percentage points); these
              effects are not significantly different from each other. In column 4, we include
              some controls for the farmer’s raven score, years of education, gender, ability
              to read a newspaper, ability to write a letter, score for coffee best practices
              followed, whether the farmer agrees that drought is the most important risk that
              he or she faces, a score for whether the farmer is patient, number of coffee trees,
              whether the farmer understands index insurance, and whether the farmer can
              identify 60 millimeters in a drawing. These controls do not significantly alter the
              magnitude of our estimates.
                  Our estimates in columns 3 and 4 provide suggestive evidence that finan-
              cial literacy materials are only efficacious in encouraging take-up when farmers’
              social contacts similarly receive access to financial literacy materials. Our results
              also show that the naïve estimate in column 1 understates the impact of comic
              provision by conflating the impact of comics in low- versus high-intensity comic
              clusters, which work in opposite directions.
                  We find similar patterns of impact if we look at spillover effects beyond
              the geographical cluster (table 6.3). To measure how treatment density affects
              farmers’ decision to purchase insurance, we rely on exogenous variation in the
              local density of treated farmers by virtue of the cluster-level randomization. Specif-
              ically, we compute the number of treated farmers residing in close proximity. We

get significant spillovers from farmers living 150 meters away; these diminish as
the band is expanded to 200 meters, then 300 meters. If a farmer was assigned
a comic, each additional farmer who receives a comic within a 150-meter radius
increases the likelihood that a farmer will purchase insurance by 4.7 percentage
points (standard error 1.7 percentage points), off a base of 2 percentage points
among controls. In contrast, if a farmer was not assigned a comic, each additional
farmer who receives a comic within a 150-meter radius decreases the likelihood
that a farmer will purchase insurance by 2.0 percentage points (standard error 1.0
percentage points). These estimates are robust to adding farmer-level controls in
columns 2, 4, and 6.

              6.4	         FOLLOW-UP SURVEY
              Eight months after the baseline was completed and a few months after payouts
              were made, we conducted a phone follow-up with respondents. On average,
              we were able to reach about 56 percent of our sample. This moderate tracking
              rate was due to the fact that not all respondents had mobile phones and not
              all respondents were available during the three-week-long follow-up period.
              Table 6.4 demonstrates that receiving a voucher is mildly correlated with being
              more likely to be found during the follow-up.

      Table 6.5 examines the impact of the provision of the interventions on
farmers’ understanding of index insurance. At the baseline and at the follow-up,
we asked farmers the following three questions: Imagine you have bought insur-
ance against drought. If it rains less than 70 millimeters by the end of November,
you will receive a payout of K Sh 20 for every millimeter of deficient rainfall (that
is, each millimeter of rainfall below 70 millimeters). Will you be paid out if (a) it
rains 100 millimeters? (b) It rains 60 millimeters (if b = Yes). How much would you
receive as a payout? The knowledge score is the sum of these three questions.
On average, respondents were able to answer two out of the three questions.
Column 1 shows that farmers who received a comic in a low comic intensity

                    force their knowledge about index insurance, since not many of their neighbors
                    received comics.
                         Table 6.6 presents regressions examining the impact of the interventions

                    the baseline and at the follow-up. Column 1 shows that farmers in high comic
                    intensity clusters are more likely to state that “Insurance protects you in times of
                    emergency” by 5.7 percentage points if they received a comic and 7.5 percentage
                    points if they did not. These effects are not, however, significantly different from
                    each other. Farmers in both high- and low-intensity comic clusters are also less
                    likely to state that “Insurance companies try to cheat people even when they
                    have a good claim,” in comparison to farmers in clusters where no one received
                    a comic. Finally, only farmers who received discount vouchers are less likely to

6.5	CONCLUSION
This chapter presents preliminary evidence from a randomized field experiment
measuring the direct impact and social network spillovers of providing financial
literacy and discount vouchers on farmers’ decision to purchase drought insur-
ance.
    We find social network spillovers to the provision of financial literacy mate-
rials but no spillovers to the provision of discount vouchers on farmers’ decision to
purchase insurance. We further find that financial materials have spillover effects
on farmers’ attitudes toward insurance but limited effects on understanding, as
narrowly measured in survey.
    Our results provide suggestive evidence that financial literacy materials are
efficacious in encouraging take-up when farmers’ social contacts similarly receive
access to financial literacy materials.

ABSTRACT
     Take-up of voluntary financial education programs is typically extremely
     low. We conduct randomized experiments around a large financial literacy
     course offered in Mexico City to understand the reasons for low take-up and
     to measure the impact of financial education. We document that the general
     public displays very little interest in such courses and that participation is
     low even among individuals who express interest in financial education. We
     experimentally investigate barriers to take-up, and find no impact of relaxing
     reputational or logistical constraints and no evidence that time inconsistency
     is the reason for limited participation. Even relatively sizable monetary incen-
     tives get less than 40 percent of interested individuals invited to training to
     actually attend. Using this randomized encouragement design, we measure
     the impact of the course on financial knowledge and behavior. Attending
     training results in a 9 percentage point increase in financial knowledge and a
     9 percentage point increase in savings outcomes, but no impact on borrowing
     behavior. Administrative data indicate that the savings impact is relatively
     short lived. The results suggest people are making optimal choices not to
     attend financial education courses, and point to the limits of using gener-
     al-purpose courses to improve financial behavior for the general population.

              7.1	INTRODUCTION
              Access to finance is strongly associated with poverty reduction worldwide
              (Demirgüç-Kunt, Beck, and Honohan 2008). For Mexico, evidence suggests that
              many poor and lower-middle-class individuals are credit constrained and that
              relaxing these constraints has high returns. For example, McKenzie and Wood-
              ruff (2008) show that small injections of working capital funding have monthly
              returns of 15 percent or more for microenterprise owners. Bruhn and Love (2009)
              find that a rapid expansion of bank credit serving low-income individuals led to
              increases in income and employment. Lack of access to finance has also meant
              Mexican households have been unable to smooth consumption in the face of
              income shocks (Attanasio and Székely 2004; McKenzie 2006). These factors illus-
              trate the great potential for increases in access to savings and credit to benefit
              low-income individuals.
                      However, as access to financial services expands around the world, there is
              also a growing concern that many consumers may not have sufficient informa-
              tion and financial acumen to use these new financial products responsibly. Such
              concerns are particularly pressing in middle-income countries such as Mexico,
              which have seen rapid expansions of access to finance in recent years, bringing
              many low-income individuals into the formal financial system for the first time.
              The number of credit cards has doubled during the past five years; and in urban
              areas, an increasing number of credit cardholders are now poorer and less-edu-
              cated individuals. According to the 2008 Mexican Income and Expenditure Survey
              (ENIGH), 42 percent of households making a credit card payment had a head with
              less than high school education, and one in six had only primary education or less.
              Lower-educated households are more likely to make unsophisticated decisions
              (Lusardi and Mitchell 2011). These unsophisticated decisions can lead to lower
              efficiency and competition in the credit card market, and as this market grows,
              they could also have implications for the stability of the financial system as a
              whole.
                      The recent global financial crisis has emphasized the importance of overin-
              debtedness on systemic risk. Low levels of financial literacy were arguably one
              important factor leading many homeowners in the United States to take out mort-
              gages exceeding their means.1 During the subprime mortgage crisis, individuals
              with lower financial literacy were more likely to be delinquent or to default on
              their mortgage (Gerardi, Goette, and Meier 2010).2 In Mexico, nearly 10 percent of
              all credit cardholders fell delinquent on their payments in February 2009, double

               In contrast, individuals with higher financial literacy are more likely to strategically default

the U.S. rate.3 Many of these are low-income individuals who are first-time card-
holders. In addition, the financial crisis highlighted the need for building up suffi-
cient savings to smooth consumption in the face of adverse shocks. However,
savings rates tend to be low in many countries, including Mexico (4.2 percent).4
        In response to these concerns, many governments, employers, nonprofit
organizations, and even commercial banks have started to provide financial
literacy courses with the aim of improving financial education. However, partic-
ipation rates for noncompulsory financial education programs are typically
extremely low. Willis (2011) sums this up as follows: “Voluntary financial educa-
tion is widely available today, yet seldom used.” For example, Brown and Gartner
(2007) examine pilot experimental efforts by three credit card providers in the
United States to provide online financial literacy training to delinquent and at-risk
credit cardholders, as well as to college students with newly received credit
cards. Target Financial Services made calls to 80,982 at-risk cardholders, reaching
only 6,417 of them, of whom half were invited to use a credit education website:
only 684 of these requested a code to log-on, of which only 28 used the code, and
only 2 people completed the course. U.S. Bank had only 384 cardholders out of
the 42,000 it attempted to reach complete its online program (0.9 percent). Wells
Fargo offered college students a 60-minute phone card as an incentive to do the
training; it had the highest response rate, with 6.7 percent of college student
cardholders offered the treatment logging onto the website, and 6.5 percent
completing the training.
        Thus, despite financial education programs becoming increasingly popular
among policy makers and financial providers, they appear to be deeply unpop-
ular among customers. This raises two interrelated questions that are important
for research and policy. The first is whether there are economic or behavioral
constraints that prevent more individuals from participating in such programs.
The second question is whether there are any benefits to these marginal individ-
uals from doing so, or whether they are rationally choosing not to participate in
such training.
        We investigate these questions through the context of randomized experi-
ments conducted in Mexico City. We collaborated with a financial institution to
evaluate a free financial literacy course offered on a large scale. We document that
there is relatively little interest in such a program among the general population,
and then screen recruited subjects on interest in participating. We then randomly

  This number is based on data from the 2008 Mexican Income and Expenditure Survey. It
corresponds to the average household savings rate (total income − total expenditures/total
income) using sampling weights and dropping those with savings rates below −100 percent
and above 100 percent. The average household savings rate using monetary income and
expenditures is 11.4 percent.

              selected half of the interested individuals to be invited to the course. The initial
              participation rate in the course was low (18 percent), even among the sample
              of interested individuals. Motivated by different theoretical and logistic reasons
              why individuals may not attend training, we randomized the treatment group into
              different subgroups, which received treatments designed to provide evidence on
              some key barriers to take-up. These treatments included monetary payments for
              attendance, deferred payments, free-cost transportation to the training location,
              and a video CD with positive testimonials about the training. We find that the latter
              two incentives did not increase take-up, but both current and deferred mone-
              tary payments boosted attendance rates by about 10 percentage points (from
              18 to between 27 and 33 percent, depending on the payment size). There was no
              significant difference in attendance between those who received the payment
              immediately and those who received a deferred payment, suggesting that time
              inconsistency or high discount rates are not the main constraint to participation.
                  A follow-up survey conducted six months after the course is then used
              to measure the impacts of the training on financial knowledge, behaviors, and
              outcomes. We find attending training results in a 9 percentage point increase
              in financial knowledge and a 9 percentage point increase in savings outcomes;
              but there is no impact on credit card behavior, retirement savings, or borrowing.
              Moreover, administrative data suggest that the savings impact is relatively short
              lived. Data on credit card balances and repayment rates show no systematic
              differences across the treatment and control groups related to the course. In
              addition to limited overall impacts of training, we find relatively little hetero-
              geneity in impacts. We do not find significantly different effects by gender or
              whether the individual is a customer of our partner financial institution, but we do
              find stronger savings impacts for individuals with a bachelor’s degree than those
              without.
                  Our results therefore suggest that the answer to the question of why volun-
              tary financial literacy programs are so unpopular is that they do not offer that
              much in the way of benefits to those who are not currently attending them. That
              is, it appears individuals may be making rational decisions not to attend such
              financial literacy training programs. We cannot rule out that such programs offer
              benefits to the individuals who voluntarily choose to go without being given any
              additional information or incentives, but our results suggest there are limited
              gains to trying to encourage more people to attend.
                  There is a growing literature attempting to assess the causal impacts of finan-
              cial literacy training, which we review in the next section. Much of the existing
              literature has looked at training provided in a compulsory manner, such as to
              students (Bernheim, Garrett, and Maki 2001; Cole and Shastry 2009; Lührmann,
              Serra-Garcia, and Winter 2012; also see Bruhn et al. in chapter 2 of this volume),
              or otherwise has focused on specialized content given to specific populations
              such as migrants and their families (Doi, McKenzie, and Zia 2012; Seshan and Yang
              2012; also see Gibson, McKenzie, and Zia in chapter 1 of this volume), and farmers

(Cai 2012). We contribute to this literature by focusing on a large-scale voluntary
financial literacy program offered to the general population in a large urban city—
precisely the type of effort that is being increasingly adopted in a number of coun-
tries around the world. As well as evaluating the impact of such a program, we are
able to experimentally test the importance of different constraints to participa-
tion in such programs, which the existing literature has not done.
     The remainder of this chapter is structured as follows. Section 7.2 provides
background information on financial literacy in Mexico and reviews the existing
literature. Section 7.3 describes the financial literacy course. Section 7.4 lays out
the experimental design and initial take-up. Section 7.5 then describes our exper-
iments to overcome barriers to take-up. Section 7.6 presents estimates of the
impact of the course on financial knowledge, behavior, and outcomes. Section 7.7
concludes with policy recommendations.



7.2	       BACKGROUND AND LITERATURE REVIEW

7.2.1	     Financial literacy in Mexico
During the last two decades, Mexicans have experienced significant changes in
access to finance, banking products, and exposure to risk. In 1997, the Mexican
Pension System switched from a pay-as-you-go system to one based on indi-
vidual retirement accounts. Under the new system, all private sector workers
have to choose a pension fund administrator to manage their account and invest
in portfolios with different levels of risk. A similar pension system was launched
for public sector workers in 2007. Banking services and financial product avail-
ability have also increased in recent years. While in 2004 around 25 percent of
the population had a bank account (Demirgüç-Kunt, Beck, and Honohan 2008),
this number had more than doubled by 2009 (Saldívar 2009), reaching 58 percent.
The number of credit cards has increased from just below 15 million to almost
28 million during the past five years, so that there are now as many credit cards
as households in Mexico.5
     As access to financial services expands and many consumers become users
of formal financial products for the first time, there is a growing concern that
many individuals may not have sufficient information and financial acumen to
use these products responsibly. The National Commission for the Protection of
Users of Financial Services (CONDUSEF [Comisión Nacional para la Protección y
Defensa de los Usuarios de Servicios Financieros]) found that 62 percent of Mexi-
cans lack financial education and are not aware of their rights and responsibilities

              with respect to financial institutions (Fernández 2010). In the 2012 Visa Interna-
              tional Financial Literacy Barometer, Mexico ranks in the lowest third of a sample
              of 28 countries on questions related to having a household budget or savings set
              aside for an emergency.6 Coupled with the evidence of low financial literacy, there
              is also evidence suggesting that individuals may not be managing their financial
              products correctly. For example, a recent study by Ponce, Seira, and Zamarripa
              (2009) analyzing credit card use and payment behavior in Mexico suggests that
              consumers make financially unsophisticated decisions in the credit card market.
              Also, Mexican workers tend to choose their pension fund administrator based on
              features not related to fees or returns (Hastings and Tejeda-Ashton 2008; Lara-
              Ibarra 2011).
                   The Mexican government has addressed the concern regarding low levels
              of financial education in several ways. CONDUSEF has held a Financial Education
              Week annually since 2008. The Ministry of Finance has also launched campaigns
              to improve financial literacy and financial education awareness. Furthermore,
              one of the objectives of the 2008–2012 National Development Financing Program
              was “to develop financial culture and consumer protection, promoting that
              people realize that they can save, get financing for their productive products,
              be responsible with their loans and protect against risks” (Saavedra 2012). The
              government’s efforts have also been matched by the development bank BANSEFI
              and by the private sector—e.g., commercial bank—initiatives. In 2009, a total of
              59 programs throughout the country were promoting financial education among
              different audiences (Treviño Garza 2011).


              7.2.2	     Literature review
              Financial education programs act under the assumption that lack of knowledge
              may be preventing individuals from making sound financial decisions. This is
              in part due to growing evidence showing strong associations between finan-
              cial literacy measures and financial decisions. For example, Lusardi and Tufano
              (2009) find that individuals who have low measured levels of financial literacy
              tend to pay minimum balances on credit cards, incur late fees on cards, and use
              informal sources of credit. Stango and Zinman (2009) show that people who make
              mistakes in interest and future value calculations tend to borrow more and save
              less. Lusardi and Mitchell (2009) illustrate that people with low levels of finan-
              cial literacy think less about retirement, and most of them have not planned for
              retirement at all. And in Mexico, Hastings and Tejeda-Ashton (2008) conducted a




               Overall, the barometer ranked Mexico in the top three (Visa 2012). However, this result
              6 


              may be biased by “taste”-related questions such as: “At what age should the government
              require financial literacy?” “How well do you think teens understand finance?” and “How
              often do you speak to your kids about money?”

survey that reveals that less literate individuals tend to choose mutual pension
funds with higher fees.
    There are three main problems with moving from these studies to developing
policy recommendations. The first is that the results are not necessarily causal.
They show a correlation between proxies for financial literacy and outcomes of
interest, but these correlations may simply reflect unobserved characteristics of
individuals such as their numeracy, ability, self-discipline, parental background,
or other such features. Second, it is often conceptually difficult to understand
whether individuals are truly undersaving and overborrowing, so even if we see
increases in savings it is unclear whether this represents a welfare improvement.
Third, even if we knew that individuals were overborrowing and undersaving,
and that financial literacy had a causal impact on these outcomes, it is still an
open question as to whether and how financial literacy skills can be taught and
improved.
    A growing literature tries to address the first and third of these issues by
relying on quasi-experimental or experimental variation in the provision of finan-
cial education programs. The studies vary widely in terms of context. In addition,
they face the challenge that the concept of financial literacy is often measured
and defined differently (see Lewis and Messy 2012; Xu and Zia 2012).
    Compulsory financial education classes taught in high schools have been
subjected to a number of studies. Bernheim, Garrett, and Maki (2001) use exoge-
nous variation in high school financial education mandates across U.S. states to
show that students exposed to financial education classes save more as adults.
However, Cole and Shastry (2009) cast doubt on these findings, showing that they
are not robust in controlling for state-fixed effects and examining effects over
time. Shorter-term evidence comes from Bruhn et al. (2013), who conducted a
randomized experiment providing financial education in Brazilian high schools.
They find positive effects on financial knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors; and an
increase in savings rates—although the impacts are small in absolute magnitude:
a 3 percentage point increase in knowledge, and a 1 percentage point increase
in savings. In Germany, Lührmann, Serra-Garcia, and Winter (2012) find teenagers
given financial literacy training show increased interest in and knowledge of finan-
cial matters, and save more in a hypothetical task, but they do not measure actual
savings.
    Other studies have focused on providing financial education to working
adults, recognizing the differences in households’ financial needs and exposure
across developed and developing countries. The literature in developed coun-
tries tends to study the impact of financial education on planning for retirement
or investment portfolio choices. Participation in voluntary seminars for retire-
ment savings also tends to be low. Duflo and Saez (2003) show that offering
monetary rewards can increase attendance substantially, but that this large
increase leads to less than a 1.5 percentage point difference in retirement plan
participation.
216  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




                  In the developing country context, impact evaluations of financial literacy
              training have studied the unbanked, insurance take-up, and migrants. One of the
              first papers to examine the impact of financial education in a developing country
              is Cole, Sampson, and Zia (2009). The authors implemented a field experiment in
              Indonesia where they offered randomly selected unbanked households a financial
              literacy course geared toward opening a bank savings account. They find that the
              financial literacy course had no effect on the likelihood of opening a bank savings
              account in the full sample, but it had modest effects for uneducated and finan-
              cially illiterate households. Cai (2012) used a randomized experiment to show that
              farmers in rural China are more likely to take up crop insurance and become less
              price sensitive after attending financial education sessions.
                  Gibson, McKenzie, and Zia in chapter 1 of this volume; Doi, McKenzie, and
              Zia (2012); and Seshan and Yang (2012) analyze how providing information and
              financial education affects the behavior of migrants and their households. Gibson,
              McKenzie, and Zia work with migrants in New Zealand and Australia, and find
              that financial education increases knowledge about remittance transaction
              costs, but does not lead to changes in the amount of remittances sent or use of
              the cheapest remittance method. Using a sample of Indonesian migrants, Doi,
              McKenzie, and Zia (2012) find that impacts on financial knowledge, behavior, and
              savings are largest when both the migrants and their families receive financial
              education. The results show that financial education can have large effects when
              provided at a teachable moment, but that this impact varies with who receives
              training. GAO (2004) has also recognized the importance of providing education
              during “teachable moments.” Seshan and Yang (2012) find that Indian migrants
              in Qatar increase savings after financial literacy training, but only if they had low
              financial literacy to begin with.
                  A common assumption in most financial literacy interventions is that people
              are not saving enough. Indeed George Akerlof goes so far as to state in his Nobel
              address that “it is common wisdom that people save too little” (Akerlof 2001). He
              notes that in standard economic models, saving is the outcome of utility maxi-
              mization decisions, so saving too little or too much is not possible. However,
              behavioral economics offers several reasons for undersaving: present consump-
              tion is more salient than future consumption, so individuals may procrastinate
              about saving and have time-inconsistent preferences. He notes that the best
              evidence of undersaving is the observation that upon retirement, consumption
              falls substantially. However, the view that people do not save enough for retire-
              ment has been challenged by Aguiar and Hurst (2005), who show that although
              expenditure falls dramatically upon retirement, consumption does not, as people
              increase home production. Nevertheless, evidence from lab experiments (e.g.,
              Brown, Chua, and Camerer 2009) supports two views of undersaving: that people
              do not know how to save optimally in complex environments; and that even when
              they do know how to save, they cannot resist short-term temptations to spend.
              Financial education in principle can reduce undersaving by helping with these two

problems: by giving individuals more information and knowledge about saving
strategies, and by providing tools and ideas to help resist temptations to spend.
     In a recent review, Gale and Levine (2010) find that none of the traditional
approaches have generated unambiguous evidence of positive impacts of finan-
cial literacy efforts.7 The literature is now moving toward exploring whether inno-
vative channels for providing financial education may affect behavior. Ongoing
studies in India, Peru, South Africa, and the United States (among others) are
testing whether the provision of information via videos, radio, mass media, or
video games is effective in improving individuals’ financial decisions.
     This study builds on and complements this existing literature in several ways.
First, we work with a population that is already banked. Thus, we do not study
whether financial education makes individuals more likely to use formal finan-
cial products, such as savings accounts or credit cards, but rather on whether
they use these products to their advantage and responsibly. Second, the financial
education course we analyze covers topics that are relevant for a range of users
of financial services and is delivered at scale by a financial institution, rather than
being a pilot or government program. Third, we examine interest for such training
in a general population, and then focus on individuals who state an interest in
attending a financial literacy course. We show that even among this population
training attendance rates are low, and we examine the barriers to participation
experimentally through the use of different incentive treatments. Finally, we
obtain administrative data on savings and credit card usage from a financial insti-
tution to validate the conclusions drawn from survey data.



7.3	       THE FINANCIAL LITERACY TRAINING PRODUCT
The financial literacy training course studied in this chapter is a large-scale
program offered to the general public. The goal of the program is to convey basic
knowledge and tools that individuals may need to manage their personal finances
responsibly. It is targeted at adults and is offered free of charge. The program
was first launched a few years ago and has trained over 300,000 individuals. In
2011, the course won a regional award for innovativeness in fostering financial
education.
     During the time of our study, the course was being taught at several loca-
tions in Mexico City and in a number of other cities in Mexico, as well as through
an online platform. Our study focuses on the training locations in Mexico City.
Courses are offered on a continuous basis, with one or two sessions per day
Monday through Saturday. Each session has capacity for 20 participants, although



 The authors mention four approaches: employer-provided financial education, state-man-
7 


dated financial and consumer education for students, credit and mortgage counseling, and
community-based programs providing general financial education.
218  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              typical attendance at the most central location is only four or five people per day
              on weekdays and more on weekends. Attendance is even lower at the other loca-
              tions, with participation rates of about one person per day during our pretreat-
              ment monitoring. Training is administered via individual computer terminals, with
              an instructor present to show videos and facilitate interactive exercises that are
              used to strengthen the concepts taught in the material. Participants also receive
              workbooks that contain the information being presented, as well as exercises to
              be completed during the course. At the end of the session, participants take a
              short test and receive a certificate conditional on completing the test success-
              fully. They also receive a CD to take home. This CD includes the tools used in the
              exercises performed during the course.
                   The course lasts half a day and consists of modules on saving, retirement,
              credit cards, and responsible use of credit. The course explains why saving is
              important and discusses different savings instruments and steps individuals can
              take to increase the amount they save, such as setting savings goals and keeping
              a household budget. Saving for retirement and pension funds are also covered.
              The course then discusses the use of credit cards, associated fees, and how to
              decipher a credit card statement. Finally, information is provided on good credit
              card debt management practices, an individual’s credit score and credit history,
              and steps individuals can take to preserve and improve their credit management.



              7.4	      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN, AND THE LOW DEMAND FOR
                        FINANCIAL LITERACY TRAINING
              To estimate the impact of the training on financial knowledge, behavior, and
              outcomes, we conducted a randomized experiment. This section describes the
              design and implementation of the initial experiment, including sample selection,
              randomization, and take-up.
                   Many programs in finance and private sector development face low take-up
              (McKenzie 2010), and prior voluntary financial literacy programs have also expe-
              rienced low take-up issues (Brown and Gartner 2007). While the 300,000 indi-
              viduals taking part in the financial literacy training program studied here are a
              substantial number, this is countrywide and over four years. Assuming at most
              100,000 were trained in Mexico City in any one year, this represents less than 0.6
              percent of Mexico City’s adult population obtaining the training annually.8 Low
              take-up has severe consequences for statistical power. We therefore tried several
              approaches to screen individuals for their interest in participating in financial
              literacy training and thereby measure the impacts of such training on these indi-
              viduals. This process gives insights into the demand for financial literacy training,

                The National Population Council (CONAPO) projects that in 2012 there were 17,372,952
              individuals 17 years or older living in the metropolitan zone of Mexico City.

and provides training impacts for a policy-relevant group. Since it is difficult to
make adult financial education mandatory, a key policy question is whether policy
efforts should try and encourage more people who are interested in attending
such programs to actually attend them.


7.4.1	    Approach 1: low demand for financial literacy
          demonstrated through a mailing campaign
Our first approach to obtain a sample of people interested in financial literacy
training was to send a screener survey to clients of our partner financial institu-
tion. The institution agreed to partner with us and to provide us with a de-iden-
tified list of all its clients in Mexico City who have a savings account and a credit
card. By conditioning on these characteristics, we intended to identify individuals
for whom debt management and saving advice is likely to be relevant and who
have credit card and savings behavior that we could study. We further narrowed
down the list of clients to those who lived in a municipality with a financial literacy
training location less than 5 kilometers away. From this sample, we randomly
selected 40,000 clients to receive a mailing with the screener survey. The
randomization was stratified by gender and age. The mailings were sent by our
partner institution through its usual provider between January 7 and 12, 2011. The
delivery company confirmed delivery of 98.8 percent of the letters. Nondeliveries
were due to clients having moved or the address not being found.
    The mailing contained a letter informing clients of our partnering with their
financial institution to help research ways people are managing their savings and
credit card debt, and to see if they are interested in participating in a financial
education training session. The letter only mentioned the training in general terms
and did not refer to the specific program we are studying or the locations where
this training was being offered. The mailing also contained a two-page screener
survey that clients could mail back to us in a prepaid envelope to indicate their
interest in the training. This short screener survey collected information on name,
address, phone number, gender, age, education level, occupation, household
income and expenditure (in bins), as well as basic usage of savings accounts and
credit cards. Clients also had the option of responding to the survey by going to
a website or by calling a toll-free number. In order to increase response to the
screener survey, half of the letters (20,000) were randomly selected to include an
offer for a monetary payment of Mex$75 (about US$5) to the first 200 clients who
submitted their answers.
    The total number of letters sent (40,000) was chosen based on information
from our partner financial institution that typically only 2–3 percent of its clients
reply to any sort of mail offer it sent to them. This expected response rate would
yield 800–1,200 clients who would form the sample for our randomized experiment.
However, we received much fewer responses than anticipated—only 42; thus, only
0.1 percent of clients expressed interest in a financial literacy training program.
220  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




                    We suspect that this low response rate is in part due to the climate of inse-
              curity that has prevailed in Mexico City during the past few years and that has
              made people distrustful of unsolicited requests for data. Around the time of our
              study, fradulent phone and mail extortions had become a threat to the general
              population. In fact, both the federal government and commercial banks launched
              a campaign asking people to avoid giving personal information to strangers, espe-
              cially through phone or mail communications offering money or prizes in return
              for personal data. Our letters were sent out by our partner financial institution,
              bearing its logo, but people may still have been suspicious of the request for data.9


              7.4.2	     Approach 2: low demand for financial literacy
                         demonstrated through an online campaign
              Our second strategy for obtaining a study sample was to conduct a screener
              survey through Facebook. We created a Facebook page for financial literacy and
              launched a Facebook ad that pointed to this page. The Facebook page included
              the same information as the letters sent in the mail, mentioning the importance
              of financial literacy. The page invited people to indicate their interest in partici-
              pating in a (generic) financial literacy course by clicking on a link that redirected
              them to a page where they could answer our screener survey online. This survey
              contained the same questions as the one mailed to our partner financial insti-
              tution’s clients. We did not offer a financial incentive for completing the online
              survey.
                    The Facebook ad was targeted to individuals residing in Mexico City and ran
              for two months, from mid-February to mid-April 2011.10 It was displayed about
              16 million times. We obtained a total of 1,240 fans of our Facebook page and 119
              responses to the online survey. Since this sample was still not large enough for
              our study, we implemented a third approach to screening people for an interest
              in a financial literacy course, as described below.


              7.4.3	     Approach 3: street and branch surveys
              We conducted screener surveys on the streets of Mexico City and outside branches
              of our partner institution. Surveyors were placed in busy locations within the city
              during a period of eight weeks (from April 25 to June 25, 2011) where they tried to
              interview people passing by. We also placed surveyors outside branches of our




              9 
                 All letters included a toll-free number people could call to make i\enquiries. We did not
              receive any phone calls about the training in response to this mailer, suggesting a low
              demand for such training.

                At the time, Facebook had 7,743,220 registered users who reside in Mexico City (approx-
              10 


              imately 87 percent of the population).
                                   7.  Why is voluntary financial education so unpopular?  ◾ 221




partner institution between July 6 and 19, 2011, where they approached exiting
customers and people waiting in line.
      For this approach, interviewers asked people if they would be interested
in participating in a financial literacy course, providing the same information as
stated in letters sent during the mailing campaign. As in the letters, the name
of the course was not disclosed. If the respondents expressed interest in the
course,11 interviewers asked them to fill out the screener survey, so that we could
contact them later with further information about it. The questionnaire included
the same set of questions as the mail and online surveys. We did not offer a
monetary incentive for completing the surveys, but people who answered the
survey were offered cookies and a pen as a small thank you token. We obtained
a total of 6,945 completed questionnaires from the street survey and 2,294 from
the branch survey.


7.4.4	     Treatment randomization and balance
For all individuals who had expressed interest in a financial literacy course either
through the mail, online, or via the street or branch screener survey, we conducted
phone audits to verify the contact information they had provided. This eliminated
about half of the respondents. We further dropped respondents who lived outside
the Mexico City metropolitan area or who had participated in a financial literacy
program in the past. We also dropped observations that had missing answers to
the questions we stratified on in the randomization, as described below. Our final
sample includes 8 respondents from the mail survey, 5 from the online survey,
2,490 from the street survey, and 1,000 from the branch survey, for a total sample
of 3,503 people. We divided this sample into a control group of 1,752 individuals,
and a treatment group of 1,751 individuals, using stratified randomization. The
randomization was conducted by the authors by computer.
      We stratified the randomization by whether we obtained the respondent
through the branch versus the mail, online, or street survey; by gender; by having
at least a bachelor’s degree or not; and by whether the person was (1) a client
of our partner financial institution, (2) a client of another financial institution, or
(3) neither. Within the sample of financial institution clients, we further stratified
by whether they made a deposit into their savings account during the past month
and by whether they have a credit card. For clients with a credit card, we strati-
fied by whether they made more than the minimum payment each month during
the past six months. For individuals who were not financial institution clients,
we stratified by whether they lived closer than 8 kilometers away from a training
location or not.




  Subject recruiters reported that, roughly, only two out of every five people approached
11 


expressed an interest in the course and agreed to fill out the survey.
222  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




                  Our original intention with the mail screener survey was to study only indi-
              viduals who are financial institution clients to learn whether the financial literacy
              course can improve their financial behavior and outcomes. Through the online,
              street, and branch surveys, we obtained 1,325 respondents who were not finan-
              cial institution clients. We decided to keep these in the sample, since the course
              material could in principle also be relevant for them, and they may start financial
              institution relationships as a result of taking the course. However, the percentage
              of nonfinancial institution clients in the treatment group who ended up attending
              the financial literacy training was very low (18.1 percent), making it difficult to
              detect any effects on this sample. Since the take-up rates were higher among
              financial institution clients (28.1 percent), as discussed further below, we decided
              to conduct our follow-up survey only among financial institution clients; and we
              dropped the nonfinancial institution clients from the impact analysis, although
              they are included in our experiments on inducing attendance.
                  Table 7.1 shows baseline variables collected through the screener survey
              for the sample of financial institution clients. About half of the individuals were
              clients of our partner financial institution as opposed to clients of another insti-
              tution. Close to 65 percent made a savings deposit during the past month. About
              40 percent had a credit card at baseline, and only half of them made more than
              the minimum payment in all previous months. In fact, about 20 percent made a
              late payment on their credit card during the past six months. The demographic
              variables show that about half of the sample is female, and 40 percent has at
              least a bachelor’s degree. The average age is 33. As expected given the random
              assignment, all baseline variables are balanced across the treatment and control
              groups.


              7.4.5	       Initial take-up: low attendance for training even
                           among those who say they are interested in
                           attending a financial literacy course
              Starting on August 1, 2011, each person in the treatment group was contacted
              by telephone and invited to participate in the financial literacy training program. If
              the participants confirmed interest, they were offered the opportunity to choose
              a training location, date, and schedule that best suited them. The phone operator
              then enrolled the participant based on this information. The operator confirmed
              the details of the appointment with the participant before ending the call.
                  A second call was made the day prior to the participant’s appointment as a
              reminder to increase the probability of attendance, and a third and final call was
              made the day after the appointment to confirm attendance and inquire about
              the level of satisfaction with the courses. During this third call, if participants
              responded that they had missed the appointment, they were offered the oppor-
              tunity to reschedule for a future date, if they said they were still interested in
              attending.

     During this phase, we signed up 1,049 out of 1,751 individuals (59.9 percent)
for the course. About a third of the people who signed up for the course actu-
ally attended (312 people). Participants gave a range of reasons for not attending
the session they had signed up for, including difficulties attending due to work
and family commitments, sickness, and—in some cases—issues with instructors
turning up late or their arriving late and being turned away.
     The overall attendance rate for the 1,751 treatment group individuals who
had been screened for interest in attending a financial literacy course was thus
only 17.8 percent. This number is low compared to attendance rates for business

              training courses. A study in Mexico found a 65 percent attendance rate for busi-
              ness training. Attendance rates for business training interventions in other coun-
              tries range from 39 to 92 percent (McKenzie and Woodruff 2012).



              7.5	       OVERCOMING BARRIERS TO ATTENDANCE THROUGH
                         EXPERIMENTAL INTERVENTIONS
              We first examine theoretical reasons why individuals may choose not to partici-
              pate in financial literacy training, and then describe the experiments designed to
              test these barriers.


              7.5.1	     Why might people not want to participate in financial
                         literacy training?
              Let c be the cost of attending the financial literacy program. While the program
              itself is free, individuals would incur transportation costs in getting to and from
              the program, as well as the opportunity cost of lost income (or lost leisure time).
              Let bt be the benefits the individuals will realize in period t from participating
              in the course, such as better financial outcomes, and Ebt the certainty-equiva-
              lent expectation of these benefits. Then theory will predict that an individual will
              choose to attend a financial literacy course if the expected discounted benefits of
              the course exceed the costs of attending. i.e., if
                                                     T
              	∑t = 0βδt Ebt > c 	                                                                 (7.1)

                  Revealed preference would suggest that anyone whom it would benefit to
              take the financial literacy course would have done so, while anyone who chooses
              not to take the course is doing so because he or she does not view the benefits
              as exceeding the costs.
                  This theory then suggests several barriers that may prevent individuals from
              participating in the financial literacy course, even if it has positive benefits to
              them (∑tT = 0 bt > 0). A first reason is just that they face costs of attending, so that c
              is large in magnitude. A second set of reasons concerns the timing of when costs
              are incurred relative to when benefits are received. In particular, individuals may
              not participate because the costs are experienced immediately, while the bene-
              fits may take time to accrue. Individuals with high discount rates (low δ) may find
              the discounted value of benefits is less than the current costs. Individuals who are
              present biased (β < 1) can have time-inconsistent preferences; while they would
              like to have attended financial literacy training in the future, because the benefits
              occur in the future and attendance occurs today, they keep putting the course off.
              Third, individuals may not know the benefits of participating, potentially underval-
              uing them. Even if their expected benefits are accurate, with risk aversion, uncer-
              tainty as to these benefits will still cause Ebt < bt. Finally, one could also imagine
              that liquidity constraints prevent individuals from paying the costs today, even if

they see positive net expected benefits. This final explanation seems less relevant
in our case where many individuals have credit cards and most have savings.


7.5.2	        Experimental interventions to overcome barriers to
              attendance
We designed a second stage of interventions to explore if we could tease out
whether high uncertainty about benefits, transport costs, high opportunity costs,
impatience, or low appeal for the course could explain individuals’ low attendance
and thereby learn what policy efforts could spur attendance. The treatment group
was divided further into six different groups—one group that received no further
assistance, and the following five booster treatment groups:

      1.	 Offered Mex$1,000 (US$72) for completing the training: participants were
          given a Walmart gift card of Mex$1,000 if they attended12
      2.	 Offered Mex$500 (US$36) gift card for completing the training
      3.	 Offered Mex$500 gift card that they would receive one month after
          completing the training
      4.	 Offered a free taxi ride to and from the course location
      5.	 Provided a video CD containing positive testimonials from people who had
          attended the course

        Treatments 1 and 2 enable us to examine whether individuals are more
likely to attend the course as the benefits of attending the course increase. This
helps get at the issue of whether individuals are making rational decisions by
responding to changes in the net benefits, as well as to measure how the demand
for training varies with these benefits. The comparison of Treatments 2 and 3
enables us to see whether high discount rates or present bias is a reason for
lack of attendance—people might think the course has benefits, but because
these benefits occur in the future and attendance occurs today, they keep putting
the course off. If this was the issue, we would expect much greater response to
Treatment 2 than to Treatment 3. Treatment 4 lowers the costs of attending the
training, which enables examination of whether one important component of c
is the constraint. Treatment 5 aims to reduce informational constraints that may
prevent people from attending the course if they are not sure it will be helpful,
thereby attempting to reduce the difference between Ebt and bt.
        The incentive treatments were assigned through stratified randomization
using the entire treatment group. We stratified by whether the respondent was
screened through the branch versus mail, online, or street survey; by income

                    group; by whether the person was a client of our partner financial institution, a
                    client of another financial institution, or neither; and by attendance status thus
                    far. The attendance status categories were attended, was scheduled but did not
                    attend, was reached but did not want to be scheduled, and cannot be reached.
                    Individuals who had already attended the course did not receive the incentives,
                    but they were included in the randomization to allow us to report post-incentive
                    treatment take-up rates by incentive type for the complete treatment group.


                    7.5.3	        Impacts of experiments to increase attendance
                    Figure 7.1 shows the overall percentages attending in each incentive treatment
                    group (after the initial treatment offer and the booster treatments). Some partic-
                    ipants were unreachable by phone, so we show results as a percentage of all
                    participants assigned to a treatment, and of all who could be reached to actually
                    offer them the treatment. Table 7.2 provides regression estimates of the impacts
                    of the various treatment arms on attendance.
                          As a result of the booster interventions, we succeeded in getting an addi-
                    tional 114 individuals to attend the course, giving a total of 426 attendees out of
                    1,751 treatment group individuals (24.3 percent). Offering a monetary incentive of
                    US$36 increased the take-up rate from about 18 percent to 27 percent of those
                    assigned to treatment, while the US$72 incentive increased take-up further to 33
                    percent. While the difference between the two monetary amounts is not statis-
                    tically significant, they both suggest that individuals are rationally responding to

higher benefits of training by being more likely to attend. The treatment impact
is exactly the same when US$36 is offered immediately at the completion of
training, or one month after training. This suggests that high discounts or present
bias are not the main barriers to participation in training.
      In contrast to the monetary incentives, we find that transportation assistance
and the testimonials did not significantly increase attendance. One reason for the
lack of impact of transportation assistance was security concerns in Mexico City,
with people reluctant to take a taxi cab that came to their home. The lack of impact of
the testimonials could reflect people updating their beliefs about the efficacy of the
training very little after the receipt of this treatment, or that lack of information about
the benefits and quality of the training was not the main reason for nonparticipation.
      Finally, note that even when participants were offered US$72 to attend, it is
still the case that the majority of individuals who had initially expressed interest
in attending financial literacy training do not attend.13

              7.5.4	     Which individuals attend training?
              If we break down the take-up rate by individuals who are clients of a financial insti-
              tution and those who are not, we find that the attendance rate was 28.1 percent
              among clients versus 18.1 percent among nonclients. Since we do not expect to
              be able to detect treatment effects with a take-up rate of 18.1 percent and since
              our randomization was stratified by being a financial institution client, we decided
              to collect follow-up data only on the 2,178 individuals who are clients of a financial
              institution. From this point on, all tables and analysis in this chapter cover only
              these individuals.
                    Using data from the screener survey, we analyze which individual background
              characteristics are correlated with training attendance in the treatment group. Table
              7.3 displays this analysis, using two different measures of take-up: (1) a dummy vari-
              able for whether the individual attended the course prior to our booster incentive
              interventions, and (2) a dummy variable for whether the individual attended either
              before or after we offered the incentives.14 The bottom row of table 7.3 shows that
              the take-up rate increased from 20.8 percent to 28.5 percent after the incentive
              intervention (in our sample of financial institution clients). Two characteristics are
              strongly and positively correlated with attendance: education and age. Individuals
              who have a bachelor’s degree or higher are up to 14 percentage points more likely
              to have attended the training. The take-up rate among this group was 38 percent
              after the incentive intervention. Older individuals are also more likely to have partic-
              ipated in the training. In addition, we find weak evidence that females and indi-
              viduals who are clients of our partner financial institution as opposed to another
              institution are slightly more likely to have attended the training.

              has many missing values and including it would thus reduce the sample size. When we add
              income to the analysis, it is not correlated with take-up, and the coefficients on the other
              variables remain similar to the ones shown in table 7.3.

focused on concepts and behaviors taught in the course. We discuss specific
questions and outcome variables below.
     For logistic reasons, we first attempted to conduct the follow-up survey over
the phone. If the person did not respond to the survey during the first attempt,
we offered them a Mex$500 (US$36) Walmart gift card for completing the survey
during the second attempt. If we were still not able to interview the person over
the phone, a surveyor visited the individual’s house to conduct a face-to-face
interview. If the participant was not at home, the surveyor delivered a letter with
information about our study and instructions for how to contact us to participate
in the survey and to receive the Walmart gift card. Surveyors made two more
attempts (three attempts in total) to conduct a face-to-face interview if a respon-
dent was not at home.
     We were able to interview 72.8 percent of our sample during the follow-up
survey. The attrition rate was slightly higher in the treatment group (29 percent)
230  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              than in the control group (25.3 percent). The last two columns of table 7.1 show
              baseline characteristics for the sample of individuals interviewed at follow-up.
              The characteristics are very similar to the full sample, and we do not find any
              statistically significant differences between control and treatment group means
              in the follow-up sample. This shows the difference in attrition rates between the
              two groups is not leading to imbalance on observable characteristics.


              7.6.2	     Administrative data
              We obtained administrative data on savings account balances and credit card
              outcomes from our partner institution. For confidentiality reasons, our partner
              cannot disclose individual-level data, but it offered to generate summary statis-
              tics at the treatment and control group level. This was going to be straightforward
              with the sample we screened through the mail survey, since the list of individ-
              uals in this sample came from our partner financial institution, meaning that it
              could easily find these individuals in its records. The low response rate to this
              survey implied, however, that our sample now consists almost entirely of individ-
              uals who were screened through the street or branch surveys. About half of the
              current sample (1,034 individuals) reported being clients of our partner financial
              institution, and 470 of these individuals could be found in the institution’s records
              based on name, address, and phone number.15 The last two columns of table 7.1
              show our baseline statistics for this sample of 470 clients. Overall, this group is
              similar to the full sample. Also, the characteristics of the treatment and control
              group clients who were matched with administrative data were not statistically
              different at baseline.


              7.6.3	     Estimating treatment impacts
              We estimate the impact of the financial literacy training with the following inten-
              tion-to-treat equation

              	               yi,s,m = α + βTrainingInvitei,s,m + ∑γsds+ ∑δmdm + εi,s,m	(7.2)

              where yi,s,m is a follow-up survey measure of the financial knowledge, behavior, or
              outcome of individual i, in randomization strata s, who was surveyed in month m.
              The variable TrainingInvitei,s,m indicates whether an individual was invited to the
              course or not and is thus equal to 1 for the treatment group and equal to 0 for the
              control group. We control for randomization strata dummies ds, as well as month
              of follow-up interview dummies dm. The main coefficient of interest is β, which
              represents the treatment effect of being invited to a financial literacy course.
              The coefficient β in equation 7.2 is also equal to the difference in means of the

outcome variable yi,s,m across the treatment and control groups, conditional on
strata and interview month dummies.
        In addition, we estimate the following local average treatment effect regres-
sion:

	                  yi,s,m = α + βAttendedTrainingi,s,m + ∑γsds+ ∑δmdm + εi,s,m	(7.3)

where AttendedTrainingi,s,m is equal to 1 for treatment group individuals who
attended a course and 0 otherwise. We instrument this variable with our indi-
cator variable for whether an individual was invited to the training or not
(TrainingInvitei,s,m). The coefficient of β here represents the local average treat-
ment effect: that is, the impact of the financial literacy course on the individuals
who attended a course as a result of being invited to it but who would not have
otherwise attended.


7.6.4	         Impact on financial knowledge
We measure financial knowledge through eight follow-up survey questions based
on the material that was taught in the course. For each question, we create a
dummy variable indicating whether the respondent gave the correct answer to
the question. These eight questions are then aggregated into a financial knowl-
edge index that is the average of the eight dummy variables, and thus represents
the fraction of questions the respondent answered correctly. Finally, we asked
individuals to rate their own level of financial education on a scale from 1 to 5 (1 =
excellent, 2 = good, 3 = satisfactory, 4 = unsatisfactory, 5 = no knowledge of the
topic). Based on the responses to this question, we coded a dummy variable indi-
cating whether the self-assessed level of financial literacy is satisfactory or higher.
         Table 7.4 lists the eight dummy variables used to measure financial literacy,
as well as the knowledge index and self-assessed knowledge level. The table
shows the control group mean for each variable and the intention-to-treat and
local average treatment effect estimates that correspond to the coefficients β in
equations 7.2 and 7.3.
         The results in table 7.4 show that the course had a positive and statistically
significant impact on financial knowledge. The knowledge index increased from
0.31 in the control group to 0.34 in the treatment group due to the training, meaning
that control group individuals answer 31 percent of the eight questions correctly,
while treatment group individuals answer 34 percent correctly. The size of this
impact is relatively small, but the effect is larger for some individual questions. For
example, only 13 percent of control group individuals know that bank deposits are
insured up to 400,000 UDIs,16 but the training increased this number to 20 percent
in the treatment group. Similarly, 24 percent of the control group knows what total

a. A unidad de inversion (UDI) is an inflation-adjusting currency unit.
b. Total annual cost of credit, including all interest rates and fees.



                    annual cost of credit is; this number increased to 28 percent in the treatment group
                    due to the training. The training also increased the self-assessed level of financial
                    literacy, with 63 percent of the treatment group saying their knowledge is satisfac-
                    tory or higher, compared to 58 percent in the control group.
                          When interpreting the magnitude of the effects, it is important to keep in
                    mind that only about 30 percent of the treatment group attended the financial
                    literacy course. The local average treatment effect estimates in the last column
                    of table 7.4 take into account this relatively low take-up rate. They show much
                    larger impacts on individuals who actually went to the training as a result of
                    being invited through the intervention. The knowledge index increased by
                    8.7 percentage points due to the course for these individuals, and the probability

7.6.5	    Impact on savings behavior and outcomes
The financial literacy course emphasized specific behaviors that may help individ-
uals save more money, including checking financial institution transactions regu-
larly and keeping track of expenses, making a budget and setting a savings goal,
and identifying necessary and unnecessary expenses to reduce overall expendi-
tures. The follow-up survey asked whether individuals engage in these behaviors,
and we code five dummy variables indicating that they do, as listed in panel A of
table 7.5. We aggregate these behaviors into a savings behavior index by taking
an average of the five dummies, giving the fraction of the five behaviors in which
individuals engage.
    The control group means in panel A of table 7.5 show that many individuals
check their financial institution transactions regularly (69 percent), keep track of
expenses (79 percent), and make a budget (77 percent), even without having taken
the financial literacy course. We do not detect a significant treatment effect of the
training on these behaviors, perhaps because these behaviors were already quite
common in the control group. The remaining two savings behaviors we study
are not as frequently used in the control group: 57 percent of individuals have a
savings goal, and 59 percent have cut expenses in the past three months. We find
that the course increased the percentage of individuals who cut expenses during
the past three months to 63 percent, but this effect is only statistically significant
at the 10 percent level.
    In addition to studying savings behavior, we also examine whether the
training had an impact on savings outcomes. Panel B of table 7.5 lists three
measures of personal savings: a dummy variable indicating whether the indi-
vidual has any type of savings/money set aside, a dummy variable for whether
the individual reports saving at least some fraction of his or her income during
the past six months, and a dummy variable indicating whether the respondent
said he or she saves more each month than a year ago. We construct a savings
outcome index by taking the average of these three dummy variables. All three
savings outcomes are higher in the treatment group than in the control group
at follow-up, although the differences are not statistically significant for the
individual variables. We do, however, find a positive and significant impact of
the course on the savings outcome index. Control group individuals reach on
average 65 percent of all three savings outcomes, increasing to 68 percent in the
treatment group.
    Recall that we provided monetary incentives of Mex$500 or Mex$1,000
(US$36 or US$72) to some randomly chosen treatment group individuals in order
to encourage them to attend the financial literacy course. These amounts are
equivalent to 5.5 and 11 percent of median monthly income in our sample. To
check whether the positive effect on savings outcomes is driven by the monetary
payments instead of by the course itself, we add a dummy variable to estima-
tion questions (1) and (2), indicating whether the individual received an incentive

     The course included material on retirement savings and pension funds. Table
7.6 shows the impact of the course on retirement savings behavior and outcomes.
In the control group, 57 percent of individuals have a pension fund; the course did
not change this percentage in the treatment group. Pension funds are typically
provided through an individual’s employer, implying that we did not necessary
expect to find an impact of the course on this outcome since acquiring a pension
fund may involve switching jobs. The other variables reported in this table are
based on follow-up survey questions that were only answered by individuals who
have a pension fund. In order to account for possible selection bias, we fill the
variables in with 0 for individuals who do not have a pension fund, so that they
are defined for the complete sample, except for individuals who did not know
whether they have a pension fund or not.
     In terms of retirement savings behaviors, we measure whether (1) individ-
uals choose a pension fund administrator based on fees or returns, as opposed
to using the default option, relying on friends’ advice etc.; (2) they check their
pension fund statement regularly; and (3) they have calculated how much money
they will need upon retirement. We construct an index of retirement savings
behavior that is the average of the three behavior dummy variables. As the retire-
ment savings outcome, we examine whether individuals report saving money for

              retirement (on top of their pension fund).17 We do not find an impact of the training
              on any of the retirement savings behaviors or outcomes listed in table 7.6.


              7.6.6	     Impact on borrowing behavior and outcomes
              The course also discussed responsible use of credit cards and healthy borrowing
              behavior. Table 7.7 shows that 48 percent of the control group had a credit
              card at follow-up. This percentage was not statistically different in the treat-
              ment group. For individuals with a credit card, we define several measures of
              credit card behavior and outcomes, as listed in panels A and B of table 7.7. The
              measures are based on questions that were only posed to individuals with a
              credit card and refer to their most frequently used card. The variables are filled
              in with 0 for individuals who do not have a credit card, to account for possible
              selection bias.
                    We examine six credit card behaviors. Three are dummy variables indicating
              whether the person knows the credit limit, knows the credit card interest rate,
              and checks the credit card statement every month. The other three variables
              are coded as the fraction of the past six months, where the individual paid the
              balance in full, made only the minimum payment, and received cash through the
              credit card. We construct a credit card behavior index by first converting all vari-
              ables to z-scores using the control group mean and standard deviation and then
              taking the average of these z-scores. The two behaviors that are last on the list
              are coded with a negative sign in the average, since they represent undesirable
              credit card behavior.
                    We study three credit card outcomes: (1) whether the issuer blocked the
              credit card during the past six months, (2) the fraction of the past six months
              when the individual was charged late payment fees, and (3) the fraction of the
              past six months where the individual was charged overdraft fees. The incidence
              of all three events is quite low in the sample, ranging from 1 to 4 percent. We also
              construct an index of these three outcomes, using the average of the z-scores.
              The results in table 7.7 show no impact of the course on credit card behavior or
              outcomes.
                    Table 7.8 examines borrowing behavior more broadly. We look at three loan
              behaviors, coded as dummy variables that indicate whether the individual applied
              for a loan from any source during the past six months, went to a pawn shop for
              credit during the past six months, and stopped servicing outstanding debt during
              the past six months. We aggregate these behaviors into a loan behavior index by
              taking the average of the three dummy variables. In the control group, 23 percent



                We intended to also ask questions on having calculated how much money is needed

              upon retirement and whether the individual is saving money for retirement in the complete
              sample, independent of whether the person has a pension fund. However, by mistake,
              these questions were only posed to individuals who reported having a pension fund.

of individuals applied for a loan during the past six months, 10 percent went to a
pawn shop, and 13 percent stopped servicing outstanding debt. These percent-
ages are not statistically different in the treatment group. We also find no effect
of the course on the index of loan behavior.
     Panel B of table 7.8 shows the impact of the course on loan outcomes.
One-third of control group individuals have a loan from any source, and their total
outstanding debt represents about 15 percent of annual income. These numbers
are statistically identical in the treatment group, implying that the training had no
effect on loan outcomes.

                    7.6.7	       Heterogeneous treatment effects
                    We now ask whether the impact of the course was different for different groups
                    of people. The take-up regressions in table 7.3 show that individuals with a bach-
                    elor’s degree, as well as females and clients of our partner financial institution,
                    were more likely to attend the training compared to other people in the treatment
                    group. The treatment effects may be larger for these groups since more of them
                    were exposed to the course material. It could also be the case that individuals
                    who know that they will benefit more from the course are more likely to attend
                    in the first place.
                         The treatment randomization was stratified by gender, being a client of our
                    partner institution, and having a bachelor’s degree. We can thus examine the
                    effect of the training on these groups of people separately by adding an interac-
                    tion term between the treatment group dummy (TrainingInvitei,s,m ) and a dummy
                    variable indicating whether the individual was female, a client of our partner insti-
                    tution, or had a bachelor’s degree, to equation 7.2.
                         Table 7.9 reports the heterogeneous treatment effect regression, using all
                    indexes from tables 7.4 through 7.8 as the outcome variables. We do not study
                    the index components here to minimize multiple hypothesis testing. The results
                    in panel A show that the course had a similar impact on clients of our partner

financial institution and on clients of other institutions. The positive effect on
financial knowledge and on savings outcomes is not statistically different across
these two groups. Panel B similarly shows no statistically significant differences
in treatment effects by gender.
     The only indication of heterogeneity in impacts is found in panel C, which
shows that individuals with a bachelor’s degree are more likely to improve savings
behavior and retirement savings behavior than individuals without this education
level. Since the take-up rates for training were also higher for the more educated,
this could just reflect the fact that this group was more likely to attend training.

              We therefore estimate local average treatment effect impacts by education level
              to see whether the effect of actually receiving training varies with education
              status. We find that receiving training had a larger effect on individuals with a
              bachelor’s degree for both the savings behavior and retirement savings behavior
              index (although the heterogeneous treatment effect on savings behavior is only
              statistically significant at the 10.4 percent level).

                           outcomes with administrative data
              Our partner financial institution provided monthly data on savings and credit card
              outcomes at the treatment and control group level for the 470 clients found in
              their database, from December 2010 through May 2011. These data cover several
              pre-intervention months, since we started inviting clients to the financial literacy
              course in August 2011. It also overlaps with the follow-up survey, which was
              conducted between February and July 2012.
                   Figures 7.2 to 7.4 plot the administrative data for the treatment and control
              groups over time. Figure 7.2 shows that the median savings account balance in
              the treatment and control groups followed a more or less parallel trend before
              our intervention started in August 2011. In October 2011, the savings balance
              starts rising in the treatment group, going from about Mex$900 in September
              2011 to Mex$1,600 in December 2011, while the savings balance in the control
              group stays relatively constant. After January 2011, the savings balance in the
              treatment group starts falling again and goes back to its original level in April
              2012. Although the aggregate data do not allow us to conduct a test of statistical

significance in the difference of medians, the observed pattern is consistent with
the course having a positive effect on savings account balances. However, this
effect appears to be temporary.
      Figures 7.3 and 7.4 display median credit card balances and average
percentage of credit card debt paid off each month, respectively. The treatment
and control group values follow a similar pattern throughout the period, indicating
no impact of the course on credit card balances or debt paid off each month.

                  Overall, the patterns in the administrative data are consistent with the
              follow-up survey results. The course seems to have had no effect on credit card
              behavior or outcomes, but it led to a small increase in savings. The administra-
              tive data suggest that this increase was temporary and dissipated within a few
              months.



              7.7	       CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS
              Despite the popularity of financial literacy workshops among policy makers and
              financial institutions, voluntary participation rates are typically very low for these
              programs. Working with a half-day-long training course in Mexico City that aims to
              teach participants the importance of savings and responsible debt and credit card
              use, we use randomized experiments to investigate the lack of demand.
                  We find very little interest in participating in financial education among
              samples of financial institution clients and Facebook users. Screening our sample
              to focus on those individuals who express interest in attending training, we
              find the majority of them also do not attend. Experiments to increase take-up
              suggest that this low participation rate is not mainly due to high discount rates,
              time inconsistency, or lack of information, but rather appears to be due to indi-
              viduals thinking that the benefits of such training are not high enough. Mone-
              tary incentives that increase the benefits lead to more attendance. A follow-up
              survey conducted about six months after the course enabled us to measure just
              what these benefits are. We find participating in the course leads to increases
              in financial knowledge and savings, but this increase in savings appears to dissi-
              pate quickly, and there is no evidence that the training changed credit card usage
              or borrowing behavior. The lack of interest in training therefore appears to be a
              rational choice, since users see relatively little benefit from it.
                  One natural response to the modest impacts of training measured here
              is to note that the training is only a few hours long, and to thus argue that
              much longer and intensive training sessions are needed to really affect financial
              behavior. However, our study shows that most of the general population has
              very little interest in attending even a short financial literacy course, and that it
              is very difficult to even get individuals who state they are interested in partici-
              pating to show up and attend. Monetary incentives did help boost attendance,
              but even an immediate payment of US$72 motivated less than 40 percent of
              people who had expressed interest in a financial literacy program to attend.
              Longer and more intensive programs would appear likely to have even more
              trouble attracting participants. Moreover, Kim, Garman, and Sorhaindo (2003)
              provide an example suggesting that even 18 months of adult credit counseling
              has not been effective.
                  We caution that our study measures local treatment effects, showing
              the effect of training for people who are induced to attend as a result of our
                                    7.  Why is voluntary financial education so unpopular?  ◾ 243




interventions, but who would not attend it without the information, logistical
support, and incentives we provided. It seems plausible that the impacts for
these individuals who have self-selected into not attending a program that is
available to anyone who wants to participate will have less benefit from such
training than people who choose to attend of their own accord. However, as our
study notes, less than 2 percent of the eligible population voluntarily chooses to
take part in training. Even if the training has large benefits for them, the results of
our study suggest that the benefits of encouraging more people to participate in
such training are likely to be slight. This concurs with recent skepticism about the
value of such training (Economist 2013; Willis 2011).
    Finally, we note two issues with the increasing focus of financial institu-
tions and policy makers on extending financial education to the masses through
general multipurpose financial literacy courses. First, the classroom setting for
the provision of financial education may not be appealing to the general public.
We find higher take-up rates among the population of bachelor graduates who
may be more comfortable in such a setting, or may be better at digesting informa-
tion provided through this channel. Alternative methods to educate the general
public should be tested. For example, Berg and Zia in chapter 11 of this volume
provide evidence of an increase in financial knowledge and reductions in certain
types of borrowing following financial education taught through a soap opera in
South Africa. Second, the variety of topics covered in the course conflicts some-
what with the idea that some concepts are best taught at teachable moments.
Workshops about pension savings provided to workers at the time of making
their pension savings allocations, or to college students or young graduates when
they receive their first credit card, may be more effective in influencing these
outcomes. In contrast to credit and retirement savings, there is less of an obvious
teachable moment for education about savings. Indeed, since individuals make
spending and savings decisions on a very regular basis, it could be argued that
general financial literacy courses are likely to work better for this topic since
individuals have the ability to quickly translate the concepts learned into prac-
tice. This might help explain why we find impacts (albeit transitory ones) only on
savings outcomes in our study, and be consistent with the savings impacts of
financial education programs taught in schools.

Evidence from an audit study in Mexico

ABSTRACT
    We conduct an audit study in peri-urban Mexico to understand the quality
    of information and products offered to potential low-income customers.
    Trained auditors visited multiple financial institutions seeking credit and
    savings products. Consistent with Gabaix and Laibson (2006), staff provide
    little information about avoidable fees, especially to auditors trained to
    reveal little experience with the market. In addition, clients are almost never
    offered the cheapest product, most likely because staff are incentivized to
    offer more expensive products that are thus more profitable to the institu-
    tion. This suggests that disclosure and transparency policies may be ineffec-
    tive if they undermine the commercial interest of financial institutions.




8.1	INTRODUCTION
Many financial decisions are made infrequently and without immediate
feedback that can be used to improve decision making (Thaler and Sunstein
2008). In addition, these decisions may involve unfamiliar concepts, espe-
cially to individuals with limited financial capabilities (Lusardi and Mitchell

              2006). In a series of focus groups carried out as part of this research with low- to
              middle-income consumers in the Mexico City greater metropolitan area, many
              savers were not aware of various key terms of their accounts; those who were
              had only become aware of them when these had already negatively affected their
              account. Similarly, most borrowers did not understand key product terms of their
              consumer loans, such as total annual cost, and were unaware of possible fees for
              early and late payment of installments.
                   This suggests, as evidenced in a burgeoning literature, that financial
              consumers do not necessarily choose the most cost-effective product or the
              one most suitable to their needs (see, e.g., Agarwal et al. 2013; Campbell et al.
              2011; Choi, Laibson, and Madrian 2011; DellaVigna 2009; Duarte and Hastings
              2011; Gross and Souleles 2002; and Hastings, Hortaçsu, and Syverson 2012 for
              reviews). Agarwal et al. (2013) find that if feedback is fast enough, then financial
              learning can occur, albeit the hard way: credit card fees paid by new cardholders
              fall during the first three years after account opening because, after paying a fee,
              consumers adjusted their behavior to avoid paying it in the future.
                   More generally, mistakes in financial decision making would be less of
              a concern if market forces led to a set of relatively cheap financial products.
              However, this is rarely the case. Table 8.1 reports summary statistics for all credit
              and savings products offered by the 26 institutions that were part of the study
              targeted to low-income households. The total annual cost of a Mex$10,000 loan
              (US$748) ranges from 3.48 percent to 58.53 percent. The total annual yield for
              savings products with an initial deposit of Mex$5,000 (US$374) exhibits a similar
              pattern. The yield ranges from −31.80 percent to 6.17 percent for an investment
              account and from −100 percent to 5.12 percent for a checking account.
                   This lack of transparency and high-cost environment are the result of a market
              failure created by the information asymmetry between less informed customers
              and better informed financial institutions and the misalignment of their incen-
              tives. Many governments around the world have tried to reduce the information
              asymmetry by introducing legislation to improve disclosure and transparency; in
              some cases, they have mandated that low-cost savings products be offered in
              the marketplace or have imposed usury laws capping the interest rate that can
              be charged on credit products. For example, in 2009 Mexico enacted the Law for
              Transparency and Regulation of Financial Services, which requires that consumers
              be presented with key financial terms for both savings and credit products, and
              standardizes calculation of certain key product terms and disclosure formats. In
              addition, as part of the Law on Credit Institutions of 2007 the Bank of Mexico
              requires that all deposit-taking institutions offer a basic account without account
              opening, deposit, withdrawal, balance inquiry, or debit card fees.1



               Table 8.1 also reports the summary statistics for mandated basic savings accounts offered
              1 


              by the institutions in the study. As expected, the mean in annualized yield is higher and
                                                                   8.  Financial (dis-)information  ◾ 249




    It remains unclear if these efforts have been successful in improving the
financial outcomes of the population (Lowenstein, Sunstein, and Golman 2013).
Indeed, the reason consumers may remain misinformed and prone to making
mistakes is because financial institutions shroud prices, even in competitive envi-
ronments, in order to maximize profits (Ausubel 1999; Gabaix and Laibson 2006).
Firms will therefore adjust their behavior to undermine transparency initiatives
(Duarte and Hastings 2011) and may not put much effort in marketing mandated
products.
    This discussion brings to the fore two interrelated questions that are the focus
of this chapter. First, what is the quality of information provided by financial
institutions to low-income customers when choosing among credit and savings
products? Second, do financial institutions offer the product that best meets
the customer needs, in particular as it relates to cost and intended usage?
    To answer these questions, we implemented an audit study in peri-urban
areas near Mexico City. Auditors visited the branches of financial institutions
seeking to acquire a loan or a savings product. Since the goal was to capture
all the information given to the auditor until the product was contracted (or the
auditor was rejected), several follow-up visits were required, especially for credit
auditors. Credit auditors therefore had to be local residents in each study area,
since follow-up visits at the house were common. For these reasons, instead of
using professional auditors, we recruited and trained credit auditors from the
street.
    The scripts used by auditors were designed in collaboration with Mexico’s
National Commission for the Protection of Users of Financial Services (CONDUSEF
[Comisión Nacional para la Protección y Defensa de los Usuarios de Servicios
Financieros]) and differed along four dimensions. First, we introduced variation
specific to the product sought. Savings auditors expressed a preference for either
a checking account or an investment account where funds would be deposited
for a minimum duration of one year. Credit auditors requested a loan amount of
either 20 percent or 70 percent of their household’s annual income, thus creating
exogenous variation in the level of household indebtedness. Second, we varied
the financial sophistication of the auditor made salient by the language used and
the level of engagement during the visits. Third, we varied the level of competition
among sophisticated auditors by stating that a competing institution had offered
them better terms. Finally, we created variation in the dress code used during
the visit. Each auditor was given a randomized list of branches to visit and was
randomly assigned to a script.
    The model of Gabaix and Laibson (2006) provides a useful framework to
understand the results from the audits. In the presence of enough uninformed



variation is lower than that of checking accounts, and they do not vary by whether avoidable
fees are included or not, since most of the basic accounts do not charge avoidable fees.

              customers, their model predicts that firms in equilibrium will fail to advertise
              certain fees and commissions that uninformed customers will end up paying and
              informed customers will try to avoid. Thus, advertising will be deceptive rather
              than informative; in fact, firms will have no incentive to de-bias customers.2
                   Consistent with these predictions, we find that the staff provided enough
              information to allow auditors to apply for the loan or to open the savings account,
              but that very little information about avoidable fees and commissions was
              provided to neophyte auditors. In addition, the printed materials given to auditors
              of all profile types contained too little information to be useful for comparisons
              across products.
                   Relatedly, while savings auditors were offered products that matched their
              preference for maturity, they were never offered the cheapest product that the
              institution could offer. The mandated basic account was only offered in 2 of the
              54 visits in which the auditor expressed a preference for a checking account.
              By contrast, when faced with credit auditors requesting large amounts, finan-
              cial institutions demonstrated ability to assess borrowers’ capacity to pay both
              by being more likely to reject their loan application and by reducing the amount
              granted if the application was finally approved.
                   Thus, firms seem to behave rationally by following their own self-interest,
              which may explain why the recent policy initiatives around product transparency
              and basic savings accounts have met with little success. The fact that finan-
              cial institutions will resist transparency initiatives and mandated products with
              low-cost designs is not new; in this sense, the chapter contributes to the recent
              literature that uses audit studies to assess financial advice for financial invest-
              ment (Mullainathan, Nöth, and Schoar 2010) and life insurance (Anagol, Cole, and
              Sarkar 2012).
                   The remainder of the chapter is organized as follows. Section 8.2 describes
              the financial market for low-income households in Mexico. Section 8.3 reviews the
              predictions of Gabaix and Laibson (2006). Section 8.4 describes the experimental
              design, while section 8.5 describes the data and empirical strategy. Section 8.6
              reports the results, and section 8.7 concludes.




               We note that if consumers were rational, then shrouding would actually hurt the finan-
              2 


              cial institutions, as consumers faced with impartial disclosure of fees and commissions
              would assume they are high and purchase from banks that disclose more information.
              Shrouding behavior by banks would thus unravel, forcing banks to disclose all the infor-
              mation (Grossman 1981; Jovanovic 1982; Milgrom 1981). There is evidence suggesting that
              consumers tend to ignore not only information that is not disclosed (see Nisbett and Ross
              1980 for an early review), but also disclosed information that is not made salient (Chetty,
              Looney, and Kroft 2009; Finkelstein 2009).

8.2	CONTEXT
Financial markets in Mexico have recently been transformed by the appearance
of new providers such as the consumer goods chains Elektra, Walmart, and
Coppel, and new intermediation channels such as agent and mobile banking. This
increase in the supply of financial services has coincided with a rapid expan-
sion of household debt to gross domestic product from 8.7 percent in 2000 to
14.3 percent in 2011, with a recent study estimating debt service at 35 percent of
household income (López Bolaños 2012). Among the components of household
debt, consumer debt has been a key driver of this increase, rising from 7.7 percent
in 1994 as a share of banking sector debt to 23 percent in 2011.3
     Consumer credit in 2011 represented 40 percent of all bank earnings in
interest, commissions, and annual fees. Much of this growth in consumer credit
comes from bringing low-income individuals into the formal financial system for
the first time. These individuals tend to have lower levels of education and may
thus be worse equipped when deciding among financial products (Lusardi and
Mitchell 2011).
     According to the 2008 Mexican Income and Expenditure Survey (ENIGH),
42 percent of households making a credit card payment had a head of household
with less than high school education, and one in six had only primary educa-
tion or less. The irregular (and sometimes unpredictable) income flows of many
low-income individuals suggest that more flexible credit and savings products
will be more suitable than others with stiff penalties for missed or partial install-
ment payments or high minimum balance fees. In addition, products offered to
low-income households tend to be relatively more expensive because they entail
either smaller loan amounts or smaller savings balances that are more expensive
to administer.4 For all these reasons, this study focuses on consumer credit and
savings products targeted to low-income households.
     Savings and credit products in Mexico are offered by a range of financial
institutions, including the new players that have a particular focus on low- and
middle-income Mexicans. These include banks established by large retail chains,
such as Banco Walmart, Banco Azteca (part of the Elektra Group, affiliated with
the Elektra retail chain), Banco Coppel, and Banco Ahorro Famsa; as well as
credit providers that have recently obtained banking licenses, such as Banco

   According to a series of focus groups we conducted at the time of the study, low-income
households mainly use credit to either finance an emergency or a durable asset.

 Using CONDUSEF’s online calculator, we find a total annual cost for a 12-month loan
4 


of Mex$100,000 ranges from 19.3 percent to 154.4 percent; the total annual cost for a
12-month loan of Mex$10,000 ranges from 22.6 percent to 190.1 percent. Source: http://e-

              Compartamos. Besides these banks, the commercial banking sector also includes
              traditional banks such as HSBC, Banorte, Bancomer, and Banamex.
                   Cooperative societies (SCAPs [sociedades cooperativas de ahorro y prés-
              tamo] or cajas de ahorro) are nonprofit, cooperative-based institutions that offer
              both credit and savings services. Popular financial societies (SOFIPOs [sociedades
              financieras populares]) also offer both credit and savings products, typically
              serving low-income consumer segments; unlike SCAPs, they are not considered
              nonprofit institutions. Multipurpose societies (SOFOMEs [sociedades financieras
              de objeto múltiple]) only offer credit products, as they are not permitted to collect
              deposits.5 SOFOMEs were nevertheless included in the savings audit to verify that
              they were indeed not accepting deposits.6
                   Institutions that offer savings products include banks, SCAPs, and SOFIPOs.
              All of these institutions offer both checking and fixed-term accounts with an initial
              deposit as low as Mex$1.
                   Despite the diversity in institutions offering financial services, there are two
              related indications that the market is not competitive: lack of product information
              made available to the consumer, and high cost of credit and savings products.
                   Focus groups conducted with low-income clients recruited from the study
              areas around the time of the audit study revealed that terms advertised in
              marketing materials and communicated by sales representatives did not accu-
              rately reflect the actual costs of the credit products they selected, making it hard
              to assess the true cost of a product before signing the contract. In addition, few
              of the participants understood the concepts of total annual cost and total annual
              earnings, and therefore did not use these terms in their decision to purchase
              credit or savings products. Consumers tended to focus instead on the periodic
              payment amounts (such as weekly or monthly installments), but these could lead
              to more expensive choices if the bulk of fees and commissions were not reflected
              in the installment amount. Participants also focused on the peso-value cost of
              the product, which was easier to understand than when the cost was expressed
              in percentages.
                   Similarly, participants cited several cases where they had lost a significant
              fraction of their savings balance due to fees assessed on their accounts that were
              not known at the time when the savings account was opened. The fees respon-
              sible for the reductions in savings balances were mostly avoidable fees such as

                 SOFOMEs are divided between regulated and nonregulated SOFOMEs; the latter do not
              have to report financial information to the National Banking Commission, but must comply
              with consumer protection regulations set forth by CONDUSEF.

               While SOFOMEs accounted for only 1.3 percent of all complaints registered by consumers

              with CONDUSEF in 2011, the number of cases leading to a fine being assessed were nearly
              twice as many for SOFOMEs as for any other provider type, despite their being a relatively
              small share of the market and only offering credit products (CONDUSEF 2012).

     From a policy perspective, mistakes in financial decision making due to limited
information would be less of a concern if all financial products offered were rela-
tively cheap. However, despite the recent entry of new players in the Mexican
market, the cost of financial products in Mexico is relatively high compared to
other countries, and it varies drastically depending on whether the fees just
described are incurred. According to the Banco de México (2013), competition in
consumer credit markets remains low, especially when compared to mortgages
or business loans.
     Table 8.1 reports summary statistics for all credit and savings products that
could have been offered by all 26 financial institutions in the audit study to clients
between June and August 2012, the period in which the study was implemented.
For consumer credit loans, table 8.1 reports the total annual cost of a Mex$10,000
(US$780) loan.7
     For savings products, table 8.1 reports the total annual earnings from a
Mex$5,000 (US$390) deposit in a term account and in a checking account. The
table presents two different costs (or returns) depending on whether avoidable
fees are incurred. The reason for presenting costs and returns this way is that
information (or lack thereof) on avoidable fees is relevant, since behavior can be
adjusted to avoid paying them. For example, a well-informed borrower could have
borrowed from elsewhere to meet the installment payment obligation and avoid a
high late payment fee; while a well-informed saver could have timed the deposits
and withdrawals from the account so as to prevent the balance from falling below
the minimum, thus avoiding the minimum balance fee.
     Thus, when the total cost (and return) includes only fees that must be
incurred to contract the product (i.e., unavoidable fees), the cost refers essen-
tially to the total annual cost and total annual earnings (equivalent to the U.S.
annual percentage rate or annual percentage yield). However, since avoidable
fees are only incurred if the client engages in certain behavior, the reported cost
and returns inclusive of avoidable fees are computed using a hypothetical usage
profile. For credit, we assume that the client misses one payment; for fixed term,
we assume that the client withdraws the money before maturity (at six months);
and for the checking account, we assume that the client maintains an average
balance below the minimum for two months per year. According to table 8.1, the
total cost of credit products offered by the 26 institutions that were included in
the audit study was 24 percent without avoidable fees, and 26 percent if avoidable
fees are also taken into account. Annualized yields for savings products exhibit a

  Since auditors asked for either 20 percent or 70 percent of household income, the average
loan size was Mex$18,388, and the median was Mex$13,500.

Note: S.D. = standard deviation. An observation is a credit or savings product offered by 1 of the 26 institutions in the study. Unavoidable fees include the premium for compulsory unemploy-
ment or life insurance, administrative commissions, credit bureau check and membership fees for credit products, and the opening fee and management fee for savings products; avoidable fees
include a late installment payment for credit products, early withdrawal for investment accounts, and two months of balances below the minimum for checking and basic accounts. Information
on product terms was collected by the National Commission for the Protection of Users of Financial Services (CONDUSEF) between June and August 2012, the period in which the audit visits
were made.
                                                                   8.  Financial (dis-)information  ◾ 255




similar pattern. Investment accounts yield on average 1.01 percent without avoid-
able fees, and 0.39  percent if avoidable fees are included. Checking accounts
have lower (negative) annualized yields of −7.36 percent without avoidable fees,
or −9.10  percent on average if avoidable fees are taken into account. Consid-
ering only government-mandated basic checking accounts, the average yield was
−0.77 percent without any avoidable fees, and −0.86 percent with the avoidable
fees.
     Table 8.1 suggests that small differences in behavior can have large impacts
on the cost or return of a product, especially for credit and checking accounts;
thus, accurate information on overall costs—in particular, avoidable fees—can
save customers sizable amounts. The cost comparisons also demonstrate how,
for most small-balance savers, the government-mandated account is cheaper
than most checking accounts, and actually offers average returns that are only
Mex$89 (approximately US$6.93) lower over a 12-month period without avoidable
fees, and Mex$62 (approximately US$4.83) lower over a 6-month period with the
avoidable fees than the average return of the investment accounts in the sample.
     The Gabaix and Laibson (2006) model to which we now turn can account for
the variation in costs and yields reported in the data. It therefore provides a useful
starting point to study the quality of information about financial products offered
to prospective clients by the staff of financial institutions.



8.3	THEORY
Recasting the example in Gabaix and Laibson (2006), imagine that a bank can
offer a 2 percent deposit rate on a savings account so long as it can also charge
a fee whenever the average monthly balance falls below a certain minimum, to
break even.8 If the fee is not assessed, the institution can only offer a 1 percent
deposit rate. Suppose that there are two types of customers, naïve and sophisti-
cated. Naïve customers are not informed about the minimum balance fee (or do
not understand it) and thus decide which account to open based on the highest
deposit interest rate offered. In contrast, sophisticated customers know about
the fee. Assume further that if customers do not take action, the timing of their
deposits and withdrawals is such that the average balance will fall below the
minimum, thus resulting in the minimum balance fee being assessed by the bank.
Customers can, however, exert some effort to change the timing so that the
balance never falls below the minimum.
     In this setup, banks will market accounts with a 2 percent deposit rate, failing
to mention the minimum balance fee, to attract naïve customers. Given the



8 
  Note that this fee will only be assessed to the subset of customers whose average balance
falls below the minimum. We assume that the bank knows this fraction of customers in the
population and that, given the deposit rate offered, it can calibrate the fee to break even.
256  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              assumptions made, all naïve customers will end up paying the minimum balance
              fee, unaware of it. Sophisticated customers will also be attracted to the 2 percent
              deposit rate, but will never pay the minimum balance fee as they will take action to
              avoid it. Banks will therefore make enough money from naïve customers to cover
              the losses from offering the account to sophisticated consumers: naïve customers
              will cross-subsidize the sophisticated ones. Note that if a bank decided to price
              the savings account more transparently, offering savings accounts at 1 percent
              without the minimum balance fee, no customer would be attracted because
              it offers a lower interest rate. All customers would still demand the 2  percent
                             — naïve customers failing to realize that they will end up paying
              savings account­
              the minimum balance fee, and sophisticated ones realizing that they are better
              off earning 2 percent and avoiding the minimum balance fee altogether.9 The equi-
              librium is thus one in which financial products offered have hidden fees that are
              only taken into account by sophisticated consumers. More formally, the following
              testable implications can be derived:

                   1.	 Banks will not engage in informative marketing. Marketing campaigns, if
                      any, will advertise the deposit rate but not the minimum balance fee for
                      savings. Similarly, marketing campaigns for credit products will not adver-
                      tise the total cost of the credit nor the detailed fees and charges. In other
                      words, campaigns will be mostly persuasive.
                   2.	 Both naïve and sophisticated customers are aware of all basic require-
                      ments, unavoidable fees, and other terms to open an account. For example,
                      all customers know the interest rate earned on deposit products or the
                      interest rate charged on credit products.
                   3.	 Naïve customers are unaware of avoidable fees and commissions such as
                      the minimum balance fee on deposit accounts or the late payment fee on
                      credit products.
                   4.	 Naïve and sophisticated customers are offered the same product, but naïve
                      customers will earn less (if any) interest on savings (or pay more interest for
                      credit) as they also pay fees and commissions.

              In section 8.6, we test these predictions more formally.




               Alternatively, naïve customers could understand the fee structure but be overly optimistic
              9 


              about the chances of their savings balances falling below the minimum. In either case, they
              would prefer the 2 percent account over the 1 percent account offer.

8.4	       EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
The audit study was conducted in collaboration with CONDUSEF, the government
authority established in 1999 responsible for financial consumer protection and
financial education programs.
      Four towns near the greater metropolitan region of Mexico City were selected
with populations ranging from 30,000 to 1.6 million: Amecameca, Cuernavaca,
Ecatepec, and Los Reyes de la Paz. These towns were selected for their high
penetration of financial institutions targeting low- to middle-income consumers,
and for their proportion of low- to middle-income population.10 From the town
center, a radius of 1.5 kilometers was drawn, and every financial institution inside
the circle was included in the study. We found a total of 26 distinct institutions,
of which 13 were banks, 2 were SCAPs, 4 were SOFIPOs, and 7 were SOFOMEs.
For the purposes of the analysis, we group the banks as either commercial banks
(Scotiabank, HSBC, Banorte, Banamex, etc.) or “low-income” banks that target
low-income households (Banco Ahorro Famsa, Bancoppel, Compartamos Banco,
Banco Walmart, and Banco Azteca). Of the low-income banks, all but Banco
Compartamos had their branches located inside the department stores of which
the banks were a subsidiary.
      Credit auditors requested a six-month loan for a household expenditure,
preferably with monthly installments. The expenditures included house repairs,
medical expenses, and children’s school supplies, among others. Savings auditors
were assigned a quantity of Mex$5,000 (US$378) that they wanted to deposit.
      Since we wanted to capture all the information that staff provided to prospec-
tive clients up until the signing of the credit contract or opening of the savings
account, a visit by the auditor was deemed completed when either the institution
refused to open the account or grant the loan or when the auditor was asked to
sign the contract. While most savings auditors needed only one visit to gather
all the information and be offered the chance to open the account, credit audi-
tors needed up to four follow-up visits (with an average of 1.87 visits), some
at their residence, before they were offered the opportunity to sign the credit
contract. Because credit auditors had to reside locally, we could not use profes-
sional auditors. Instead, we recruited 18 auditors from low-income households
(4 or 5 auditors in each town) who were trained by a full-time professional from
a survey firm. There were 7 men and 11 women, with ages ranging from 21 to
53. Education levels were average for the population: 13 had secondary educa-
tion, and 5 had undergraduate education. In terms of income- generation activi-
ties, 7 were self-employed and 11 had a salaried job. Credit auditors made 215
visits, and a total 115 auditor-branch pairs since multiple visits were needed to



  Although there are considerable disparities in access by region and between rural and

urban populations, the towns selected are similar to other peri-urban towns in Mexico.

              complete the loan application process. Savings auditors were professionals from
              the same survey firm, but they all also came from low-income households. Each
              auditor visited roughly seven different institutions in each town and collectively
              carried out a total of 112 visits. Since SOFOMEs cannot take deposits by law, we
              included them in the list of institutions to assess whether they complied with
              the law.11 Credit and savings visits took place between the months of March and
              June 2012. Given that a total of 26 different financial institutions were visited, a
              branch in a given site was always visited by more than one auditor. Each visit was
              recorded with a hidden digital recorder; after each visit, the auditor was required
              to complete a questionnaire that was validated with the audio recording.
                    Immediately after recruitment, auditors were randomized into savings and
              credit scripts. To minimize confusion among credit auditors, a given auditor was
              assigned and trained on the same script that would be implemented in all of his
              or her visits. Savings auditors were professionals and thus alternated between
              different scripts. Auditors memorized the script(s) and used a uniform language
              when asking about the products. During the training, the auditors and manager
              were never told about the purpose of the study nor the specific hypotheses we
              wanted to test.
                    The scripts varied along three dimensions: financial sophistication or literacy,
              the degree of perceived competition, and the dress code used in the visit.

                    ◾◾ Financial literacy. Auditors were assigned to be either experienced or
                      neophyte. Experienced auditors were trained to mention at the outset of
                      the visit that they were shopping around for the best product and that
                      they had reviewed product offers from other institutions. During the visit,
                      they had to demonstrate knowledge of certain terms; if the staff did not
                      voluntarily provide certain product information, they had to ask for it. For
                      savings products, they had to ask for the minimum balance required to
                      open the account, interest rate, total annual earnings, fees and commis-
                      sions, and whether there was a linked debit card. For credit products, the
                      experienced auditor had to ask about the total loan amount, total amount
                      received, the term of the loan, the frequency and amount of each install-
                      ment, other costs and fees, the interest rate, total annual cost, and the
                      time lag for approval and disbursement.
                    	 Neophyte auditors did not mention that they were shopping around nor
                      that they had received other product offers.
                    	 In sum, experienced shoppers explicitly asked for avoidable fees and
                      commissions if the staff did not provide information voluntarily, while
                      neophyte auditors did not. The reason for this treatment was to assess



              11 
                 The law regulating SOFOMEs is the Ley General de Organizaciones y Actividades Auxi-
              liares de Crédito, National Banking Commission of Mexico.
                                                                    8.  Financial (dis-)information  ◾ 259




        the amount of information provided by the staff either voluntarily or when
        prompted.
      ◾◾ Competition. Among experienced auditors, half mentioned that they were
        offered a lower interest rate in another institution, while the other half
        mentioned that they were offered a higher interest rate while shopping
        around at other institutions. The goal of this treatment was to assess the
        degree of flexibility of the staff in offering product terms that could match
        the competition.
      ◾◾ Dress code. Auditors were also instructed to alternate the way they
        dressed for each branch. In half of the branches that each shopper visited,
        he or she would dress formally (the attire for a special event or church); for
        the rest, he or she would dress informally. Since credit auditors could have
        follow-up visits to the same branch, they were instructed to dress formally
        or informally for all the visits to that particular branch.12

      In addition, scripts differed in a product-based variation related to the savings
needs or level of overindebtedness:

      ◾◾ Specific savings needs. Savings auditors wanted to make a deposit for
        either one full year, indicating a preference for an investment product;
        or to make frequent transactions, indicating a preference for a checking
        account.
      ◾◾ Overindebtedness. Credit auditors were assigned a loan amount resulting
        in a total household level of indebtedness of either 20 percent (low indebt-
        edness) or 70 percent (high indebtedness). This treatment amounted to
        loan sizes that ranged from Mex$1,000 to Mex$55,000. Auditors assigned
        to the high indebtedness script asked on average for Mex$10,350 more
        (US$774), an amount that is statistically significant at the 1 percent level.
        The reason for this treatment was to assess whether credit officers reduced
        the loan amount approved or whether they fudged the income numbers in
        the application to approve the loan (Berg, Puri, and Rocholl 2013).

      The combination of these variations resulted in six different scripts for credit
and savings auditors.13




  Although most shoppers followed this instruction, there are 13 cases in credit where the

For these cases, in the analysis we used the dressing profile treatment followed in the first
visit.

              8.5	        DATA AND EMPIRICAL STRATEGY
              We use data from three different sources:

                  ◾◾ Questionnaire. The questionnaire filled out by auditors after each visit
                     covers various aspects of the visit, including the length of the visit, the
                     products offered and their features, and the quality of service provided.
                  ◾◾ Printed materials. The printed materials the staff provided to the auditor
                     consist of either leaflets about the product or, less frequently, personal-
                     ized amortization tables when credit was requested. For credit, out of the
                     54 printed materials given to the auditors, 49 were advertisements and
                     generic leaflets; only 5 were personalized amortization tables.
                  ◾◾ CONDUSEF data set. This includes the terms of all the savings and credit
                     products offered by the institutions at the time of the study. Many of the
                     terms were not available online and had to be requested directly from
                     the institution. The data set only includes credit products with loan sizes
                     in the range requested by the auditors and savings products that can be
                     contracted with an initial deposit of Mex$5,000. These data were used to
                     generate table 8.1 and to match the products that were actually offered to
                     the auditors to compare their cost against the rest of products offered by
                     the institution.

                  We use data from the questionnaire, printed materials, and CONDUSEF to
              construct variables related to the amount of information provided by the institu-
              tions. We divide the information into the following categories: legal requirements
              to open the account or take out the loan, terms of the account, and fees and
              commissions—most of which are avoidable, as they are only assessed depending
              on usage. The items of information the staff could provide for each category vary
              by product.
                  For savings products, legal requirement items include the need to show an
              official identification number and an address certificate. The terms of account
              items include whether the client needs to be a member of the institution to open
              an account, the minimum balance required to open an account, maturity of the
              account, whether a debit card is provided, the interest rate offered and whether
              it is fixed or variable, total annual earnings, deposit insurance tax, and tax on
              earnings.



              for savings auditors are similar, replacing high indebtedness with preference for invest-
              ment account and low indebtedness with preference for checking account. As mentioned,
              each credit auditor was assigned one script, while savings auditors were assigned as either
              experienced or neophyte, and to have a preference for either an investment account or a
              checking account; if they were assigned the experienced profile, they alternated between
              high and low competition scripts.
                                                                 8.  Financial (dis-)information  ◾ 261




      Fees and commissions include fee if the average balance falls below the
minimum balance, inactivity fee, early withdrawal fee for investment accounts,
withdrawal fee, balance inquiry fee, and debit card reposition fees. In sum,
the legal requirements and the terms of the account include requirements and
unavoidable costs to open the account, while fees and commissions are addi-
tional costs that can be avoided through usage behavior.
      For credit products, the legal requirements additionally include an income
certificate. The terms of the account include the need to be a member/client
of the institution, save before acquiring a loan, have a checking account in the
institution, amount lent, amount disbursed, total amount due, amount of each
installment, value added tax, interest rate and whether it is fixed or variable, total
annual cost, maturity, frequency of payments, and number of installments. The
fees and commissions include premium for unemployment and/or life insurance,
administrative commissions, cost of the credit bureau check, membership fee,
early payment fee, late payment fee, and fee for payment of installments in other
branches or institutions. Similar to the savings categories, the legal requirements
and terms of the account include requirements and unavoidable costs to obtain
the loan, while fees and commissions are additional costs that can mostly be
avoided through usage behavior.
      There are therefore up to 16 items of information for savings products and
23 items for credit products we measured that could potentially be provided to
auditors by sales staff. Clearly, not all are equally relevant or important. For this
reason, we construct two sets of measures for each product offered. The first
simply involves counting the items of information in each category. For example,
if the staff mentioned that a savings auditor needed to show an official identifica-
tion number and an address certificate, the variable would take the value 2 (for
the possible two items).
      Because certain items of information may be irrelevant if they are not required
or do not apply, we also construct a set of variables that reflect the percentage
of items of information that are present in the product offered by the staff. The
numerator in this variable is the number of items mentioned (among those that
are present in the product), and the denominator is the number of items either
required or that apply. For example, if a product has a withdrawal fee, then the
item will be included in the denominator for the fees and commission category
and will appear in the numerator if the staff mentioned the fee.14
      In addition to the information provided, we assess the cost of the product
offered and compare it to similar products offered by the institution and the
market. As with the costs reported in table 8.1, we compute the total costs and
earnings with unavoidable fees only, using the formulas for total annual cost and



  In this example, if there was no withdrawal fee, it would not appear in the numerator or
14 


denominator, although the staff could have mentioned that such a fee was not assessed.
262  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              total annual earnings, and the total costs including the most commonly assessed
              avoidable fees. In particular, we assume that credit clients will miss one payment
              and will thus be assessed a late payment fee and that savings clients will either
              withdraw early for those contracting an investment account or will maintain a
              balance for two months below the minimum.15 Because the assignment of scripts
              to auditors was random, we can run the following ordinary least squares regres-
              sion for savings visits:

              	                  yij = β1HLi * HIi + β2HLi * LIi + β3 INVi + β4 Fi + Lj + εij	(8.1)

              where yij is the outcome of interest for auditor i visiting institution j, HLi is an
              indicator for high literacy, HIi is an indicator for high interest rate (high compe-
              tition), and LIi is an indicator for low interest rate (low competition). In addition,
              INVi is a dummy that takes the value of 1 if the auditor has a preference for an
              investment account or fixed-term deposit (0 if savings/checking account), and
              the dummy Fi takes the value of 1 if the auditor was dressed formally during the
              visit. The variable εij is a mean zero error term. The regression specification also
              includes dummies for each type of financial institution (Lj). Robust standard errors
              are included.16
                    For credit auditor-branch pairs, a similar specification is used. Note that if the
              pair involved more than one visit, the outcomes are aggregated up to the pair level.
                    We include a dummy that takes the value of 1 if the auditor asked for a loan
              representing 70 percent of household income (0 for a loan representing 20 percent
              of household income). In this specification, we include a vector of auditor char-
              acteristics, because given the relatively small number of credit auditors, there
              are some imbalances in the characteristics of auditors assigned to the different
              scripts. As the table in the annex to this chapter shows, there is balance in the
              assignment of the financial literacy profile (experienced and neophyte) with high
              and low competition ( p-value of an F-test that all auditor characteristics included
              are jointly zero is .42 and .97, respectively), but not in the indebtedness profile
              ( p-value of the F-test that all variables are jointly zero is 0.01). Overindebted audi-
              tors tend to be older women with a regular salary and to be more likely to have
              an outstanding loan. As a result, we include as controls the variables that cause
              the imbalance—namely, gender, age, whether the auditor is self-employed, and
              whether he or she is currently a borrower (Bruhn and McKenzie 2009). We there-
              fore run the following specification:



              15 
                  These usage profiles come from discussions with CONDUSEF and focus groups about
              the average behavior of low-income consumers with personal credit products and savings
              accounts.

                Notice that other auditor individual characteristics were not included as controls
              16 


              because, with only four auditors, some of these characteristics were near collinear with
              the treatment assigned.
                                                                  8.  Financial (dis-)information  ◾ 263




	                   yij = β1HLi * HIi + β2HLi * LIi + β3 HDi + β4 Fi + Lj + Xi + εij	(8.2)

     In this specification, the indicator for high interest rate HIi (low interest rate
LIi) denotes low (high) competition because a credit at lower cost is more attrac-
tive. As before, the regression also includes dummies for each type of financial
institution (Lj).



8.6	        EMPIRICAL RESULTS
This section presents the results. Columns 1 and 2 of table 8.2a report, respec-
tively, the average waiting time and the interview time or face-to-face time of
savings auditors with the staff. For auditors dressed informally with low experi-
ence and a preference for a checking account (dubbed “control” auditors because
all treatment dummies take value zero), each visit lasted on average 18.5 minutes,
including 10.2 minutes of face-to-face interaction with the staff. Auditors visiting
commercial banks had to wait on average 18.5 minutes, while the wait time
in the other institutions was approximately 7 minutes. Commercial banks and
SOFIPOs had the shortest face-to-face time (approximately 11.5 minutes), while
low-income banks and SCAPs had longer interview times (14.5 and 25 minutes,
respectively). Experienced auditors reported significantly longer interview times
relative to neophyte auditors by 6.3 and 8.3 minutes, depending on the interest
rate quoted from other institutions. This difference is, however, not significant,
suggesting that the extent of competition does not affect how long staff spends
with the auditor. We also do not find differences in interview time between audi-
tors seeking an investment account compared to those interested in a checking
account. Column 3 reports the number of different savings products offered by
the staff. Commercial banks and SOFIPOs offered the least number of products.
Similarly, auditors seeking an investment account are offered fewer products,
simply because the institutions have less distinct investment products. According
to the CONDUSEF data set, of the 125 savings products, only 35 percent are
investment products. Experienced auditors are not provided with more choices.
     We note that the number of observations drops from 112 to 107 because
all the auditors who were assigned to visit SOFOMEs were turned away empty
handed, suggesting that SOFOMEs do comply with the law. Interestingly, while in
92 percent of the visits, the auditor was offered a product that aligned with his
or her preferences (column 4), in only 2 of the 54 visits where auditors sought a
checking account did the staff offer the mandated basic account. In sum, expe-
rienced auditors spent more time with the staff, but were not offered more or
cheaper products.
     Table 8.2b reports similar results to those of table 8.2a for credit audits.
Since an observation is now an auditor-branch pair that may involve more than
one visit, columns 1 and 2 report the sum of each visit’s length in minutes. For
control auditors, now defined as informally dressed, with low experience and low

indebtedness, the average wait time was around 6 minutes and the total time
in face-to-face interactions throughout all visits was 33.1 minutes. Similar to the
savings audits, experienced auditors had more face-to-face time with the staff,
especially for those who mentioned a higher interest rate offer from another insti-
tution.17 Using nonexperimental variation, we find that shoppers with an under-
graduate degree have about 10 more minutes of face-to-face interaction with
the staff. Again, commercial banks had more wait time and less interview time
compared to the rest of the institutions.
      Column 3 reports the number of visits in each auditor-branch pair. Control
auditors had on average 2.2 visits, 0.6 of which were at home or at the place of
business. None of the treatment conditions affect the number of visits, although
auditors in commercial banks had significantly less visits. Auditors with a busi-
ness, however, had on average 0.46 more visits—perhaps to verify that the
business did exist and that the income reported could be generated from its reve-
nues. In column 4, we report the probability that the loan application was rejected
by the lender. On average, 70 percent of the loan applications were rejected.
Interestingly, auditors with the high indebtedness profile—that is, auditors who
requested amounts that brought household indebtedness up to 70 percent of
household income—were 47 percent more likely to be rejected. This is particu-
larly true for the commercial banks compared to the rest of the institutions. Using
nonexperimental variation, we find that female and educated auditors as well as
those with a loan were less likely to be rejected, while auditors with a business
were more likely to be rejected. In addition, among auditors who were offered a
loan amount, those with the high indebtedness profile were approved amounts
significantly smaller than those requested (column 5).18
      Commercial banks did provide, on average, larger loan sizes compared to
other institutions. Thus, it seems banks are willing to give larger loans, but may
have more stringent approval processes. In sum, lenders seem to adjust their
approval decisions and loan amounts rationally in response to the risk profile of
prospective clients to mitigate their exposure.
      In tables 8.3a and 8.3b, we explore whether the information provided to audi-
tors conforms to the predictions of the Gabaix and Laibson (2006) model reviewed
in section 8.2.



  It is not clear a priori whether the extent of competition should play a role in the length
17 


of the interview because, when faced with an auditor who has an alternative offer with a
higher interest rate, say, the staff could spend more (or less) time convincing the auditor
about the better product offered in the institution.

  The number of observations drops from 115 to 88 because 27 loan applications were
18 


rejected without an amount being offered. Among the 88 loan offers, 54 were ultimately
rejected. Results from the regression in column 5 using the 34 loans that were approved are
similar to those reported, except that experienced auditors with the low interest rate (high
competition) script were offered larger loans.

Note: Robust standard errors in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respec-
tively. All regressions include a dummy for each type of financial institution (commercial bank, low-income bank,
SOFOME, and SOFIPO) and the following auditor characteristics: gender, age, whether the auditor is self-employed and
whether he or she is currently a borrower. Control auditors were assigned the script with low experience (neophyte), a
preference for a loan size of 20% of household income, and were dressed informally.

    Column 1 of table 8.3a reports the number of printed materials (generic leaf-
lets or personalized information) that auditors were given by staff. The average
number of materials among control savings auditors was less than one. In fact,
only about 67 percent of auditors were given any material, and among those who
were, the mode was one leaflet. Perhaps more interesting, column 2 confirms
hypothesis 1 in section 8.2, which states that financial institutions do not engage
in informative marketing. Indeed, the printed materials from the institutions do
not provide factual and detailed information to help customers choose among
different financial products. An example of one such printed material for a credit
product is shown in figure 8.1. Column 2 of table 8.3a reports that printed mate-
rials contained one item of information (out of 17 items in total as described
above). While experienced auditors received materials with an additional two
items, especially if they reported an alternative inferior interest rate offer, the
average level of information that printed materials provide is very low and certainly
insufficient to make informed decisions about the suitability and cost of financial
products. Columns 1 and 2 of table 8.3b echo the results of table 8.3a for credit
audits. In only 30 percent of the credit audits (22 out of 88) did auditors receive
any printed material. While experienced auditors received 2 or 3.4 more items of
information (depending on the interest rate mentioned) than neophyte auditors
who only received 1.5 items, in neither case is the information received sufficient
for making informed decisions. We note that by law all printed materials must

              contain the total annual earnings or total annual cost, as the examples in figure
              8.1 show. The formulas for computing the total annual earnings and total annual
              cost, however, do not take into account avoidable fees and commissions—which
              can be relevant when choosing the cheapest product. In addition, the total annual
              cost and total annual earnings are never made salient, as they are typically buried
              in a paragraph with other disclosures printed in small type.
                  Columns 3–6 in tables 8.3a and 8.3b test hypotheses 2 and 3 of section 8.2,
              stating that all auditors should be equally informed about the requirements and
              unavoidable costs in opening a savings account or contracting a loan and that
              only experienced auditors would be aware of avoidable costs. Column 3 reports
              all information items in one aggregate variable called “Total information,” while
              columns 4–6 separate the information provided by the staff into the categories
              discussed in the previous section: legal requirements (column 4), terms of the
              account (column 5), and fees and commissions (column 6).
                  According to column 4 in table 8.3a, staff provided oral information to control
              auditors on 7.1 of 22 items (1.5 legal requirements, 4.6 term items, and 1 fee
              item). Experienced auditors were provided on average six more items of informa-
              tion (an increase of 80 percent in number of items). Inspecting columns 4–6, we
              can see that the bulk of the increase comes from fees and commissions, which
              are all avoidable. Indeed, there are no differences among auditors on the legal
              requirements needed to open an account. Control auditors are provided 1.5 of 2
              items of information on average. There are also few differences in the informa-
              tion provided to experienced and neophyte auditors. Neophyte (control) auditors
              receive 4.6 items of information, while experienced auditors receive 1.6 more
              items of information—an increase of only 13.5 percent (column 5). In contrast,
              column 6 reports that neophyte auditors only receive information about one fee
              and commission, while experienced auditors receive information on 4.4 fees and
              commissions—more than a fourfold increase. Table 8.3a thus confirms hypoth-
              eses 2 and 3 because all auditors receive roughly the same information needed
              to open an account, but only experienced auditors learn about the avoidable
              fees and commissions when they ask about them. We note that auditors seeking
              investment products were provided less information on fees simply because
              these products tend to have fewer fees. Also noteworthy is the fact that all insti-
              tutions tend to report the same amount of information.
                  Table 8.3b echoes the results of table 8.3a. Experienced auditors are given
              3.2 and 4.1 more items of information depending on the interest rate quoted
              from a competing institution. This increase in information does not concern legal
              requirements or terms of the account but rather fees and commissions. Indeed,
              control auditors are given information on 0.2 fees and commissions; experienced
              auditors are given information on 2.7 and 2.5 fees and commissions, depending
              on the interest rate quoted. Again, all auditors are provided enough informa-
              tion to be able to apply for the loan, but only experienced auditors are provided
              information about (mostly avoidable) fees and commissions. We also note that
                                                             8.  Financial (dis-)information  ◾ 271




commercial banks tend to give less information to all auditors, probably because
staff is more likely to reject applications and after the rejection no further infor-
mation was provided.
    Columns 1–4 of tables 8.4a and 8.4b complement columns 3–6 of tables
8.3a and 8.3b in that they report the percentage of items in each category that
are relevant for the products offered. Put differently, if, for example, the savings
account offered has only one legal requirement (instead of the maximum two),
four relevant terms instead of the maximum eight, and only fees fees instead of
the maximum six, the percentage of items of information is constructed with the
number of items mentioned by the staff among those in the product. Continuing
with the example, if the staff mentions the legal requirement needed to open
the savings account, then column 2 would record 100 percent; if three out of the
four fees are mentioned, then column 4 would report 75 percent. In computing
these percentages, information provided by the staff about, say, fees that are not
assessed or requirements that are not imposed is ignored.
    Columns 2 and 3 of table 8.4a shows that control auditors are provided most of
the information needed to open an account (70 percent of the legal requirements
and 50 percent of the relevant terms of the account), but are barely provided with
information about avoidable fees and commissions (only 11 percent). In addition,
experienced auditors are provided a threefold increase in information about fees
and commissions (column 4). These two findings again confirm hypotheses 2 and 3.
    Columns 1–4 of table 8.4b are again consistent with the findings in table 8.4a.
Control credit auditors appear to be more informed about the fewer fees and
commissions of credit products than their savings counterparts, but again expe-
rienced credit auditors are more informed about fees and commissions. In fact,
they now learn about all of them.
    Columns 5 and 6 of table 8.4a report the total yield after one year that would
accrue in the savings account under the assumptions of “no usage” (column 5)
and “usage” (column 6). No usage refers to no deposits and withdrawals being
made for one year. In this case, without inactivity fees, the formula to calcu-
late the total yield coincides with the total annual earnings formula. In column 6,
usage refers to the situation where the average balance in the account is below
the minimum allowed for two months.
    Columns 5 and 6 can be used to test hypothesis 4 in section 8.2, namely
that all customers will be offered similar products. Indeed, control auditors are
offered accounts with a small negative total yield, and experienced auditors are
given roughly the same accounts. As expected, auditors with a preference for
investment accounts are offered higher yields, so auditors are offered different
products based on their preference but not based on their financial literacy. When
usage fees are taken into account, it appears that experienced auditors (espe-
cially those who quote a low interest rate) are offered higher-yielding accounts.

              have offered and the product that was actually offered. We see that auditors are
              offered more expensive products, especially those offered checking accounts.
              Staff offered the basic account in only 2 of the 54 visits where a checking account
              was requested.
                    Table 8.4b again echoes the findings of table 8.4a. All auditors are offered
              similar products, and yet there are large differences in the total cost of credit
              once usage costs are included.
                    The last section of the questionnaire included a set of subjective questions
              about the auditor’s perceptions of the service provided by the staff. Table 8.5
              reports these perceptions for the nonprofessional credit auditors.19 In about
              30 percent of the visits, the control auditors thought that the official was kind and
              that the information provided was clear. Interestingly, none of the control audi-
              tors would acquire the product. Experienced auditors provide higher ratings of
              the officer’s performance and would acquire the credit in 19.4 and 28.6 percent,
              depending on the interest rate quoted. Auditors quoting a lower interest rate and
              thus signaling that they had a better offer were more likely to acquire the product,
              although they were not necessarily offered a better product. In addition, auditors
              also perceived that the staff were kinder and were more likely to be willing to
              acquire the product when they dressed formally.



              8.7	CONCLUSIONS
              This study provides evidence of the quality and quantity of information that
              financial institutions provide to potential customers on their savings and credit
              products, as well as the ways in which mismatching of product features and low-
              income consumers’ financial activity profiles can lead these consumers to pay
              higher costs for the financial services they use in their daily lives.
                    Consistent with the predictions of Gabaix and Laibson (2006), this study finds
              that consumers who behave in ways that indicate they have little experience with
              formal financial products are provided enough information to acquire the product
              but very little information about its costs, especially those that relate to avoidable
              fees and commissions. In contrast, experienced auditors who were instructed to
              ask specific questions about the product if the official did not disclose this infor-
              mation voluntarily end up better informed about avoidable fees and commissions.
                    The first key finding then is that voluntary provision of basic product informa-
              tion is exceedingly low. Of course, one should not disclose all terms and conditions
              of the products because too much information may also be ineffective, but at least
              aggregate terms similar to the total annual cost and total annual earnings should

              19 


              number of auditors is small and the fact that they are professional suggests that they may
              be less influenced by the staff.

be adequately disclosed. Despite the fact that the total annual cost and total
annual earnings should by law have been disclosed as they enhance compara-
bility across similar products, in every visit the staff failed to explain their meaning
correctly to experienced auditors who had to ask about them according to their
script. The aggregate key terms to be disclosed should, however, include avoidable
fees, unlike the total annual cost and total annual earnings which do not reflect
them, because they can significantly affect the total yield and cost of products.

                   The second key finding is that staff responded to incentives by limiting the
              offer of basic savings accounts and by rejecting loan applications more frequently
              from overly indebted auditors or by reducing the loan amounts approved. The
              analysis of the average returns and fee structures for savings products in table 8.1
              suggests that traditional checking accounts have a much stronger business case
              for providers than the mandated basic accounts, which limit potential revenue that
              can be earned from savings accounts through both avoidable and unavoidable fees.
                   The findings point to an evident misalignment of incentives between officials
              and potential customers, both in terms of suitability of products to consumers’
              needs, and in willingness and ability of sales staff to disclose key product infor-
              mation. They also demonstrate how disclosure and transparency policies may
              be difficult to implement successfully because financial institutions have strong
              incentives to undo them. Lowenstein, Sunstein, and Golman (2013) argue that
              disclosure policy implemented successfully may have little effect on consumers
              but large effects on financial institutions.
                   This is, however, not the case in Mexico, where financial disclosure policy
              can be improved. For example, since experienced auditors received more product
              information because they were required to ask certain questions, basic guidance
              could be provided to consumers on key questions to ask when looking for a credit
              or savings product. In addition, information could be provided more transparently
              as tested in a follow-up to this study.
                   This study covers standard consumer credit and savings products that may
              be expensive to offer, especially to low-income populations. A promising avenue
              is the take-up of low-cost mobile or online savings accounts, or access to financial
              products as a by-product of government-to-person payment programs, as is the
              case with the Oportunidades social payment program in Mexico.

Using savings lotteries to promote
financial inclusion in Nigeria

ABSTRACT
    Prize-linked savings products—such as savings lotteries—are a popular
    class of financial products widely used around the world. Prize-linked prod-
    ucts combine an otherwise standard financial product with the possibility of
    winning additional returns. Prize-linked savings have broad popular appeal
    because they use lottery elements familiar to large segments of the popula-
    tion, use simple savings products that do not require a high level of financial
    literacy, and have no downside risk for the client. We evaluate the impact
    of a large-scale savings lottery in Nigeria. The I-Save I-Win program was a
    nationwide savings incentive campaign run by one of the country’s largest
    banks. The program incentivized customers to maintain a prespecified
    balance in their savings account for a period of 90 days. Bank customers

    3 percentage points, and the usage of additional financial products by up to
    5 percentage points, within a week of lottery events. However, we find no

    persisted after explicit incentives were removed. In addition, new media

              9.1	INTRODUCTION
              Low-income households in developing countries are often confronted with the
              dual challenge of highly volatile incomes and an inability to insure such income
              risk through access to insurance or formal credit. Without access to insurance
              markets, the accumulation of precautionary savings is often the only viable
              risk-management strategy available to poor households. Mobilizing precautionary
              savings has, however, proven difficult. In many contexts, access to basic banking
              services is limited; even where such services are available, there are often signifi-
              cant barriers preventing borrowers with limited financial literacy from harnessing
              their full potential.
                   In this chapter, we explore the effectiveness of prize-linked savings prod-
              ucts as a device to encourage savings and build financial capabilities through
              “learning by doing.” Prize-linked savings products combine an otherwise standard
              financial product, such as a savings account, with a lottery component. In this
              way, customers are incentivized to adopt the saving product through its lottery
              component, which, in addition to regular interest payments, promises the pros-
              pect of a stochastic return in the form of one-time awards or annuities. Some
              early examples of prize-linked savings products include “prize bonds” issued
              by the French court to close the financing gap left by the profligate spending of
              Louis XIV. In recent times, lottery-linked savings products have often been used
              by banks in many emerging markets to extend their client base to previously
              unbanked populations.
                   While policies to encourage savings have often relied on mandating saving,
              prize-linked products may provide an appealing alternative for building financial
              capabilities among households with low financial literacy. Many households in
              this target population have never had the experience of explicitly thinking through
              and committing to a savings strategy that will insure against future risk. Prize-
              linked savings products are attractive in this context, because they are easy to
              run through regular savings accounts, significantly less complex than dedicated
              commitment savings products, and have no downside risk for the client. More-
              over, the lottery component of the product is often an extremely effective factor
              in raising the appeal of such savings programs: for instance, 82  percent of all
              South Africans play the lottery at least once a week (Bar and Collins 2006), but only
              53 percent have a formal savings account, and at 20 percent of gross domestic
              product (GDP), South Africa’s domestic savings rate is one of the lowest in the
              world (FANews 2011). In Nigeria, only 30 percent of all adults have an account at
              a formal financial institution, while lotteries are widespread.
                                                                       9.  Learning by doing?  ◾ 281




    Savings lotteries share many features of a basic commitment savings product.
Such products, which have been introduced by many banks across the globe, are
designed to build household savings through automatic deductions or mandatory
contributions to a savings plan—e.g., a 401(k) retirement savings account. The
available evidence suggests that commitment savings products can do much to
boost savings among low-income households. Ashraf, Karlan, and Yin (2006), for
example, report that individuals who were offered a commitment savings product
in a field experiment in the Philippines were able to increase their savings by up to
81 percent relative to households in a control group without access to the product.
    In practice, however, using commitment savings products to build financial
capabilities has been challenging. Dedicated commitment savings products are
relatively costly to introduce, to market, and to administer. Take-up of these prod-
ucts has therefore often been suboptimally low and unevenly distributed, with
more financially literate households being disproportionately likely to demand
these products. By contrast, prize-linked saving products, such as the savings
lottery we study in this chapter, are usually based on an existing financial product,
such as a savings account, and create direct incentives to commit to a savings
plan by offering stochastic returns.
    Although prize-linked products have been shown to be effective at reaching
low-income nonsavers, an important question is whether they can generate
persistent changes in saving behavior. While some incentive savings programs,
such as prize bonds, have been offered consistently and over an extended period
of time, many savings lotteries offered by private lenders have been limited in
time, and it is unclear whether this relatively short exposure to the incentive
program is sufficient to build financial capabilities.
    We investigate the impact of the I-Save I-Win (ISIW) promotion, a nationwide
financial capability program launched by a leading Nigerian bank (InterContinental
Bank [ICB]) in the spring of 2011 with the aim of mobilizing precautionary savings
through mass market savings accounts. The ISIW promotion was a heavily publi-
cized lottery incentive scheme designed to educate consumers about savings
through first-hand sustained use of individual savings accounts. All consumers
who opened new accounts or maintained existing savings accounts above partic-
ular balance thresholds were eligible for the lottery. Over 600 lottery prizes,
ranging from cash payouts to television sets and cars, were awarded in stages
over the promotional period. The promotion delivered a simple educational
message: lottery awards are the immediate draw, but every saver is a winner.
    From a financial capability perspective, the promotion resembled a simple
commitment savings product (see, e.g., Brune et al. 2011; and Ashraf, Karlan, and
Yin 2006) that incentivized the establishment of new savings accounts and the
more active use of accounts among existing account holders. Rather than relying
on explicit financial education content, the program sought to change financial
behaviors directly by providing incentives for “learning by doing” through the
active use of formal financial services.
282  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




                  In this way, banking relationships and learning by doing induced by ISIW may
              change financial behavior even after the promotion is over, leading to greater
              financial capabilities, as measured by precautionary savings and the use of finan-
              cial products beyond savings accounts. In the empirical analysis, we examine in
              detail which of these goals the program achieved by exploring the impact of the
              incentive program on savings balances, the intensity of banking relationships, and
              changes in the use of financial services among program participants.
                  While many past efforts to increase financial capabilities have offered educa-
              tion hoping it would improve later financial behaviors, ISIW focused on changing
              financial behaviors directly. Was this approach effective, and did it have lasting
              effects? Direct experience with savings, whether the experience is gained
              because of a desire to self-insure or because of the promise of a prize, may serve
              to familiarize customers with formal financial services and lower the barriers to
              future participation. It may also demonstrate to customers that they can manage
              to maintain levels of savings previously thought impossible.
                  In this way, savings induced by the ISIW promotion may lead to learning by
              doing, changing financial behavior even after the promotion is over (as measured
              by long-term level changes in savings balances and adoption of other financial
              products). Analysis of the ISIW promotion will be of interest to both banks that
              wish to draw poor, unbanked clients into the formal banking system; regulators
              who wish to encourage precautionary savings among vulnerable households; and
              researchers exploring methods other than direct education that may be used to
              increase financial literacy.
                  Nigeria’s emerging market for consumer finance is a particularly useful
              testing ground for programs like ISIW that combine private sector initiatives
              with “nudges” intended to build financial capabilities. Like other countries in the
              region, Nigeria does not have a significant history of state banking and lacks an
              extensive network of state banks through which government-led financial capa-
              bility programs could be delivered. This increases the role of the private sector
              in bringing individuals with limited financial literacy into the fold of the formal
              banking system. ISIW is an example of a simple, commercially viable program that
              has successfully aligned private and social incentives to achieve this goal.
                  Several important details of implementation allow us to plausibly estimate the
              impact of the ISIW program. First, ISIW was heavily promoted over a seven-month
              period through a variety of innovative media channels. The media push included
              celebrity endorsements from popular politicians and athletes. For example, Sullivan
              Chime, the governor of Nigeria’s Enugu State, publicly endorsed ISIW via a televised
              ceremony. The popular Nigerian football star Segun Odegbami also endorsed ISIW
              and encouraged personal savings as a way of transforming the lives of participants
              (WorldStage 2011). In addition, the ISIW lottery was promoted on television and via
              social media portals such as Facebook pages and YouTube videos. Finally, the stag-
              gered public drawing of lottery prizes across geographical regions itself functioned
              as a form of promotion for the ongoing portion of the ISIW lottery.
                                                                      9.  Learning by doing?  ◾ 283




    By exploiting the staggered introduction of various components of the
ISIW promotional campaign over time, we can measure the marginal increase
in savings applications and banking activity following each component of the
savings campaign, including lottery drawings and promotional events. We will
control for time trends using data from a second major Nigerian bank, Access
Bank. By comparing banking behavior across these two banks, before and after
the introduction of each ISIW media promotion, we can estimate the differenc-
es-in-differences impact of each type of media push on short- and medium-term
consumer banking behavior. In addition, the presence of a lottery winner in the
local area likely attracted participants through their social networks. Because
the location of winners was randomly determined by the lottery, this additional
source of variation allows us to estimate both the short- and long-term impacts of
participation in the ISIW program.
    We find some evidence that the publicity generated by the lottery had a
short-run impact on financial behaviors and increased individual savings balances
by 2–3 percentage points, and the usage of additional financial products by up
to 5 percentage points, within a week of lottery events. However, we find no
evidence that the incentive program led to persistent changes in savings, intensi-
fied banking relationships, or the use of financial products. In addition, new media
promotional campaigns, which encouraged customers to maintain minimum
savings account balances to become eligible for the lottery, did not significantly
affect individual banking choices. These patterns are consistent with results from
the literature on financial education and underscore the challenge of designing
education and incentive programs that can generate persistent changes in finan-
cial behaviors.



9.2	BACKGROUND

9.2.1	    Savings and financial literacy
A number of recent papers investigate household savings in developing countries
and find both low rates of savings and low access to formal savings channels.
Banerjee and Duflo (2007) summarize survey data from 13 countries from 1998 to
2005 and find that few people with expenditures below US$2 per day manage to
maintain formal savings accounts. Instead, households—if they save at all—use
alternative methods, documented in Rutherford (2000). Such alternative savings
channels may include self-help groups, popular in India; rotating savings and
credit associations (ROSCAs), popular in Africa and Latin America (see also Besley,
Coate, and Loury 1993); as well as moneylenders and other informal means.
    Compounding the problem of low savings rates is the fact that individuals and
small businesses in developing countries tend to borrow at high rates. As pointed
out by Banerjee and Duflo (2008), only a few small businesses with high rates
284  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              of return persist—since they are forced to borrow at extremely high rates—and
              many do not maintain cash buffers that would otherwise help them avoid costly
              borrowing.
                  Another branch of the savings literature argues that demand for savings
              accounts is high, but overall savings rates are low because of lack of access to
              formal savings technologies. Prina (2011) describes an experiment that offered
              savings accounts to households in the slums of Nepal. The take-up rate was high,
              and the average household saved 7 percent of its weekly income. In a similar vein,
              Collins et al. (2009) argue that many poor people wish to use better savings tech-
              nologies—more reliable, more convenient, cheaper—than they currently use. In
              fact, people often pay fees to save money—i.e., they are willing to accept nega-
              tive interest in exchange for access to mechanisms that allow them to save.
                  While the literature finds that many people who already save are willing to
              change overt to formal savings channels, it has been more challenging to increase
              savings participation overall. Results from the literature exploring the effect of
              financial literacy and education programs on money management decisions
              are, for example, extremely mixed. Carpena et al. (2011) study the effects of a
              financial literacy training consisting of five weekly video screenings, and find that
              the program affects participants’ numeracy but not their awareness of financial
              products. Other studies have found that financial literacy training tends to have
              only a small impact on actual behaviors—especially when educational content
              is delivered at a point where the target audience does not have the opportunity
              to translate this information into action. Relatedly, studies of targeted financial
              literacy interventions generally find newly acquired financial knowledge to have a
              relatively short half-life and therefore very limited effects on longer-run behavior.
              Xu and Zia (2012) provide an overview of other targeted financial literacy interven-
              tions; they find that lectures do not significantly affect financial behavior, while
              interactive lessons can generate stronger effects.
                  In contrast to this line of research, we explore the effect of a program that
              directly incentivized individuals to save and to try out a new savings technology.
              The objective of this program was twofold. First, by encouraging people to save
              for a few months by offering lottery rewards, the hope is that program participants
              will learn from the experience and continue to save even after explicit incentives
              are removed (learning by doing). Second, among individuals who already have an
              account, the program creates incentives for more frequent interactions with the
              formal banking system. This may build financial capability by improving familiarity
              with formal financial transactions and a wider range of financial products.
                  In part, our project is motivated by findings by Cole, Sampson, and Zia (2011),
              who compare the effect of financial literacy programs with small financial induce-
              ments to open a bank account. The ISIW program is similar in its underlying
              objective—individuals who open or maintain an account and receive additional
              expected returns through the opportunity to win lottery prizes, conditional on
              achieving a prespecified savings target.
                                                                       9.  Learning by doing?  ◾ 285




    Our focus on learning by doing in the use of financial services is also motivated
by Lusardi, Keller, and Keller (2009), who find that learning about the process and
difficulties of saving from others’ stories is highly effective at motivating savings
behavior. To the extent that holding a savings account (and having to maintain a
given balance level for several months) may provide an even more salient experi-
ence, learning by doing could also be helpful in creating a long-term savings habit.


9.2.2	    Time inconsistency and commitment savings
          products
The ability to engage in welfare-enhancing financial behaviors, such as saving,
may be constrained by other factors beyond financial literacy and the availability
of appropriate savings instruments. Much of the available evidence suggests that
a wide range of behavioral and psychological factors such as time inconsistency
may prevent people from saving as much as they would like.
    Against this background, a number of studies explore whether savings prod-
ucts can be designed to help people commit to save. Much of this research is
motivated by the hyperbolic discounting model (Laibson 1997; O’Donoghue and
Rabin 1999; Thaler 1990). Hyperbolic discounting describes the case in which an
agent sharply discounts all future consumption relative to today. This is a popular
model that explains low rates of precautionary savings and is consistent with
observed behaviors. Even individuals who understand that saving would be
welfare enhancing and would like to commit to a savings plan may be tempted
to place a greater weight on current consumption at the end of the month when
their paycheck arrives and they have the opportunity to trade future versus
current consumption. This is the commitment problem captured by the hyper-
bolic discounting model: an individual expects that in the future, he or she will
commit money to savings, but when the time comes, he or she no longer finds
it worthwhile. If the agent can anticipate this tendency, he or she will demand
commitment savings devices that prevent reneging on the savings goal.
    In response to the recognition that time-inconsistency problems may pose a
significant barrier to a household’s ability to save, banks and microfinance insti-
tutions have introduced so-called commitment savings products (Ashraf et al.
2003). A typical commitment savings product restricts or penalizes withdrawals
before a specified date or penalizes insufficient deposits. A study by Ashraf,
Karlan, and Yin (2006) shows that commitment savings products can significantly
affect behavior. The authors conduct a randomized trial of a commitment savings
product offered by a bank in the Philippines. The study demonstrates that there is
significant demand for products offering individuals a way to save—28 percent of
bank customers took up the product and used it to save. More interestingly, the
authors show that, consistent with the theory, more impatient individuals (i.e.,
those with the highest elicited discount rates) were also the most likely to take
up the product.
286  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




                  Mullainathan and Shafir (2009) discuss some additional behavioral issues that
              may generate low savings rates among low-income households. Their analysis
              focuses mainly on U.S. households, although the lessons apply more generally.
              They argue that mental accounting explains why people who save using cash
              will have a greater tendency to spend their savings on impulse purchases than
              people who keep their savings in formal savings accounts (Thaler 1999). Lack of
              reminders and limited attention may be another factor. For example, credit card
              companies give timely reminders to pay, while savings accounts do not regularly
              prompt the holder to contribute available money toward a financial goal.
                  Overall, the behavioral economics view of savings behavior suggests that
              observed savings behavior may run counter to the long-run preferences of the
              agents themselves. This motivates efforts to create products and incentive
              programs that try to build financial capability by inducing people to save more,
              including promotions and future efforts that this project hopes to inform.
                  While the main aim of the ISIW promotion was to raise savings balances and to
              promote savings through learning by doing, it shares some characteristics usually
              associated with commitment savings schemes. By opening an account and main-
              taining a certain account balance, the agent receives an anticipated reward (the
              expected lottery payout). If the agent were to withdraw from the savings account
              prior to the end of the promotion period, he or she then suffers a loss of the
              expected lottery rewards. This creates an incentive mechanism similar to that of
              a standard commitment savings product, where the prospect of expected returns
              combined with penalties for not maintaining the savings target creates an incen-
              tive to commit to a savings plan.
                  When it comes to reaching low-income households which face particularly
              severe constraints in committing to a savings plan, prize-linked savings products
              may be especially effective. Traditional commitment savings products suffer
              from the limitation that they are relatively complex to market and administer.
              They may also be prone to problems of selection. Because it requires some level
              of financial sophistication to be aware of one’s own commitment problems and
              sign on to financial products that can help mitigate these problems, it is likely
              that there is a disproportionate selection of financially literate households in the
              take-up of these products. Prize-linked products generally do not suffer these
              selection problems. On the contrary, by using lottery elements with wide popular
              appeal, such products are especially likely to be successful among hard-to-reach
              segments of the population that would not otherwise sign up for a savings plan.
              Using a survey among potential clients of prize-linked commitment savings
              products in the United States, Tufano, Maynard, and De Neve (2008) show that
              demand for this class of product is greatest among low-income individuals who
              do not have regular savings habits and have little actual savings, but regularly
              play the lottery.

9.2.3	    The history of prize-linked savings products
Prize-linked savings products have been used by governments and financial insti-
tutions for at least three centuries. These entities learned early on that combining
savings with lottery features was an effective means of raising capital. In cases
where savings lotteries have been run by the state, they have often been combined
with the issuance of specialized bonds, so that in addition to the potential upside
of the lottery, they often provided consumers with an incentivized introduction to
new savings products.
    The earliest use of lotteries as a device to encourage savings dates back
to the “Million Lottery” or “Million Adventure,” which was used to finance King
William of Orange’s efforts in the Nine Years War (Murphy 2005). Launched in
1694, the Million Adventure was designed to appeal to a wide range of inves-
tors, as it promised large prizes to fortunate winners for their £10 ticket with no
downside risk. For every 100,000 tickets sold, the lottery offered 2,500 generous
prizes, the highest being an annuity of £1,000 for 16 years; the lowest an annuity
of £10. Moreover, unlike other lotteries, the non-prize-winning, or blank, tickets
also entitled the holder to a modest but reasonable return on investment of £1
per year until 1710. As a result, the tickets were swiftly sold, and soon after the
draw, a secondary market for the drawn tickets, including the blanks, formed—
which, after all, now had the features of a government bond.
    Savings ideas soon became popular elsewhere. In France, Louis XV intro-
duced the first “borrowing lottery,” in part to make up for excessive spending
under the reign of Louis XIV (Pfiffelmann 2009). In a borrowing lottery, bonds
issued by the state paid bondholders through a draw. Each bondholder was
given a ticket to participate in the draw. The winners received funds that were
significantly higher than what they had originally invested, while losers received
interest compensation in the form of a rente viagères (a form of perpetuity that
ends upon the death of the beneficiary). A few decades later, in 1777, Jacques
Necker, then French comptroller-general, resorted to a borrowing lottery to raise
capital after France had declared war on England the previous year. He arranged
for issuance of “the most attractive bonds possible”—20,000 titles at a face value
of 12,000 livres each. The drawing comprised two draws without replacement;
the first offered 3,000 lots of annuities and the second, 15,000 perpetuities and
2,000 batches of rente viagères.
    Prize-linked savings products were launched successfully by several govern-
ments throughout the 20th century. In 1918, Sweden needed to find new sources
of funding to finance postwar development and began issuing bonds annually or
biannually. The coupons of these bonds were determined by a lottery drawing.
The lottery became so popular Sweden’s Debt Department faced stiff opposition
when it tried to discontinue the program in 1931.
    In the United Kingdom, the government of Harold Macmillan introduced
so-called “premium bonds” with the budget of 1956, and Ireland saw the
288  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              introduction of “prize bonds” in the same year (Lobe and Hölzel 2007; Tufano
              2008). Accessible in small denominations, both systems paid the interest into a
              prize fund out of which a electronic random number generator would select the
              winning bond numbers on a regular (monthly for the United Kingdom, weekly in
              Ireland) basis. With about one in three Britons holding premium bonds, this form
              of savings has gained widespread appeal.
                      Banks have noticed the wide appeal of government-sponsored savings
              lotteries, and have launched a range of similar products. First introduced by a
              local cooperative bank in Germany in 1950, a program known as GewinnSparen
              (WinSaving) is now offered by many cooperative and savings banks across the
              country.1 As an incentive for the client to commit to a regular savings amount
              (deducted as a direct debit from the client’s current account), part of this amount
              is effectively invested as a ticket for a lottery which typically has a 55  percent
              payout quota and is run by an nonprofit association independent of the bank.2
                      Prize-linked savings products have been successfully used by public and
              private entities around the world, particularly in Latin America, Southeast Asia,
              Scandinavia, and the United Kingdom. More recently, lottery-linked products have
              been introduced in the United States, where legislation still limits the use of prize-
              linked savings products for commercial purposes.


              9.2.4	        Savings lotteries in Sub-Saharan Africa
              Savings lottery promotions are relatively common in a number of Sub-Saharan
              African economies. However, only a few banks have rolled out a single promo-
              tion across the breadth of the countries in which they operate. One of the first
              instances of a launch of a savings lottery across different markets occurred in
              September 2012, when Ecobank launched its Win Big with Ecobank promotion
              in several African markets including the Gambia, Malawi, Tanzania, and Zambia.
              Banks in many African markets have been open to the introduction of savings
              promotions with lottery features, as these are often used as a short-term instru-
              ment for new client acquisition and rapid deposit mobilization. However, legal
              barriers to lottery-linked savings products persist in several countries. In South
              Africa, for example, First National Bank’s very successful Million-a-Month Account
              (MaMA) program was banned by a court in 2008, and other South African banks
              have been prevented by law from running similar programs. In this subsection,
              we review the MaMa program and selected examples of lottery promotions from
              Kenya and Nigeria.

SOUTH AFRICA: FIRST NATIONAL BANK MILLION-A-MONTH ACCOUNT
In 2005, First National Bank, one of South Africa’s leading banks, launched MaMA,
a lottery-linked savings program. The idea was to draw on the popularity of
traditional lotteries among South Africans to encourage savings behavior in the
country (see also Cole et al. 2008). For example, while nearly 80 percent of South
Africans spend on average R 80 on the lottery at least once a week, South Africa’s
domestic savings rate is one of the lowest in the world at about 20 percent of its
GDP (FANews 2011), and its household savings rate is below 1 percent.
    At zero cost, the MaMA program encouraged South Africans to open a
32-day savings account with a minimum balance of R 100 (about US$12) (account
holders were not permitted to withdraw their savings without giving a 90-day
notice to the bank); they were offered a nominal low interest rate of 0.25 percent.
                                                                      1,000
In return, savers were automatically offered a chance to win between R 
              1 million (US$115,000) for every R 
(US$115) and R                                  100 on deposit in a monthly
draw. MaMA became very popular, as First National Bank opened nearly 1 million
savings accounts with an average balance of R 1,000 and mobilized over R 1 billion
(US$115 million). The impact of this program on financial inclusion was consider-
able: approximately 20 percent of those signing up for an account were reported
as previously unbanked (De Waal 2012).
    The program was introduced around the same time that South Africa enacted
new national lotteries legislation that provided legal clearance for the bank to
launch the product. First National Bank obtained additional formal approvals from
Uthingo (the national lottery operator) and the National Lotteries Board, which
viewed the program as a promotional tool rather than a form of lottery and raised
no objection to it. However, taken by surprise by MaMA’s rapid success, six
months after the launch, the National Lotteries Board ordered the bank to stop
the program and later obtained an injunction from the High Court of South Africa
against First National Bank. A protracted legal battle ensued that resulted in the
Supreme Court of Appeal ruling in favor of the National Lotteries Board. After an
initial wave of withdrawals by participants of the MaMA program, the majority of
client savings remained with the bank after the demise of the program.


KENYA POST OFFICE SAVINGS BANK’S PREMIUM BONDS
As part of its mission to “encourage and facilitate savings” in Kenya, the Kenya
Post Office Savings Bank, a state entity, introduced the “premium bond” in 1978.
The premium bond was a savings product akin to a lottery savings scheme
whereby holders, mostly low-income individuals or families, could buy premium
bonds to enhance their savings and stand a chance to win monthly cash prizes
(Kamewe and Radcliffe 1999; Wright 1999). These premium bonds were offered
                        10 (US$0.14) and K Sh 
in denominations of K Sh                     20 (US$0.28). Holders could not
make any withdrawals on their interest-free deposits within the first three months
after the initial deposit. By 1998, these deposits constituted about 0.62 percent
290  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              of the Kenya Post Office Savings Bank’s total deposits (or US$0.56 million out
              of US$89.6 million). Interest in the premium bonds was particularly focused in
              rural areas where, until the early 2000s, hardly any alternatives to the Kenya Post
              Office Savings Bank existed. Plans to introduce larger denominations of K Sh 500
              (US$7.14), K   1,000 (US$14.28), and K 
                           Sh                          10,000 (US$142.80) and increase the
                                                     Sh 
              prizes were abandoned, though, when the bank ceased to offer the premium
              bonds in October 2004 in the face of increasing competition and restructuring.
                  Likely one of the first lottery savings programs in Sub-Saharan Africa, the
              Kenya Post Office Savings Bank’s premium bonds did not face the regulatory
              hurdles that, for example, First National Bank’s MaMA did. Several Kenyan and
              international banks such as Barclays and Ecobank are now turning to savings
              promotions to incentivize Kenyans to save and increase their deposit base. In
              2012, Barclays Bank Kenya and Ecobank Group launched savings promotions with
              features similar to the ones described below for Nigeria.


              NIGERIA
              In 2010, several Nigerian banks including Union Bank, Oceanic Bank, and Spring-
              Bank (renamed Enterprise Bank after the takeover by the country’s “bad bank”
              AMCON) began to deploy lottery-based savings promotions to increase their
              deposit base and expand their customer base among unbanked and under-
              banked segments of the population. Each of these savings promotions has been
              structured uniquely, but share several commonalities. The prizes on offer are
              most often cash, vehicles (cars, scooters, or motorbikes), household appliances,
              personal electronics, or some combination of the four. Promotions are held for a
              limited period of time, ranging in duration from three months to one year. Draws
              are usually held monthly and on a rotating basis (in different geographic zones).
              This was also the case for the ISIW promotion, which we analyze in detail below.
                  There are some nontrivial regulatory hurdles for financial institutions wishing
              to launch a prize-linked savings product in Nigeria. To launch a lottery promo-
              tion, a bank must first register with the National Lottery Regulatory Commission,
              apply for a permit and pay permit processing fees of between N      = 2 million and
              = 10 million (US$63,400), depending on the length of the promotion. Each subse-
              N
              quent promotion requires a permit of its own. Among other stipulations, the
              commission demands that the location of each draw be open to members of the
              public and that its officials be present. Additionally, banks are required to register
              their promotions with the Consumer Protection Council of Nigeria and pay the
              requisite registration fees. We describe below a number of savings promotions
              that have been successful completed in Nigeria.

              Diamond Bank’s SavingsXtra promotion. Initially launched in June 2008,
              Diamond Bank Plc.’s annual SavingsXtra promotion was created with the stated
              aim of engendering a culture of saving among the Nigerian populace and to reward
              customers for their loyalty. For the bank, the mobilization of low-cost deposits as
                                                                       9.  Learning by doing?  ◾ 291




a means of funding and driving client growth as Diamond Bank expanded its retail
footprint were central. However, by the same token, this implied an extension of
the bank’s customer base to segments of the population with previously limited
access to formal banking. Since its inception, the bank has rolled out several
phases of the scheme: Season 2 (September 2009–August 2010), Season  3
(September 2010–August 2011), Season 4 (September 2011–August 2012), and
Season 5 (September 2012–August 2013). As of mid-2011, 30,000 new savings
accounts were opened each month through SavingsXtra (ABN Digital 2011). To
be eligible to participate in the monthly and weekly draws, existing customers
must simply maintain a minimum balance of N  = 5,000 (US$31.70) in their Diamond
SavingsXtra account prior to the draw. New customers must open an account
and maintain a minimum balance of the same amount. All account holders with
the required balance are equally likely to win prizes, but for every additional
= 5,000 held in the account, customers receive more lottery tickets—thereby
N
increasing their chances of winning. Prizes include cash gifts of varying amounts
            = 500,000, N
 = 250,000, N
(N                     = 2 million), household appliances, and a unique offer enti-
                                                 = 100,000 (US$634) monthly for
tled Salary4Life where a lucky customer receives N
a period of 20 years. In addition to these prizes, SavingsXtra account holders also
receive life insurance coverage of N= 50,000 and automatic eligibility to apply for a
SavingsXtra Visa credit card (with a credit line capped at 75 percent of their cash
balance). While the savings account permits withdrawals, it still offers 2 percent
annusl interest (daily accrual) independent of the account balance. Given these
favorable conditions, the multiple repetition indicates the bank’s interest in this
product, as it appears to have driven up new accounts strongly with more than
75 percent of new accounts remaining active after the promotion.3

First Bank of Nigeria’s Save & Excel promotion. FirstBank of Nigeria’s Save
& Excel promotion (February–December 2012) also stated a broader goal of
promoting financial inclusion by compelling unbanked/underbanked groups such
as farmers, women, and senior citizens to test out different savings products. The
top prizes in the quarterly draws were all-expense-paid trips to the London Olym-
pics and Peugeot 307 cars. Cash prizes of varying amounts and household appli-
ances such as home theater sets and chest freezers were offered in the monthly
draws. Thresholds were put in place for participation in draws and for eligibility
to win the Olympics trip. To participate in the monthly draws, customers need to
have saved and maintained a balance of N  = 20,000 (US$127) in the period leading up
to the draw—i.e., four times the minimum amount at Diamond Bank. To be eligible
for the quarterly draw, customers need to have maintained a minimum balance
                                                                   = 20,000
   = 60,000 for three months. Alternately, they need to have saved N
of N
incrementally every month for three consecutive months. Finally, to qualify for

              the Olympics trip, customers need to have saved N= 30,000 every month for four
                                                            = 120,000 for four months. In the
              consecutive months or maintained a balance of N
              wake of previous savings promotions, First Bank aims to look at continuing this
              product category in the future, as it credits a growth of up to 40 percent in its
              client numbers to these initiatives.4

              First City Monument Bank’s Millionaire Savings promotion. First City Monu-
              ment Bank’s Millionaire Savings promotion, which ran from June 2011 to April
              2012, was also developed to foster a savings culture and reward bank customers
              for their loyalty. The top prize was a N= 1 million cash gift; consolation prizes
                                                       = 10,000. To qualify to participate in the
                                = 100,000 (US$634) and N
              included gifts of N
              consolation prize draws, customers were required to have or to open a First City
                                                                                  = 10,000 for
              Monument Bank Millionaire Savings certificate and save a balance of N
              30 days or more prior to the draw. Every subsequent unit held for 30 days or more
              qualified a saver for the millionaire top prize draws. The promotion was unique
              in that it was carried out on a rolling basis; nonwinning certificates were rolled
              over every month to subsequent draws. In generating awareness of the scheme,
              management emphasized that the certificate could be liquidated for its full value
              at any point and that customers could exit from the scheme at their convenience.
              The bank’s experience with the product, though, was less enthusiastic compared
              to initial sales projections. The nature of the certificate—vis-à-vis a more standard
              account—might have played a role in diminishing the product’s appeal, as well as
              the lower reward compared to peers and limited advertising expenditures. The
              fees levied by the National Lottery Regulatory Commission further challenged the
              overall profitability of the product for the bank; it is currently undergoing revision.5

                      While savings promotions have become a standard feature in the product
              offerings of Nigerian banks, it is also evident that banks continue to test product
              features and marketing interventions to guarantee the economic success of these
              products as well as ensure they do not just generate a one-off effect of clients
              signing up only to relapse into dormancy as soon as a lottery expires. In this
              respect, it appears that the incentives of banks are highly congruent with a finan-
              cial inclusion agenda, aiming to draw new customers into formal banking relation-
              ships and ensuring that accounts do not just get opened but are also actively used.

program we evaluate is the ISIW savings promotion, a commercial savings incen-
tive program offered by ICB, one of Nigeria’s leading retail banks with a network
of 362 branches across the country and a client base of more than 2 million active
savings account holders in all states in Nigeria.
        The ISIW savings promotion was announced in March 2011 and ran from April
to November 2011. The bank’s motivation for offering the program was twofold:
first, to raise savings balances among existing clients, and second, to extend the
appeal of basic savings accounts to Nigeria’s large unbanked population—many
of whom reside in remote areas of the country and have limited prior financial
literacy exposure to formal financial services.
        The remainder of this section describes the design of the program. The first
subsection reviews the program rules and eligibility criteria, the second describes
the advertising campaign that accompanied the program, and the third provides
details about lottery winners and the timing of regional and national prize drawings.


9.3.1	        Program rules and eligibility
Program rules were kept deliberately simple to achieve widespread participation.
Bank clients qualified for participation in one of the six regional draws of the
                                            = 50,000 (US$300) for a minimum period
savings lottery by maintaining a balance of N
of 90 days.6 For the drawings that were held more than 90 days after the contest
was announced, the requirement was amended so that a customer needed at
                                                            = 50,000 between
least 90 days—not necessarily consecutive—with a balance of N
the contest announcement and the prize drawing. Savings account holders qual-
                                                        = 100,000 (US$600) for a
ified for the national draw by maintaining a balance of N
minimum period of 90 days. The savings lottery was open to both existing bank
clients as well as clients who opened a new savings account between April 4
and October 31, 2011. The program applied only to dedicated savings accounts.
Balances held in current, checking, and other types of accounts did not qualify
bank customers for participation in the lottery.


9.3.2	        Social media campaign and celebrity endorsements
The lottery was advertised through print media and direct marketing as well as
radio and television commercials. The marketing campaign accompanying the
program targeted both existing and potential new bank clients and had three
main components (figure 9.1).
        First, to mobilize savings among existing clients, the bank launched a direct
marketing campaign utilizing relationship banking interactions as well as direct
marketing by mail and new media to generate awareness about the program.
This direct marketing campaign had several components. Branch managers, sales

representatives, and relationship managers provided information materials to
customers at the branch level. In addition, information about the savings promo-
tion was included in the bank’s regular mailings to its customers. Finally, the bank
undertook several waves of direct marketing using mobile phone text messages.
Targeted SMS messages were sent to more than 100,000 bank customers in three
waves. The messages contained a list of regional and national prizes and informa-
tion on how to sign up for the savings lottery.
    Second, the bank used television and radio advertisements aired in English
and multiple regional languages across all states of Nigeria. Television and radio
commercials were designed specifically to reach out to marginal clients in remote
and underbanked areas of the country where existing banking relationships and
direct marketing via mobile phones and social media are less effective. Televi-
sion and radio advertisements were used throughout the promotion, initially to
announce the program and generate awareness about the benefits of increased
savings. At later stages in the program, radio and television commercials were
also used to publicize the prize drawing events and announce the winners of the
regional and local prize drawings. In addition to traditional television and radio
commercials, the bank launched a comprehensive social media campaign, which
included a dedicated Facebook page, a YouTube video stream, and a Twitter
channel. The social media campaign was used to publicize prize drawings and
included a basic financial education message: “By saving more, everybody wins.”
    Finally, to extend the appeal of the savings promotion beyond the bank’s
traditional customer base, the bank secured a number of high-profile celebrity
endorsements. For example, in April 2011, international soccer star Segun Odeg-
bami endorsed ISIW, in a move that was widely publicized in local and national
media. Over the course of the promotion, ISIW received additional endorsements
from popular Nigerian media and sports personalities.


9.3.3	     Prize drawings
The bank held prize drawings for each of its 10 regions between July and November
2011, followed by a final drawing for the grand national prize on November 3, 2011.
To be eligible for the regional draw, a customer needed to maintain a balance of
= 50,000 for 90 days prior to the contest; for the national draw, the threshold
N
                                                                       = 10,000
    = 100,000. In each regional draw, 20 customers won a cash prize of N
was N

(US$60), 10 each won cash prizes of N20,000 (US$120) and N50,000 (US$300), 10
won 32” LCD TVs, and one won a Toyota Corolla. The prize in the national drawing
                                                     = 15 million (US$95,000). To

by the accounting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers.
    Regional prize drawings took place in six phases between July and October
2011. In each phase, winners were drawn from all qualifying account holders
in one or more of the bank’s 10 operational regions. Each region encompasses
296  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              between 5 and 10 states of Nigeria and between 10 and 30 of the bank’s 362
              branches. The first regional prize draw occurred on July 21, 2011, and covered
              the capital territory of Abuja and the north central region of Nigeria; subsequent
              regional prize drawings followed on August 8 for the southeast region, August 25
              for the south region, September 14 for the northwest region, and October 21 for
              the southwest region. The final regional prize drawings for northeast Nigeria, the
              Lagos mainland, and Lagos island took place concurrently with the national draw
              on November 3, 2011.
                  The prize drawings were televised, and prize winners were announced in
              regional and national print media, including Nigeria’s leading daily newspapers,
              the Guardian and This Day, following each prize drawing. Table 9.1 summarizes the
              timing of prize drawings; figure 9.2 shows the sequence of prize drawings by state.



              9.4	        DATA AND DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS
              We analyze the impact of the ISIW savings promotion using detailed microdata on
              daily account balances for more than 4 million account holders at all of the bank’s
              362 branches for the period between October 1, 2010, and August 30, 2012.
                  We merge this data set with information on (1) demographic data on each
              account holder; (2) data on the complete set of financial products used by each
              client before and after the program; and (3) data on the timing of lottery draws,
              prizes won, and the geographical location of lottery winners. We additionally use
              data on the media campaign that accompanied the savings lottery. These include
              records on the timing of television commercials and newspaper and radio promo-
              tions.
                  We were able to collect data for all clients at ICB, as well as for a control
              sample of 620,035 customers of a second leading Nigerian bank—Access Bank—
              which did not have a comparable promotion during the time period covered by
              our data.
                  The remainder of this section describes our data sources and provides
              descriptive statistics on customer demographics, savings balances and transac-
              tions, and summary statistics on the lottery drawings to motivate the subsequent
              econometric analysis.


              9.4.1	      Savings balances and transactions
              The main data set consists of detailed transaction-level data of 2,958,714 savings
              account customers. This includes all 2,338,679 savings account holders at the
              bank that ran the ISIW promotion, as well as a random sample of 620,035 account
              holders at the control bank. The data series consists of daily data between
              October 1, 2010, and August 30, 2012, for a total of 1,979,379,666 daily account
              observations.

    These data allow us to compute daily balances and changes for every account
over any subperiod. Accounts at the two banks were combined following their
merger in March 2012. For the purpose of this chapter, we consider only balances
and transactions up to February 2012. Customers with large balances might have
298  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              large balance changes as well, and thus heavily influence both the average and
              total figures; it is likely that the impact of the lottery is particularly pronounced
              among customers with balances close to the eligibility threshold of N     = 50,000 and
              = 150,000. In the statistical analysis, we restrict our sample accordingly. Second,
              N
              power calculations indicate that our minimum detectable effect size is very small,
              on the order of a few naira, even with relatively low statistical power. This allows
              us to further focus the statistical analysis and consider the effect of the lottery on
              very specific subpopulations in the sample.
                  It is worth noting an important caveat about the account data underlying
              our analysis. Because of inconsistencies in the data on account balances, we
              currently restrict our attention to data on balance changes within a time window
              of ±7 or ±14 days around ISIW events, for which we can be sure that our results
              are not biased by measurement error. This places some limitations on our anal-
              ysis. First, we have only an approximate measure of whether a bank customer is
              above or below the N = 50,000 cutoff at the date the lottery is introduced. Hence we
              currently cannot exploit the sharp discontinuity in eligibility for the program that
                        = 50,000 in our analysis. Second, one would expect the response to the
              occurs at N
              lottery incentive to be heterogeneous, with take-up and balance changes being
              larger for households with smaller initial savings balances. Since our measure of
              initial savings balances is imprecise, we cannot currently explore this heteroge-
              neity in the response to the program.
                  Finally, the account data also enable us to calculate measures of the type and
              frequency of banking transactions, which we use as a proxy for the intensity of a
              customer’s banking relationship.


              9.4.2	    Customer profile: demographics and geography
              The data set contains the demographic details and locations for all individuals
              who opened a savings account before September 2012. Table 9.2 lists the vari-
              ables available for each individual in the data set. Demographic data and location
              for each individual can be matched to account and transaction data through an
              anonymized identifier code.
                  An important consideration for our analysis is whether the population of
              customers at the control bank is sufficiently similar to serve as a useful compar-
              ison group vis-à-vis the population of borrowers were eligible to participate in
              ISIW. To verify that this is the case, this section presents a number of summary
              statistics by bank.
                  We first consider the geographic distribution of the two banks’ population of
              savings accounts customers. Both banks are large nationwide banks that operate
              a large network of branches (362 and 325 branches, respectively) in all states and
              territories of Nigeria. Figure 9.3 plots the branch network of the two banks and
              shows that the locations served by them are very similar, with the control bank
              having a slightly more extensive network in central Nigeria. The same pattern

              holds for the percentage of accounts in each geographical region (figure 9.4). The
              general pattern is similar for the two banks in that the vast majority of accounts is
              concentrated in the same urban centers (Lagos, Abuja, Kano, Ibadan). Overall, the
              control bank has a higher fraction of accounts in Lagos and some of the southern
              Nigerian states, while the treatment bank’s branch network is somewhat more
              evenly distributed around the country.
                   We next consider the demographic characteristics of bank customers of the
              treatment and control banks. Table 9.3 shows the breakdown of the two banks’
              customers by gender, marital status, and age. The clientele of both banks is about
              two-thirds male, with the customers of the control bank being slightly younger
              and, on average, less likely to be married. Overall, the demographic profile of the
              two banks is quite similar, indicating that differential selection into the client pool
              of the two banks is unlikely to pose a threat to our empirical approach.

                     Lottery drawings for the ISIW promotion occurred in six phases between July
              and November 2011. Prize drawings were conducted separately among qualifying
              bank customers in each of the bank’s six regions, beginning with the Abuja and
              north central tegions of Nigeria on July 21, 2011, and concluding with the Lagos and
              northeast Nigeria regions on November 3, 2011. The drawing for the grand national
              prize took place concurrently with the last regional drawing on November 3, 2011.
                     The data on prize winners contains the name, address, and account informa-
              tion for all 611 individuals who won prizes in the regional and national rounds of
              the ISIW lottery.

9.5	      METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS

9.5.1	    Empirical strategy
The introduction of the ISIW promotion and each type of new media campaign
(e.g., celebrity endorsement, television commercial, YouTube video, intermediate
lottery drawing) was staggered over time from April to October 2011 as shown
in figure 9.5. To evaluate the effect of each type of media campaign on borrower
behavior, we focus on a narrow time window around the introduction of each
type of media launch and perform the following event study:

	∆Yi = β 0 + εi	(9.1)

where ∆Yi is the change in the outcome of interest in the narrow time window
around the event, e.g., account balances for customer i, and β 0 is the coefficient
on the constant term capturing the effect of the promotion. εi is the error term,
which we allow to be clustered at the bank branch level. We include a single
observation for each account. Note that, because the outcome is specified in
terms of changes in account characteristics, the regression implicitly controls
for fixed individual differences affecting the level of account activity. In supple-
mentary tests, we also allow for more flexible nonlinear time trends as well as
corrections for seasonality in account activity.
    To account for the possibility that there are other changes affecting savings
behavior that happen to coincide with the intervention, we employ a differ-
ence-in-difference approach to account for such changes. To do this, we add data
from accounts at Access Bank (the control bank) and estimate the following:

	∆Yi = β 0 + β1IiICB + β2 Xi + εi	(9.2)

in which IiICB is a dummy equal to 1 if the customer banks with ICB and equal to 0 if
the customer banks with Access Bank. We again focus on a narrow time window
around the introduction of each type of media launch, with a single observation for
each account. β 0 measures the average change in account activity among Access
Bank customers. β1 measures the marginal difference in the average change in
account activity for ICB customers relative to Access Bank customers. We also
include controls for demographic characteristics that might affect the change in
account activity around the event. Note again that because the outcome is spec-
ified in terms of changes, the regression implicitly controls for fixed individual
differences affecting the level of account activity. As before, we also test specifi-
cations allowing for more flexible nonlinear time trends as well as corrections for
seasonality in account activity.
    For the evaluation of the lottery component of ISIW we use the following base
specification:

    To further explore the effect of lotteries on savings behavior, we exploit
branch-level variation in whether customers at the bank won a disproportionate
number of lottery prizes or won particularly large prizes, such as cars. We hypoth-
esize that other customers banking at branches with major lottery winners may
become more aware of the lottery and of the possible benefits associated with
banking activities. We use the following specification:

disproportionate number of lottery prizes or was the home of a car lottery winner.
    Our strategy for evaluating components of ISIW (other than the lottery
component) relies on the assumption that Access Bank customers serve as an
appropriate control for ICB customers. We believe this is a reasonable assumption
for several reasons. Both Access and ICB are among Nigeria’s largest national
banks and serve a broad clientele. Like ICB, Access Bank previously ran a savings
campaign, although it occurred outside the time frame of our study and had fewer
new media elements. This suggests that Access and ICB executives had similar
approaches to running their businesses, and merely the timing of their implemen-
tation differed.
    However, as noted previously, we must also confront several important
concerns when using Access Bank as a control. First, Access launched a sign-up
drive for new accounts shortly after the launch of ISIW, as evidenced by a signif-
icant increase in new account openings for Access Bank starting in July 2011.
Therefore, we cannot use Access Bank as a control group to examine the effect
of ISIW on new account openings. Instead, we explore the effect of the savings
promotion on the behavior of customers with accounts opened prior to the launch
of the ISIW promotion. Second, ISIW was launched during a turbulent period in
which both ICB and Access Bank saw large declines in balances and new account
openings just prior to the initiation of the ISIW promotion. Given the general
volatility in account activity, one may be concerned that ICB and Access Bank
may have reacted in different unobserved ways that directly affected savings
behavior. Therefore, in the next section, we present the results using Access Bank
as a control, but refrain from drawing strong conclusions. Instead, we focus on
the lottery-related results, which use regional and branch-level variation in the
timing and outcomes of the lottery drawings. These lottery-related results do not
require the use of Access Bank as a control group and are less subject to endog-
eneity concerns.


9.5.2	    Short- and medium-term impact on savings balances
We begin our analysis by examining how the ISIW promotion affected savings
balance activity. We find evidence that the initiation of the savings promotion led
306  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              to a small increase in the savings balances of existing account holders. However,
              this effect was short lived. Moreover, subsequent media campaigns, such as
              celebrity endorsements and the release of YouTube promotional videos, did not
              significantly affect savings behavior.
                  Figure 9.6 shows the mean savings account balances at ICB and Access Bank
              around the initiation of the ISIW promotion in April 2011. To focus on the set of
              customers most likely to be affected by the promotion, we exclude “high-roller”
              accounts, defined as accounts with balance changes exceeding N= 3 million (about
              US$20,000) in a single transaction in our sample period. We also exclude accounts
              that are inactive over a large window surrounding the launch of the ISIW promo-
              tion (from October 2010 to February 2012). Comparing the trends for ICB and
              Access Bank, we do not observe obvious large differential changes in savings
              balances across the two banks.
                  In unreported results, we also look at mean and median account balances
              around the initiation of ISIW and around the introduction of subsequent new
              media campaigns and find similar results. In all cases, new media campaigns
              did not lead to economically meaningful changes in savings activity. In table 9.4,
              we explore changes in the savings account balances following the launch of the
              ISIW promotion in April 2011 using the single-difference and differences-in-differ-
              ences specifications described in the previous section. The sample is restricted
              to accounts active prior to April 2011. Outcomes are the change in the month-end
              account balance relative to March 2011 (the month prior to the ISIW promotion).
              For example, for event window [−1,2], the outcome is the month-end balance in
              June 2011 minus the month-end balance in March 2011. Columns 1, 3, and 5 report
              a single-difference specification in which observations are limited to accounts
              at ICB. Columns 2, 4, and 6 report a differences-in-differences specification

ment profession of the primary account holder. We do not report the coefficient
for the constant term in columns 2, 4, and 6 because they represent the omitted
category after including state and profession fixed effects.
     We find that account balances at ICB increased in the event window around
                                    = 500 (approximately US$3.20). However, at
the launch of the ISIW by more than N
approximately 2.5 percent of the mean balance, this change is relatively small in
economic magnitude. Further, Access account balances also grew in this period,
and the marginal difference between ICB and Access is not always statistically
significant. In particular, columns 4 and 6 show that ISIW may have had a small
significant impact on ICB balances in the month after the ISIW launch, but this
effect quickly disappears if the event window is extended to two months.
     In additional results, not reported here, we conduct similar regression anal-
ysis to explore the effect of new media promotions on savings account balances.
We do not find significant effects. Finally, we find that adjustments for seasonality
do not substantively change our results.
     In figure 9.7, we test whether the launch of the ISIW encouraged bank clients
                                         = 50,000 over a minimum nonconsecu-
to maintain a minimum savings balance of N
tive period of 90 days to be eligible for the lottery drawings. We limit the sample
to saving accounts that were created prior to the launch of ISIW and plot the
                                                        = 50,000. We find that
fraction of all active accounts with balances exceeding N
both ICB and Access Bank experienced steady declines in the fraction of accounts
                        = 50,000 in the months preceding the launch of the ISIW
with balances exceeding N

              promotion. In the months following ISIW, the fraction of accounts qualifying for
              the lottery remains steady at both banks. This suggests that ISIW did not signifi-
              cantly encourage ICB clients to maintain minimum account balances. Instead,
              we believe there were general time trends leading to broad declines in account
              balances in early 2011, which subsequently abated starting in April 2011.


              9.5.3	      Impact on use of other financial products
              Next, we explore changes in the use of other bank products (excluding the
              main account holder’s primary savings account) following the launch of the ISIW
              promotion in April 2011. In table 9.5, we again restrict the sample to accounts
              active prior to April 2011. Outcomes are the change in the rate of product initia-
              tion in May 2011 relative to March 2011 (the month prior to the ISIW promotion).
              Each column reports a differences-in-differences specification as described in
              the previous section. We find that ISIW led to small significant increases in the
              usage of other products at ICB relative to the same trends at Access Bank. In the
              short run, ISIW led to a 5 percentage point increase in the use of other bank prod-
              ucts. Gains in the usage of credit cards and nonsavings products are smaller in
              magnitude, indicating that customers primarily used other similar products—e.g.,
              a secondary savings account or checking account. This evidence is suggestive
              that customers may have opened additional accounts to become “doubly” eligible
              for the savings lottery.
                    In unreported results, we also test whether the staggered release of new
              media promotions affected the usage of other bank products and find insignif-
              icant effects. Finally, we explore the long-run effect of ISIW on other product
              usage and find insignificant effects.

9.5.4	      Impact of lottery drawings on savings balances
Table 9.6 explores changes in savings account balances and activity following the
ISIW lottery drawings. Panel A exploits regional variation in when lottery draw-
ings were held. Panel B exploits branch-level variation in whether the branch was
the home of winners of the largest prize, the car. Panel C exploits branch-level
variation in the percentage of account holders at the branch who won any lottery
prize. Observations in panels B and C are limited to the sixth round of lottery
drawings (this round was the largest regional drawing, including all branches in
Lagos and northeastern Nigeria). We limit the sample to this round of drawings
because it is currently the only round for which we can link all lottery winners to
home branches.
     The outcome in column 1 is the daily change in the savings account balance
(account balance at day end minus the account balance in the previous day).
The outcome in column 2 is an indicator for whether the daily change in savings
account balance is positive. The outcome in column 3 is an indicator for whether
there was any account activity on each day. We explore these indicator variables
because we currently are unable to link lottery winners to individual savings
accounts. Therefore, we cannot exclude lottery winners from the specifications
in column 1. Lottery winners may directly experience large increases in savings
balances, which can affect our estimates. To ensure that this does not bias our
results, we focus on columns 2 and 3, which use indicator variables as the outcome
variables. In these specifications, a small handful of lottery winners with poten-
tially large changes in balances are unlikely to significantly alter the results. All
event windows measure calendar days relative to the day of the lottery drawing
(day 0). All other variables are as defined in previous tables.

Note: Standard errors, at the bank branch level, in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significance at the 10%, 5%,
and 1% levels, respectively. Observations in panels B and C are limited to region 6 (the largest region, including Lagos),
because of data limitations regarding the identity of lottery winners. The outcome in column 1 is the daily change in the
savings account balance (account balance at day end minus the account balance in the previous day). The outcome in
column 2 is an indicator for whether the daily change in savings account balance is positive. The outcome in column 3 is
an indicator for whether there was any account activity on each day. Event windows measure calendar days relative to
the day of the lottery drawing (day 0). All other variables are as defined in previous tables.




                         In panel A, we find that the staggered timing of lottery drawings across
                     regions did not significantly affect savings balances. Nonetheless, the magnitude
                     of the coefficient in column 1 is suggestive. In each of the seven days following
                     the regional lottery draw, savings accounts experienced a N= 16 increase relative to
                                                                       9.  Learning by doing?  ◾ 311

the seven days preceding the lottery draw, totaling an average increase of N
across all accounts active prior to the lottery drawings.
    In panels B and C, we find that focusing on local branch-level effects leads to
more precisely estimated effects. Customers at branches with a high percentage
of lottery winners or at branches with at least one winner of a large prize increased
savings balances relatively more following the lotteries.
    In panel B, we find that banking with a branch associated with a winner of
a car leads to significant increases in account activity and in positive changes in
the account balances. Relative to the mean proportion of days with a net positive
change in account balances of 0.026, the lottery leads to an increase of 0.10 (an
increase of 28 percent). Relative to the mean proportion of days with any account
activity of 0.067, the lottery leads to an increase of 0.11 (a 16 percent increase).
However, we do not find significant effects with regard to mean daily changes in
net balances, although this measure may be more subject to outlier bias.
    In panel C, we find similar effects of the lottery on those banking with
branches associated with a high proportion of lottery winners. In general,
71.7 percent of branches had a least one lottery winner, averaging to 6.4 winners
per 10,000 customers. We find that a 1 percentage point increase in the propor-
tion of branch customers who win the lottery leads to a 3.8 percent increase the
likelihood of positive changes in account balances and a 1.5 percent increase
in the proportion of days with any account activity. Mean daily changes in net
balances also increase. However, we focus on the results in columns 2 and 3,
which use indicator variables as the outcome variables, because they are less
likely to be influenced by balance changes directly related to lottery winnings. In
unreported results, we extend the event windows to 14 days around the lottery
drawings and find similar effects. However, medium- and long-run effects several
months after the lottery are not significant.



9.6	CONCLUSION
The literature on financial education documents that it has often proven difficult
to design education programs that can lead to significant changes in financial
behavior. This chapter has examined the impact of a large-scale savings lottery
as a potential alternative. Instead of teaching welfare-enhancing financial behav-
iors, ISIW incentivized savings. In this way, the program aimed to change financial
behaviors directly, by “turning a dollar saved into a lottery ticket” that would give
the account holder the opportunity to earn additional returns in the form of cash
and noncash prizes.
    We find that the program affected savings balances in the short run, but
did not have a significant long-run impact on financial behavior. When comparing
bank customers exposed to ISIW with the clients of another bank that did not offer
a similar promotion, we find that the initiation of the program led to a temporary
312  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              increase in the savings balances of existing account holders. At approximately
              2.5 percent of the mean account balance, this change is small in economic terms,
              but within the range of estimates found in the literature on financial education
              (see, e.g., Bruhn et al. 2013; Xu and Zia 2012). The effect of ISIW on savings balances
              is, however, short lived, and disappears when we extend the time window of our
              analysis more than one month beyond the introduction of the program. The intro-
              duction of ISIW also led to a 5 percent increase in the total number of financial
              products used by customers at the treatment versus the control bank. This result
              should, however, be interpreted with caution, as it may reflect existing customers
              opening additional accounts to become “doubly” eligible for the program.
                  Finally, using variation generated by the lottery, we analyze how effective the
              highly publicized lottery drawings are as a means to incentivize savings. We find
              that the lottery drawing itself did not lead to significant changes in balances of
              accounts exposed to the drawing versus branches in regions that did not have a
              drawing at that date. We do find that the demonstration effect of having a lottery
              winner at one’s branch led to significant increases in net savings balances at the
              branch within a seven-day window after the event.
                  Taken together, the results presented in this chapter suggest that savings
              incentive programs, although a potentially promising channel to build financial
              capability, appear to suffer from many of the same limitations documented in
              the literature on financial education: their impact on behavior is relatively short
              lived and quite small relative to the income and assets of the target population.
              Despite the fact that prize-linked products have a number of features that could
              make them an attractive tool to serve as a stepping stone into formal banking
              relationships, it appears difficult to realize this potential even in widely publicized,
              large-scale incentive programs such as the one studied here.
                  The fact that we document significant short-run responses to the introduction
              of the program and the publicity associated with the lottery drawings is sugges-
              tive of a missed opportunity. Both the bank and potential participants would
              benefit from a program that could provide a credible long-term incentive to save
              and establish deeper formal banking relationships. One possible way to do this
              would be to offer savings accounts with an incentive feature as a regular product,
              rather than a one-off promotion. Exploring how to best build financial capabilities
              by integrating such incentive features into financial products is beyond the scope
              of this chapter, but an exciting topic for future research.

ABSTRACT
    Can edutainment be an effective tool to strengthen financial inclusion? In
    collaboration with a local nongovernmental organization (Credit Awareness)
    and a microfinance bank (Accion), we explore the short- and medium-term
    savings decisions of a group of microentrepreneurs in Lagos, Nigeria, by
    inviting business owners to one of four randomly allocated events: a movie
    screening of The Story of Gold —a Nollywood (the Nigerian version of Holly-
    wood) film encouraging entrepreneurs to save responsibly; an event where
    business owners are shown a “placebo” screening of a movie with no finan-
    cial education content and offered on-the-spot microsavings accounts
    through Accion; a combined event, screening The Story of Gold and offering
    on-the-spot accounts; and a screening of the placebo film only as our
    control group. We find that entrepreneurs watching The Story of Gold were
    5 percentage points more likely to open a savings account on the spot than
    those in placebo screenings, and this effect was mostly driven by male busi-
    ness owners. In contrast, less than 1 percent of entrepreneurs who were not
    offered an on-the-spot opportunity signed up for a savings account after the
    screening. In the longer run, only moderate changes in attitudes and percep-
    tions were found, while savings and borrowing behavior was unchanged four

                  months after the screening. This suggests that, while influencing short-term deci-
                  sions is possible, longer-run behavior is far less malleable through one-off events.
                  This chapter contributes to the literature by directly testing the importance of
                  linking emotional stimulus to financial messages in order to influence short-term
                  savings decisions and identifying the important interaction between emotional
                  stimulus and the opportunity to act on this stimulus.




              10.1	BACKGROUND
              Traditional rational agent economic models rely on the assumption that people
              make decisions based on a rational and deliberate consideration of all costs and
              benefits associated with the action, conditional on available knowledge. However,
              low-income individuals regularly make seemingly suboptimal financial decisions,
              and there are strong correlations between financial knowledge, sound financial
              decisions, and the use of financial products (e.g., Hilgert, Hogarth, and Beverly
              2003). This has led to a growing body of literature exploring the importance of
              providing financial education and training to individuals and entrepreneurs to
              effectively improve knowledge, leading to improved financial capabilities and
              decisions. Despite strong correlations (e.g., Lusardi 2007), rigorous causal impact
              evaluations of financial literacy training programs have shown mixed results,
              often with little to no effect on actual behavior (e.g., Cole, Sampson, and Zia 2011)
              or with positive impacts only through resource-intensive interventions (see, e.g.,
              Bruhn, Ibarra, and McKenzie in chapter 7 of this volume). These limited effects
              could be explained by (1) only small increases in actual knowledge, or (2) the fact
              that people do not fully apply this knowledge when making financial decisions
              such as when and how much to save. Evidence from psychology and behavioral
              economics highlights the fact that people act within “bounded rationality,” often
              relying on heuristics to simplify their choices. Kahneman (2003) presents a frame-
              work that differentiates between two states that drive human decision making:
              intuition and reasoning. Decisions based on intuition are “fast, automatic, effort-
              less, and often emotionally charged,” whereas reasoning is “slower, effortful, and
              deliberately controlled” (Kahneman 2003, 1451). He argues that most decisions
              are based on intuition, where reasoning acts as a safeguard, rather than moti-
              vator, of many behaviors. This insight has important potential implications on
              how best to influence financial behavior. Even when people are fully aware of the
              most appropriate action to take, cognitive biases and heuristics may prevent this
              knowledge from translating into action. Thus, the traditional causal framework
              linking improved financial knowledge to changes in awareness, perceptions, atti-
              tudes, and behavior may underestimate important psychological barriers to finan-
              cial inclusion that weaken the suggested causal chain. Acknowledgment that we
              base many decisions on heuristics rather than full information helps to explain
              why, for instance, “rule-of-thumb” approaches to financial education can be more
                                                               10.  Nigeria’s Nollywood nudge  ◾ 317




effective at changing behavior than teaching more detailed accounting principles
(Drexler, Fischer, and Schoar 2012).
    This evaluation explores the effectiveness of mass and social media in deliv-
ering financial messages in order to induce behavior change beneficial to recipi-
ents. Specifically, building on the evidence that emotions and heuristics are likely
to influence decisions, this study explores the effectiveness of using a Nollywood
movie, The Story of Gold, to relay a simple message of safe saving and responsible
borrowing through an emotionally charged storyline to a group of 2,938 micro-
entrepreneurs in Lagos, Nigeria. By intertwining the main message of respon-
sible financial behavior into an accessible, entertaining, and relatable story about
twin sisters trying to succeed in business, the movie appeals to emotion, without
providing specific information related to common measures of financial literacy
such as understanding interest rates and inflation. The underlying assumption is
that a movie loses its entertainment value when people start explaining how to
calculate risk-adjusted returns to investments.
    The Story of Gold is a one-off event aiming to influence transient emotions
and lower transaction costs. However, responsible saving is a long-term commit-
ment requiring continued and deliberate effort. The objective of the study was
to identify whether this one-off event could spur action (in our case, opening
a microsavings account) and serve as a catalyst to build financial capabilities
through direct and continued exposure to financial institutions and products. The
theory of behavioral consistency—where actions based on transient emotions
have been identified to influence later decisions derived from people’s desire to
be consistent with previous actions—justifies the possible effectiveness of this
“foot-in-the-door” hypothesis, but there is limited evidence on how this might
influence savings behavior in particular.1 Hence, shedding some light on whether
and how interventions that work through affecting perception and emotions in
the short term can produce change in behavior and commitment in the longer
term is an important empirical topic.
    The study uses a 2x2 randomized factorial design to exogenously vary
(1) exposure to The Story of Gold and (2) access to financial products by offering
free on-the-spot microsavings accounts through a microfinance bank (MFB) at
selected screening events. Through this framework, we are able to test the rela-
tive effectiveness of (1) using “edutainment” (i.e., education through entertain-
ment) to motivate action, (2) reducing access constraints to financial products,
and (3) the interaction of these two.
    We find that entrepreneurs in all three treatment arms increase self-reported
trust in MFBs, but the treatment arms including The Story of Gold had a larger

              effect on male self-reported trust. The combination of the movie with the pres-
              ence of an MFB to help facilitate the opening of a savings account (at the time of
              the screening) was substantially more effective in motivating business owners
              to open an account than the presence of an MFB combined with a placebo
              screening—and this was most effective for influencing male decisions, increasing
              savings account sign-up rates from 1 percent to 11 percent. Four months after
              the event, we find limited or no sustained impacts on perceptions of MFBs and
              intention to borrow and save, and no effect on the likelihood of having a savings
              account (we find that many of the business owners who opened an account at the
              screening already had a savings account, resulting in this null effect).
                      This suggests that, even with relatively low-budget productions, it is possible
              to use entertainment to motivate action in the short term, but long-term behavior
              is less malleable.2 Furthermore, having a direct opportunity to act in the moment
              may significantly increase the impact of edutainment activities that influence
              transient emotions. Care needs to be taken when developing the choice architec-
              ture designed to nudge people toward more “optimal” financial decisions, as this
              may induce unexpected behavior leading to further suboptimal outcomes.
                      The rest of the chapter is structured as follows: in section 10.2, we explain our
              rationale to test edutainment—in contrast to more standard financial education
              programs—as a means to change savings behavior. In section 10.3, we describe
              the interventions; sections 10.4 and 10.5 provide an overview of the identifica-
              tion strategy, sampling, baseline balance, and attrition. Section 10.6 presents the
              econometric framework for analysis. Section 10.7 presents results, with robust-
              ness checks included in section 10.8. We provide a discussion and conclude in
              section 10.9.



              10.2	          A NUDGE FOR BETTER SAVINGS OUTCOMES?
              This section explains the reasoning behind this chapter’s approach to test enter-
              tainment media to nudge savings behavior. It first presents the state of poor
              financial literacy and access to finance in Nigeria. We then show that traditional
              financial education programs have mostly failed to deliver results to ameliorate
              this condition. We next argue that psychological biases might partly cause this
              inefficient savings behavior, and that they cannot be overcome by learning about
              the right way to do things alone. We show how to make existing biases work in
              favor of sound financial decision making, “work[ing] around human nature to help
              people save as they aspire to” (Karlan, Ratan, and Zinman 2013).3 We then present

how edutainment has previously been used to aim at these biases to transform
behavior. Lastly, we briefly describe Nollywood and its potential to serve as a
vehicle to spread messages broadly.


10.2.1	 Financial literacy and access to finance in Nigeria
Although improvements have been registered in the last three years, 46 percent
of the Nigerian population remains financially excluded, with no access to formal
or informal financial services.4 This compares unfavorably to countries such
as Kenya and Botswana (33  percent); in South Africa, only one-quarter of the
population is financially excluded. Only 25  percent of Nigerian’s population has
a formal savings account, excluding 66 million adults. The use of MFB accounts
is even less widespread, with only 4.6  percent of the adult population having
a savings account with an MFB. This lack of access is not derived from a lack
of interest or demand. According to recent survey results, almost 75 percent of
the unbanked population in Nigeria report that they would like to have a bank
account, and over 80  percent of the population receives financial advice from
family and friends. In theory, saving helps individuals and businesses by enabling
consumption smoothing for volatile incomes, serving as insurance for the poor,
growing investments, and allowing better access to microfinance (e.g., Deaton
1989; Karlan, Ratan, and Zinman 2013). However, “…very few people possess
the extensive financial knowledge conducive to making and executing complex
plans” (Lusardi and Mitchell 2013). But knowledge and acting on knowledge are
two different concepts, and individuals often make poor financial decisions—
even when better options are readily available (Pathak, Holmes, and Zimmerman
2011; Willis 2011), and even when they express the desire to act differently (Thaler
and Benartzi 2004). Building financial capacity in Nigeria represents a big step in
helping consumers acquire the skills and knowledge to be capable, confident, and
self-reliant when making financial decisions. Evidence on the best way to build
this capacity is, however, lacking. It is within this context that the World Bank has
worked closely with the Central Bank of Nigeria to develop and implement the
World Bank–funded Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises project to test innova-
tive consumer education programs such as the one evaluated here.5

              10.2.2	 Financial education and business training programs
              In order to improve financial decision making, a common strategy is to offer finan-
              cial or business training. Evidence on the impact of these programs is mixed.
              While financial literacy is correlated with household well-being (Mulaj and Jack
              2012) and less financial decision-making errors (Lusardi and Tufano 2009; Stango
              and Zinman 2009) research results do not fully support a causal chain leading
              from financial education to higher financial literacy and subsequently improved
              behavior (Duflo and Saez 2003; Willis 2011).6 Financial literacy may therefore be
              a secondary or even tertiary determinant of individual financial behavior (Cole
              and Fernando 2008). Intensity, exposure, quality, and training content also vary
              widely (Drexler, Fischer, and Schoar 2012). Willis (2011) argues that effective
              financial education would need to be “extensive, intensive, frequent, mandatory,
              and provided at the point of decision making, in a one-on-one setting, with the
              content personalized for each consumer.” Also, participation levels for voluntary
              financial education programs are “extremely low,” even for very short courses
              (see chapter 7). This presents a concern regarding the power of the analysis; but
              more broadly, not attending the courses might be an expression of economically
              optimal behavior by the potential recipient, reflecting the poor perceived efficacy
              of these programs.7 The poor results of traditional education programs made us
              think about alternative interventions such as making use of existing behavioral
              biases to change detrimental behavior.


              10.2.3	 Bounded rationality
              A large body of literature from the fields of psychology and behavioral economics
              attempts to shed light on the fact that individuals often make irrational decisions
              or “mistakes” (being limited by “bounded rationality”), even when they know
              better. To present a framework of this bounded rationality, Kahneman (2003)
              introduces the “architecture of cognition,” distinguishing two models of thinking
              and deciding, broadly (and metaphorically) summarized as intuition—System 1—
              and reasoning—System 2:

                   The operations of System 1 are fast, automatic, effortless, associative, and often
                   emotionally charged; they are also governed by habit, and therefore difficult to



              6 
                 An increase in knowledge does not necessarily change attitudes and habits, also among
              more educated populations (Thaler and Benartzi 2004).

               In their literature review, McKenzie and Woodruff (2012) come to the conclusion that many
              7 


              impact evaluations of training programs are inconclusive due to technical shortcomings
              such as heterogeneity in length, content, and types of firms participating. Many studies
              are underpowered, with hurried follow-up surveys (within one year of the training) covering
              small sample sizes, making it difficult (or impossible) to detect long-term effects. They also
              suffer from attrition and measurement problems of relevant business indicators.
                                                                   10.  Nigeria’s Nollywood nudge  ◾ 321




     control or modify. The operations of System 2 are slower, serial, effortful, and
     deliberately controlled; they are also relatively flexible and potentially rule-gov-
     erned… (Kahneman 2003, 1451–52).


     The two systems can provide crucial insights on how to influence financial
decision making. If System 1 mainly drives financial behavior (intuition), models
aiming to affect behavior through System 2 (reasoning) such as information
campaigns or business training, assuming a “rational agent of economic theory”
(Kahneman 2003), might prove to be ineffective (which is supported by some
evidence; see, e.g., Cole, Sampson, and Zia 2009).8


10.2.4	 Accessing System 1
References (such as expectations, emotional and motivational arousal, and other
phenomena) can increase the accessibility of thoughts that are important for
decision making (Andrade and Ariely 2009). Loewenstein and Lerner (2003) argue
that even small “primers” can influence behavior, even when this “priming” is
unnoticeable by the stimulated individual.9 In the field of marketing, Bertrand et
al. (2010), for example, find that “persuasive” advertising can play a significant role
in decision making, even if the content of the advertising is not directly related to
the product being sold. There are different kinds of references applicable to our
setting, as discussed below.


THE “AFFECT HEURISTIC”
People tend to base decisions that are being taken now on past decisions (uncon-
sciously), shortcutting the thought-intensive System 2 process of deliberately
evaluating the pros and cons of the respective decision at hand. They also base
decisions on whether they like something, rather than carefully evaluating bene-
fits and disadvantages (Slovic et al. 2007), answering a difficult question (what
are the pros and cons?) by answering the easier question instead (how do I feel
about it?)—a cognitive shortcut, where intuition (which resembles perception)
acts as a substitute for reasoning (Kahneman 2003). Advertising professionals
often make use of these phenomena by focusing on conveying a good feeling
about their product to their audience rather than stressing the beneficial effects
of a purchase.

   Kahneman, e.g., argues that the assumption that deciders evaluate outcomes by the
utility of final asset positions is “easily” proven to be wrong.

322  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              BEHAVIORAL CONSISTENCY
              Another important heuristic is the tendency to behave consistently with previous
              decision making (Cialdini, Trost, and Newsom 1995). Although the incidental effect
              of emotions might be short lived, the influence of mild incidental emotions can last
              longer than the emotional experience itself (Andrade and Ariely 2009). Goldberg,
              Lerner, and Tetlock (1999), for example, illustrate the effects of an anger-inducing
              film on subsequent—unrelated—actions. Decisions based on a short-lived inci-
              dental emotion can develop the foundation for future choices and hence outlive the
              original cause (the emotion) for the behavior (Andrade and Ariely 2009). Retrospec-
              tively, people tend to identify their past choice as an expression of their past prefer-
              ence (Schwarz and Clore 1983); in reality, thoughts and actions are rather intuitive
              most of the time (as argued in Kahneman 2003). In this manner, initial emotions
              serve as an “anchor” for later decisions (Tversky and Kahneman 1974), reinforcing
              behavioral consistency.10 Similarly, hypothetical commitment carries over to real
              decisions if they are presented later (Ariely, Loewenstein, and Prelec 2003).11


              KNOWLEDGE AND TRUST
              An initial reference or action can have longer-lasting effects by fostering cooper-
              ative behavior based on knowledge and trust in the institution generated through
              repeated interaction (Mailath and Samuelson 2006). Once the initial burden of
              interacting in a new environment is overcome, subsequent interactions might
              become easier, as benefits become more salient. Following this rationale, expo-
              sure to media that induce emotions can trigger an initial action, providing a “foot-
              in-the-door,” which may influence later actions (Freedman and Fraser 1966).


              EMOTIONS AND DECISIONS: GENDER DIFFERENTIALS
              A sizable body of research looks into the question of whether emotions show
              differential gender effects on risk preferences, social preferences, and compet-
              itive preferences. Harshman and Paivio (1987) review evidence on studies
              showing that women experience emotions more strongly than men. Women are
              often more risk averse (Croson and Gneezy 2009; Sunden and Surette 1998) and
              tend to save more conservatively than men (Hinz, McCarthy, and Turner 1997).12
              However, Finucane et al. (2000) find gender differences only for whites (“white

              have a hard time to correct previous actions by realizing financial losses, consequentially
              making things worse (Arkes and Blumer 1985; Thaler 1981).
              11 
                  Other relevant studies on past decisions affecting the present include Ottati and Isbell
              (1996) and Pocheptsova and Novemsky (2010).

male effect”), which hints at cultural biases causing gender differences. Brought
together, the literature suggests that gender differentials tend to be context (and
culture) specific with few clear and unambiguous traits across population groups
and activities.


10.2.5	 Edutainment and behavior change
Drawing from the above-mentioned studies and findings, the question arises as
to whether (1) commercial entertainment media could be used to combine infor-
mation (education) delivery with (2) behavioral treatment arms, such as nudges,
varying choice architecture, and/or emotional stimulation. Could combining
the two perhaps help improve literacy levels and, at the same time, overcome
some of the psychological barriers that stimulate bad behavior? While commer-
cial media have for a long time been associated with effective changes in social
behavior (both positive and negative), they have rarely been used in the field of
finance. In other sectors, such as health and education, these tools have been
used with success for a long time. For instance, as Brazil’s Rede Globo network
grew through the 1970s and 1980s, women also began having fewer children,
experiencing the same decrease in fertility as with two extra years of education
(La Ferrara, Chong, and Duryea 2012).
    While using mass media to transmit educational messages is not a novel
approach, using edutainment to improve financial capabilities is less explored.
The telenovela Nuestro Barrio is a prominent example from the United States
aimed at Hispanic immigrants, where research found that it successfully conveyed
the importance of formal bank accounts to the largely underbanked community
(Spader et al. 2009). Most recently, a World Bank–supported study evaluated the
impact of a South African soap opera with financial messages (Scandal!). The
study made use of an encouragement design to compare outcomes between a
randomly selected group that watched Scandal! and another group that watched
a “placebo” show without financial education content. Watching Scandal! resulted
in higher financial knowledge scores, increased borrowing from formal sources,
and decreased the likelihood of entering into hire purchase agreements (see
chapter 11).
    Edutainment, as an alternative to more formal classroom learning, has the
potential to be distributed more widely at lower marginal costs and may appeal
to a broader base, reaching out to people who may not otherwise be interested in
the topic. By creating emotional connections to the characters and the storyline,
the process is believed to help internalize and operationalize the learning. Since
this is a relatively new approach in the field of finance, there is a need for rigorous
evaluation of these programs to assess the extent to which entertainment media
are indeed effective in changing individuals’ financial behavior. In particular, one
question is about the role of edutainment through a one-off event (as is the case
for The Story of Gold ) as opposed to continued exposure to the message (as in
324  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              the case of the soap operas mentioned above) that could make the emotional
              connections much stronger.


              10.2.6	Nollywood
              Movies from the Nigerian film industry penetrate almost all households in
              Nigeria—and across much of Africa—making them the ideal platform to deliver
              edutainment content. Although producing relatively low-budget films, Nollywood
              is now the second largest movie industry in the world in terms of production,
              only trailing India’s Bollywood, with an output of about 200 films every month.
              The industry is also the second largest employer in Nigeria, after the govern-
              ment. Films are largely made for home consumption rather than for the bigger
              cinema screenings. The stories told put fundamental human emotions and strong
              narratives front and center: love, hate, envy, upward mobility, urban culture, and
              witchcraft. Due to their ubiquity, movies have the potential to reach large audi-
              ences with ease, surpassing traditional ways of conveying messages. Even poli-
              ticians have understood the potential of these movies, posing with their stars at
              rallies and events. President Goodluck Jonathan recently announced support for
              aN= 3 billion facility to support the Nigerian movie industry (Vanguard 2013). With
              financial and political backing, together with large demand, Nollywood provides a
              unique opportunity to disseminate knowledge and build a culture of responsible
              financial decision making, reaching out to otherwise marginalized communities.


              10.2.7	Application
              Under the assumption that System 1 is a driver of many financial decisions and
              accessibility and “narrow framing” (Kahneman and Lovallo 1993) and references
              are indeed important, The Story of Gold was developed to place more weight on
              intuition than reasoning to influence decision making.13
                    The movie seeks to address System 1 in order to encourage behavior change
              by promoting the take-up and use of savings accounts in the short term and
              encourage sustained use by building experience (offering a foot in the door) and
              promoting longer-term behavioral consistency with the original action. Thus,
              while the Nollywood movie could possibly also augment knowledge and aware-
              ness that in turn leads to better reasoning, the main intention of using the movie
              is to target business owners’ intuitive behavior by influencing emotions, making
              relevant thoughts more accessible—especially when coupled with the immediate
              availability of signing up for savings accounts after the screening (reduction of
              transaction costs).




                Kahneman (2003) stresses the point that preferences of System 1 are shaped by emotions
              13 


              of the moment and need not be internally coherent or reasonable. The preferences of
              Systems 1 and 2 therefore do not have to be consistent.

10.3	          DESCRIPTION OF INTERVENTION
The Story of Gold is a feature-length Nollywood movie produced and distributed
by Credit Awareness, a local nongovernmental organization promoting “safe
savings and responsible borrowing.”14 It tells the story of identical twin sisters in
Nigeria. Although identical in appearance, the decisions they make when faced
with different financial choices affect their lives as well as those around them
and ultimately lead them down different paths, one making sound financial deci-
sions and succeeding in business and the other falling into a debt trap. The movie
aims to impress upon low-income individuals with limited formal education the
importance of saving with a formal financial institution and borrowing respon-
sibly. Focusing on this simple message and highlighting the repercussions of
poor financial decisions, The Story of Gold focuses on the heuristic and emotional
elements of human decisions to promote a stronger savings culture, facilitated
by Credit Awareness. A partner MFB, Accion, participated in selected screening
events and briefly presented its main savings and borrowing products after the
show.15 It then provided all the necessary paperwork for participants to open a
“Brighta Purse” business savings account on the spot if they were interested in
doing so. The microsavings account is geared toward microentrepreneurs as an
entry savings and transaction account, requiring no initiation fees (although a
minimum balance of N= 500 is needed—one-third of average daily profits from our
sample of entrepreneurs). Interest in this savings account is then a function of
the amount of savings held. If entrepreneurs expressed an interest in opening an
account but did not have the opening balance on hand, they could sign up their
names and contact details and follow up with Accion at a later date to confirm the
account opening. In this case, the combined intervention aimed at simultaneously
encouraging people to save through the movie’s message while reducing access
barriers almost to zero with the presence of the MFB at the screening events. The
hypothesis was that the movie would serve to inform, and also motivate business
owners to act and open a new savings account. The motivational effect of the
movie was expected to wear off soon after the screening; giving business owners
the opportunity to act in the moment may increase the potential for this short-
term motivation to translate into action. By overcoming these barriers to formal
financial participation, the study could then explore whether this engagement
resulted in longer-term interactions, leading to improved use of financial products
over time.
        While Credit Awareness plans to roll out the screening events across the
country, the evaluation focused on a series of early pilot screenings to test the

              modality and learn before scale-up. The pilot screenings were conducted at local
              community halls in the Ikotun region of Lagos—home to a sprawling street market.
              The typical screening event would be held in a hall, with local traders invited to
              attend. The event lasted approximately three hours, starting with a brief introduc-
              tion, the screening of the movie, and an open discussion after the event to reflect
              on the story’s core messages. This would be followed by engagement with the
              MFB. For the purpose of the evaluation, two extra elements were included to the
              standard Credit Awareness model: (1) to ensure compliance with the assignment
              strategy, each participant received a personalized invitation with a photograph to
              confirm his or her identity; and (2) to improve participation rates, a lottery was
              held at the end of the event in which participants could win spot prizes.



              10.4	     SAMPLING AND IDENTIFICATION STRATEGY
              Two community halls large enough to hold 200 people were identified in the
              Ikotun area of Lagos. A radius of 2 kilometers was used to set the boundaries to
              ensure that all participants could easily access the halls without needing to use
              public transport. A census of the area was then taken in July 2012, together with
              a short baseline listing questionnaire used to stratify the sample as to whether
              they had a savings account, whether they kept financial records, and if their store
              was in the main (official) market area or in the surrounding Lagos streets. In total,
              2,938 microentrepreneurs were recorded with geopositioning and photographs
              to confirm their identity in follow-up interactions and verify intervention compli-
              ance (see figure 10.1 for an example of the invitation created from this infor-
              mation to verify identity at the event). The criterion used for selection into the
              sample was being the owner/operator of a business operating within the study
              area. These businesses were then randomized into one of five groups: (1) pure
              control, (2) placebo screening, (3) The Story of Gold screening (Movie), (4) placebo
              screening plus presence of MFB (MFB), and (5) The Story of Gold screening plus
              presence of MFB (Movie/MFB).
                  The pure control group was not invited to attend any screening. The other
              four groups were invited to attend one of eight screenings (two per group). Invi-
              tations were delivered one week before the screening, and two screenings took
              place every Thursday during September 2012 for four weeks. Invitations to each
              screening were identical, and events were held at the same time each week (8 –11
              a.m.), chosen because the cleaning of the market took place at this time, ensuring
              low opportunity costs to participation since businesses were not allowed to trade
              during this time. This uniformity of invitations and event dates was used to mini-
              mize the possibility of differential take-up across screening events.
                  In placebo screenings, people were shown a Nollywood movie that had
              no financial messages associated with it, but were given a brief talk after the
              event about the importance of hygiene in markets to provide quality products

and services. This was done explicitly to control for the event effect of having
received a personalized invitation and participation in a big screening event
possibly confounding results, and also to create a comparable group of compliers
in both treatment and control groups to simplify the analysis. The standard Credit
Awareness program (screening The Story of Gold and interacting with an MFB)
was split in order to differentiate the impact of the movie from the increased
access of financial products coming from the MFB’s presence. As such, a 2x2
factorial design was implemented for the treatment arms in order to detect the
differential impact of each component and the interaction effect relative to the
placebo screening.
    In total, 1,261 people (60 percent of those invited) attended the movie screen-
ings; a short questionnaire was administered at the end of the event to measure
perceptions and attitudes about savings, borrowing, and MFBs. Administrative
records were kept at the MFB and Movie/MFB events to record the people who (1)
engaged with Accion to open an account at a later stage and (2) actually opened
an account at the event.
    Four months later, in February 2013, a follow-up survey was conducted on
all baseline respondents to collect longer-term data on attitudes, intentions, and
behaviors with respect to saving and borrowing activities to assess the longevity
of any impacts identified at the screenings.

              10.5	     OUTCOME MEASURES, BASELINE BALANCE, AND
                        ATTRITION

              10.5.1	 Outcome measures
              The main outcome measures are aligned with the essential messages of the Nolly-
              wood movie. They can be divided into four categories that capture (1) percep-
              tions of MFBs, (2) perceptions of women, (3) intentions to save or borrow, and
              (4) savings and borrowing behavior.
                  Regarding the perceptions of MFBs, the survey asked the microentrepreneurs
              if they agree or disagree with statements such as, “I would trust an MFB to keep
              my money safe,” “MFBs treat people with respect,” and “If I apply to an MFB for a
              loan, my application will be accepted.” Since the movie focused on female entre-
              preneurs as the main protagonists, we also explore self-reported perceptions of
              female business competence and access to financial opportunities. Questions
              designed to explore perceptions of women as business owners or financial deci-
              sion makers ask respondents if they agree or disagree with statements such as
              “Women can run businesses just as well as men,” “Women make better financial
              decisions than men,” and “It is easier for men to receive loans than for women.”
              The intention to save or borrow questions capture whether respondents agree
              with statements such as “I plan to apply for a loan in the next six months” or “I
              will save some money next month.” Self-reported savings and borrowing behavior
              is captured through responses to questions such as “I saved money last month,”
              the amount of total savings relative to the monthly income earned, savings kept
              at MFBs, savings at commercial banks, outstanding loans from commercial banks,
              MFBs, suppliers, moneylenders, or family/friends. Actual savings behavior is
              measured through administrative records of those who engaged with represen-
              tatives of Accion to open an account and those who actually opened an account
              at the screening event.
                  Neither financial knowledge nor basic numeracy skills were specifically
              addressed in the movie’s storyline. Nevertheless, the survey also included six quiz-
              like questions with true and false choices to assess respondents’ understanding of
              basic financial concepts as well as their numeracy skills. The underlying motivation
              for including these questions is that economic models of savings and investment
              choice consider both as indispensable for good financial decision making (Lusardi
              and Mitchell 2013). In particular, respondents were required to do simple division,
              perform basic calculations related to interest rates, identify the better bargain
              among two different savings and loan products, and demonstrate their under-
              standing of how inflation affects their savings. Lastly, one question aimed to eval-
              uate respondents’ know-how in successfully interacting with financial institutions
              (awareness of required documentation for being able to open an account).
                                                             10.  Nigeria’s Nollywood nudge  ◾ 329




    Since single questions provide a rather incomplete picture of respondents’
levels of financial knowledge, an arithmetic financial knowledge score ranging
from 0 to 6 was calculated by summing up the correct answers to these six ques-
tions.
    To reflect the level of difficulty associated with each question, an alternative
financial knowledge score has been developed, which weights every question
with the inverse of the proportion of respondents who were able to provide a
correct answer. Larger weights are given to questions that fewer people answered
correctly.


10.5.2	 Baseline balance
Table 10.1 reports summary statistics for the entire sample, as well as for each of
the five assignment groups for all exogenous variables including information from
the baseline listing and time-invariant variables measured at follow-up. Results
are thus reported on balance for business owners who were included in both the
baseline and follow-up surveys (n = 2,357). The microentrepreneurs comprising
the total sample are on average 38 years old, predominantly female (71 percent),
married (84 percent), Christian (64 percent), and able to speak English (70 percent);
they completed high school as their highest level of education (50 percent), and
live in households with an average size of 4.5 individuals. They are experienced
in running a business (on average around 11 years of experience), and more than
half of the sample (57 percent) already holds a savings account.
    Given that treatment was randomly assigned, the five assignment groups
are expected to have similar characteristics. Columns 4, 6, 8, and 10 in table 10.1
show the mean baseline characteristics of all microentrepreneurs surveyed at
baseline by treatment group (including the pure control). Columns 5, 7, 9, and
11 report the p-values of the t-test for equality of each of these mean baseline
characteristics against those in the placebo control group. No characteristics are
significantly different from the placebo control group at the 5 percent level for the
three treatments, except for the proportion of Igbo business owners in the Movie/
MFB group. The expectation of balance on observable baseline characteristics
also holds across treatment groups, which supports our claim that the random-
ization worked well. We see for the pure control group, however, that 3 of the 26
characteristics are significantly different at a 5  percent level (we would expect
significant difference in 1 of every 20 measures by chance). Of particularly concern
is an imbalance in having a savings account (56  percent in the placebo control
group; 63 percent in the pure control group). This is likely to have been driven by
differential nonresponse at follow-up, where we find higher nonresponse rates in
the pure control group. We also explore balance across treatment groups for male
and female business owners separately (tables 10A.1, 10A.2, 10A.3, and 10A.4 in
the annex to this chapter) and find similar results.

     Table 10.2 reports the mean characteristics of those who were assigned to a
screening event (column 1), which excludes individuals in the pure control group;
and details observable differences of those who attended (column 2) with those
who did not (column 3). As indicated in column 4, the selection into screenings is
strongly correlated with more educated microentrepreneurs, who are more likely
to speak English, enjoy higher access to financial products, and keep financial

              records for their business. This selection process may be explained by the way
              the screening events were framed: business owners were told that they were
              invited to a business development event, and the invitation was in English (see
              figure  10.1). Since a major aim of edutainment is to reach out to the “bottom
              of the pyramid,” future edutainment activities may want to consider framing
              the event less as business development and more as entertainment, as well as
              promoting and designing it in such a way that language is not perceived as a
              barrier to attendance. Overall participation rates are reasonably high (60 percent)
              when compared to other financial literacy programs, but it is clear that nonpartic-
              ipants present a target group that potentially has the most marginal added value
              to participation but is at the same time the most difficult group to entice into
              these types of events.
                  Although there is strong evidence of self-selection into screening events,
              table 10.3 shows that the drivers of this selection across screening events appear
              to be the same. For those who participated, we see balance across observable
              characteristics—which is in line with the fact that all screening events were
              marketed in the same way with the same characteristics. This balance of selec-
              tion across events supports the possibility of comparing attendees against each
              other, rather than needing to rely on the intention to treat estimates.


              10.5.3	Attrition
              The attrition rate in this study is 21.1 percent, which is relatively high compared to
              other household surveys (e.g., EFInA 2010 had an attrition rate of 6 percent), but
              within reason when compared to enterprise surveys. Intensive efforts were made
              to reach all respondents who were listed at the baseline, but around 12 percent
              could not be contacted again, some refused to be reinterviewed (2.9  percent),
              and a very few (0.3 percent) were unable to participate (e.g., for health-related
              reasons). This attrition rate also includes former microentrepreneurs (5.7 percent),
              who may not be considered as being eligible anymore, because they shut down
              their business between the baseline listing and the endline survey. If former
              microbusiness owners are not taken into account, the attrition rate is reduced to
              16.3 percent. There is some evidence for selective attrition for the pure control
              group, but good balance between the placebo and three treatment arms. Attrition
              is largest in the pure control group (25.5 percent) when compared to the control
              and treatment groups (20.2  percent). Table 10.4 suggests a random pattern of
              attrition for the three treatment arms when compared to the placebo control
              group, but a large and significant differential attrition in the pure control group.
              This differential attrition is reinforced by the balance results from table 10.1, and
              may result from the fact that pure control business owners were only contacted
              at baseline and follow-up. In contrast, all other groups had another intermediate
              contact to receive the screening invitation, making them (1) more aware of the
              activities, and (2) easier to track. Given the significantly lower response rate in the

              pure control group, we subsequently analyze treatment effects by comparing the
              placebo screening group with the different treatment arms.
                   When data are analyzed by simply excluding respondents with missing values
              for any relevant outcome measures—item nonresponse (INR)—this could again
              cause biased results if missingness is systematically related to a respondent’s
              potential outcomes. Table 10.5 presents INR rates for main outcome measures
              across different treatment and control groups. For instance, for the question of
              basic understanding of inflation, it can be seen that 100 percent of the surveyed
              microentrepreneurs are asked this question (column 1) and that 2.37 percent
              of those who are asked do not give a response (column 2). Overall, the data in
              table  10.5 indicates that INR for main outcome measures is not a critical issue
              (most of the time, INR rates are less than 5 percent) and nondifferential across
              treatment and control groups. Interestingly, INR is the lowest for measures of
              intentions, saving, and borrowing behavior, whereas highest INR rates (between
              10 and 20 percent) can be observed for questions related to perceptions about
              MFBs—possibly reflecting cases where business owners have not interacted
              with MFBs and therefore have not been able to form an opinion. Table 10.5 also
              reveals a striking increase in INR for the questions of perceptions about MFBs
              at the endline survey relative to the data that were collected shortly after the
              screening. This increase does not interact with a particular treatment status and
              may be due to different modes of interviews and the design of the questionnaires.
              While the short survey conducted right after the screenings was self-adminis-
              tered by attendees, the endline survey was conducted face to face. To avoid unit
              nonresponse and potential measurement errors, the self-administered question-
              naire was designed to be as simple as possible and only asked dichotomous (yes
              or no) type of questions with no explicit “don’t know” or “refusal” choices. This

              means that direct comparison over time (e.g., through a difference-in-difference
              approach) would present challenges; however, similar response patterns across

              that they are indistinguishable across control and treatment groups, we take
              no specific measures to address this type of missingness. Nevertheless, we do
              account for missing data on covariates. In the regression analysis, coefficients
              of predictors of interest are adjusted using a procedure advocated by Cohen et
              al. (2002), whereby measures with missing values are replaced by zero and a
              dummy variable indicating such missing values is included. The logic behind this
              approach is that the dummy variables adjust the parameters for theoretically rele-
              vant predictors by removing variance that can be attributed to missing data that
              is lurking in the dependent variable (McKnight, McKnight, and Figueredo 2007).
              This also avoids losses in sample size during regression analysis in cases where
              observations would otherwise be dropped due to missing covariate responses.



              10.6	      MODEL SPECIFICATIONS
              In this study, we effectively have three treatment arms: MOVIE, MFB, and MOVIE/
              MFB. Given that the intervention assignment was randomly allocated, we can
              measure the causal impact of these interventions through a simple linear regres-
              sion that identifies the average treatment effect using the intention-to-treat esti-
              mator:

              	                                Yi = α + ∑3    γ T + Xi+ εi	(10.1)
                                                         j = 1 j ij


              where Yi is the outcome interest for participant i, and Tij is the treatment status
              for person i with regard to treatment j. Treatment j = {1,2,3}, for each of the three
              treatment groups. Xi is a vector of exogenous control variables collected at base-
              line or time-invariant variables collected in the endline survey.16 We run the same
              regression without controls and find point estimates to be unchanged in the anal-
              ysis, consistent with the balanced nature of the selected control variables, and as
              such we report the adjusted results in the chapter.
                    Since we are particularly interested in gender differentials, our second spec-
              ification explores the impact heterogeneity by gender:
                                                          3
              	                         Yi = α + βGi + ∑j = 1(γj + Gδj)Tij + Xi+ εi	(10.2)

                 The control variables included in the analysis are: business owner age, marital status,
              ethnicity, ability to speak English, education level, household size, religion, business expe-
              rience, number of employees at baseline, whether they had a savings account or kept
              financial records at baselines, and whether they operated in the main market area or in the
              outskirts (geographically defined through global positioning system [GPS]).
                                                                10.  Nigeria’s Nollywood nudge  ◾ 337




Here Gi = 1 if male, 0 if female. The regression results presented in the tables
generated from the analysis include the effect of treatment j on females (γj), the
additional impact for males (δj) and the overall gender differential Gj. Each table
of results presents results from equation 10.1 first, followed by gender-disaggre-
gated results from equation 10.2.
      In section 10.3, we see that overall selection into the movie screening is such
that those who attended the events were slightly different from those who did
not. However, we find that this selection pattern is the same across all screening
events (based on balance of observable characteristics) and, importantly, there
are no differential selection patterns between the three treatment arms and the
placebo screening. In this case, we run a restricted analysis on those business
owners who actually attended the event. Relying on the balance across an exten-
sive set of baseline variables and the manner in which the events were imple-
mented (randomized invitations at the individual level), we reasonably expect this
comparison to provide an unbiased estimate of the average treatment effect on
the treated—the impact for those who actually attended the event, using equa-
tions 10.1 and 10.2 with the restricted sample of 1,261 participants.
      We acknowledge that, if there are large positive spillovers, this may result in
a downward bias of the estimate of impact. As such, the survey included control
clusters that were created through geographic discontinuities, where a self-con-
tained cluster meant that all businesses within the cluster were at least 20 meters
away from the next closest business outside of the cluster.17 This sampling
method creates a “pure” control group less exposed to treatment neighbors, thus
exogenously varying the level of intensity of treatment in any particular area of
the market, theoretically allowing us to explore spillovers. We see, however, in
the pure control group that we experience differential attrition resulting in an
imbalance based on baseline observable variables. As such, we exclude this
group from analysis in this chapter. In the following section, we present results
using equation 10.1 with the restricted sample of business owners who actually
attended a screening, using the placebo group as our control comparison.

                  private with complete control over the entrance and exit of the events. Although
                  participation rates averaged around 60 percent, contamination was very low as a
                  result of this process. Table 10.6 highlights this fact, where less than 1 percent of
                  invited guests went to a different screening than the one to which they had been
                  assigned—strengthening the justification of using equations 10.1 and 10.2 with
                  our restricted sample to measure the average treatment effect on the treated.
                      In the follow-up survey, we asked for self-reported exposure, partly to
                  confirm attendance, but also to understand whether people could remember the
                  main activities and messages from the events; this is presented as a summary in
                  table 10.7. While people have no problem recalling the screening, they express some
                  confusion about the details of the event. We find that 95 percent of people recall
                  receiving an invitation and 96 percent of the people who were recorded through
                  administrative records as attending the event confirmed that they had attended.

                  they had done so; 77 percent and 82 percent, respectively, could recall the main
                  message of the movie without prompting. However, placebo screening and MFB
                  groups also reported having seen the movie, although at significantly lower levels
                  (59 percent and 58 percent, respectively). Since the movie was tightly controlled
                  and not released to the public, this suggests a potential confusion between The
                  Story of Gold and the placebo movie screening—possibly confounded by the fact
                  that neighboring businesses may have seen and mentioned something about the
                  movie.
                      Recall of Accion presence was much lower. We find significant increases in
                  recall for MFB and Movie/MFB compared to Movie and control as expected, but
                  the proportions are still low. Only 16 percent of MFB attendees and 17 percent
                  of Movie/MFB attendees recalled Accion’s presence at the event. We also asked
                  a falsification question to assess the level at which respondents may have been
                  adjusting their answers to respond positively to the interview. We find that only
                  1 percent of people responded positively to a question asking whether a certain
                  MFB (Jaiz Bank), which is only based in Abuja, had visited them (an impossibility);

this is similar across treatment arms, suggesting that positive response bias does
not seem to be a problem in our case. Since the interventions were monitored
carefully and Accion was indeed present at these events, this contrast between
Accion and The Story of Gold recall highlights the differential salience of each of
the interventions.


10.7.2	 Financial literacy
The quiz questions test basic numeracy and financial concepts. Since the movie
screening aimed to influence emotions and perceptions rather than formal
financial literacy, we expected these indicators to show balance across groups,
which they do. Aggregating the questions into a single index, we find two things
(table  10.8): (1) scores are very similar across all groups; and (2) the aggregate
scores are relatively high, with the weighted and arithmetic scores yielding similar
results—perhaps reflecting a lack of variation and cognitive separating ability of
the set of questions. However, when exploring the covariates associated with
these financial literacy scores, we find strong relationships between the overall
score and (1) whether business owners had a savings account at baseline and (2)
whether they had any schooling, supporting the assertion that the indexes are
informative in distinguishing between financial literacy levels, and the similarities
in scores across groups reflect balance induced by the randomization.

10.7.3	Perceptions
We find increases in self-reported trust and perceptions of MFBs directly after
the screening events; however, when asked the same questions in the follow-up
survey, many of the initial differences reduce or disappear.18 While males are
influenced most strongly by the movie stimulus in the short run, differentials in
self-reported trust only sustain for females in the longer run. Table 10.9 presents
the results from the screening and endline surveys. While the movie on its own
has some impact on whether people report that they would trust an MFB to keep
their money when they were asked this question at the screening, the presence
of Accion seems to have a much larger effect than the movie, and there is no
additivity of the interventions (although both are significant and positive). In the
second follow-up survey, we see that the differential between control and treat-
ment group trust declines; however, it is the movie treatment arms that sustain
results, where the impact on MFB reduces to insignificance. This sustained impact
is almost entirely driven by females, even though males were most affected by
the movie in the short run. A supporting question identifying positive perceptions
of MFBs (“MFBs treat people with respect”) shows similar results, with larger
impacts for males in the short run, followed by some limited but sustained differ-
ences for females in the longer run—even when male differentials disappear. This
significant impact is only found in the combined Movie/MFB arm.
      We also explore perceptions of ease in obtaining a loan and riskiness of doing
so. Both the Movie and MFB treatments have a significant positive effect on busi-
ness owners’ perception of how likely it is that they may receive a loan if they
applied for one in the short run (this falls away completely in the longer run), but
none of the interventions have any impact on beliefs of the risk in taking out a
loan. We also explore perceptions of female business owners (table 10.10).


10.7.4	Intentions
We tested business owners’ intentions about their saving and borrowing plans,
once again through the screening questionnaire and in the follow-up, with results
presented in table 10.11. Here there is mixed evidence, with some impact on
borrowing intentions, but no changes on what are already very high intentions
to save. Intention to save is almost universal—90 percent of respondents at the
screening and 95  percent in the follow-up indicated that they planned to save




  Direct comparison between the two follow-up surveys should be handled carefully.

Although the questions asked were identical, the response method varied across data
collection activities. In the immediate follow-up, the question responses were yes/no, and
the questionnaire was self-administered. In the four-month follow-up survey, the question-
naire was administered by an interviewer and response options were strongly agree, agree,
disagree, strongly disagree.

the past month (65  percent in the endline survey—table 10.12), it is clear that
there is a disconnect between intentions and behavior, with many more business
owners planning to save but not necessarily following through with these plans,
reinforcing the possibility that various frictions may be reducing people’s ability to

                   translate intention into action. The reason for this disconnect could be manifold—
                   hyperbolic discounting, lack of disposable funds, overconfidence, limited access
                   to financial products—and we cannot necessarily disentangle all of these factors.
                   However, we do see that the interventions provided have little influence on what
                   are already very strong self-reported intentions to save, suggesting that this is not
                   likely the channel through which any behavior change occurs.

10.7.5	 Savings behavior
At screening events with MFBs present, business owners were able to discuss
savings opportunities with the MFB and sign up for a savings account on the spot
if they were interested. Participants had two options when expressing interest in
opening an account with the MFB: (1) business owners would meet with the MFB
and sign up for a follow-up visit to open an account, or (2) business owners would
sign up for an account on the spot. Table 10.13 reports on the data collected at the
two types of screening events (MFB, Movie/MFB) showing that people were more
likely to express interest in opening an account by visiting the MFB stand directly
after the event in the MFB group (13 percent versus 8 percent). However, differ-
entiating this visit into each of the two options available (signing up on the spot or
agreeing to a follow-up visit to sign up for an account), we find substantial differ-
ences. The majority of people in the MFB group who visited the MFB stand opted
for a follow-up visit rather than signing up on the spot. However, the Movie/MFB
combination event was substantially more effective at incentivizing on-the-spot
savings account sign-ups at the event; this effect was strongest for male partici-
pants. The Movie/MFB combination event motivated 7 percent of participants to
open an account on the spot (compared to 2 percent in the MFB group). This effect
was substantially different between male and female participants (5 percent of
females and 11 percent of males). The overall difference is statistically significant,
but the gender-disaggregated differences are only significant for males.
    Although the MFB event was moderately successful in encouraging people to
visit the MFB stand and agree to a follow-up visit (11 percent), on further inspec-
tion we find that none of the people in this category actually followed up after
the event (table  10.12). In fact, the only people who followed up with an MFB
after the screening came from the Movie group, where the MFB had not been
present. Although it is a small fraction (2 percent for both males and females), this
is the only group with a statistically significant increase. The results provide the
following insights: (1) reducing access barriers to virtually zero (MFB condition)
increases engagement with the MFB and reported interest in opening an account,
but has only a modest effect on actual sign-up rates; (2) even without having an
immediate call to action (the ability to open an account on the spot) The Story of
Gold has some (although very limited) impact on short-term behavior, inducing
2 percent of participants to follow up with an MFB afterwards (Movie condition);
but (3) combining the reduced access constraint with the movie designed to
promote savings (Movie/MFB) provides the strongest incentive to open a savings
account, mostly driven by male participant choices. The evaluation design helps
to deconstruct some of the potential barriers to demand for a savings account
and identifies that an educational event attached to an emotional stimulus can be
an effective tool to increase take-up, but only when combined with an interven-
tion that allows for immediate action. However, this tells us little about savings
behavior after the event.

                         Despite the strong impacts observed, important concerns arise from the
                   follow-up findings. First, we find that 67 percent of all participants who opened
                   a savings account at the event reported having a savings account at baseline
                   (significantly higher than the average for our sample). While there may be rational
                   reasons to hold multiple accounts (or to change accounts), the finding reinforces

the fact that the intervention may be inducing action only in a subpopulation that
has lower marginal gains in doing so when compared to the unbanked target
population. The second related concern is that in the follow-up, we find no distin-
guishable difference in whether respondents have a savings account—which is
not surprising given that the majority of those induced to open an account already
had one prior to the screenings. Of greater concern, however, we find that males
in the Movie/MFB group report having been less likely to save some money in the
month prior to the follow-up survey and show no differences in savings amounts
relative to their income. While it is not clear what may be driving this result, it is
possible that the event—although successfully motivating business owners to act
in the moment and put money in a new savings account—only served to displace
future savings, with no net gain.


10.7.6	 Borrowing behavior
For borrowing behavior, we rely only on self-reported responses in the follow-up
survey. The movie message centered on responsible borrowing, highlighting
the problems with relying on moneylenders, and we reflect on this through two
particular indicators: (1) borrowing rate in last 4 months and (2) the source of

              borrowing. In particular, we were interested in identifying whether business
              owners used formal or informal sources for financing. We find first that borrowing
              rates are substantial—about half of all business owners reported taking out a
              loan in the past four months, and half of those who took a loan did so from an
              informal source. The interventions have no effect on borrowing rates (although
              there is a reduction in all treatment groups, it is not significant). Similarly we
              find little to no evidence in changes in the form of lending (table 10.14), although

females in the Movie/MFB group reduce informal lending by 14 percentage points,
which is borderline significant. Interestingly, there seems to be more congruency
between intentions to borrow and actual borrowing than for savings intentions
and behavior. While 54 percent of people mentioned that they were planning to
take out a loan in the next six months immediately after the screening, we find
four months later that 51 percent of people did so. This contrasts sharply with the
intended savings (90 percent) and actual savings rates (60 percent); this seems to
confirm that, in terms of savings behavior, there are several additional barriers at
play besides those that the interventions address directly.



10.8	      ROBUSTNESS CHECKS
Our results show a significant effect of Movie/MFB on motivating business owners
to open a savings account, but little to no evidence of longer-term impact on a
broad range of savings and borrowing perceptions and behavior. A null effect
could be a result of (1) limited power, driven by sample sizes too small to detect
true impacts; (2) spillovers improving outcomes for the control group; or (3) selec-
tion bias resulting from the control group participants having different participa-
tion decisions than our treatment groups.
      Power is of particular concern when we measure heterogeneous impacts
by gender, given that only 28 percent of our sample is male. We run each of the
regressions reported in this chapter for the entire sample (without differentiating
by gender) and continue to find mostly null to low effects on our outcomes of
interest in the four-month follow-up.19 Here our sample is substantial, and power
is less of a concern. However, in most cases, the point estimate of the effects is
so small that the interpretation of the results would not change even in cases we
were to have enough sample power to estimate these small changes.
      The study was originally designed to account directly for potential spill-
overs, given that all participants came from the same market area and interac-
tion between participants was expected. The pure control group was generated
using cluster randomization to address this; however, as mentioned previously,
we are unable to use this group due to selective attrition and cannot rule out
potential spillovers. Given that we see the strongest effects of the intervention in
the immediate term, and given the nature of the program (increasing short-term
motivation rather than focusing on financial content), it seems somewhat unlikely
that second-hand information passed from treatment to control business owners
is likely to be a serious concern.




  As expected, we do find cases where significant results in the gender-disaggregated
19 


analysis become nonsignificant in the pooled specifications, particularly when male and
female effect coefficients have opposite signs.

                      Our restricted regression analysis used throughout the chapter effectively
              reports on the average treatment effect on the treated, without reference to the
              intention-to-treat results—which limits the scope of interpretation to effects on
              those who were actually convinced to attend the event. We run intention-to-treat
              regressions, including all business owners invited to the screening events on
              outcomes who were recorded at the endline, but do not report these results here.
              Unsurprisingly (see discussion above on why we can rely on the treatment effect
              on the treated in this context), the null effects remain; and our outcomes where
              impacts were found mostly remain significant, albeit with lower point estimates
              for impact.20
                      Finally, reflection on the savings account take-up rates on which we find
              significant impacts is required. Why is it that males react most strongly to the
              screening event in the short run? This could reflect the fact that male emotions
              are affected more than females, inducing action; but may equally reflect the possi-
              bility that females have added constraints beyond motivation that affect take-up,
              such as low liquidity or limited autonomy in financial decision making. The liter-
              ature has found that females often make decisions jointly with their spouse or
              other counterpart, when compared to male business owners. However, we find
              that business autonomy is balanced across gender in our sample, with 92 percent
              of males and females reporting that they make business decisions on their own.
              We do find, however, that business revenues and profits across gender differ
              significantly, with males having nearly twice the yearly profits of females. Selec-
              tion equations regressing profits and revenue with the likelihood of opening an
              account show no relationship. Furthermore, we find that intermediate outcomes
              such as increased self-reported trust in MFBs are substantially stronger for males
              than females. This suggests that, rather than females facing added constraints
              that the screening event does not overcome, the events have a differential effect
              on perceptions by gender that seems to be driving the differential take-up of
              savings accounts at the event.



              10.9	          DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
              The primary role of the evaluation was to explore the use of a new medium to
              transmit financial messages, focusing on the use of heuristics and emotions to
              spur action in the short run with the intention of getting business owners a foot
              in the door to use financial products more regularly, learning and building expe-
              rience thereafter. The second objective was to identify how access to financial
              products and motivation interact to induce action, and whether choice architec-
              ture can be effectively utilized to promote welfare-enhancing financial decisions.

    The results from the evaluation are mixed, and warrant further discussion on
three issues of importance for policy dialogue: (1) the ability of edutainment to
reach out to the targeted population, (2) the role of choice architecture on influ-
encing short-term decisions, and (3) ensuring sustained behavior change.
    Recent evidence has highlighted the challenges to encouraging people to
attend voluntary financial literacy workshops and other training programs (see
chapter 7). Low take-up rates are common, and this is especially true for interven-
tions targeting business owners. Business owners may be making a rational deci-
sion to avoid the training because of low perceived benefits. Using edutainment
to transmit financial messages is a new approach that has the potential benefit
of being more inclusive, lowering barriers to participation. Response rates in this
study of approximately 60 percent reflect the fact that, even though these events
are able to reach out to the majority of potential participants, this is far from
universal and more effort is needed to find ways to market these events to have
more mass appeal. In particular, the least educated people with lowest access
to financial products were the ones who selected out of the screening events,
highlighting the difficulty of reaching out to this subpopulation.
    The study identifies a strong interaction between offering a stimulus (the
movie) together with a direct outlet (the presence of the MFB) for acting on this
motivation. This result is not surprising, and replicates what is well known among
marketers in a development setting. However, applying choice architecture to
a development setting requires careful attention to the potential unexpected
outcomes that may result. In our case, the one-off screening was effective at
encouraging people to open new accounts; but on closer inspection, nearly
two-thirds of these people already had savings accounts, possibly limiting the
potential marginal impact of the work. This highlights the importance of testing
potential interventions at a pilot level, measuring and understanding the determi-
nants of take-up before scaling up.
    While the intervention was able to influence decisions in the short run, people
make financial decisions on a daily basis, and more sustained behavior change is
critical in the context of saving. Our limited longer-term impacts emphasize this
point. The ability to spur people to action through the use of edutainment may
have more development impact for activities that are beneficial as one-off actions,
particularly given the intervention’s relatively low cost and simple logistics. Exam-
ples of where these types of interventions could work in other development areas
include, for instance, encouraging people to test themselves at mobile clinics for
HIV/AIDS or taking vaccinations, where one-time actions of groups of people at
once can have important private and public benefits. This approach could also be
tailored to more sustained financial behavior change if coupled with commitment
savings accounts—where decisions taken in the moment have a more binding
effect in the longer run (Ashraf, Karlan, and Yin 2006). However, take-up of finan-
cial instruments tells us little about how this increased exposure may strengthen
financial capabilities—responsible use of these instruments and financial decision

              making more generally. The literature has traditionally explored the direction for
              strengthening financial capabilities as going from education to better financial
              decision making and increased use of financial products. There is less under-
              standing of how a learning-by-doing approach—focusing on providing access to
              financial instruments and exploring how this translates into experiential learning
              and ultimately improved decision making. While we have seen that nudges can be
              developed to help overcome the access constraint, it is still unclear as to whether
              this can be effectively translated into strengthened financial capabilities in the
              longer run.

ABSTRACT
     This chapter exploits the emotional connections and viewer attentiveness of
     mainstream media to evaluate the economic impact of financial education
     messages on debt management delivered through a popular television soap
     opera in South Africa. The study uses a symmetric encouragement design
     to compare outcomes of individuals who were randomly assigned to watch
     a soap opera with financial messages, Scandal!, to those of individuals who
     were invited to watch a similar soap opera without financial messages,
     Muvhango. Both shows overlapped in evening primetime and had similar
     past viewership profiles. The financial storyline spanned two months and
     featured one of the leading characters of the show borrowing excessively




We would like to thank our direct project counterparts, Ochre Media, the production
company of Scandal!, in particular Stan Joseph and Lebogang Ramafoko who coor-
dinated the development of the storyline; the National Debt Mediation Association
for supporting the project, in particular Magauta Mphalele; and TNS South Africa, in
particular Bobby Berkowitz, who offered keen intellectual insights into the survey
design. We are also grateful for comments and input received from Claus Astrup,

sentatives from the National Treasury, the Financial Services Board, the National Credit
Regulator, and the Credit Ombudsman. Special thanks to Christian Salas Pauliac and

                  and irresponsibly through hire purchase, gambling, ending up in financial distress,
                  and eventually seeking help to find her way out. Two intermediate and one final
                  follow-up surveys were conducted as part of the study. The analysis finds individ-
                  uals assigned to watch Scandal! had significantly higher financial knowledge of
                  the issues highlighted in the soap opera storyline, in particular messages deliv-
                  ered by the leading character. On behavior, Scandal! viewers were almost twice
                  as likely to borrow from formal sources, less likely to engage in gambling, and
                  less prone to enter hire purchase agreements. Messages promoting a national
                  debt mediation helpline delivered by an external character did not sustain traction
                  beyond immediate interest. Three qualitative focus groups highlight the impor-
                  tance of emotional connections with the leading character in motivating behavior
                  change.




              11.1	INTRODUCTION
              Financial education is important, yet there is a considerable knowledge gap in
              determining how best to deliver it. The literature on careful evaluations of finan-
              cial literacy is small but growing, and has moved away from classroom-based
              interventions, such as Cole, Sampson, and Zia (2011), to more innovative delivery
              mechanisms, such as videos and DVDs (Carpena et al. 2011). Yet the scope and
              reach of even the best produced DVDs is limited on the supply side, and attracting
              viewership can be significantly challenging on the demand side.
                  Entertainment media—television and radio—offer not only broader outreach,
              since nearly every household nowadays has a TV, but also a captive audience.
              Furthermore, as emotional connections are established between a show and its
              audience, the program provides a potentially powerful platform for communi-
              cating messages and influencing behavior.
                  There is considerable anecdotal and some survey evidence on the impact
              of mass media on behavior, especially in the areas of health and education. For
              instance, as Brazil’s Rede Globo television network grew through the 1970s and
              1980s, women began having fewer children, and experienced the same decrease
              in fertility as with two extra years of education (La Ferrara, Chong, and Duryea
              2008). Similarly, one of the most successful public health campaigns in the Arab
              Republic of Egypt—the central component of which was a soap opera—was highly
              successful in improving the use of oral rehydration therapy and reducing infant
              mortality rates by 70  percent (Abdulla 2004). In other studies, the introduction
              of television has been linked to decreased domestic violence and fertility rates
              in India (Jensen and Oster 2009), and lower adolescent drug use and increased
              contraception adoption in Brazil (Verner and Cardoso 2007).
                  The emotional connections channel is particularly central to media campaigns.
              Advertisers, for example, consistently and successfully use influence on emotions
              to affect consumer choices (Bagwell 2007; Russo, Carlson, and Meloy 2006; Stigler
              1987). In the financial context, Bertrand et al. (2010) and Agarwal and Ambrose
                      11.  Harnessing emotional connections to improve financial decisions  ◾ 363




(2007) show that persuasive advertising and direct mail solicitation can influence
consumer loan contract choices. Perhaps the most direct anecdotal evidence on
the power of emotional connections with television personalities comes from the
United States, where Kennedy et al. (2004) find that the greatest number of calls
to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s AIDS hotline in one year came
not as a result of a million-dollar public awareness campaign or through news and
documentary broadcasts, but rather in response to a beloved soap opera char-
acter dealing with his HIV-positive diagnosis.1
        This chapter contributes to the literature by carefully analyzing the impact of
financial education messages delivered through a popular South African television
soap opera, Scandal! In partnership with the production company of Scandal!, the
soap storyline features one of the main characters borrowing excessively through
hire purchase, gambling, falling into a debt trap, and eventually seeking help to
find her way out and manage her debt responsibly. The storyline plays out over a
two-month period, and the study evaluates the effectiveness of these messages
through two intermediate surveys and one final follow-up survey conducted
four months later. Further, three qualitative focus groups provide insight into the
mechanisms behind measured impacts.
        The methodological challenge associated with such an evaluation is nontrivial.
Critically, it is impossible to externally restrict viewership since the soap opera is
nationally televised with no variation in TV signal strength, at least in urban areas
where this study focuses. Even an encouragement design methodology is limited
in scope as we can only encourage a set of individuals to view Scandal!, but in no
way can we prevent others (particularly those in the control group) from doing
the same.
        To overcome this constraint, we employ a symmetric encouragement design
in this study. Specifically, while a randomly selected treatment group is encour-
aged through financial incentives to view Scandal!, another set of individuals—the
control group—is similarly encouraged through identical financial incentives to
view a comparable soap opera (Muvhango) that overlaps with Scandal! in tele-
vision primetime. Hence, we are able to create an artificial separation between
treatment and control groups that enables us to identify the treatment effects of
financial literacy delivered through Scandal!
        Our results are quite encouraging. First, we confirm that the overwhelming
majority of individuals (96  percent) assigned to watch the two soap operas in
fact watched them, with very little overlap—less than 12 percent of Muvhango
viewers claim to have also watched Scandal! during the study period, and a third
of these viewers watched several other shows too. Moreover, such crossovers
will only underestimate treatment effects.

                  We measure and study outcomes along the causal chain of impact from
              financial knowledge to financial behavior, as per Carpena et al. (2011). The anal-
              ysis shows significant improvements in content-specific financial knowledge—a
              4.5  percentage point increase—and no differences in knowledge of financial
              concepts that were external to the soap storyline.
                  Central to the theme of the soap was highlighting the high interest charges
              and hidden costs of borrowing through hire purchase. Our analysis on finan-
              cial behaviors finds a significant and substantial increase in the likelihood of
              borrowing through formal channels—22 percent compared to 13 percent in the
              control group—and a greater likelihood to borrow for productive purposes such as
              investments in household durable goods and vehicles. We also directly measure
              hire purchase use and find a significant reduction in the likelihood of entering into
              such contracts—15 percent compared to 19 percent in the control group. Further,
              we find a 5 percentage point lower propensity to gamble among the treatment
              group, yet another theme highlighted in the show. These are promising results
              and point to successful dissemination of themes depicted in the soap storyline.
                  One aspect of the storyline that did not sustain traction beyond immediate
              effects was a public call to action for the South African National Debt Mediation
              Association (NDMA). The soap featured an NDMA counselor who helps the main
              character build a financial plan to enable her to save enough to repay her debts.
              The actual NDMA toll-free helpline also appeared at the end of several shows. The
              findings on this public call to action are quite stark. While we see a huge uptake in
              the number of calls received within days of the NDMA being featured in the soap,
              the longer-term analysis shows no recall of the NDMA or even memory that a debt
              counselor appeared in the soap storyline.
                  These quantitative results hint at the mechanism of our measured impacts.
              Specifically, the behavior change in our study tracks well with the storyline that
              featured the main soap character, who herself depicted poor financial behavior
              before transforming her habits. This character was part of the show prior to the
              two-month financial storyline and remained part of the show afterwards. The
              nonresult on knowledge of the NDMA could at least partly be explained by the
              fact that the NDMA messages were delivered not by the main character, but by
              a different character who was external to the main soap cast and who appeared
              in two or three episodes as an NDMA counselor and then disappeared. Hence,
              the audience did not get the opportunity to establish or maintain a connection or
              following with this character.
                  In order to further assess the merits of this emotional connections channel,
              we conducted three qualitative focus group discussions with study participants
              three months after the final quantitative survey. In these meetings, the focus
              group leaders were unable to elicit recall of NDMA from the participants; only a
              few women seemed to remember, and they associated their memory more with
              the fact that the NDMA character was female rather than her representation of
              the NDMA. In contrast, all participants readily recalled the main soap character
                   11.  Harnessing emotional connections to improve financial decisions  ◾ 365




and aspects of the financial storyline delivered by her. Upon further inquiry, they
attributed better recall to the fact that the character was a mainstay in the soap
opera, and was popular and likable.
     Overall, our findings suggest an important role for entertainment media as
an accessible and important tool for policy makers to deliver carefully designed
educational messages that resonate with the audience and can potentially
influence financial knowledge and behavior. Further, our findings suggest that
emotional connections and familiarity with media personalities certainly play
a role in motivating knowledge and behavior change among viewers, and that
harnessing such potential can be an important channel for achieving develop-
ment impact.
     This chapter is organized as follows. Section 11.2 provides a brief litera-
ture review on financial literacy and mass media. Section 11.3 focuses on finan-
cial education in South Africa and explains the study context and soap opera
storyline. Section 11.4 outlines the research methodology and study timeline, and
section 11.5 presents summary statistics. Section 11.6 provides the main analysis
and discussion of results, and section 11.7 concludes.



11.2	      BACKGROUND AND LITERATURE

11.2.1	 General financial education evaluations
Making informed financial decisions and evaluating complex financial choices
remains a challenge for large parts of the population across the world (Lusardi
and Mitchell 2007; Lusardi, Mitchell, and Curto 2010). While financial literacy
training has been heavily promoted as a solution, evidence of its effectiveness is
limited. A recent study finds muted evidence that financial education influences
the demand for savings accounts in Indonesia (Cole, Sampson, and Zia 2011). A
more comprehensive video-based financial education program in India is asso-
ciated with large and statistically significant improvements on knowledge and
awareness of financial products and services, and some moderate improvements
in savings rates (Carpena et al. 2011).
     To date, debt literacy research has been limited to survey-based studies.
Lusardi and Tufano (2009) find that debt literacy levels are generally low in the
United States, especially among women; and that some groups perceive their
knowledge to be higher than it actually is. More work has been published on the
effects of mortgage counseling,2 however, such facilities are rarely available in
developing countries.

              11.2.2	 Mass media for edutainment
              Mass media outlets, including television and radio, have been used successfully
              to deliver educational messages in developing and developed countries (Kenny
              2009). For example, Verner and Cardoso (2007) find that access to TV lowers
              the probability of teen pregnancy and risk-taking in Brazilian favelas. Similarly,
              Jensen and Oster (2009) analyze the power of TV to shift cultural roles of women
              by studying the effects of satellite or cable service installation in Indian villages.
              Access to TV increases women’s autonomy and female school enrollment, while
              fertility, tolerance of domestic violence, and the preference for sons appear to
              decrease.
                  Entertainment education through soap operas is quite popular in Spanish-lan-
              guage telenovelas. The Peruvian series Simplemente Maria became a success in
              educating and inspiring people to take actions to improve their own lives (Singhal,
              Rogers, and Brown 1993). Similarly, the U.S. soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful
              successfully reached at-risk minority women when a storyline was accompanied
              by display of a free hotline number. Further, after an HIV-positive character was
              diagnosed—a subplot that lasted only two shows—the number of calls to the U.S.
              Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s AIDS hotline spiked substantially.
                  Examples of education through entertainment media come from other parts
              of the world as well. The radio soap opera Apwe Plezi was broadcast between
              February 1996 and September 1998 in St. Lucia, with themes including family
              planning and sexually transmitted disease prevention. Vaughan, Regis, and St.
              Catherine (2000) carried out personal interviews (753 pretest and 1,238 posttest)
              and find that although only small changes were observed, the program had a
              positive effect on knowledge and change of attitudes with a minimal change in
              behavior.
                  Similarly, Paluck and Green (2009) evaluate the effectiveness of a radio
              program on conflict resolution and intergroup tolerance in Rwanda using a
              group-randomized research design. For one year, the treatment group was
              exposed to the reconciliation program, while the control group listened to
              a program about health and HIV. The authors observe increased dissent from
              popular opinion and also increased collective action among the treatment group.
                  In Tanzania, the soap opera Twende Na Wakati was broadcast between 1993
              and 1997, with messages promoting adoption of family planning methods and HIV/
              AIDS prevention. Rogers et al. (1999) and Rogers and Vaughan (2000) evaluate the
              effectiveness of this program and find that the soap opera had strong behavioral
              effects on family planning.
                  Yet another example is from Brazil, where La Ferrara, Chong, and Duryea
              (2008) study the effects of novelas on fertility rates in the 1970s and 1980s. The
              authors find that as a result of the expansion of the Rede Globo network (which
              enjoyed a monopoly position as the supplier of novelas until the 1990s), family size
              was reduced, women began naming their children after soap opera characters,
                  11.  Harnessing emotional connections to improve financial decisions  ◾ 367




and separation and divorce figures went up in the areas that were exposed to the
network. The results can partly be explained by the strong influence of television
in Brazil.
     In Kazakhstan, Seeking Happiness, a six-episode soap opera funded by the U.S.
Agency for International Development, was used to explain capitalism—especially
privatization and rule of law—to the former Soviet country. According to Mandel
(1998), the project failed since the local production company was unfit to produce
a social marketing soap opera, the budget was too small to produce the series
well, and the U.S. Agency for International Development decision makers lacked
experience in rural Kazakhstan. Another soap opera, Crossroads, funded by the
British government, took a different approach to social engineering in Kazakhstan;
it ended up becoming one of the most popular Kazakhstani television programs
in 1998. The most important element for success was ensuring high quality at all
production levels, especially a good storyline and convincing actors.
     Finally, Brown and Cody (1991) explore the effects of a pro-social soap
opera, Hum Log, in promoting the status of women in India. The authors find that
although the soap was popular, it did not significantly influence society’s percep-
tion of women.
     Overall, the use of mass media for spreading social messages is quite
common both in developed and developing countries, with mixed evidence on
effectiveness.


11.2.3	 Mass media and financial education
The use of mass media, and specifically soap operas, to communicate financial
capability-related messages is a relatively new approach to financial education,
and the few existing financial literacy mass media programs have not yet been
rigorously tested for their effectiveness.
     The telenovela Nuestro Barrio in the United States was one of the earliest
soap operas to incorporate financial literacy messages. It was aimed at educating
Hispanic immigrants about financial matters and promoting the use of bank
accounts. It was primarily directed toward households outside the formal finan-
cial system with the goal of making these products and services attractive.
     Similarly, Makatuno Junction, a Kenyan soap opera that is still in produc-
tion, includes financial literacy themes. Since 2005, the series has reached large
audiences in Kenya (over 7 million viewers in 2009), Uganda (3 million viewers in
2009), and Tanzania (2 million viewers). Among the many storylines featured in
the soap, the series has encouraged viewers to open bank accounts, to save, and
to budget. The soap has also featured other social messages, such as malaria
prevention, contraception, and schooling. Yet, to date, no careful evaluation of
these messages has been conducted.
     Apart from television, the online world has stepped into the fray of finan-
cial education. The most prominent example is the U.S. nonprofit, Doorway to
368  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              Dreams (D2D), which offers online games that teach players important lessons
              on managing finances. Tufano, Flacke, and Maynard (2010) analyze the impact of
              these video games on low-income and minority adults and find that the games
              improved financial knowledge and confidence, although the sample size and
              scope of this study were fairly limited.
                  Yet another entertainment outlet, theater, has been used to spread financial
              messages. The VISA Financial Literacy Road Show is a traveling theatrical perfor-
              mance that provides educational messages on financial matters in unbanked
              communities in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, the program has never been eval-
              uated.


              11.2.4	 Evidence on emotional connections through media
              The evidence on using emotional connections to connect with target audiences
              is varied. Several factors and external impulses have been shown to affect
              consumer decisions. Numerous factors—from the messenger, to the setting, to
              the method of delivery and phrasing of the message—matter when communi-
              cating information.
                  The clearest example of persuasive messaging comes from advertising.
              Advertisers regularly use influence of emotions to affect and complement
              consumer preferences (Bagwell 2007; Stigler 1987). Russo, Carlson, and Meloy
              (2006) further argue that persuasive advertising can lead decision makers to
              make inferior choices. Bertrand et al. (2010) are among the first to systematically
              study how persuasive advertising influences consumer choice. The authors carry
              out a large-scale direct mail field experiment to study the effects of advertising
              content on real decisions in South Africa, and find that factors such as framing
              and phrasing—such as including a picture of an attractive female accounts
              manager—influences loan demand. Similarly, Agarwal and Ambrose (2007) study
              the impact of direct mail advertising on financial decisions and find that adver-
              tising campaigns have a persuasive effect on loan contract choices.
                  Outside of the financial realm, Evans (1963) finds that demographic similar-
              ities between the client and the salesperson influence retail demand. Similarly,
              an experiment involving door-to-door charitable fundraising finds that attractive
              female solicitors secure significantly more donations (Landry et al. 2006). Further
              evidence on the influence of emotions through media comes from Anschutz et al.
              (2008), who find that body size of television actors affects personal body dissatis-
              faction and actual food intake.

11.3	       FINANCIAL EDUCATION IN SOUTH AFRICA

11.3.1	 The South African context
Household debt has been a large and growing problem for South Africa over the last
decade. The ratio of household debt to disposable income was 76.3 percent in the
second quarter of 2012, up from 50 percent in 2002 (South African Reserve Bank
2012). In June 2012, the National Credit Regulator reported that, of the 19.6 million
consumer borrowers in its records, 9.22 million (47 percent) had impaired records
(NCR 2012). Of the consumers with impaired records, 19.5 percent were in arrears
for three months or more, 13.3 percent had adverse listings, and 14.2 percent had
judgments and administration orders issued against them. What is particularly
troubling is that the percentage of consumers with impaired records has been
above 45 percent since December 2009.
     Financial woes in South Africa are not limited to indebtedness. The savings
rate of households is, at 1.7 percent in the second quarter of 2012, very low
(South African Reserve Bank 2012). In fact, according to Finmark Trust (2012), a
large percentage of the South African population (67 percent) does not save at all,
even though the majority of adults believe that saving is important. In addition, of
those who save, only 22 percent save through formal channels, either with banks
or other formal financial institutions.
     The Financial Services Board, the statutory regulator of the nonbanking finan-
cial sector in South Africa, undertook a nationally representative study on finan-
cial literacy levels in South Africa in 2011.3 The survey focused on four key areas
of financial literacy: day-to-day money management, financial planning, choosing
appropriate products, and financial knowledge and understanding. One of the
central findings from this survey was that financial literacy is, to a large extent,
dependent on educational attainment and income levels (Roberts and Struwig
2011). For example, the presence of a household budget—indicative of a higher
awareness of financial management—is strongly related to income levels, with
79 percent of households in the top income quintile having household budgets,
compared to 36 percent in the lowest income quintile.
     Income differences are also prevalent in the sources of information that influ-
ence individuals’ decisions regarding financial products. While individuals in the
richest quintile are far more likely to consult the Internet, independent financial
advisers, or friends in the financial services industry, the poor are more likely to
rely on public resources such as newspapers, radio, and television. In general,


3 
  A total of 3,112 South Africans (individuals aged 16 and above living in South Africa) partic-
ipated in the survey. The study was undertaken in collaboration with the International
Network on Financial Education of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Devel-
opment.
370  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              the importance of public media for financial decisions is high across all income
              groups, with 33 percent of respondents indicating that TV and radio programs or
              advertisements were the source of information that most influenced their deci-
              sions about financial products; this shows the potential media has to influence
              financial decisions and behavior in South Africa.
                      Against this backdrop, financial education through popular media is poten-
              tially a powerful tool to stimulate improvements in financial knowledge and
              behavior. This chapter exploits this potential to study the effectiveness of finan-
              cial messages delivered through a popular soap opera.


              11.3.2	 Scandal!
              South Africa has a well-developed media industry with popular television shows
              reaching millions of viewers. Further, educational messages in health and educa-
              tion have previously been incorporated in soap operas such as Soul City.
                      The target soap opera for this study is Scandal!, which has been running for
              eight years (more than 1,500 episodes) and produces four weekly episodes. The
              show is broadcast on eTV, the second most popular station in South Africa,4 and
              is especially popular among low-income South Africans.
                      The storyline for this study was developed by the production company of
              Scandal!, Ochre Media, together with the NDMA and a team of financial capability
              and social marketing experts. Messages in the storyline were tested through
              focus groups to ensure that they were correctly understood by the target group,
              that the plot appeared realistic, and that the target group could identify with the
              characters and their problems. All suggested changes and recommendations by
              the focus group members were included in the final storyline.
                      The storylines focused on debt aspects of financial capability, including
              sound financial management (e.g., using credit wisely and borrowing from formal
              sources), avoiding debt traps (e.g., impulse buying and living beyond one’s means),
              and getting out of debt (e.g., practical steps for seeking help). The financial educa-
              tion storyline stretched over a period of two consecutive months, a time that was
              deemed necessary for the viewers to emotionally connect with the characters
              and their problems. Specifically, between February 13 and March 27, 2012, 26
              episodes with financial literacy messages were aired.
                      The objective of the storyline was to positively affect the behavior of medium-
              to low-income South Africans regarding financial literacy and management by
              increasing their knowledge and understanding of personal financial management.
              The story highlighted five major themes:

                      ◾◾ Getting into debt—caused by financial mismanagement, e.g., impulse
                        buying and/or living beyond one’s means

        ◾◾ The effects of financial mismanagement and debt on family and home life
        ◾◾ Acknowledgment that a problem exists with managing finances that has
          led to debt, which in turn has led to other problems
        ◾◾ Getting out of debt—practical steps for seeking help, e.g., debt manage-
          ment, assessment tools, and debt recovery
        ◾◾ Sound financial management, e.g., using credit wisely, borrowing respon-
          sibly, feeling confident.

        In addition, the NDMA was featured prominently in the storyline, and the
main character and her husband seek advice from an NDMA employee who helps
them find their way back to financial responsibility. At the end of each episode
in which the NDMA was highlighted, the actual NDMA toll-free number was
displayed on screen with a public announcement offering NDMA’s free financial
advisory service.
        A detailed synopsis of the show is included in the annex to this chapter.
Further, a short summary video clip of the storyline is available on YouTube.5



11.4	         RESEARCH DESIGN AND TIMELINE

11.4.1	 Research design
Evaluating the impact of a nationally televised soap opera is quite challenging.
First, it is difficult to separate the effect of the soap opera’s message from other
messages on similar issues that individuals and families may be receiving from
alternative sources. Second, certain types of individuals may self-select into
watching a particular soap opera, and hence any subsequent behavior change
is confounded by these selection issues. Third, it is difficult to identify the cause
of any subsequent behavior change as the message itself because the effect of
the message is confounded by the mode of delivery. Specifically, since on-screen
actors typically have a mass following, many of those watching may simply follow
what their favorite actors advocate regardless of the content of the message.
        To overcome these concerns, the project used a random encouragement
design methodology with the following setup. First, a listing exercise of the study
population was conducted during which basic socioeconomic and TV viewer-
ship information was gathered from all households. The evaluation, and hence
the listing exercise, was concentrated in the area of urban Gauteng (with 2,500
respondents from Johannesburg and 500 respondents living in Pretoria). The
listing was done for 3,000 people through physical visits (face to face). It was
ensured that all individuals listed were responsible for their household’s spending

              decisions, watched television soap operas, were 20 years of age or older, and
              belonged to medium- to low-income groups (i.e., classified as 5 to 7 on the Living
              Standards Measure scale).6 To avoid individuals in the sample communicating
              with each other about the soap operas they watch (and thus potentially influ-
              encing each other), only one interview per home/family was conducted, only one
              interview per street was carried out, and two streets were mechanically skipped
              before visiting another household.
                   Next, the study sample of 1,031 individuals was chosen and randomized into
              treatment and control groups. The original study design called for stratification
              by gender, income level, education, and the likelihood of watching soap operas
              to allow for measuring heterogeneous impacts; however, due to an undetected
              coding error, the randomization occurred unconditionally rather than within
              strata. Nevertheless, as the summary statistics in table 11.1 show, the sample is
              balanced across treatment and control on these variables.
                   Since the soap operas were nationally televised, we could not control or
              restrict viewership. In order to encourage individuals to abide by our assignments
              and to create a separation between treatment and control groups, a financial
              incentive was provided for individuals in both groups to watch their respective
              assigned show. Initial telephone calls were made to explain these details to the
              study sample. They were told that we would call them every three to four weeks
              during the next three months and ask them questions about the soap storyline,
              and if they answered three out of four questions correctly they would win R 60
              (US$7) each time. This amount was agreed upon after consulting with the survey
              and production firm and was deemed high enough to encourage participation. An
              auxiliary advantage of providing financial incentives to both treatment and control
              groups was that any confounding effects of the incentive itself on subsequent
              financial attitude or behavior change (i.e., Hawthorne effects) would be netted
              out.7
                   During these calls, in addition to questions about the storyline, the surveyors
              asked questions related to financial knowledge, attitudes, and behavior. Since the
              scope of questions asked over the telephone was limited, a face-to-face follow-up
              survey was conducted four months after conclusion of the storyline with more
              comprehensive knowledge and behavior questions. In addition, administrative
              daily call data were obtained from the NDMA so we could track incoming calls

                 The South African Audience Research Foundation’s Living Standards Measure is the
              most widely used marketing research tool in Southern Africa. It divides the population into
              10 groups, with 10 being the highest and 1 the lowest. The scale cuts across race, gender,
              age, or any other variable used to categorize people. Instead, it groups people according to
              their living standards using criteria such as degree of urbanization and ownership of cars
              and major appliances.

               This design is similar to an experimental evaluation of radio programming to change social

to the financial advisory call center following the public call to action. Finally, in
order to be able to understand mechanisms of impact, three qualitative focus
groups were conducted after the final follow-up survey.
        An important aspect of the above research design is the comparability of
viewers across Scandal! and Muvhango. Clearly, if the demographic profiles varied
substantially, we could have significant differences in take-up among our random
sample of treatment and control groups. Hence, prior to the study, we researched
all available alternative soap operas to Scandal! and found Muvhango to be very
similar in content and in viewership profile.8 Both series had approximately
2.5  million adult viewers who came predominantly from mid- to low-income
groups, and viewership was distributed similarly across race with most viewers
being nonwhite and primarily Sotho-speaking.

                    storyline then began airing from mid-February to end March.
                        The first follow-up computer-assisted telephone interview was conducted in
                    early March, the midpoint of the storyline; the second was in early April, at the
                    conclusion of the storyline. The final face-to-face follow-up survey was conducted
                    four months later, in late July 2012.
                        The results from these surveys were then analyzed and issues highlighted
                    for the qualitative study. Three focus group sessions were conducted in
                    mid-November 2012 to conclude the study.



                    11.5	       SUMMARY STATISTICS, RANDOMIZATION, AND
                                TAKE-UP
                    Table 11.1 presents baseline summary statistics that were gathered as part of the
                    listing exercise. The table first presents means and standard deviations for the
                    full sample, then separately for treatment and control groups, and finally pres-
                    ents p-values for a test of differences in means between treatment and control
                    groups. None of the differences are significant, which confirms that the random-
                    ization was successful.
                        Overall, the sample consists of 70  percent females, which is unsurprising
                    since soap opera viewership is predominantly female. At the same time, however,
                    we strived to include males in the sample; the surveyors made the extra effort to
                    find males who watched soap operas during the listing phase. Since our sample is
                    entirely urban, the level of formal education was relatively high, with 70 percent
                    of the sample having at least graduated from secondary school. A little more than
                    50 percent scored above the median in the financial literacy test, which highlights
                      11.  Harnessing emotional connections to improve financial decisions  ◾ 375




that the mean and median are almost the same—thus, a nice bell-shaped distri-
bution. A little less than half the sample (43–46 percent) belongs to the low Living
Standards Measure group, thus providing variation in income levels. Half the
sample also has a full-time job or other paid work. Nearly 60 percent of the sample
had not borrowed money in the past six months at the time of the baseline survey;
finally, about 50 percent of the sample had watched Scandal! in the past.
     Table 11.2 presents attrition results and notes two important points. First, the
general level of attrition is very low—in the final follow-up survey from which we
obtain knowledge and behavioral outcomes for our analysis, we were able to inter-
view more than 93 percent of the baseline sample. (The response rates on the first
two telephonic surveys were relatively lower, however: 85 percent and 76 percent,
respectively.) Second, there is no significant difference between response rates of
treatment and control groups. Some of the final interviews could not be conducted
face to face, and we investigate whether the likelihood of face-to-face interview is
correlated with treatment status; reassuringly, it is not (column 2). Nevertheless,
we control for mode of interview in all subsequent analysis.

Note: Robust standard errors in parentheses. This table presents attrition analysis for our study in column 1, and the
effect that treatment might have had on the survey mode in column 2. All variables of interest used in the subsequent
analysis come from the final follow-up survey. Note that the alternative to a final face-to-face interview was a telephonic
interview. The total sample in both columns is all respondents present at baseline; column 2 has only 1,024 observations
because of missing information on survey mode for 7 observations.




     Finally, the take-up within both treatment and control groups was very high.
Out of the sample of individuals assigned to either group, 96  percent reported
watching their assigned soap during the study period, and there was no varia-
tion across treatment and control groups. Furthermore, table 11.3 investigates
whether there was substantial crossover, or treatment contamination, with the
control group also watching the treated show, Scandal!. In either follow-up 1 or 2,
we find that less than 12 percent of Muvhango viewers claim to have also watched
Scandal! in the last four weeks, and a third of these viewers watched several
other shows too. The tabulations show that 2 percent of respondents watched
Scandal! and another show, about 1  percent watched two other shows, and
0.5 percent watched three or more other shows. A large proportion—38 percent

Note: This table tabulates responses to the following survey question asked in follow-up 1 and follow-up 2: “Apart from
Muvhango, which other shows did you watch in the last four weeks?” The question was only asked of the sample in the
control group—i.e., those individuals who were assigned to watch the soap opera Muvhango. The purpose was to assess
whether individuals assigned to Muvhango also watched Scandal! during our study period.




                   in follow-up 1 and 29 percent in follow-up 2 watched other shows entirely and
                   did not watch Scandal!. While these are reassuring findings, we note that such
                   crossovers will only underestimate treatment effects in our subsequent analysis.

                   This section presents the main analysis on financial knowledge and behavior.
                   Since our research methodology uses random assignment, we compare the
                   cross-sectional averages between the treatment and control groups in a regres-
                   sion framework, and conclude that any difference between the two groups is
                   due to viewing the soap opera’s financial messages in Scandal! Additionally, we
                   control for mode of interview and use robust standard errors.
                        Note that while the two intermediate computer-assisted telephone inter-
                   view surveys provide insight into the immediate effects of our intervention,
                   the outcomes measured in these surveys are not directly comparable with the
                   outcomes in the final face-to-face survey since a richer set of questions were
                   asked in the latter. Hence, our analysis focuses primarily on outcome measures
                   obtained from the final follow-up survey, though we briefly discuss intermediate
                   results as well.
                        Finally, the discussion below also explains our qualitative results from the
                   three focus groups. Note that the focus groups were held after we analyzed the
                   quantitative data, and were designed and directed at understanding mechanisms
                   and heterogeneity of some of our quantitative findings.


                   11.6.1	 Financial knowledge
                   The first outcome of interest is financial knowledge. While our intermediate
                   computer-assisted telephone interview surveys did ask questions on financial
                   knowledge, we could only ask very basic questions and do not detect any signifi-
                   cant differences between treatment and control groups in these surveys.

     However, in the final face-to-face survey, we were able to ask more compre-
hensive questions, and further were able to distinguish between general financial
literacy and content-specific financial literacy. General financial literacy refers
to questions that test financial concepts that were not at the forefront of the
soap opera storyline, such as separating business and personal expenses, proba-
bilities in lotteries (although gambling was highlighted, less attention was paid to
probabilities), and writing down budgets. In contrast, content-specific financial
literacy refers to questions that focused on knowledge of hire purchase agree-
ments, which was the central contract through which the main soap character
overspent and ended up with unaffordable high monthly payments.
     Table 11.4 presents our findings. Column 1 shows no significant differences
between treatment and control groups on general financial literacy, but signifi-
cantly higher scores on content specific financial literacy in column 2—compared
to 42.5 percent in the control group, 47 percent of respondents in the treatment
group answered these questions correctly, a 4.5 percentage point increase.
Comparing across subgroups of gender, ex ante financial literacy, schooling, and
ex ante income status, we do not see significant differences on these literacy
measures.

11.6.2	 Debt management
Next we turn to behavior. Clearly the most important financial behavior high-
lighted in the soap storyline was borrowing and debt management. The first
outcome we study is borrowing propensity—whether there was an increase or
decrease in borrowing due to the storyline. Ex ante, we did not expect any partic-
ular effect on this margin since the storyline did not discourage borrowing per se,

                    but rather only discouraged irresponsible borrowing. And the results confirm our
                    prior assumption, as we do not observe any significant difference in borrowing
                    likelihood between the treatment and control groups, as shown in table 11.5.

                         While borrowing is similar across the two groups, we identify a very strong
                    treatment effect in the composition of borrowing. Column 2 of table 11.5 shows
                    that, compared to 13 percent of respondents in the control group, 22 percent of
                    treated respondents reported borrowing primarily from a formal bank. This is a
                    very large effect size, equivalent to a 69 percent increase from the control group.
                    Further, this result is directly relatable to the storyline, as the main soap character
                    falls into financial distress precisely because she underestimates the financial
                    charges associated with borrowing outside of formal financial institutions—in her
                    case, hire purchase borrowing.
                         Further, we detect significant differences in the length of loan, with the treat-
                    ment group obtaining loans 4.5 months longer in term than the control group
                    (column 3 of table 11.5). This difference in loan terms complements the finding
                    of a shift toward formal borrowing as nonformal borrowing is typically of shorter
                    duration. Nevertheless, we do not detect any differences in missed payments
                    between the treatment and control groups.
                         Finally, we examine reasons for borrowing in table 11.6 and find that the
                    treatment group is more likely to borrow for investment purposes, which includes
                    loans for vehicles, home improvement, or business development—all productive
                    loans.
                         Some interesting findings do emerge on heterogeneous margins. First, the
                    effect of borrowing formally is driven entirely by men, while the coefficient for
                    women is positive but not significant. Similarly, those with high ex ante financial

literacy and high education also have larger (and significant) effect sizes. The
latter results make sense, since more educated people would be more likely to be
eligible and approach formal financial institutions for loans. The gender difference
is interesting, and the qualitative analysis below sheds more light on this finding.
Finally, though not statistically significant because of small sample size and large
standard errors, we do see point estimates higher for women in borrowing for
unexpected events, and higher for men in borrowing for consumption purposes.
     On the qualitative side, women generally came across as being incredibly
reluctant to borrow at all, and only preferred to borrow as a last resort. This
helps explain the muted impact on formal borrowing and borrowing only for unex-
pected emergencies. One female response was, “If you do loans you will end up
paying a lot of money back, they are very costly. It is better to budget and save for
what you want.” Another female reacted to information from a colleague about
her multiple loans, “Three accounts? That is damaging!”
     Men, on the other hand, were more willing to use borrowing, often to pay
for consumption items and consumer electronics. What is particularly interesting
is that men themselves recognized that women tend to be more responsible in
their borrowing decisions. One male offered his insight, “Women are good with
money most of the time. When they need something and they are short [R] 500,
you should know that she really needs [R] 1,500 but she already has the [R] 1,000.”
Another male concurred, “Women don’t like borrowing money, they have a
conscience.”
     Perhaps as a consequence of these differences in borrowing preferences,
women in our focus group tended to have more credibility among friends and
family, and reported less resistance on the rare occasions they had to borrow in
the past. One female summed up, “Men are so scared [to borrow from friends and
family]. If my brother does not have money, he will phone me over and over again
and then I must make a plan for him.”

                         Finally, despite thinking differently about reasons to borrow, both male and
                   female respondents agreed that formal borrowing was key to successful finan-
                   cial management. An older female provided her opinion, “Sometimes people are
                   negligent in using money, as human beings we have to manage every cent we get,
                   we have to. If you are negligent you will end up with loan sharks and in trouble.”
                   The men concurred with this opinion, with one male responding, “When I started
                   working, I bought a TV and the salesman advised me to buy it over a six-month
                   credit. And because hire purchase is expensive, you pay for years, and when you
                   don’t pay, they come and take your stuff.”


                   11.6.3	 Hire purchase and gambling
                   The discussion of qualitative interviews above leads to our next set of results—use
                   of hire purchase and gambling. The severe consequences of both these financial
                   decisions were highlighted centrally in the soap storyline, with the main char-
                   acter purchasing items on hire purchase and gambling and ending up in significant
                   financial distress.
                         Our quantitative results confirm the effectiveness of the soap opera’s
                   message. As shown in table 11.7, respondents in the treatment groups were signifi-
                   cantly less likely to have used hire purchase in the past six months (19 percent
                   in the control group versus 15  percent in the treatment) and to have gambled
                   in the past six months (31 percent control versus 26 percent treatment). These
                   effect sizes are also large, representing an increase of 27 percentage points and
                   19 percentage points, respectively.
                         When we examine heterogeneous effects, we see that these effects are stron-
                   gest for respondents with low initial financial literacy and low formal schooling,
                   both of which are consistent with having strong treatment effects given the low
                   base level of financial knowledge and schooling.

     Turning to the qualitative study, we find a strong disdain for gambling among
both men and women in our focus groups. One woman expressed her frustration,
“People are crying, it is addictive. There is a lady I work with, when the money
hits her account and she is working the midnight shift with me, when we finish in
the morning she doesn’t go home, she goes to Gold Reef City [a casino].” The men
agreed, with one relating a personal experience with gambling, “I regretted that
day, my whole salary went down the drain.”


11.6.4	 Savings and well-being
Next we investigate whether there were any treatment impacts on other finan-
cial outcomes, such as savings, budgeting, and feeling of financial well-being
(table  11.8). We should note that we did not expect any significant treatment
effects on these margins ex ante since the soap opera storyline did not focus on
these issues. However, there may have been indirect impacts on these measures
as a result of improved financial behavior elsewhere. Our results do not find signif-
icant differences except in feeling confident about solving financial problems.

     The nonresult on savings is, in fact, encouraging, as it provides some
evidence against survey bias—that individuals were not simply providing answers
that pleased the surveyors—else we would have seen a positive treatment effect
here also.


11.6.5	 Seeking financial advice
Finally, we turn to an important feature of the soap opera—a public call to action
through the NDMA. As explained in previous sections, the NDMA was highlighted
prominently in the storyline and its toll-free number was broadcast at the end
382  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              of each episode that featured an NDMA representative helping the main soap
              character.
                     We examine quantitative outcomes in two separate ways. First, we obtained
              daily call volume data from the NDMA call centers and observe a huge spike in
              incoming calls immediately following the episode where the NDMA was intro-
              duced into the soap storyline. Figure 11.2 plots the daily call volume, with the
              orange vertical line representing the date of the soap feature. The call volume
              immediately jumped from an average of 120 calls per day to over 500, a more than
              300 percent increase.
                     Unfortunately, we cannot classify and match callers to our sample and hence
              can only present a before and after picture. However, our second intermediate
              survey, conducted just a short while later, included a question on consumer
              awareness of financial advice outlets. The regression analysis confirms a signif-
              icant increase in awareness of formal avenues for financial advice (such as the
              NDMA). Specifically, as shown in column 1 of table 11.9, compared to an average
              of 69 percent in the control group, nearly 80 percent of the respondents in the
              treatment group stated that they would seek financial advice from a formal source
              such as the NDMA if it was needed.
                     Surprisingly, however, this effect dissipated in the long run. Columns 2–4 of
              table 11.9 show that, while the average proportion of respondents in the treat-
              ment and control groups who would seek formal financial advice remained rela-
              tively high (about 60  percent), there was no discernable statistical difference

between the two groups. Also, the treatment group was no less likely to believe
that there was nowhere to go for financial advice.
     The qualitative analysis provides key insight into these differences in short-
and long-term effects. In the focus groups, very few respondents recognized the
NDMA logo, and no link was made between the Scandal! storyline and the NDMA
until there was more probing into the related soap characters. Men in particular
needed more prompting to recall the show, while women could remember more
but primarily based on the fact that the debt advisor on the show was female
rather than her affiliation with the NDMA. However, neither women nor men
could accurately recall the role of the NDMA advisor in the storyline.
     One leading explanation for this lack of recall is that the NDMA advisor only
appeared in the show for two or three episodes, was an external character, and
never reappeared after her short stint. Hence, the audience did not get the oppor-
tunity to establish or maintain a connection or following with this character. In
contrast, all participants readily recalled the main soap character and aspects of
the financial storyline delivered by her. Further, they attributed better recall to the
fact that the main character was a mainstay in the soap opera, and was popular
and likable.



11.7	CONCLUSION
This chapter analyzes the economic impact of financial literacy messages on debt
management delivered through a primetime television soap opera in South Africa.
Using a symmetric randomized encouragement design methodology, the results
show significant improvements in content-specific financial knowledge, strong
384  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              affinity toward borrowing formally, moving away from hire purchase deals, and
              gambling less—all messages that were conveyed in the soap storyline. A comple-
              mentary qualitative analysis confirms these findings and further highlights some
              key gender differences in the way men and women think about borrowing, with
              women generally using debt as a last resort while men are more willing to borrow
              for purchases.
                  Interestingly, while a televised public call to action toward seeking financial
              advice through the NDMA led to a significant upsurge in calls immediately after
              the messages were shown on TV, this effect dissipates over time. The qualita-
              tive discussions suggest that lack of emotional connection with an external char-
              acter acting as the NDMA agent was a leading cause for the erosion of memory
              regarding the NDMA. Conversely, respondents easily and fondly recalled other
              aspects of the show delivered by the main soap character, who was part of the
              show prior to the financial literacy storyline and remained part of it afterwards.
                  These findings suggest that emotional connections and familiarity with
              media personalities certainly play a role in motivating knowledge and behavior
              change among viewers, and that erosion of memory is an important concern
              when incorporating public service messages in mass media productions. Hence,
              incorporating messages through mainstay actors, delivering complementary
              interventions, or scheduling regular reappearances of external characters could
              potentially lead to greater retention and continuation of impact.
                  Overall, unlike most other financial literacy evaluations, our analysis shows
              significant and favorable impacts on financial knowledge and behavior, which
              highlights the importance of delivery mechanisms in financial education. Indeed,
              entertainment media has the power to capture the attention of individuals unlike
              any other medium, and thereby provides policy makers with an effective and
              accessible vehicle to deliver carefully designed educational messages.

ANNEX: SCANDAL! STORYLINE: MALETSATSI’S DEBT
Lead cast:                 Maletsatsi, Eddie

Support cast:              Daniel, Palesa, Gloria (Maletsatsi’s neighbor), Society
                           Members (Maletsatsi’s new neighbors), Constance,
                           NDMA Official, Financial Advisor

Universal truth:           If you can’t afford it, don’t buy it.

Central question:          Will Maletsatsi take the necessary steps to get out
                           of debt and successfully manage her finances in the
                           future?

Premise:                   Maletsatsi, through good deeds and wanting to create
                           a beautiful home for her husband and family, finds
                           herself caught in a spiraling vicious cycle of debt. The
                           objective of the storyline is to positively affect targeted
                           behaviors around financial literacy and management
                           by increasing the knowledge and understanding of
                           low-income South Africans regarding personal finan-
                           cial management. The storyline will improve financial

Synopsis
   ◾◾ Maletsatsi has started to socialize with the women in her new neighbor-
     hood of Orlando, Soweto. She’s becoming comfortable enough to start
     mobilizing.
   ◾◾ A neighbor can’t afford to bury a family member. Maletsatsi plays an active
     role in collecting donations from the neighborhood to help with the burial,
     but the money is not enough.
   ◾◾ Gloria (Maletsatsi’s new neighbor) tries to talk Maletsatsi into accompa-
     nying her to a casino. Maletsatsi is initially completely opposed to the idea
     but, when she realizes that she may be able to win money to put into the
     burial fund, she decides to try it, although she refuses to go to the casino
     herself. She gives money to Gloria and tells her what number to play on her
     behalf at the roulette table.

                  ◾◾ Maletsatsi’s number is lucky for her, and she wins some money which she
                    puts into the burial fund. But it is still not enough.
                  ◾◾ Encouraged by her initial success, she gets Gloria to play for her again…
                    and again. Sometimes she wins, sometimes she loses, but on the whole,
                    she stays ahead. Of course, she doesn’t tell Eddie what she is doing and
                    convinces herself that, because she isn’t actually going to the casino
                    herself, what she is doing isn’t wrong—particularly as any money she wins
                    will go to a good cause.
                  ◾◾ Maletsatsi doesn’t manage to raise quite enough money for the funeral.
                    Daniel Nyathi comes to the rescue and magnanimously foots the rest of the
                    bill, much to Eddie’s annoyance.
                  ◾◾ The experience with the burial fund leaves Maletsatsi surprised that the
                    neighborhood doesn’t have a society (stokvel ).
                  ◾◾ Maletsatsi sees an opportunity to start a society with the neighbors. She
                    runs her idea by Eddie, who thinks it is a good idea.
                  ◾◾ Maletsatsi pitches her idea to Gloria. Gloria tells Maletsatsi that she’s tried to
                    get the women to start a society, but there has been a lack of commitment.
                  ◾◾ Maletsatsi speaks to some of the neighbors about her vision. The people to
                    whom she speaks are keen to get involved in the society.
                  ◾◾ Maletsatsi calls a meeting, and the interested neighbors respond well.
                    Maletsatsi pitches her idea for the society, and most of them love it. They
                    admit that they tried this before but it didn’t work due to a lack of commit-
                    ment. (What becomes apparent is that they lacked a strong leader to
                    inspire and keep them motivated, which Maletsatsi is good at.)
                  ◾◾ Gloria tells Maletsatsi that some of the women gossip about her behind her
                    back. They say that her lounge, dining room, and kitchen (which visitors
                    see) are well furnished, but the bedrooms (which most visitors don’t see)
                    don’t match up. (Gloria checked out the house after using the bathroom
                    during one of her visits and started the gossip herself. Gloria is jealous
                    that Maletsatsi seems to be succeeding with starting a society while she,
                    Gloria, failed to get the initiative off the ground.) Maletsatsi pretends to
                    laugh this off.
                  ◾◾ In actual fact, Maletsatsi is troubled by what she heard from Gloria. She is
                    worried that people will think that she doesn’t care for her family properly;
                    that she only makes the public areas of her house nice and neglects the
                    areas where her family sleeps. Eddie advises her not to pay attention to
                    town gossip, but Maletsatsi is unappeased. Her commitment to being a
                    good wife, mother, and grandmother has been brought into question.
                  ◾◾ To make herself feel better (and to prove to herself and her neighbors
                    that she cares for her family), Maletsatsi buys new curtains for all the
             11.  Harnessing emotional connections to improve financial decisions  ◾ 389




  bedrooms—and, while she’s at it, new lounge and passage carpets and a
  new tea set with which to impress the society ladies.
◾◾ Eddie is surprised to see the new things. Maletsatsi sheepishly admits
  that she wanted her family’s bedrooms—and the rest of the house—to
  be nice for her family. Eddie is pleased that the house is looking so good.
  (Note: Some younger males in the focus groups felt that Eddie is too under-
  standing and supportive of Maletsatsi, while the older males felt that Eddie
  is doing the right thing. We have elected to go with Eddie being supportive.
  This also avoids the clichéd situation of the spendthrift wife who squan-
  ders money on luxuries without her husband’s knowledge. By making
  Eddie pleased with Maletsatsi’s purchases, he encourages her to continue
  making a nice home—which makes him partly responsible for the negative
  financial situation in which they find themselves.)
◾◾ The society kicks off. The women give it a name, and Maletsatsi suggests
  that they draft a constitution by which they will all abide. The society
  agrees to meet fortnightly. (Most of the first meetings will take place at the
  Khumalo home.)
◾◾ The first contributions come in. It is agreed that Maletsatsi will be treasurer
  of the society and will take care of the money while they are in the process
  of opening a bank account.
◾◾ Constance comes to see Maletsatsi. She and Benjamin are having some
  renovations done to their house in a few weeks’ time and she wants
  to know if they can stay in the Khumalos’ back rooms for a week or so.
  Maletsatsi and Eddie agree that Palesa’s in-laws can come and stay.
◾◾ Maletsatsi tells Gloria about Constance and Benjamin coming to stay in
  the back rooms and asks whether she has a spare bed or even some
  mattresses that she can borrow. Gloria is horrified. She knows Constance
  and doesn’t think that Maletsatsi is doing a good thing by allowing her
  daughter’s in-laws to sleep on borrowed, makeshift furniture. Maletsatsi
  really needs to furnish the back rooms properly or she will lose face.
◾◾ Maletsatsi tells Eddie that she would like to furnish the back rooms for
  Constance and Benjamin’s stay. Eddie agrees, but says that Maletsatsi must
  only buy the necessities—a bed, sheets and blankets. The rest can wait.
◾◾ Maletsatsi comes back with brochures from the furniture shops. She
  spends time looking at them and is particularly taken with a bedroom suite
  made of expensive wood.
◾◾ Maletsatsi purchases the bedroom suite but, when it arrives, a small table
  and chairs for the back rooms, plus a new refrigerator and flat screen TV
  for the house, arrive along with it. Eddie is concerned. Maletsatsi explains
  that when she went to look at furniture, the salesperson checked her credit
  status and found that she could afford to open an account. Eddie asks how
390  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




                    much the stuff came to. Maletsatsi says R 30,000. She has opted to pay in
                    installments over 24 months.
                  ◾◾ Eddie goes through the credit agreement and breaks down the various costs
                    involved, including the interest. It turns out that by the end of that period,
                    she will have paid almost double that amount, due to the interest and other
                    costs. (The salesperson sweet-talked her into this and told her that there
                    was no deposit needed and no payments due for the first two months.)
                  ◾◾ Eddie thinks Maletsatsi should send the things back. Maletsatsi pleads with
                    him. Their old refrigerator from the flat is too small for the space in the new
                    kitchen, the TV will be great for Eddie to watch sports on, and their family
                    will have lovely back rooms to stay in. And anyway, she will be paying for it.
                    Eddie asks with what money.
                  ◾◾ Maletsatsi tells a little white lie. She has been saving some of her salary
                    every month (it’s actually her gambling winnings), and Daniel is giving her a
                    small increase that she can put toward the monthly installments. Also, she
                    has started the society and, when it is her month to get the money, she will
                    be able to pay off the full amount.
                  ◾◾ Eddie softens. He likes the things, and Maletsatsi’s arguments make good
                    sense. He is happy that his new house is looking so good. But he tells her
                    there is a condition attached. She must pay the debt off quicker to avoid
                    paying so much interest. Maletsatsi undertakes to go to the furniture store
                    and shorten the repayment period.
                  ◾◾ Maletsatsi does this, but the monthly installments will go up substantially
                    and the two-month grace period falls away. She will have to start paying
                    immediately. She tells Eddie that she has dealt with his conditions, but in
                    reality she hasn’t. The new monthly installments are more than she can
                    afford, and she doesn’t have enough money for the first installment which
                    is now due.
                  ◾◾ Gloria is impressed with Maletsatsi’s purchases and that she has “managed
                    her husband so well.” Abel (Gloria’s husband) would never allow her (Gloria)
                    to get away with this. Maletsatsi starts to wonder if Gloria’s advice is what
                    she really needs in her life. But she tells Constance that the back rooms
                    have been tastefully and comfortably furnished in preparation for their
                    stay. Constance is pleased and touched that Maletsatsi has gone to so
                    much trouble for them.
                  ◾◾ Constance arrives to stay (Benjamin has had to go away on Evershine busi-
                    ness) and makes herself comfortable in the back rooms.
                  ◾◾ Maletsatsi still has the cash from the society, as the bank account hasn’t
                    been opened. She borrows some of it (quite a lot, actually) to make up the
                    shortfall on her furniture payment, telling herself that she will put it back
                    soon.

◾◾ As per the constitution of the society, if a member is in dire need of money
  before it is their turn, the society can vote to help them out. One of the
  member’s husbands loses his job and, even though it is the first month of
  existence, the society votes to donate the money to the member. Trapped,
  Maletsatsi says she will get the money, which she claims she has locked in
  the community center safe until the bank account has been opened.
◾◾ Maletsatsi doesn’t know where to turn. But then she remembers the
  community center. Daniel handed the running of the center’s money over
  to her when he went away some months ago and decided to leave her in
  charge on his return. Maletsatsi draws money from the community center’s
  account to pay back the society’s money. She draws a little extra to help
  her with next month’s installment for the furniture.
◾◾ Maletsatsi pays the society money over to the needy woman.
◾◾ Daniel asks Maletsatsi for the community center’s books, etc. He wants to
  take a look at them. Maletsatsi stalls, buying time by telling Daniel that she
  has taken everything home. Daniel is fine with that, and says Maletsatsi
  can bring the stuff in at her leisure.
◾◾ Panicked, Maletsatsi can think of only one way of getting the money back.
  She gives Gloria some more money to gamble with. She loses.
◾◾ Desperate to be able to pay back the community center money, Maletsatsi
  goes to the automated teller machine (ATM) to see what she has left in her
  account. The ATM offers her the chance of a loan.
◾◾ She takes a deep breath and requests the loan, which is granted.
◾◾ Maletsatsi pays the money she took from the community center back into
  the account and hands the books over to Daniel.
◾◾ Maletsatsi manages to cover the remainder of the month’s expenses with
  the rest of her loan, but when the new month starts, she realizes that she
  is in debt to the bank, has to pay the installment on the furniture, and has
  lost all of her savings to gambling.
◾◾ In an unguarded moment, Maletsatsi lets slip to Constance that she has
  been gambling and borrowed money from the stokvel to help with her
  debts. Judgmental and horrified, Constance is expressing her shock when
  Gloria walks in and overhears everything. She immediately insists that
  Maletsatsi has to confess to the society ladies. Maletsatsi begs Gloria to
  give her some time.
◾◾ Daniel notices something odd in the community center’s books. An
  amount was withdrawn and then repaid a few days later. He questions
  Maletsatsi about this. Maletsatsi breaks down and confesses her financial
  woes to Daniel. Daniel is taken aback. This is the last thing he expected of
  Maletsatsi, of all people. The irony of the situation (the woman who saved
392  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




                    him from sin actually stole money from him) tickles Daniel, but he cares too
                    much for Maletsatsi to allow her to see his amusement.
                  ◾◾ Palesa arrives back from her POWA tour unexpectedly and comes to the
                    community center to surprise her mother. She is surprised to find Maletsatsi
                    weeping in Daniel’s arms.
                  ◾◾ Maletsatsi is forced to come clean to her daughter about what she has
                    done. Palesa wants her to tell Eddie straight away (she is horrified that
                    Maletsatsi has confided in Daniel but not her husband), but Maletsatsi
                    refuses. There has to be a way of fixing this before Eddie finds out. She is
                    also terrified of the society ladies hearing that she has landed herself in
                    financial trouble—she is the treasurer of the society!
                  ◾◾ Palesa advises her mother to go back to the furniture store and get them to
                    make a plan to allow her to pay it off at a lower installment rate. Maletsatsi
                    does so, and the store agrees to extend the loan period again. But the
                    interest she will pay will go up substantially.
                  ◾◾ Not wanting to worry Palesa, Maletsatsi tells her that she has made a plan
                    with the store and everything is going to be all right. Palesa still wants
                    her mother to talk to Eddie, but Maletsatsi insists that she is handling the
                    problem and that she is fine.
                  ◾◾ But she isn’t. Terrified that she will never be able to pay back the loan and
                    the interest on the furniture installments, Maletsatsi starts to ignore other
                    bills, leaving them unopened—and unpaid.
                  ◾◾ At the next society meeting, the ladies all pay in their contributions.
                    Maletsatsi is about to take the money, but “supportive” Gloria says she’ll
                    take some of the responsibility off Maletsatsi’s shoulders of having to take
                    care of the cash until the bank account is opened. She’ll take care of the
                    money this time. For a moment, Maletsatsi fears that Gloria is going to
                    expose her, but she doesn’t.
                  ◾◾ Maletsatsi becomes moody. She makes mistakes at work and is irritable
                    with her family at home.
                  ◾◾ Eddie gets a letter saying that a household expense hasn’t been paid. He
                    questions Maletsatsi, who almost faints but covers and tells him she must
                    have forgotten to pay it. She will sort it out today. Eddie thinks nothing
                    of it.
                  ◾◾ Maletsatsi breaks down at work again. Daniel walks in on her crying, sits
                    her down, and asks her how much she owes, including the outstanding
                    amount on the furniture. She tells him. It is a lot of money to her, but to
                    Daniel (with his recent R2m windfall and the property business taking off)
                    it is not much. He offers to pay off her debts for her. She doesn’t even have
                    to pay him back. She must consider it his gift to her.
             11.  Harnessing emotional connections to improve financial decisions  ◾ 393




◾◾ Daniel also makes Maletsatsi realizes that she will have to come clean with
  Eddie. (Daniel is, of course, thrilled to have the opportunity to be able to
  help Maletsatsi out and to rub Eddie’s nose in it.) Maletsatsi tells Palesa
  that she is going to confess to her husband.
◾◾ Maletsatsi and Palesa arrive home, and Palesa tells Eddie that Maletsatsi
  has something to talk to him about. She leaves them alone.
◾◾ Slowly, painfully, and with many tears, Maletsatsi tells Eddie what has
  happened. He is shocked, but allows her to complete her story without
  interrupting too much. Only when she gets to the part where Daniel has
  offered to pay off her debt does Eddie erupt. There is no way that his wife
  is touching that man’s money! Maletsatsi says she understands Eddie’s
  concerns, but what other way out is there? Eddie says he doesn’t know. He
  needs some time to think about it, but he will come up with another plan.
  He leaves a distraught Maletsatsi alone.
◾◾ The next day Eddie is calm and practical. He tells Maletsatsi that he was
  very angry with her, but that is now over. What’s done is done and they have
  to move forward to fix things. He spent a large part of the night researching
  debt, debt counseling, and finding out about organizations that can help.
◾◾ Firstly, they are going to approach the NDMA to get them to help negotiate
  a reasonable repayment option with the furniture store for some of the
  items. (Note: It is clear that most people have never heard of the NDMA. So,
  at this point, Eddie will explain in simple and clear terms what the NDMA
  is and what it does. This will be expanded on in later scenes. These scenes
  will be written with input and final approval from the NDMA.)
◾◾ Secondly, Eddie continues, they are going to return some of the items to
  the store. Thirdly, they are going to go to her bank and get them to work
  out a way for her to pay off her loan. And they are going to take a financial
  management course to learn how to manage their finances properly. All of
  this they will do together. But there are two things that Maletsatsi is going
  to have to do on her own. One, she is going to make sure that she never
  gambles again. And two, she is going to come clean with her society and
  step down as treasurer until such time as she and they feel that she is
  financially responsible enough to occupy such a position.
◾◾ Maletsatsi is horrified at the thought of having to tell her neighbors what
  she has done but, as a Christian, she agrees that she has to do it. Eddie
  concurs.
◾◾ Eddie softens. He tells Maletsatsi that he only wants her to do all these
  things for her own good. He knows that she only got into debt because she
  wants the best for her family and because she wants to help others. He
  reminds her that she has done this before (the leather couch debacle). She
  is a good woman. But even good people make mistakes. There is no shame
394  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




                    in that. The only shame is if lessons are not learned from those mistakes.
                    And this time Maletsatsi really has to take responsibility and learn her
                    lesson. As an alcoholic, he knows that better than anyone. Maletsatsi
                    agrees. Eddie hugs her and tells her he loves her.
                  ◾◾ Maletsatsi thanks Daniel for his kind offer, but tells him that she and Eddie
                    will deal with the debt on their own. Daniel is not surprised. Eddie Khumalo
                    would never take anything from him. But he could still give Maletsatsi
                    some money without Eddie knowing. Maletsatsi holds up her hand. She is
                    never going to hide anything from Eddie again. Ever. Daniel is disappointed
                    but understands. He wishes he could find a woman who is as loyal as
                    Maletsatsi.
                  ◾◾ We see a scene where the NDMA successfully negotiates a reasonable
                    repayment option for Maletsatsi with the furniture store. This scene will
                    show that approaching the NDMA is nonthreatening and easy to do. It will
                    also make it clear that the NDMA does not charge for its services (one of
                    the misconceptions that was picked up in the focus groups). Maletsatsi and
                    Eddie will have to develop an income and expenditure statement (these
                    will be carefully explained) to determine the amount available to offer to
                    the credit provider. They also need to plan how they will prevent previous
                    mistakes and understand the consequences of not sticking to the new
                    restructured agreement. They decide to do this for the refrigerator and TV
                    and to return the furniture that they bought for the back rooms. (Note: this
                    scene will be written with input and approval from the NDMA.)
                  ◾◾ The furniture from the back rooms is returned to the store. Maletsatsi
                    is forced to borrow a camping bed from Gloria, who is horrified that
                    Maletsatsi is doing this. With great difficulty, Maletsatsi has to swallow her
                    pride and explain to Constance why the furniture that she bought specially
                    for Constance’s stay will no longer be there. As usual, Constance can’t
                    help being a bit judgmental, but Eddie, in full-on support of Maletsatsi, tells
                    Constance that if she isn’t happy with what they are able to provide for her,
                    she is welcome to check into a hotel. Constance backs down.
                  ◾◾ We see Maletsatsi and Eddie at a financial management course, learning
                    the rules of sound financial management and planning. (Note: During
                    this scene, terms that the focus groups had difficulty understanding—
                    converting to cheaper debt, downgrading, and productive borrowing—will
                    be simply and clearly defined and explained.)
                  ◾◾ Maletsatsi plucks up the courage to admit to the society ladies that she took
                    money from them. They are all shocked, but some are more supportive and
                    understanding than others. The overall feeling, though, is that Maletsatsi
                    will have to step down as treasurer. She will have to work hard to regain

  the members’ trust. Maletsatsi accepts this, but the shame is hard for her
  to bear.
◾◾ Maletsatsi organizes a talk at the community center where a financial
  planning expert comes and gives simple yet sound advice about finan-
  cial management. The whole Khumalo family attends, as well as people
  from the community. They are again told about downgrading, converting
  to cheaper debt, budgeting, and saving (all of which terms will be clearly
  defined and explained again). Borrowing can be a potential risk, but produc-
  tive borrowing and saving can help consumers take control of their debt.
  The expert also explains the role of the NDMA and the differences between
  that organization and the National Credit Regulator, which is tasked with
  education, research, and registration of credit providers and debt coun-
  selors; complaints related to debt counselor behavior; and ensuring the
  enforcement of the Credit Act. The difference in the roles of the NDMA and
  debt counselors is also explained. (Note: Most people have heard of the
  National Credit Regulator but not of the NDMA, so we are taking the oppor-
  tunity to define and differentiate clearly the roles and functions of the two
  organizations. This scene will be written with input and approval from
  the NDMA.) Maletsatsi shares her experience with the assembled group,
  explaining that she is going to take control of her situation and implement
  some of these measures in her own life.

T  he impact of financial
   education on
financial service use
Evidence from a financial diaries
study in Uganda

ABSTRACT
    This chapter presents findings on a study of a financial education program
    in the Luweero district of Uganda, about 150 kilometers north of the capital,
    Kampala. The chapter focuses on how financial diaries generate data on the
    financial behavior of low-income individuals that cannot be readily gener-
    ated from more traditional survey research or focus group discussions. In
    combination with in-depth interviews, it provides considerable detail on the
    knowledge, skills, and attitudes and behaviors of low-income people that
    can inform the debate about how best to change knowledge, skills, and atti-
    tudes and behavior through financial education and other interventions. In
    addition, the chapter shows how researchers can track change in indicators
    of financial capability over time using diaries and in-depth interview data.




12.1	INTRODUCTION
This chapter demonstrates the circumstances under which financial diaries
can be used to evaluate the impact of a financial education program. Such
diaries generate data on the financial behavior of low-income individuals that
cannot be readily generated from more traditional survey research or focus
group discussions. The chapter addresses the following questions:

                1.	 What can diaries, in combination with in-depth interviews, tell us about the
                    financial capabilities of low-income people that we might not know otherwise?
                2.	 How can change in indicators of financial capability be tracked through
                    diaries, in combination with in-depth interviews, over time?
                3.	 Under what circumstances is it appropriate to use financial diaries to eval-
                    uate the impact of a financial education program?

                  Answers to these questions have important implications for both research
              and practice. The study exploits the fact that the diaries produce detailed behav-
              ioral data—they track the transactions respondents perform, the relationship
              between the respondent and the other party in the transaction, and where the
              transaction was performed. As we will elaborate in the following section, one
              theory of change in the financial capabilities literature is that education changes
              knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs), which in turn result in a change in behavior,
              out of which improvements in economic well-being emerge. We use the interview
              data to identify the sample’s KSAs and changes in KSAs, and relate this informa-
              tion to their economic behavior and changes in behavior. In this way, we were
              able to examine the relationship between KSAs and behavior.
                  In addition, though the diaries data from this project only concern low-income
              rural Ugandans in the Luweero district (about 150 kilometers north of Kampala),
              they will add to the growing evidence from other diaries studies regarding the
              economic behavior of low-income individuals. As noted above, such evidence
              is critical for understanding how education, through changes in KSAs, might
              affect behavior. But it is also critical for understanding how alternative strategies
              aimed at directly affecting behavior might work within low-income populations.
              Advances in behavioral economics suggest that financial capabilities might be
              enhanced through behavioral prompts (“nudges”) that bypass changes in KSAs
              (Holzmann 2010). Detailed behavioral data from the diaries can be used to inform
              the work of researchers who are interested in designing and evaluating nudges
              aimed at changing the behavior of low-income individuals.
                  For example, evidence from other diaries studies (Collins et al. 2009; Stuart
              and Cohen 2011; Stuart, Ferguson, and Cohen 2011) suggests that low-income
              individuals handle a lot of cash and have a wide variety of cash flows, depending
              on their livelihoods and other factors. A behavioral approach to improving finan-
              cial capabilities might segment populations by cash flow structure, and deliver
              nudges timed to coincide with the flow of money through the hands of the people
              in targeted segments to remind them to save their money. A researcher inter-
              ested in testing such a strategy might use a traditional survey to gather informa-
              tion on how much cash a person handles each week and what pattern their cash
              flow follows, to segment the population and apply the different nudges. Informa-
              tion from the diaries should be useful in informing survey questions designed to
              capture information on cash flow.

    In addition to these substantive contributions to the understanding of indi-
viduals’ economic behavior, the chapter evaluates the role financial diaries, in
combination with qualitative interviews, can play in the evaluation of the impact
of financial education programs. Though this project’s final sample composition
makes it difficult to attribute changes in KSAs and behavior to the Habitat for
Humanity Uganda (HFHU) intervention, it nevertheless provides important guid-
ance to researchers wishing to use the diaries for an impact evaluation.1 It docu-
ments the data-gathering process and provides examples of how diaries can be
used to measure changes in behavior.
    The framework for the analysis is informed by a number of different sources:
the literature on financial literacy and financial capabilities in developing coun-
tries, data from participatory exercises conducted in Uganda in which partici-
pants defined financial capabilities in their own terms, and findings from previous
financial diaries regarding the behavior of low-income individuals.
    The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows: section 12.2 provides
an overview of the project, describing the intervention, conceptual framework,
research design, research sites and sample characteristics, and research meth-
odology. Section 12.3 presents the findings of the data analysis in full, and section
12.4 presents a conclusion that summarizes the major points covered in the
chapter. A more detailed version of this chapter, including an analysis of respon-
dents’ cash flow management and planning for the future, can be found in Stuart
(2012).



12.2	      PROJECT OVERVIEW

12.2.1	 Habitat for Humanity intervention
HFHU’s eight-week financial education program adapted a curriculum developed
by Microfinance Opportunities which includes modules on savings, budgeting,
bank services, debt management, and financial negotiations. The program is
designed to give participants the basic knowledge and tools they need to manage
their money more wisely and to encourage positive changes in their financial
behavior. By the end of the training, participants are expected to have gained

   Our sampling yielded a self-selected group of individuals almost all of whom attended
an HFHU financial education program, and who are overwhelmingly members of either a
savings group or a savings and credit cooperative organization (SACCO). It has also yielded
a comparison group, randomly selected from similar communities to those from which the
treatment group was drawn, who show little use of SACCOs and savings groups, and some
use of banks. More information on the original purpose of the project and the sampling
problems we faced can be found in Stuart (2012), annex 1.

                financial knowledge and skills leading them to positive changes in financial atti-
                tudes and behavior, as described in the financial education model of change. The
                learning objectives for each session were used in formulating outcomes indicators
                for assessing the impact of the financial education program. We obtained infor-
                mation on the schedule, rosters, and attendance of the sessions from HFHU in
                order to cross-check participants’ self-reported events data and to help correlate
                session attendance with outcome measures.
                    HFHU conducted seven training sessions from July through September 2011
                for each of four groups of financial education clients in two locations: Ssenyomo
                village and Kiwayirembe village. In the former, HFHU delivered financial education
                training to the Basoko Kwavuula Group; in the latter village, it delivered financial
                education training to the Bakuseka Magende Group, Suubi Farmers’ Group, and
                Ssenyomo F.F. Association Group. Two sessions were required to cover each of
                the first two chapters in the curriculum on budgeting and saving. The remaining
                three sessions covered financial negotiation, debt management, and bank
                services (table 12.1). Though HFHU reported a 95 percent attendance rate for
                participants in the diaries study, self-reported attendance suggests much lower
                rates of participation, from a low of 23 percent at the second budgeting session to
                a high of 70 percent at the second savings session. More information on the HFHU
                curriculum and attendance rates can be found in Stuart (2012), annex 3.

                    In total, HFHU recorded 110 individuals attending some or all of its classes,
                including 41 in the diaries study. All but one pair of diaries respondents were
                from different households, meaning that 40 diaries households were exposed to
                financial education.


                12.2.2	 Indicators of financial capability
                Stuart (2012) identifies three major elements of financial capability: day-to-day
                cash flow management, planning ahead, and financial service use. Each of these
                           12.  The impact of financial education on financial service use  ◾ 401




three has a cognitive (KSAs and self-confidence), behavioral, and environmental
dimension. For the purposes of this chapter, our focus is on financial service use
and indicators of change in use. We are especially interested in cognitive and
behavioral indicators, because the prevailing theory of change within the financial
education literature is that financial education has a cognitive impact that then
translates into behavioral change (Stuart 2012). Table 12.2 outlines the elements
and associated indicators used to describe what it means to be financially capable.

    As we will explain more fully later in this chapter, the financial diaries produce
transaction data that can be used to measure the indicators associated with each
element, except in cases where it is indicated that the source is in-depth inter-
views. Furthermore, the interviews provide explanations for some of the behav-
iors we observe in the transaction data generated by the diaries and are invaluable
in helping construct the right measures of indicators of financial capability.

              12.2.3	 Research design
              The original research design of this project was a quasi-experimental, differ-
              ence-in-difference evaluation of the impact of HFHU’s financial education
              program. It was set up to compare changes from the pre-intervention period
              to the post-intervention period in the KSAs and behavior of a treatment group,
              in comparison to pre-/post-intervention changes in the KSAs and behavior of a
              similar comparison group in a different community that had not been exposed to
              the education program.
                  The research design of the Uganda Financial Education Impact Project divides
              the study into two phases in order to capture both the short-term and long-term
              impacts of the financial education intervention. Specifically, the design calls for
              data to be collected immediately after the intervention ends and again eight
              months after the fact. This approach allows for there to be an overlap in the
              months in which short-term pre-intervention data and longer-term post-interven-
              tion data are collected, in turn ensuring that our comparison of respondent KSAs
              along these time horizons is based on data collected during the same season of
              the year.
                  Phase 1 spanned a 28-week period between May and November 2011. During
              this phase, we planned to collect two sets of in-depth interview data before and
              immediately after the intervention in addition to a series of diaries data that ran
              from about 10 weeks before the intervention, through the eight-week interven-
              tion itself, and then about 10 weeks after it. The study design called for a three-
              month hiatus before Phase 2 diaries collection picked up again on March 12, 2012.
              During Phase 2, we planned to conduct a third round of in-depth interviews and
              collect another 14 weeks of diaries data.
                  The project’s design was quasi-experimental in that the treatment group was
              not randomly selected, but recruited using HFHU’s normal process of responding
              to community demand for its education program. We anticipated that this would
              introduce selection bias into the recruitment of the treatment group and intended
              to mitigate the effect of this on our results by both recruiting a comparison group
              ex ante with similar observable characteristics and through post hoc controls on
              variables revealed by the diaries data. The most important method for recruiting
              a comparison group with similar characteristics ex ante was the identification of
              communities from which to draw the comparison sample that were similar to the
              communities in which the intervention took place.
                  As we will discuss in more detail below, the two samples we generated using
              the sampling strategy described above were similar in many ways. But, as noted,
              there was a crucial and overwhelming difference in the pattern of their financial
              service use: almost all respondents in the treatment group were members of a
              savings group or savings and credit cooperative organization (SACCO) and used
              these forums frequently; very few respondents in the comparison community
              transacted with such entities, and those who did did so infrequently. It is likely that
                          12.  The impact of financial education on financial service use  ◾ 403




this is a product of the way that HFHU recruited the participants into its educa-
tion program, but there may also be a fundamental difference in the financial
landscape of each community. Our landscape study of the communities suggests
that there were active SACCOs near each community and that each community
was home to savings groups, although there may have been more groups in the
treatment communities. As a result, we cannot attribute the differences in the
behavior of the two groups to differences in the groups and organizations active
in their communities. Rather, the data suggest that the treatment group in the
sample was a group of self-selected savings group and SACCO members.
    Though there was some variation in the level of participation in savings
groups and SACCOs within the treatment group, and there was some savings
group and SACCO activity in the communities we identified to serve as a compar-
ison group, the variance was not sufficient to allow us to control for the inherent
bias in the data post hoc. As a result, we have reoriented the project to answer
the questions raised in the introduction to this chapter:

  1.	 What can diaries, in combination with in-depth interviews, tell us about the
      financial capabilities of low-income people that we might not know other-
      wise?
 2.	 How can change in indicators of financial capability be tracked through
      diaries, in combination with in-depth interviews, over time?
 3.	 Under what circumstances is it appropriate to use financial diaries to eval-
      uate the impact of a financial education program?

    Though the original research design was set up to allow us to conduct a
difference-in-difference analysis, it still provides a useful framework for answering
the questions above. With respect to the first question, we have two samples of
significant interest: one a self-selected group of individuals actively participating
in savings groups and SACCOs in low-income, rural communities in Uganda; and
another a group of randomly selected individuals from similar communities. We
have 1,456 weeks of data for the first group and over 1,919 weeks of data for the
second group. Following McKenzie (2011), even with intra-class correlations due
to the clustered nature of the data resulting in larger standard errors, the size of
the data set from each sample allows for quantitative analysis of the indicators of
financial capability discussed elsewhere in this chapter.
    With respect to the second question, the data set will be, again, of sufficient size
to allow for quantitative comparisons of the behavior of the respondents at different
points in the study. Furthermore, the continuity of the diaries data, especially in the
first phase, will allow us to track the behavioral pathways followed by individual
respondents or groups of respondents using a case analysis approach to the data.
Finally, with respect to the third question, our analysis of the data can proceed on an
“as if” basis (as if the two groups were not so different) that can demonstrate how
one might use the diaries to conduct a difference-in-difference impact evaluation.

              12.2.4	 Research sites and sample characteristics
              At the time of the start of the project, HFHU’s Luweero office had a number
              of requests from community groups in the area to offer its financial education
              program in their communities. HFHU selected two communities, Ssenyomo and
              Kiwamirembe, in the Kikyusa subdistrict of the Luweero district, based on the
              criteria provided by Microfinance Opportunities. Those criteria were that the
              communities be

                   ◾◾ a rural village;
                   ◾◾ away from any main tarmac road; and
                   ◾◾ about a U Sh 2,000 (US$2 PPP) boda boda, or motorcycle taxi, ride from a
                     trading center.2

                   The two communities selected are about 20 kilometers east of the
              Kampala-Gulu highway by road. The nearest trading center is Kiziba. Kiwa-
              mirembe is about 1 kilometer from the trading center, while Ssennyomo is about
              4 kilometers from it. In the case of the former, the boda boda ride costs less
              than U Sh 2,000; in the case of the latter, it costs about U Sh 2,500, with rates
              increasing in the rainy season. Our field workers also note that the price of a boda
              boda ride is not fixed and can vary depending on weather conditions and the
              bargaining power of the customer.
                   With respect to the comparison communities, HFHU assisted Microfinance
              Opportunities and its field research team in identifying the geographical areas
              in which residents had neither requested nor received financial education but
              were similar in other ways to those in the treatment area. It is from these areas
              that Microfinance Opportunities and its field team identified the two compar-
              ison communities. The communities we selected were Kibowa and Kimwanyi,
              which are about 16 and 17 kilometers west of the Kampala-Gulu Highway by
              road, and thus over 35 kilometers by road from the treatment communities. The
              nearest trading center is Nakaseke, which is about 3 kilometers from Kibowa and
              4 kilometers from Kimwanyi—although, due to the geography of Kibowa, which
              stretches along a dirt road heading into Nakaseke, the nearest respondent to
              Nakaseke is only 1.7 kilometers from the trading center.
                   At the end of Phase 1 of the project, our financial diaries sample repre-
              sented 103 respondents living in 88 households. Forty-seven of these respon-
              dents (41  households) live in treatment communities and 56 (47 households)
              in comparison communities, with a fairly even split between men and women
              across communities.




               All currency data in this chapter are recorded in Ugandan shillings. There are about
              2 


              U Sh 1,000 to US$1 in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.

    Analysis of Phase 2 transaction data for the 13 weeks between March and
June 2012 revealed that a total of 91 respondents living in 83 households rejoined
the project for the second phase of data collection, with 12 respondents having
dropped out. The data show that only 5 of the 103 original respondents declined
to participate in the study further because of a lack of interest. The other seven
who dropped out did so because they relocated, died, or suffered some other
calamity. The Phase 2 respondent retention analysis in Stuart (2012), annex 4,
contains a detailed report on the changes in the sample from Phase 1 to Phase 2.
    As a result, there were 39 respondents in the treatment communities and 52
in the comparison communities, with a fairly even split between men and women.
There are 41 households in the treatment communities and 47 households in the
comparison communities. The average household size is just over six people, with
little difference across three of the four communities, but a markedly smaller
average household size in Senyomo, which is a treatment community.
    In sum, the treatment and comparison samples are drawn from communities
that are located in geographically similar areas. The data suggest that the occu-
pations of members of those communities are roughly similar, and though the
sample of respondents itself shows some differences in income, these are not
statistically significant at the 5 percent level. The diaries data confirm that almost
all respondents in both samples are farmers, but also suggest that there are some
differences between the two groups with respect to the share of respondents
who earn income from farming, wage work, and/or running a business. A more
detailed description of the research sites and sample characteristics can be found
in Stuart (2012), annex 4.


12.2.5	Methodology
We used a variety of methods to generate the data on which this chapter is based.
These were as follows.

    ◾◾ Financial diaries: Weekly interviews with each respondent in which
      the enumerators recorded all economic transactions performed by the
      respondent in the preceding week, including all formal and informal finan-
      cial transactions; the enumerators also asked respondents to report any
      unusual events that occurred during the week.
    ◾◾ In-depth interviews: These were conducted three times during the study
      period—near the start, at the end of the first phase, and during the second
      phase. The questions in the interview focused on respondents’ under-
      standing of money management and financial concepts.
    ◾◾ Case study interviews.
    ◾◾ Financial landscape study.
    More information on these methodologies can be found in Stuart (2012),
annex 5.

              12.3	     FINDINGS: IMPACT ON FINANCIAL SERVICE USE
              The conceptual framework identified three major areas of financial capability:
              managing cash flows, planning ahead, and financial service use. It also noted
              that there are three dimensions to these areas: cognitive, behavioral, and envi-
              ronmental. The analysis that follows focuses on financial service use, and, where
              available, reports evidence regarding changes in cognition and behavior.
                  It should be noted that for the sake of this analysis, we have split the sample
              temporally into pre- and post-intervention periods, with the cutoff being the 22nd
              week of the study, when the HFHU financial education was completed. The choice
              of the cutoff was difficult to make, given the fact that the HFHU program ran for
              eight weeks and covered a variety of topics. It is possible that during the training
              program behavior changed temporarily, and so it would not be appropriate to use
              the end-of-program date as a cutoff, but a review of the data suggests that that
              was not the case. The longer baseline period gained from using the end-of-pro-
              gram date as the cutoff gives us more precision in our measures of baseline
              behavior, because we have more data. In addition, to increase the precision of
              the post-intervention data, we combined the data from the end of Phase 1, after
              the intervention occurred, with the data from Phase 2.


              12.3.1	Overview
              The respondents in the study used a wide variety of financial services. The most
              common services used were savings accounts held with savings groups, SACCOs,
              and banks. Respondents used loans from those sources as well, but much less
              frequently. On top of these organizational sources of services, respondents also
              saved money at home, transferred cash to/from a spouse, and gave and received
              cash gifts and loans to/from family members and friends. Respondents also gave
              and received in-kind loans and loan repayments to/from other individuals.
                  Overall, respondents engaged in some sort of financial transaction with an
              individual other than their spouse once every two and a half weeks, averaging
              about U Sh 17,642 per transaction (tables 12.3 and 12.4). Their financial interac-
              tions with banks, SACCOs, savings groups, or some other type of organization
              were more frequent, over once every two weeks, and the amounts involved were
              much larger. The average transaction involved about U Sh 33,000. The frequency
              of transactions did not vary considerably by gender, but the amounts involved did.
              The average amount of transactions men conducted with other individuals was
              about 1.5 times the average amount of women’s transactions with other individ-
              uals. In the case of transactions with organizations, the men’s average amount
              was almost twice that of the women’s.
                  As noted above, there was a considerable difference between the treatment
              and comparison groups in terms of their financial transactions. Respondents
              in the treatment group conducted a transaction with an organization, mostly a

              savings group or a SACCO, more than once a week; they conducted transac-
              tions with individuals other than their spouse more than once every two weeks.
              In contrast, respondents in the comparison group conducted a transaction with
              another individual, other than their spouse, once every three weeks; and with
              some sort of organization, mostly banks, savings groups, or SACCOs, once every
              seven to eight weeks (table 12.3). Furthermore, the size of transactions conducted
              with financial institutions differed between treatment and comparison groups.
              The treatment groups engaged in smaller transactions with smaller variance than
              the comparison group, members of which conducted large and infrequent trans-
              actions, mostly with banks (table 12.4).
                  The data summarized above are for all financial transactions with other indi-
              viduals and organizations. In the rest of this section, we document the use of
              services in terms of number of transactions and the amounts involved by type of
              transaction. For savings and cash gifts, we will build a model to identify factors
              that prompted respondents to deposit and withdraw savings or to give or receive
              cash gifts, and then evaluate whether behavior changed from the period before
              the financial education intervention to the period after it by comparing changes in
              the treatment and comparison groups’ use of savings over the study period. We
              do not perform the same analysis of loan activity, as the number of loans given or
              received was too small.


              12.3.2	Savings
              The HFHU financial education curriculum included two sessions on savings, as
              described earlier in the chapter. The interview data illustrate the savings knowl-
              edge and attitudes of participants in the study, identifies barriers to savings, and
              can help to explain the motivations and context of participant savings behavior.
                  Consistent with the transactions data reported in tables 12.3 and 12.4 and
              below, the interview data revealed that treatment and comparison participants
              saved in different locations. Treatment community participants were very active in
              what they referred to as “groups.” A small number of treatment participants also
              reported saving at home. In contrast, very few comparison participants reported
              participating in groups, and many more saved at home or in banks. Some inter-
              viewees saved in multiple locations, particularly in the comparison sample.
                  No drastic changes were found in where comparison group participants
              saved over the last two rounds of interviews. However, there were two note-
              worthy changes among treatment participants. First, more treatment participants
              mentioned saving in groups and saving at home during the final two rounds. This
              finding is linked to the second change, which concerned the number of locations
              where each participant saved. During the first round of interviews, the number
              of locations where treatment group participants reported saving averaged just
              over one location apiece. During the second and third interviews, the number of
              locations where treatment group participants reported saving rose to nearly two
                          12.  The impact of financial education on financial service use  ◾ 409




locations apiece, with small increases coming in SACCOs, livestock or farming,
property, and unspecified investments.
    Another important finding from the first round of interviews concerned
saving location preferences; this can help to assess participant knowledge of
formal, semi formal, and informal savings options, which are addressed in the
HFHU curriculum. Initially, more people in the comparison sample felt that banks
were the best savings location, while treatment sample participants were split
between whether banks or groups were preferable. It was not uncommon for
people in the comparison group to say that they would like to save in banks for
security reasons, but some complained that banks were inaccessible due to
distance. This suggested that comparison sample participants are aware of banks
and their benefits. Treatment sample participants expressed this opinion less
frequently, but it is not clear whether this was due to lower awareness or to their
satisfaction with their savings groups. Very few participants in either sample felt
that saving at home was the best method, and the only advantage they cited for
home savings was the convenience of immediate access.
    The preferred savings locations of treatment participants changed from the
first round to the final rounds of the research; this was not true of the comparison
group, despite slight fluctuations. Treatment participants increasingly favored
saving in groups during the second and third rounds of the research, while fewer
favored saving in banks. At the same time, while a small number of treatment
participants during the first round felt that the best way to save was with friends
or family, or in livestock or farming, the numbers decreased during the second
round and none felt that either way was best by the third round.
    Participants who felt that banks were the best savings location felt that way
mainly because banks offer security (table 12.5). No participants mentioned earning
interest as a benefit of using banks. By contrast, earning profits or interest from
savings groups was a key motivation participants cited for keeping money with
groups. Two other important benefits that participants cited for using groups—not
cited when discussing banks—were convenience in accessing their money and
the ability to borrow funds. The number of treatment participants citing interest
and convenience as benefits of savings groups doubled from the first round to the
last, suggesting an added awareness of the financial benefits that groups offer.
    Treatment participants increasingly favored using groups, but because very
few thought banks were the best savings location by the end of the study, their
specific level of knowledge of banks was not measurable. One interpretation of
this could be that knowledge of these relative benefits may still not be enough to
convince participants to open and use bank accounts because of the associated
transaction costs. Treatment participants, as will be shown, were also less likely
at the end of the study to think of money with savings groups as an investment;
this may be a result of exposure to information in the HFHU curriculum about
savings options, causing them to alter the way they think about the money they
keep with their groups.

Distance of banks    “Banks are the best [savings option], but the only problem is that they are far from
                     us. You have to go up to Wobulenzi or Luwero to access one.” —II 305 (Round 1,
                     comparison)
                     “It is very safe, besides that you take a long time to withdraw your money because
                     it is not near you.” —II 904 (Round 3, comparison)
Security of banks    “[Banks] have a lot of security unlike in [savings] groups and at home. You are
                     assured that your money is safe.” —II 111 (Round 1, treatment)
                     “You do not use your money at all times because it is not near you and thieves
                     cannot access your money like when you keep it all at home. I believe if you kept
                     your money in the bank you also need to keep a little at home because of the
                     abrupt problems that may come up.” —II 903 (Round 3, comparison)
Profits from         “When you keep money in a group, you get profits. We are able to get profits
savings groups       because some people borrow from the same group at an interest rate.” —II 101
                     (Round 1, treatment)
                     “Groups give you the opportunity to borrow when you do not have money and they
                     earn you some profit when time to share comes; that profit comes from the interest
                     that people pay on loans.” —II 115 (Round 3, treatment)
Convenience of       “Saving groups [are best] because they are more accessible and you can easily get
savings groups       money from there in case you need it.” —II 407 (Round 1, treatment)
                     “Saving groups [are best] because [your] money is always available and no condi-
                     tions are attached to the money you borrow.” —II 107 (Round 3, treatment)




                     The data from the financial diaries show that the bulk of the financial activity
                 of the respondents in the study was savings related—either with a bank, SACCO,
                 or savings group (henceforth referred to collectively as “financial institution”) or
                 at home. Respondents made a deposit or withdrawal from a financial institution
                 about once every two weeks and from their home savings about once a week
                 (tables 12.6 and 12.7).
                     The treatment and comparison groups had very different levels of transaction
                 activity with financial institutions, both in terms of frequency and average amounts
                 per transaction. The treatment group interacted far more frequently with financial
                 institutions than did the comparison group (once a week versus once every eight
                 weeks), and the amounts involved each time were smaller (U Sh 21,000 versus
                 U Sh 102,000). This difference was driven by the treatment group’s extensive use
                 of savings groups and SACCOs. In contrast, the home savings activity of each
                 group was roughly similar in terms of frequency and amount per transaction.
                 Respondents in both study groups deposited or withdrew money into/from their
                 home savings just under once a week, and the average amount of the transaction
                 was U Sh 46,000 in the case of the comparison group, and U Sh 41,000 in the case
                 of the treatment group (tables 12.6 and 12.7).
                     Differences across gender varied depending on the group and the type of
                 transaction. Men in the comparison community deposited or withdrew money

               into/from home savings slightly more frequently than the women in that group—
               the difference was statistically significant but substantively not great. Within the
               treatment group, the differences were not statistically significant. In both treat-
               ment and comparison communities, the amounts men deposited into or withdrew
               from their home savings were far larger than the amounts women transacted. The
               average amount women transacted was about U Sh 30,000, while the average
               amount for men ranged from U Sh 51,500 (treatment) to U Sh 60,000 (compar-
               ison).
                     In the case of financial institution transactions, there was little difference
               in the frequency of transactions conducted by men and women. The variance
               of the transaction amounts was high in most cases, so interpreting the differ-
               ences across groups is difficult. But the data do suggest that, on average, the size
               of men’s and women’s transactions with savings groups were roughly the same
               (U Sh 7,996 and U Sh 7,190 respectively).
                     The case study data revealed the logic behind the highly consistent pattern
               of deposits made by many respondents in savings groups and SACCOs. They
               explained that the logic of interest earnings combined with an annual share-out
               period motivated them to do so. That is, they understood that the more they
               saved in these forums, the more they would earn in interest. Having their savings
               “frozen” until share-out appealed to them because it helped avoid temptations to
               spend (box 2.1). Additionally, many respondents described having joined savings
               groups and SACCOs in order to gain access to loans, either for unexpected emer-
               gency expenses or for business investments.


               CHANGES IN SAVINGS BEHAVIOR
               The diaries data allow us to look at the coincidence of transactions in time, and
               also to calculate the overall balance of income and expenditures within a given
               week. As a result, we can model savings behavior, and then see whether there
               was any change in behavior between the period before and during the financial
               education program and the period after it. The models below include variables




  BOX 12.1  A case study in group savings discipline

  Isaac saved with two different SACCOs, Muyizi Kasubwa SACCO and Suluma Farmers Group, making

  consistent weekly deposits of an average of U Sh 6,988. Isaac explained that he saved with these

  SACCOs in order to be prepared for emergencies and for weeks in which his income was low. Isaac

  remarked that, even though there are no penalties for missing a weekly deposit, it is important for

  him to save each week in order to increase his earnings at share-out. This commitment is reflected in

  the fact that he continued to make deposits every week in Phase 2, despite the decrease in income

  he experienced.

likely to be correlated with savings deposits into formal and semiformal accounts
and home savings. We have presented models that look at both the amount of the
deposits as the dependent variable and the incidence of deposits (1 if the deposit
happened; 0 if it did not). They include the following:

    ◾◾ Post: 1 if week fell after the end of the whole financial education program
      (weeks 22+), 0 otherwise
    ◾◾ Balance_iht: the amount by which the respondent’s net income during
      the week exceeded his or her household expenses (business expenses are
      taken into account through the calculation of net income)
    ◾◾ Deficit_iht: 1 if balance_iht is less than zero and 0 otherwise
    ◾◾ Harverst1: 1 if week fell during the harvest period (weeks 13–21), 0 other-
      wise
    ◾◾ Gender1: 0 if the respondent is a woman, and 1 if the respondent is a man
    ◾◾ Medbill: the amount spent on medical bills during the week
    ◾◾ Medbill1: 1 if a medical bill was paid, 0 otherwise
    ◾◾ Schoolfees: the amount spent on school fees during the week
    ◾◾ Schoolfees1: 1 if school fees were paid, 0 otherwise
    ◾◾ Deposits: amount deposited in a formal or semiformal account
    ◾◾ Deposits1: 1 if deposit was made, 0 otherwise
    ◾◾ Home_Dep: amount deposited in home savings
    ◾◾ Home_Dep1: 1 if home deposit was made, 0 otherwise
    ◾◾ Tot_fin_in: the amount of inflows from financial sources, including cash
      gifts or loan repayments from other individuals, withdrawals from a savings
      account, a loan from an individual or financial institution

    Medical bills are included in the model in order to capture the impact of
a large, unexpected expenditures on the savings behavior of the respondents;
while school fees capture the impact of large but anticipated expenditures on
this behavior.
    If we run the model for each group, the results suggest that the treatment
group changed its savings behavior from the period before it finished its finan-
cial education program to the period afterwards, while the comparison group’s
behavior did not change. This is the case in terms of both the amount deposited
and the incidence of deposits for home savings; it is also the case in terms of the
amounts deposited in formal and semiformal accounts. This result from the trans-
action data is consistent with the findings from the in-depth interviews, which
also found that treatment group respondents reported an increase in savings. The
results also suggest that, other than the post dummy variable, the independent
variables were correlated with the two groups’ deposit behavior in similar ways.

               HOME DEPOSITS
               Controlling for other factors that might have affected how much people deposited
               in their home savings, we find that individuals in the treatment group deposited
               more in their home savings in the post-intervention period than they did in the
               pre-intervention period (table 12.8). The coefficient on the post dummy variable is
               strongly significant, suggesting that there was an increase in average deposits of
               about U Sh 9,600 between the pre- and post-intervention periods after controlling
               for other factors. In contrast, the coefficient on the post dummy variable in the
               model of comparison group behavior was in the opposite direction, suggesting a
               decrease in home savings deposits, though this was not statistically significant at
               the 5 percent level.
                   The variables correlated with home deposits were similar for both the treat-
               ment and comparison groups. In both cases, men deposited more than women;
               deposits in formal and semiformal accounts were negatively correlated with
               home deposits; home deposits went up during the harvest period; home deposits
               went down when the respondents spent more than they earned; and medical
               bills had no impact on home savings deposits (box 2.2). The one exception was

   BOX 12.2  A case study in increased savings

   Harriet independently reported that after attending an HFHU training, she and her husband realized

   they had been overspending and started working to decrease their expenditures and save more,

   which in turn allowed them to invest in a plot of land and building material. She shared having cut

   down on unnecessary expenditures such as monthly trips to Kampala to visit family and giving her

   children money for snacks when she had already paid for school lunches.




the payment of school fees. The impact of paying these fees on home savings
behavior was positive and statistically significant in the case of the comparison
group; there was no correlation between fees and home savings deposits for the
treatment group. It is unclear why this was the case, especially given that the
school fees paid by comparison group respondents were almost twice as high,
on average, as those paid by treatment group respondents. This suggests that,
overall, the drivers of savings behavior in the treatment and comparison groups
were similar, and that the major difference between them was how much they
saved in the pre- and post-intervention periods.
      Figure 12.1 partially depicts what happened, showing the amount deposited
in home savings as a share of net income for each group, during weeks when the
respondents reported that they did not receive any financial inflows. The data
suggest that there was a savings increase as a share of income in the immediate

               remained, at a lesser level, six months later. In contrast, the comparison group

               FORMAL AND SEMIFORMAL SAVINGS ACCOUNT DEPOSITS
               The data also suggest that respondents in the treatment group increased the
               amount they deposited in savings accounts each week after the financial educa-
               tion program was over. In contrast, the comparison group did not. Controlling
               for other factors that might have affected how much people deposited in their
               savings accounts, we find that the difference in savings behavior of the treatment
               group between the pre- and post-intervention periods holds true (table 12.9).
                    The coefficient on the post dummy variable is strongly significant, suggesting
               that there was an increase in average deposits of about U Sh 6,200 between the
               pre- and post-intervention periods after controlling for other factors. In contrast,
               the coefficient on the post dummy variable in the model of comparison group

significance and direction of the coefficients was less similar in the treatment
and comparison groups, suggesting that drivers of deposit behavior across the
two groups were different (table 12.9). This is not surprising given the fact that,
as we have observed before, the respondents in the two groups used formal and
informal accounts very differently.
     Figure 12.2 partially depicts what happened, showing the amount deposited
in semiformal and formal savings accounts as a share of income for each group,
during weeks when the respondents reported that they did not receive any finan-
cial inflows. In contrast to the home deposit data, the figure suggests that there
was an initial small increase in deposits in the period right after the end of the
financial education program, and that there was a greater increase six months
later. Furthermore, the figure shows how the savings deposits of the comparison
group also increased—but not by much.

As in the other studies Microfinance Opportunities has conducted in East Africa,
the transactions data from Uganda suggest that the respondents frequently
exchanged cash gifts. On average, respondents received a gift about once every
six weeks and gave one about every seven weeks—excluding transfers between
husbands and wives (table 12.10). The average amount given was U Sh 2,800, and
the average amount received was U Sh 992 (table 12.11). There was considerable

                   difference in the frequency with which men and women gave and received cash
                   gifts. Men gave gifts more frequently than women, and the latter received gifts
                   more than did the former. Looking across the treatment and comparison groups,
                   the two groups were very similar in terms of gifts given, but the men in the
                   comparison group received gifts far more frequently than the men in the treat-
                   ment group.
                        There were no discernible changes in cash gift activity between the pre- and
                   post-intervention periods, except that the men in the comparison group expe-
                   rienced a dramatic decline in the number of cash gifts they received over that
                   period. It is unclear what drove this change in behavior.

12.3.4	Debt
The respondents in the diaries study received a limited number of loans from
financial institutions and individuals during the study period—155 in total. Seven-
ty-one of these were from financial institutions, and 68 were from savings groups
or SACCOs. There were no loans from banks reported. Not surprisingly, most of
the loans from savings groups and SACCOs went to treatment group respon-
dents. In addition, treatment respondents received the bulk of the loans from
individuals—63 of 83. One interpretation of this latter finding is that the treatment
group’s social networks were much richer than those of the comparison group.
Not only were they part of active savings groups, but they were also able to call
on members of their community for loans. In the qualitative interviews, it was
clear that respondents thought of asking someone else for a loan as imposing a
burden on them and was something that should not be done casually.
    There was no change in the rate at which respondents used loans across the
pre- and post-intervention time periods, but the limited number of loans that the
respondents received makes the detection of any change very difficult due to the
lack of precision in the data.


12.3.5	 Financial service use: summing up
    ◾◾ Transaction data from the diaries suggest that by far the most common
      savings mechanism among the respondents was saving at home.
    ◾◾ Transaction data from the diaries suggest that respondents in the treat-
      ment group increased the amount they saved at home and in their savings
      groups and SACCOs from the pre-intervention period to the post-interven-
      tion period. The same was not the case for the comparison group.
      —— In-depth interview data support the finding on increased savings:
          respondents in the treatment group reported saving more in the second
          and third rounds of interviews, both of which occurred after the inter-
          vention.
    ◾◾ Transaction data suggest that respondents borrowed little during the period
      of the study: they received 155 loans, of which 71 were from a savings
      group, either a SACCO or a nongovernmental organization. There were no
      bank loans reported. The rest of the loans were from other individuals.




12.4	CONCLUSION
This chapter began with three questions:

  1.	 What can diaries, in combination with in-depth interviews, tell us about the
      financial capabilities of low-income people that we might not know other-
      wise?
420  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




                2.	 How can change in indicators of financial capability be tracked through
                    diaries, in combination with in-depth interviews, over time?
                3.	 Under what circumstances is it appropriate to use financial diaries to eval-
                    uate the impact of a financial education program?

                  In answer to the first question, the chapter draws on a rich set of qualitative
              and quantitative data to describe the lives of low-income Ugandans. The data
              were able to provide considerable insight into how the respondents manage their
              cash flow and risk, and use financial services. The data demonstrated that low-in-
              come Ugandans form multiple financial relationships, have highly varied incomes,
              and are prone to exogenous shocks. Anyone hoping to implement a financial
              education program must keep these complexities in mind and find ways to enable
              low-income people to deal with the realities of their lives as they live them.
                  In answer to the second question, the combination of in-depth interviews,
              diaries, and case studies identified situations where changes in KSAs resulted in
              changed behavior and situations where, despite changes in the former, there was
              no discernible change in the latter. As such, it provided insight into the issue of
              the connection between changes in KSAs and changes in behavior.
                  In addition, the chapter took a step away from traditional quantitative anal-
              yses that rely on cross-sectional data and examine behavior in terms of respon-
              dent attributes (such as gender or average income). Instead, the chapter used the
              diaries to analyze behavior in one aspect of a person’s life—say saving money in
              a particular week—with behavior in another aspect of their lives—say income
              earned in a particular week or whether they made a medical expenditure in
              that week. In essence, the analysis in this chapter sought to explain, or at least
              correlate, behaviors with behaviors, rather than attributes with behaviors. The
              chapter used the same approach in tracking changes in behavior—looking at
              whether behavior changed in one aspect, controlling for changes in behavior in
              other aspects of people’s lives.
                  To the extent that financial education is about behavior change, the analytical
              approach described above demonstrates the power of diaries data for under-
              standing the impact of financial education. Diaries data allow a researcher to
              track changes in behaviors of interest, such as saving or spending on unneces-
              sary items. This chapter showed how this could be done while controlling for
              changes in behavior in other, related aspects of respondents’ lives. The analysis
              was fairly simple, and was limited by the size of the sample; there is more that
              can be done to unpack the causal chain linking financial education to behavior
              change, by looking at, for example, intermediate behavioral changes. Despite
              these limitations, we believe this chapter has demonstrated how one might go
              about this, by operationalizing measures of financial capability using the diaries
              data and analyzing whether those data demonstrated any behavioral changes.
                  Finally, despite the sampling problems this project encountered, the findings
              of the chapter suggest that the financial education program in Uganda—however
                            12.  The impact of financial education on financial service use  ◾ 421




flawed in its implementation, and however biased in its recruitment processes—
had some effect on the financial behavior of the participants. In particular, the
transactions and Phase 2 data suggest that the respondents in the treatment
group changed their savings behavior. In particular, the finding that the treatment
group experienced an increase in the amount they saved at home—an activity
common to both groups—was most striking. The findings also showed the
potential disjuncture between a change in KSAs on the one hand and behavior
on the other hand. The example presented in this study was the finding in the
qualitative data that the treatment group felt it had improved its control over
money management, but there was no change in incidence of weeks when group
members spent more than they earned.

Increasing the impact of
 conditional cash transfers
through financial literacy
Evaluation pilot in the Dominican Republic

XAVIER GINÉ, DEAN KARLAN, AND GREG FISCHER




13.1	INTRODUCTION
This chapter gives an overview of the status of the evaluation pilot in the
Dominican Republic, including the design, sample, and evaluation method-
ology, and preliminary results from the baseline. While this project began in
February 2012, there was significant turnover in the Dominican government
in August 2012, which delayed the process of gaining government approval
for the research design, accessing sample data, and identifying and hiring
government-approved surveyors. The baseline survey was completed in June
2013, and the financial education material has been finalized. The financial
literacy implementation is under way and should be completed in June 2014.



13.2	BACKGROUND
Progresando con Solidaridad is a conditional cash transfer (CCT) program
in the Dominican Republic which began in 2004 and focuses on promoting
investments in human capital among low-income households. Beneficiaries
receive monthly transfers to a debit card that can be used to purchase basic
goods in qualifying stores (colmados). The program currently serves approxi-
mately 25 percent of the national population.

                  Poverty levels are assessed by a countrywide census that uses 17 indica-
              tors, including living conditions, employment status of household members,
              and education level for household members. Households defined as poor Type I
              (extreme poverty) and poor Type II (moderate poverty) are eligible to participate
              in Progresando con Solidaridad.
                  Evaluations of CCT programs such as Oportunidades in Mexico and Fami-
              lias en Acción in Colombia have shown that such programs are successful in
              increasing usage of health care and education services (Attanasio et al. 2005;
              Baez and Camacho 2011; Gertler and Boyce 2003). However, even with improved
              health and education outcomes, it may remain difficult for CCT beneficiaries to
              manage their household finances, find stable employment, or start profitable
              businesses. All of these problems affect beneficiaries’ ability to graduate from
              the CCT program and achieve a sufficient level of economic stability on their own.
                  The program does not have a graduation strategy, so the government is inter-
              ested in ways to improve the income-generating opportunities of current benefi-
              ciaries. In this context, it is piloting a series of projects to improve financial literacy
              and access to credit and savings. Previous research conducted by the Dominican
              government has shown that Progresando con Solidaridad beneficiaries tend to
              have low levels of financial literacy and little access to financial services (GCPS
              2011). This financial literacy pilot program aims to improve the financial knowl-
              edge of Progresando con Solidaridad beneficiaries, thus increasing their ability to
              better use household resources and increase access to formal financial services.
                  Innovation for Poverty Action plans to evaluate the impact of a package of
              financial training services on beneficiaries’ economic well-being. The package
              includes training in financial literacy and household financial management, credit
              and savings as products offered by the formal financial sector to address finan-
              cial needs, job skills training including how to find and keep a job, and entrepre-
              neurship/business administration training. The evaluation will also measure the
              impact of increased access to financial products, particularly savings.


              13.2.1	 Theory of change
              In the short term, we expect the program to have an impact on beneficiaries’
              knowledge in terms of personal and household finances, take-up of formal sector
              financial services, job skills, and small business administration. In the long term,
              the change in knowledge should in turn affect behavior, specifically the following:

                  ◾◾ Improved management of household finances, by identifying planning,
                     and keeping track of recurrent income and expenses, and better control
                     in terms of spending
                  ◾◾ Increased savings, both in kind and monetary, resulting from more consci-
                     entious spending habits as well as awareness of the importance and utility
                     of saving
 13.  Increasing the impact of conditional cash transfers through financial literacy   ◾ 425




    ◾◾ Improved usage of credit resulting from more informed choices of products
      and avoiding overindebtedness
    ◾◾ Increased usage of formal sector (regulated) savings and credit products
    ◾◾ Improved ability to search for and retain formal employment, resulting in a
      better overall employment situation
    ◾◾ Improved management of small businesses, resulting in higher income
      levels; similarly, we expect to see a higher incidence of new businesses
      opened


13.2.2	Hypotheses
Based on the theory of change, the impact evaluation will attempt to test the
following hypotheses.

 1.	 Financial literacy: Beneficiaries who participate in the financial literacy
     training will improve their knowledge of household financial management,
     including budgeting techniques, the importance of saving, and knowledge
     of credit and savings options available to them. They are also expected
     to change their behavior in accordance with these principles, leading us
     to witness more frequent use of budgets and increased use of available
     savings mechanisms.
 2.	 Business training: We expect beneficiaries who already have their own
     businesses to improve their knowledge of best practices in business finan-
     cial management, including budgeting, recording income and sales, paying
     themselves a salary, and keeping business and personal accounts separate.
     This change in knowledge should also lead to changes in related behaviors.
     We also expect some beneficiaries who do not already have a business to
     open one.
 3.	 Job skills training: Beneficiaries who are not currently employed might
     lack “soft” job skills, such as self-esteem, life planning, time management,
     and decision making, that would help them find secure employment. We
     hypothesize that providing this training will increase the likelihood that
     beneficiaries will become employed and retain employment.
 4.	 Different training methods: The impact of financial training might vary
     depending on who provides it. Financial literacy training can be done by
     professional trainers or community peers. While we expect professional
     trainers to be more effective in providing the training and increasing bene-
     ficiaries’ knowledge of financial management, being trained by peers might
     make beneficiaries more likely to change their behavior and implement the
     teaching tools they have learned. This is because peer trainers are part of
     the community, and beneficiaries should be able to use them as a resource
     during and after training. Furthermore, should the government choose to
426  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




                      scale up the program, it would be much more cost-effective if community
                      peers can facilitate training as well as professionals.
                   5.	 Recordkeeping materials: Beneficiaries may be more likely to budget and
                      keep records if they are given a tool to help them perform this activity. To
                      this end, we can provide a notebook to keep records for those who received
                      entrepreneurship training. We hypothesize that providing this notebook will
                      increase the likelihood that beneficiaries will engage in recordkeeping and
                      improve management of their finances.



              13.3	DESIGN

              13.3.1	 Randomized controlled trials
              This evaluation uses a randomized controlled trial design to evaluate the impact
              of the training program. In a randomized controlled trial, one group of benefi-
              ciaries is randomly selected to participate in the training (the treatment group),
              while another is randomly selected not to receive the training at the time of the
              evaluation (the control group).1
                     Randomly assigning beneficiaries to treatment or control allows us to ensure
              that any differences observed between the two groups after the training program
              is over can be directly attributed to the training. If all beneficiaries or a nonrandom
              group of beneficiaries were invited to participate, those who chose to participate
              might systematically differ from those who did not (for instance, they might be
              more motivated or already have higher levels of financial management knowl-
              edge). Comparing these two self-selected groups would not allow us to identify
              the causal impact of the training program, because people with enough moti-
              vation to participate in the training program might have had different outcomes
              from the nonparticipating group due to their different characteristics. Random
              assignment ensures treatment and control groups are the same on average. Thus,
              the only difference between them can be attributed to the program.


              TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT
              Progresando con Solidaridad beneficiaries are assigned to a group (núcleo) of
              45–60 members. Núcleos are groups of beneficiaries who attend meetings every
              three months on a variety of subjects such as health and education, and are
              assigned a community liaison, an enlace, that is responsible for communicating
              with and organizing the núcleo. The study will include 240 núcleos in the greater



               If the training proves successful, the government may wish to offer it to the control group
              1 


              after the study period ends and scale up nationally to all CCT beneficiaries, so that they can
              also benefit from it.

Santo Domingo area in the Dominican Republic with a total of 3,840 individuals.
Núcleos will be selected from administrative data and randomly assigned to either
the treatment or control group. The treatment group will include 120 núcleos, and
the control will have 120.
    The original design based on 240 núcleos had to be rethought midway through
the baseline survey, since beneficiaries were undergoing reassignment to new
núcleos. The people originally selected were split up into multiple new núcleos
in their area. This happened throughout our whole sample area and was mostly
due to administrative restructuring, given staff changes and absorption of new
beneficiaries. This made the núcleo structure irrelevant, since more than half the
sample had already been surveyed but were spread into different, new núcleos.
Since the beneficiaries still lived in the same places but were reorganized into
new administrative groups, project leaders elected to change the treatment and
control selection; instead of basing selection on groups, treatment and control
would be randomly assigned on an individual basis.
    Since this restructuring was just an administrative change, the original design
and plan for treatment implementation remains intact. Approximately 240 groups
will be synthetically created based on geographic clusters and randomly assigned
to treatment or control. That is, beneficiaries who live nearest each other will
form a cluster, or training group, simply for implementation purposes.
    All members of the treatment group will receive financial literacy training
intended to improve household financial management skills. Within this group,
however, the treatment design is broken up into two layers of subtreatments,
which will be assigned on an individual basis and grouped based on the nearest
community training center. An additional treatment level will also be assigned at
the individual level (budget notebooks).


CLUSTER-LEVEL INTERVENTIONS
Layer 1: Professional versus peer trainers. Of the approximately 120 clusters
in the treatment group, 60 will receive financial literacy training from professional
trainers, and 60 from peer trainers (figure 13.1). This will allow us to test whether
being trained by peers is more or less effective than being trained by professional
trainers.

Layer 2: Business training versus job skills training. Half of the clusters in
both the professional and peer training groups will receive an additional training
session on financial management for businesses. The other half of the clusters
in each group will receive additional training on job skills and the job search
process. This allows us to test whether receiving small business administration
training leads to improved business outcomes and whether receiving soft job
skills training increases employment of beneficiaries. We can also compare the
economic outcomes of beneficiaries who received each type of training.

              may include individuals who receive the credit only and a pure control.

              Layer 3: Budgeting notebooks. Within each cluster in the treatment group, a
              random subset of beneficiaries will be selected to receive notebooks that can be
              used to keep household or business budgets. Of the sample of 3,840 individuals
              across all clusters, a subset to be determined will receive notebooks. This will
              allow us to test whether receiving a notebook to aid with the implementation of
              financial literacy training increases the impact of the training.


              13.3.2	 Implementation and monitoring
              The Social Cabinet of the government of the Dominican Republic and Innovation
              for Poverty Action contracted a local nogovernmental organization, the Domin-
              ican Institute for Integral Development, to develop the educational material in
              conjunction with Junior Achievement Dominicana. Since the Dominican Institute
              for Integral Development has experience working with vulnerable populations in
              the country, it was best suited to implement the training as well, and will be
              contracted for that phase. Implementation will be carried out through collabora-
              tion with operations of Progresando con Solidaridad, which will need to help coor-
              dinate the community liaisons to invite beneficiaries to the training. The Social
              Cabinet and Innovation for Poverty Action will monitor training for quality assur-
              ance and support logistics.
 13.  Increasing the impact of conditional cash transfers through financial literacy   ◾ 429




    The Dominican Institute for Integral Development was contracted for the
material development, after which the finished product was sent for review by
Freedom from Hunger, a reputable international organization experienced in
developing financial education material. Freedom from Hunger was contracted
to review and finalize the material, as well as train the Dominican Institute for
Integral Development’s trainers to ensure quality training of all facilitators, both
community leaders and professionals.
    The financial education material will consist of five modules:

  1.	 Entrepreneurship: making a business plan, small business administration,
      and keeping a business budget
 2.	 Job skills: steps needed to find and keep a job, including how to write a
      curriculum vitae and have a successful interview
 3.	 Credit: tools and information for choosing between credit products and
      learning about formal lending institutions, as well as planning for capacity
      to repay loans
 4.	 Savings: tools and information for choosing between savings products and
      formal and informal savings options, as well as making a savings plan
 5.	 Budgeting: understanding the usefulness of a household budget and steps
      for making one



13.4	SAMPLE
The sample was randomly selected from among four municipalities that fall within
two regions of Santo Domingo. These municipalities are Distrito Nacional, in the
Distrito Nacional region; and Santo Domingo Norte, Los Alcarrizos, and La Victoria,
which are in the Santo Domingo region. All of these are within the urbanized
area of greater Santo Domingo, although some parts are peri-urban and in some
households there may have been more rural than urban characteristics.
    Prior to randomly selecting núcleos, the selection was filtered for those núcleos
with greater than 25 people to conservatively account for beneficiaries who may
have moved and to include substitute invitees. It was also filtered for households
categorized as Type II (moderate) poverty. The evaluation targets beneficiaries in
moderate rather than extreme poverty because of the graduation aspect of the
hypothesized impact. Financial literacy training may give these beneficiaries an
increase in income, along with access to credit, savings, and improved budgeting
that will improve their financial situation enough for them to no longer rely on the
program. The age for individuals was also capped at 55, under the assumption that
beneficiaries much older than that may not benefit as much from financial literacy
training. This is based on the assumption that those 55 and older will most likely
retire sooner, and their financial literacy training would not be as useful since they
are less likely to begin a new business or look for a new job.
430  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




                   Of 1,763 núcleos that were in the sample area before selection, 240 were
              selected at random to be surveyed, as well as 16 people within those núcleos,
              plus 4 substitutes. Throughout the course of the baseline, three more substitutes
              were added in each núcleo to address the issue of occasional poor attendance at
              survey meetings. Additionally, 28 núcleos were replaced because of administra-
              tive constraints in working with those groups (lack of staff).
                   During the project’s planning phase, power calculations were used to estimate
              the minimum sample size necessary to detect the desired effect on the key indica-
              tors. Since treatment levels are implemented at the group level, the impact (effect
              size) will be measured at the group level. Power calculations were done using
              núcleos as groups, and are still valid even though we are no longer using actual
              núcleos as clusters, since the new clusters are from within the same communities.
                   Recent evidence on the impact of financial literacy training, business admin-
              istration, and job skills on knowledge and behavior reveals considerable variation
              of the effect size of these programs.2 We conducted power calculations to iden-
              tify the minimum sample size that would allow us to detect changes in the key
              outcomes of interest for the financial education intervention. With an estimated
              effect size of 0.15 and an intra-class correlation of 0.05, a sample of 240 núcleos
              with 15 beneficiaries per núcleo was selected in order to reach the desired power
              of 0.8 for the three treatment levels.3 In other words, we will detect an expected
              15 percent increase in the number of beneficiaries displaying stronger financial
              management skills as a result of this intervention.



              13.5	MEASUREMENT

              13.5.1	 Baseline survey
              Baseline surveying is conducted at scheduled meetings with selected núcleos.
              The meetings are organized in coordination with existing Progresando con


              2 
                 Carpeno et al. (2011) found the treatment group 5 percent more likely to understand the
              concept of a family budget, 17 percent more likely to know the minimum requirements for
              opening a savings account, and 20 percent more likely to understand what a nonperforming
              loan is. Fischer, Drexler, and Schoar (2010) find that the treatment group is 11 percent more
              likely to keep personal and business accounts separate, 11  percent more likely to keep
              accounting records, 6 percent more likely to calculate income, and 6 percent more likely to
              have savings—although the latter is only marginally significant.
              3 
                The estimated effect size is based on evidence from similar experimental studies and the
              minimum effect size necessary (as determined by the principal investigators) to justify the
              scaling up of the program, taking into account the cost of the intervention. The interclass
              correlation was estimated by educational level data (chosen as one of the determining vari-
              ables) from 2004 Progresando con Solidaridad data. Eighty percent power is the conven-
              tional power level in econometric studies.

Solidaridad field staff, from regional coordinator to field supervisor to community
liaisons (enlaces), who are the direct organizers of beneficiaries. The enlace is
responsible for communicating with heads of households to inform them about
the survey meeting and, when implementation of the training begins, the financial
literacy training sessions.
    The baseline survey is divided into the following sections of topics:

    ◾◾ Poverty-level information, including the education level of every member
       of the household, household expenses (as a proxy for income), and the
       income-generating activities of each member of the household
    ◾◾ Budgeting behavior
    ◾◾ Work experience, including strategies for job seeking
    ◾◾ Business information for those who have small businesses (including sales
       estimates, recordkeeping habits, business assets, etc.)
    ◾◾ Credit and savings (including how much and how often beneficiaries save,
       the amount and prevalence of loans, as well as questions to gauge knowl-
       edge of formal credit and savings options)
    ◾◾ Financial knowledge (knowledge of budgets, recordkeeping, prior financial
       training, as well as basic arithmetic and risk aversion)
    ◾◾ Dependency questions, both in terms of decision making and reliance on
       others for income
    ◾◾ Personality questions to gauge self-confidence and entrepreneurial spirit

    Only Progresando con Solidaridad beneficiaries (who are the heads of their
households), or their spouses/partners were interviewed in the baseline; this is
because beneficiaries, as the heads of their household, are the primary breadwin-
ners and thus the best situated person in the household to apply the skills learned
in financial literacy training. Children of beneficiaries or other household members
are not necessarily in a position to take full advantage of financial literacy training,
nor do they know enough about the income-generating activities of the head of
household to provide the data necessary.

13.5.2	 Endline survey
The endline survey will measure the impacts of the training program one year after
the program’s implementation. The survey will include everyone in the treatment
and control groups, including those who were invited to training but did not attend,
to capture the intend-to-treat effect. This was added to the design since it became
apparent that the take-up rate for training may be lower than anticipated. Many
beneficiaries did not attend baseline survey meetings; despite inviting 7 substitutes,
in some cases fewer than the targeted 16 attended. Since beneficiaries move often,
the endline survey will require surveyors to leave the survey area and conduct some
surveys at beneficiaries’ homes when they do not attend the meetings.
432  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              13.5.3	 Survey staff
              A total of 40 individuals were hired to implement the survey: 32 surveyors, 4
              supervisors, and 4 auditors. These were divided into four teams, comprising one
              supervisor, eight surveyors, and one auditor. Auditors work separately. Each team
              member was selected from a database of previous government surveyors. After
              interviewing potential candidates, about 48 were invited to surveyor training; of
              those, the 40 most qualified were selected according to experience and perfor-
              mance during training.
                  The supervisors were trained and selected first in order to assist in training
              the surveyor candidates. Both training sessions included pilot sessions of the
              survey at núcleos that were not part of the sample area. The survey team received
              training on the randomized controlled trial methodology and survey implementa-
              tion, and was carefully instructed in the protocols of the questionnaire designed
              for this study. The procedure for the endline survey will be the same.


              13.5.4	 Computer-assisted interviewing
              Computer-assisted interviewing is preferable to paper-based surveying in that
              there is a quicker turnover of data, since the data can be immediately exported
              electronically and do not require data entry, and there is a smaller risk of error
              due to programmable validity and logic checks in most computer-assisted inter-
              viewing software. We decided to use computer-assisted interviewing for this
              project for the following reasons: (1) the government offered to lend 40 laptops
              for this purpose, free of charge; and (2) it eliminated the need for data entry staff
              and time. The platform used for the baseline was Surveybe, chosen because of its
              ease in programming and because of its compatibility with the borrowed equip-
              ment. For the endline survey, these laptops may not be available to us, so we are
              considering using different survey software and purchasing tablets, since they
              are more mobile.



              13.6	     DATA QUALITY CONTROL

              13.6.1	Confidentiality
              All data that can be used to identify a participant such as name, address, and
              phone number will be kept confidential and will only be accessed by key project
              staff. A unique ID code was assigned to each respondent, which will be used for
              data analysis, dropping all other personally identifiable information. Furthermore,
              before each interview, the surveyor reads a consent script, which is printed on
              the consent forms that all respondents must sign. This script informs respondents
              that data are anonymous and in no way affect their status as a beneficiary.
 13.  Increasing the impact of conditional cash transfers through financial literacy   ◾ 433




13.6.2	 Survey monitoring
To ensure data quality, surveyors in each team are monitored by their super-
visor as they collect data. This is easily done since survey teams collect data
from an entire núcleo as meetings are held in a single site. Innovation for Poverty
Action project staff also conduct unannounced monitoring visits to survey teams.
In addition, field audits (also called back checks) are conducted with a subset of
around 15 percent of beneficiaries, who are randomly selected by a surveyor, to
ensure we audit all surveyors. In a field audit, the respondents are visited by an
auditor, who asks them a few questions from the questionnaire. This provides
us with a second set of responses to check the quality of the surveyors and the
reliability of the data. If the field audit reveals discrepancies, the surveyor may be
asked to reinterview the respondent.
    There have been no cases in which the respondent was not the same or
the data were fabricated, although there are some higher than normal discrep-
ancy rates on some variables. For example, there is a high discrepancy rate for
answers that are estimates of amounts spent or earned. The question “How much
do you estimate you spend weekly on food for the household?” has an 80 percent
discrepancy rate, both small and large differences. In practice, many beneficiaries
have trouble estimating this expense in weekly terms, so their estimates differ
when asked the same question a few days later in the back check survey.
    There are discrepancies that are due to surveyor error, and those, when
detected, are discussed with surveyors individually or as a group if the error
is common. The question “How many economic activities do you have?” had a
discrepancy rate of 23  percent. This is problematic, because in some of those
cases the respondent reported that he or she had his or her own business in
the back check, and in the original survey reported that he or she did not. This
is most likely because respondents did not understand the script the surveyor
reads to describe what we mean by economic activity, and the surveyor did not
clarify. Innovation for Poverty Action project staff address these issues as they
are gleaned from back check data throughout the survey.
    In an effort to reduce error rates and encourage higher-quality data collection
for the endline survey, we will introduce an incentive system whereby surveyors
and survey teams with the fewest errors are rewarded with a bonus in compen-
sation and those with the highest errors are penalized. Surveyors will also receive
incentives for improved performance.



13.7	     BASELINE RESULTS
The baseline survey was conducted between February and June 2013. A total of
3,280 beneficiaries were surveyed. The following summary statistics from the
baseline data include a sample from the 237 questions on the survey, chosen
434  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              because they reflect key outcome variables we expect to be affected by the finan-
              cial literacy pilot program.


              13.7.1	Income
              The amount spent weekly on food we are using as a proxy for income, since many
              beneficiaries are unemployed or have informal small businesses and may not be
              able to accurately express how much they earn or receive as income. The average
              spent on food weekly is RD$2,695 (about US$65). Seven  percent of the sample
              could not estimate how much they spent on food weekly.


              13.7.2	 Jobs and businesses
              Many people supplement their main income with small businesses, which can
              be anything from selling food from the home to obtaining small amounts of
              merchandise and selling them to friends and neighbors from time to time. In light
              of this, there is a question on the survey that explains “economic activities” and
              asks the number of economic activities each person in the household engages
              in. An economic activity is defined as anything that generates income, whether
              formal or informal. Fifty-one percent of those surveyed do not participate in any
              economic activity, whether it is a formal job or self-employment. Of the other
              49 percent that participate in at least one economic activity, 64 percent have sala-
              ried employment and the remaining 34 percent are self-employed small or micro-
              business owners or collaborators. Only 3 percent of business owners claimed to
              have formal (legally registered) businesses. Of those who have their own busi-
              ness, average sales in a normal week are RD$4,710, about US$115.


              13.7.3	Budgeting
              In response to the question “Do you regularly (at least once a month) keep track
              of your expenses?,” 57 percent of responded that they do not. While we want to
              gather accurate information on the budgeting practices of the beneficiaries, many
              do not know or misunderstand what a budget is. They were asked a question that
              breaks down budgeting: “Do you ever think about the money you expect to get
              and money you expect to spend and then make a plan for what you will do with
              your money?” The data show that 63 percent of respondents do not budget.


              13.7.4	 Credit and savings
              An important component of the financial literacy training is the informed and
              conscientious take-up of savings and credit products. The majority of those
              surveyed (72 percent) do not hold any loans. Among those who currently hold a
              loan, 82 percent accessed formal sector loans. Finally, 22 percent stated that they

loan, either formal or informal, is RD$28,972 (US$706). Of those who already have
a loan, 57 percent responded that they plan to take out another one.
    As for savings, 27 percent affirm that they save, whether with the formal or
informal sector (12 percent have savings accounts at formal financial institutions).
Furthermore, 22 percent save regularly every month. Mean monthly savings per
participant are approximately RD$435 (US$11) but increase to RD$1,989 (US$49)
when excluding participants who do not save on a monthly basis.



13.8	     RESULTS AND POLICY RELEVANCY
Results should be finalized in early or mid-2015, with a paper published by
the end of that year. The data will be made publicly available on the American
Economic Association Registry to ensure transparency and reproducibility of
results. Should the results be positive, the Dominican Republic government is
interested in scaling up the program—especially if peer facilitators are proven
as effective as professional facilitators, since the program will be more cost-ef-
fective that way.
    Although the results from this study are immediately relevant to the govern-
ment of the Dominican Republic, they will also be of great interest to other
countries implementing similar CCT or unconditional cash transfer programs
(especially given the recent surge in discussion around these programs). As noted
previously, there is little evidence on how to graduate beneficiaries from CCT
programs. The characteristics of our population include low levels of financial
literacy, poor knowledge of and access to formal financial services, high unem-
ployment and underemployment, and high rates of informality among business
owners. These characteristics are very similar to many people in middle- and
low-income countries and can also be found in vulnerable segments of the popu-
lation in high-income countries. This is the first impact evaluation of financial
literacy and employment or business training of CCT beneficiaries. Governments
that are thinking about graduation strategies from CCT or similar programs—or,
more broadly, financial inclusion and better employment options and income for
poor and vulnerable populations—will benefit from the unique data and results
of this evaluation.



13.9	TIMELINE
The project began mid-2012 and will be a 3.5-year project, including the time
necessary for data analysis and publication after completion of fieldwork. The
baseline survey took place from January to June 2013, and the financial literacy
and labor market training will take place from February to June 2014. The timeline
in figure 13.2 shows all completed and planned activities for this project.

14.1	INTRODUCTION
This project investigates innovative ways to address low levels of formal
savings in developing countries. The study explores to what extent psycho-
logical mechanisms can be leveraged to increase formal savings. In partic-
ular, we study to what extent “mental accounting,” status quo bias, and
aspirations can be targeted to help individuals match desired savings and
expenditure patterns with actual behavior.
    The study is motivated by market failures and behavioral phenomena that
limit the ability of poor households to save and invest in productive activities.
Incomplete credit markets in developing countries force many to rely heavily
on accumulating personal savings to finance investments. However, behav-
ioral phenomena, such as self-control problems or limited aspirations, may
lead to suboptimal savings and underinvestment relative to desired levels.
    The study has three parts, each targeting a different psychological
concept. In the first part, respondents within 10 kilometers of a banking
branch are offered a subsidized ordinary savings account. In addition, some
respondents are encouraged to “label” the account for a specific purpose.
Labeling is a form of mental accounting that can render funds assigned to
one category (e.g., school fees) less fungible for expenditures in another cate-
gory (e.g., unplanned expenditures on luxury items).

                  The second part of the study explores the effectiveness of financial literacy
              education and its potential to increase people’s aspirations by going through a
              detailed savings plan and showing respondents videos of successful savers from
              a similar background. This strategy may be effective if aspirations of the poor and
              their belief in their own capacity for change are depressed, creating a feedback of
              decreased effort and decreased expectations.
                  The third part of the study tests the power of status quo bias by comparing
              the expenditure and savings behavior of two groups that receive a randomly allo-
              cated grant either in the form of cash or directly into their bank accounts. If a
              bias toward the status quo leads people to disproportionately follow the default,
              then depositing income into accounts by default may facilitate savings relative
              to receiving cash. The third intervention will also test whether time between the
              announcement of winning money and the receipt of the money affects respon-
              dents’ expenditure and savings decisions. Within the “cash” group and “direct
              deposit” group, respondents randomly receive the money immediately, one day,
              or eight days after prize announcement.
                  Last year, the project conducted a baseline survey and simultaneous account
              offers, after having completed a household census as a sampling frame. The
              households were revisited for financial literacy sessions and sessions to increase
              aspirations. In the current stage of the project, a subset of the same households
              will receive cash grants and will be interviewed repeatedly to follow expenditure
              and savings patterns. In the final state, a follow-up survey with the entire sample
              will measure effects of the interventions on formal and informal savings, aspira-
              tions, income, and expenditures.



              14.2	MOTIVATION
              Savings enable people to smooth consumption over time, to buy durable consump-
              tion goods, and to make use of profitable business and investment opportunities.
              Returns to capital in particular are high in developing countries (de Mel, McKenzie
              and Woodruff 2008; Duflo, Kremer, and Robinson 2008; Fafchamps et al. 2011),
              and savings are important to generate the required capital in developing coun-
              tries due to the lack of well-functioning local credit markets.
                  Access to formal savings accounts in particular has the potential to increase
              savings, and recent empirical work suggests substantial benefits from formal
              savings accounts for overall welfare. Aportela (1999) uses data from an expansion
              of branches set up in post offices at the end of 1993. He finds that the expansion
              resulted in an average increase in savings rate of 3 to 5 percentage points, with
              higher effects (up to 7 percentage points) for low-income individuals compared to
              other low-income households located in towns without the expansion. Burgess
              and Pande (2005) find that a policy-driven expansion of rural banking reduced
              poverty in India, and provide suggestive evidence that deposit mobilization and
                                    14.  Direct deposit and commitments to save in Malawi  ◾ 439




credit access were intermediating channels. Despite positive social effects, the
program was discontinued in 2001 due to losses from defaults. Bruhn and Love
(2009) examine the opening of bank branches in consumer durable stores in
Mexico in 2002 and find an increase in the number of informal business owners by
7.6 percent, in total employment by 1.4 percent, and in average income by about
7 percent. The effects are concentrated among low0income households and in
municipalities with lower preexisting bank penetration.
    Dupas and Robinson (2013a) offer ordinary savings accounts to Kenyan urban
entrepreneurs, finding positive impacts on investment and income for women. Prina
(2011) finds that random assignment of basic savings account access to households
in Nepal leads to increases in financial assets and human capital investments.
    In this project, we focus on two sets of barriers to savings: self-control and low
levels of aspiration. The former is discussed first. The latter follows further below.
    Common reasons for people to save less than they would like to are psycho-
logical factors such as impatience (a strong preference for the present over the
future) and issues of self-control (competing preferences that dictate different
actions at different times). There is evidence from both developed and developing
countries that self-aware individuals seek to limit their options in anticipation of
future self-control problems. Ashraf, Karlan, and Yin (2006) investigate demand
for and impacts of a commitment savings device in the Philippines and find that
demand for such commitment devices is concentrated among women exhibiting
present-biased time preferences. Duflo, Kremer, and Robinson (2011) find that
offering a small, time-limited discount on fertilizer immediately after the harvest
has an effect on fertilizer use comparable to that of much larger discounts offered
later, around planting time. Giné et al. (2012) find that Malawian tobacco farmers
with present-biased preferences are more likely to revise a plan about how to use
future income, even when that plan is made under commitment.
    In this project, we test two interventions by addressing the psychological
barriers described above—the first encourages mental accounting; the second
targets status quo bias.


14.2.1	 Mental accounting through account labeling
Mental accounting, as introduced by Thaler (1990), describes the phenomenon
that money is not always fungible across expenditure categories. Savings that are
mentally assigned to a specific savings goal or set of expenditures, such as inputs
for farming, may become less available for another set of expenditures, such as
unplanned luxury purchases. Formal savings accounts, among other things, may
help people address the above-described psychological phenomena of impa-
tience and self-control by helping them perform mental accounting through phys-
ically—not just mentally—separating funds.
    Recent empirical work provides evidence that mental accounting can help
people increase savings. Dupas and Robinson (2013b) provide a number of simple
440  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              informal savings technologies, such as a simple metal lockbox, to members of
              existing savings groups in Ghana. The unifying feature shared by all the various
              savings technologies is that, while funds were technically fungible, they were
              designated as “savings for health.” Take-up was initially high and remained high
              after 33 months, and overall average savings for health increased substantially. A
              specific earmarking condition in which the type of earmarking was not chosen by
              participants was effective for emergency savings but ineffective for preventative
              health savings, suggesting that the type of labeling can matter.
                  In this study, participants are randomly separated into two groups. Both
              groups receive account opening assistance and an offer for one fully subsidized
              account. In addition, members of one group are encouraged to label their newly
              opened accounts for a specific, individually chosen savings goal. The labeling is
              physically reinforced by writing the savings goal on the automated teller machine
              (ATM) card that comes with the new account.


              14.2.2	 The power of default options
              A robust finding of behavioral economics that uses insights from psychology is the
              disproportional impact a status quo has on decision making (Kahneman, Knetsch,
              and Thaler 1991; Samuelson and Zeckhauser 1988). Given a set of choices, people
              are more likely to choose a particular option if that option is framed as the default
              or status quo. Since people are relatively more averse to losses, the perceived
              loss of moving away from the status quo tends to outweigh potential benefits.
                  The idea that defaults can matter in the context of savings has been shown
              by Thaler and Benartzi (2004) with the Save More Tomorrow program that offered
              employees the opportunity to precommit parts of future salary increases to retire-
              ment savings. Take-up of offers was high and remained high over time, and savings
              rates increased substantially for those who were offered the precommitment option.
                  Status quo effects can be expected to be more important for the poor since
              the effects of bad decisions have relatively larger repercussions; at the same
              time, the poor are more likely to be affected by status quo effects, since limited
              attention is relatively scarcer given a larger number of concurrent urgent items
              that need to be handled (Mullainathan and Shafir 2009).
                  In this study, some participants receive grants in the form of cash, while
              others receive grants directly deposited into their individual savings account. If
              status quo bias matters for savings in this context, then those who receive grants
              as direct deposits should have higher formal (and overall) savings, since cash will
              not be designated as savings and would be more likely to be spent.


              14.2.3	 Increasing aspirations
              A determinant in the decision making of the poor that recently is receiving more
              attention by economists in both theoretical (Dalton, Ghosal, and Mani 2011) and
              empirical work (Bernard, Dercon, and Taffesse 2011) is aspirations. Given external
                                    14.  Direct deposit and commitments to save in Malawi  ◾ 441




circumstances, individuals need to believe that their actions can make a differ-
ence in their lives and that change toward the better is possible. However, since
aspirations and beliefs are more broadly at least in part determined by individ-
uals’ local environment, initial conditions can matter with regard to how much
effort is exerted. Low achievement in the immediate environment can trigger a
negative feedback loop: lower effort—in expectation of low rewards—can lead to
low individual achievement, thereby perpetuating low expectations about future
cost-benefit ratios. If aspirations can be changed by external intervention, this
could lead individuals to try harder and achieve outcomes that are in fact possible
in a given environment, creating positive reinforcement.
    This study tests a cognitive intervention that targets respondent aspirations
by showing individual respondents short inspirational videos in order to set a
higher reference point for respondents to aim at and to increase their belief in
achieving those goals. A control group is shown a neutral video instead. Recent
pioneering empirical work by Bernard et al. (2012) uses a similar design in which a
documentary was shown in a group setting in rural Ethiopia. The researchers find
suggestive evidence of positive effects on education-related aspirations and on
demand for credit that are still visible six months after the intervention.



14.3	     CONTEXT OF THE STUDY
The study takes place in rural and peri-urban areas in Malawi. The household sample
will be chosen from the village population in a 10-kilometer radius surrounding the
trading center of Chitakale in Mulanje, a prominent trading center in the Mulanje
District in the southern region of Malawi. With two commercial banks, a major
microfinance institution, a microcredit institution, and a chain grocery store, Chita-
kale is a commercial hub frequented by residents of the local villages. The market
in Chitakale runs every day, experiencing particularly high traffic on Fridays, when
the largest number of informal vendors come and set up their sale items on tarps
on the ground. Chitakale is located close to a number of large commercial tea
estates, which form a major source of economic activity in the region. Chitakale is
within 75 kilometers of Blantyre, Malawi’s commercial capital.
    The study partners with a national commercial bank, NBS, to implement the
account intervention. NBS was originally established as the New Building Society
in 1964 and transitioned to a full-service bank in 2004. The bank currently oper-
ates 13 branches and 21 agencies throughout the country. The Mulanje NBS
branch is located in the center of Chitakale’s market area.



14.4	     HOUSEHOLD LISTING
For the purpose of identifying a representative sample of the villages surrounding
the Chitakale trading center, a household listing exercise was conducted. The
442  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              study sample includes households from five group villages. Each group village
              is represented by a group village headman that oversees the village chiefs. The
              total sample area consists of 14 villages ranging in size from about 50 house-
              holds at the low end to about 800 households at the other extreme. Villages are
              further divided into subvillages. A team of trained research assistants listed each
              household in these 14 villages, asking an adult member of the household for basic
              demographic and income information.
                  The listing survey ran from the end of January to the end of February 2013,
              including a clean-up period during which a small team revisited each village to
              capture any households missed during the first visit. The listing exercise recorded
              a total of 6,089 household interviews within an approximate radius of 6–7 kilo-
              meters outside of Chitakale. Fewer than 200 village households (3 percent of the
              population listed) were unavailable for interview. Households in the urban centers
              were excluded, so the sample represents a peri-urban and rural population.
                  Following are sample averages for key variables of the household listing.

                  ◾◾ Household head demographics: Among interviewed households,
                    69 percent reported having a male head of household. The average age for
                    all household heads is 42 years. Fifteen percent reported no formal educa-
                    tion. Twenty-one  percent had completed some schooling between stan-
                    dards one and four; 37 percent had completed some schooling between
                    standards five and eight (end of primary school). Twenty-seven  percent
                    of household heads had completed schooling beyond standard eight,
                    meaning secondary or tertiary education. The survey did not ask respon-
                    dents to specify a level beyond standard eight.
                  ◾◾ Household members: Respondents reported an average of 4.4 household
                    members. Household members are people who have regularly slept and
                    taken meals in the home for the majority of the last three months, including
                    nonrelatives and servants. Children under age 18 who are boarding at
                    school but whose parent or guardian is a household member are also
                    considered members.
                  ◾◾ Income sources: Interview respondents were asked to list the most
                    important sources of income (cash or in kind) from the last year, naming up
                    to five sources. Forty-three percent reported self-employment or a small
                    business as an important source; 33 percent reported piece labor for an
                    income source; 23  percent sell pigeon peas for income, and 20  percent
                    work an unskilled job for a private sector company. Other important
                    sources of income mentioned were remittances (11 percent), selling maize
                    (8 percent), working a skilled or professional private sector job (7 percent),
                    selling cassava (5 percent), and working with an organization or association
                    (5 percent). Respondents were asked to list the months in the last year in
                    which each source of income was received. Seventy-nine percent reported
                    having at least one source of income for each month of the last year.

    ◾◾ Household assets: Based on interviewer observation, 60  percent of
        households interviewed had some iron roofing. Forty-nine  percent of
        households had some glass windows, and 27 percent of homes had at least
        one room with cement flooring. Interviewers read out a list of common
        assets, and respondents were asked to self-report all items that any house-
        hold members owns. Forty-six  percent of households own at least one
        bicycle; 53 percent own a radio; 55 percent own a table; 49 percent own
        a bed. Forty-four  percent own a mobile phone, although some reported
        not owning a SIM (subscriber identity module) card to be able to use it.
        Fifty-six percent of homes own one or more axes, and 28 percent possess
        an iron (for clothing). Regarding livestock, the survey inquired about
        chickens (55 percent ownership) and goats (17 percent). Households own
        an average of 1.2 acres of land, including the land on which the house sits.
    ◾◾ Household financing: The survey included questions about banking and
        informal savings use. In 20 percent of households, at least one member has
        a bank account. On average, households with accounts used the bank 17.5
        times in the past year. Account use was defined as a withdrawal, deposit,
        transfer, direct deposit, or checking of the balance. Forty percent of house-
        holds had participated in an informal savings group in the past year.




14.5	      STUDY DESIGN

14.5.1	 Original study design
The original study design included an evaluation of the introduction of direct
deposits for a large agricultural firm that was going to switch workers from paying
in cash to paying directly into individual bank accounts.
    The partner firm was cooperating with a microlending institution that had set
up a small branch and housings for several ATMs. The research team had reached
an agreement with the firm and the bank to randomize the roll-out of direct
deposit for a pilot division of workers who had already been given accounts, and
extend the randomization of the roll-out at the appropriate level for the remainder
for the approximately 6,000 workers. The bank had already opened several thou-
sand accounts for smallholder farmers in the area that were transacting with our
partner firm. Roll-out of direct deposit for the same farmers was under way and
has been fully completed in the meantime.
    Despite the seemingly fortuitous timing of the study, the established pres-
ence of the bank, the introduction of direct deposit for smallholder farmers, and
assurances as well as expectations by all parties involved about the imminent
start, the roll-out was stalled and has not yet begun. The main reason for this
is the bank’s lack of capacity (management, information technology system) to
444  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              take over smallholder loans from the firm, which constitute an integral part of
              the bank’s business proposition. Given the revealed capacity constraints of the
              bank and the possibility that it would eventually have to abandon the project on
              economic grounds, the research team decided to pursue the research with a
              different, geographically close population with independent access to banks, and
              to work with a different bank as a partner.


              14.5.2	 Overview of project stages
              The study sample of 872 households was drawn randomly from the households
              included in the listing exercise. The study—lasting approximately one year—will
              be conducted in five stages: (1) baseline and account offers, (2) financial literacy
              training and immediate follow-up survey, (3) short-term follow-up survey, (4) direct
              deposits and expenditure surveys, and (5) endline survey with optional account
              closures. Each stage consists of one or more individual household visits.


              STAGE 1: BASELINE SURVEY AND ACCOUNT OFFERS
              Each of the 872 households in the sample were asked to complete a baseline
              survey; they were offered a special promotional account from a national commer-
              cial bank that has a local branch in Chitakale.
                  The baseline survey took approximately 90 minutes to complete. Ques-
              tion topics include demographics, expenditures, assets, sharing within social
              network, savings, savings aspirations, formal banking experience, financial
              knowledge, and agricultural activities. The account offer lasted approximately
              30 minutes. Households received one of two offers: (1) an offer for a promotional
              savings account, or (2) an offer for a promotional savings account with a savings
              goal label.
                  The respondents were offered the accounts at home, according to their
              assigned group, immediately after completing the baseline survey. The account
              script explained the benefits of savings accounts and the specific benefits of the
              promotional account. The research assistant walked the respondent through
              filling out the necessary account opening forms, organized the other documents
              required to bring to the bank, and helped the respondent formulate a plan for how
              and when to go to the bank to complete the account opening process.
                  Respondents received a bank account voucher with their name, appointment
              time, and bank hours. The voucher was only valid for two weeks after the home
              visit to encourage participants to open an account soon without procrastination.


              STAGE 2: FINANCIAL LITERACY TRAINING AND IMMEDIATE FOLLOW-UP
              SURVEY
              Each of the 872 households in the study were randomly selected for one of three
              financial literacy trainings (one group receiving no training). A research assistant
              visited the house to complete an individual training session with the household
                                   14.  Direct deposit and commitments to save in Malawi  ◾ 445




head; immediately following the training, the research assistant administered a
short survey measuring financial literacy and savings aspirations.
    The training lasted approximately 0–100 minutes, depending on the treat-
ment group assigned. The “info only” treatment watched a video about budgeting
monthly income and choosing the right savings method for their needs. This
group then completed personal worksheet exercises that demonstrate how to
create a monthly budget and monthly savings plan. The “info plus aspirations”
group completed the same training as the “info only” group; in addition, they
watched a video about community members who were able to save and improve
their households. This group also completed a worksheet with questions that
asked participants to envision their life in the future when they have reached their
savings goal. The “control” group did not receive any training.
    Following the training, the participants completed a 20-minute survey
including topics such as financial knowledge and savings aspirations. Modules
were similar to those administered at baseline.


STAGE 3: SHORT-TERM FOLLOW-UP SURVEY
The short-term follow-up survey was administered two weeks after the financial
literacy training and immediate follow-up survey. This survey took approximately
30 minutes to complete, and was similar to the immediate follow-up survey with
question topics including financial knowledge and savings aspirations.


STAGE 4: DIRECT DEPOSIT AND EXPENDITURE SURVEYS
Enumerators will visit a subset of 600 study participants, all of whom have savings
accounts with our partner bank. The household head will be asked to complete an
expenditure survey; after the survey, some respondents will be offered a voucher
to receive a monetary prize. The respondent must travel to the bank in two days
to present the voucher and determine the prize. A research assistant will return
one and two weeks later, after the prize has been announced, and administer the
same expenditure survey. The three rounds of surveys and prizes will occur over
two months.
    Six hundred households with savings accounts will be chosen from the
greater study sample to win a monetary prize of approximately US$60. Money
will be delivered in one of two ways, with the method to be chosen at random:
(1) cash, to be picked up from a location in Chitakale; or (2) directly deposited
into the winner’s savings account. The timing of the disbursement will also be
randomized: (1) immediately following prize announcement, (2) one day after
prize announcement, or (3) eight days after prize announcement.
    The expenditure survey will be administered before the prize is announced
and again one and two weeks after. The research assistant will ask the participant
to detail all household expenditures from the last week. The survey is set to last
approximately 45 minutes.
446  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              STAGE 5: ENDLINE SURVEY WITH OPTIONAL ACCOUNT CLOSURE
              The endline survey will be administered approximately one year after the base-
              line survey. Survey administration will take approximately 60 minutes; the topics
              are similar to those at baseline, including demographics, expenditures, assets,
              sharing within social network, savings, savings aspirations, formal banking expe-
              rience, financial knowledge, and agricultural activities.
                  Those respondents who opened a promotional bank account at the begin-
              ning of the study will be reminded that the promotional aspects of the account
              will expire at the end of the month. They will be informed of the fees that will take
              effect next month, and will be given assistance in closing the account if they wish
              to do so. The discussion will last approximately 25 minutes, depending on the
              action the participant decides to take.



              14.6	      INTERVENTION DETAILS

              14.6.1	 Savings accounts
              All study participants were offered a subsidized savings account with the
              specifications listed below. In addition to the account offer, half of the sample
              (436 households) were randomly chosen to receive the labeling treatment. In the
              labeling treatment, the study participant was encouraged to label the subsidized
              account with a personal savings goal. The participant could choose any goal label,
              with no restrictions except word length. The label appears on the participant’s
              ATM card as a sticker with wording such as “saving for house” or “saving for
              school fees.” The ATM card label is intended as a regular reminder to the partic-
              ipant of his or her savings goal, potentially reducing the likelihood that he or she
              will use the account funds for other expenditures. Labeling could increase savings
              and the ability of participants to reach their savings goal.
                  The accounts offered have the following characteristics:

                  ◾◾ Control group: regular savings account
                      —— Minimum balance
                      —— No initial deposit
                      —— No monthly fee for the first 12 months after account opening
                      —— No withdrawal fee for the first 12 months after account opening
                      —— Some interest earned on balance
                      —— ATM card included

                  ◾◾ Treatment group: labeled savings account
                      —— All the features mentioned above for regular savings account
                      —— ATM card has a label that mentions the owner’s chosen savings goal (a
                         sticker saying e.g., “saving for house” or “saving for fertilizer”)

14.6.2	 Account opening
During the household visit in which the baseline survey was administered, the
research assistant also offered the subsidized accounts. The research assis-
tant read from a script that explained the special offer and how to complete the
account opening process. The research assistant helped the respondent fill out
the bank account opening forms, if he or she wished. The research assistant also
worked with the respondent to identify how and when to travel to the bank to
complete the account opening process, and made an appointment for the spec-
ified time.
    Two research assistants were stationed at the local bank branch to assist
study participants with opening their savings accounts. If participants brought
all the necessary documentation, they were able to open an account that day.
Clients received their account number immediately and an ATM card during a
subsequent bank visit two to four weeks later.
    Study participants could choose to open the account as a joint account. At
the time of account opening, both account owners had to be present. The joint
account owners then decided whether one or both needed to be present to with-
draw money.


14.6.3	 Financial literacy training
Study participants were randomly assigned to one of three financial literacy
training groups, listed below. They received a one-on-one training session in their
household with a research assistant.


TREATMENT 1: INFORMATIONAL TRAINING
The study participants watched a video explaining financial concepts, such as
common banking fees, interest rates, budgeting, and choosing the best savings
method for one’s needs. At the conclusion of the session, the research assis-
tant and participant reviewed a sample savings goal plan and completed a corre-
sponding worksheet. This informational training was meant to increase participant
knowledge of financial concepts, savings methods, and budgeting.
    The materials for the training were based on a locally developed financial
literacy training from a microfinance bank. The training was adapted for time
length and research purposes; the resulting material was piloted several times
and adjusted to improve comprehension.


TREATMENT 2: INFORMATIONAL AND ASPIRATIONAL TRAINING
In addition to the informational training described above, the aspirational training
included a second video that featured five local residents—Fred, Bornface, Janet,
Mac, and Dickson—who have worked hard to earn income and have used the
profits to improve their lives. The stories are true, describing real hardships,
448  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              how the farmers or businesspeople overcame them, and the positive impact
              of increased wealth on their livelihoods. The second activity to increase aspira-
              tions was an additional worksheet that asked participants to imagine their main
              savings goal in detail, how it would improve their lives, and how it could increase
              their social standing in the family and wider community. This training was meant
              to increase participants’ aspirations for the future.


              CONTROL GROUP: NO TRAINING
              This group watched a video about the benefits of family planning. They did not
              receive informational or aspirational financial literacy training.


              14.6.4	 Direct deposit grants
              Among the study households with a savings accounts (promotional or existing),
              600 will be randomly chosen to participate in a study of direct deposit. All 600
              households will be visited by a research assistant, who will present a voucher to
              earn a cash prize.
                  The participant will need to present the voucher to a research assistant in
              Chitakale two days later. The participant will choose a token from a bag to deter-
              mine the prize (or treatment group):

                  ◾◾ Treatment Group 1: cash prize immediately. The research assistants
                     will inform 80 households that they have won MK 25,000 (approximately
                     US$60) and will receive the cash immediately.
                  ◾◾ Treatment Group 2: direct deposit immediately. The research assis-
                     tants will inform 80 households that they have won MK 25,000 and will
                     receive the money immediately into their savings account.
                  ◾◾ Treatment Group 3: cash prize + 1 day. The research assistants will
                     inform 80 households that they have won MK 25,000 and will need to
                     return tomorrow to pick up the cash.
                  ◾◾ Treatment Group 4: direct deposit + 1 day. The research assistants will
                     inform 80 households that they have won MK 25,000 and will receive the
                     money tomorrow directly into their savings account.
                  ◾◾ Treatment Group 5: cash prize + 8 days. The research assistants will
                     inform 80 households that they have won MK 25,000 and will need to
                     return in eight days to pick up the cash.
                  ◾◾ Treatment Group 6: direct deposit + 8 days. The research assistants will
                     inform 80 households that they have won MK 25,000 and will receive the
                     money directly into their savings account in eight days.
                  ◾◾ Control group. The research assistants will inform 120 households that
                     they have won MK 1,000 (approximately US$3) and will receive the cash
                     immediately.

14.7	      ADDITIONAL DATA ANALYSIS OF HOUSEHOLD LISTING:
           CHARACTERISTICS OF BANK ACCOUNT HOLDERS
Among the households surveyed as part of the village listings, 80  percent do
not hold a bank account. Among the bank account holders, we categorize “infre-
quent bank account users” as those who use their bank account less than once
a month over the last 12 months (roughly half of all account users); we catego-
rize the others as “frequent bank account users.” Comparing basic demographic
and income characteristics across bank account usage status shows that bank
account holders were more often male. Thirty-four percent of those who do not
hold an account were women, compared to 20 percent of account holders. Bank
account ownership and frequency of use do not vary substantially with the age
of the respondent: infrequent bank account users had the lowest average age
(39.4), slightly younger than frequent account users (40.2 years) and those with no
account (42.2 years). Bank account holders are more educated than those without
an account. Those who did not hold an account had, on average, 5 years of school;
in comparison infrequent and frequent account users averaged 7.6 and 8.1 years
of school, respectively. Participation in a rotating savings and credit association
(ROSCA) over the last year was most pronounced among frequent bank account
users (60 percent); participation was slightly less among infrequent account users
(58 percent), and much less among those who do not hold accounts (36 percent).
    The types of household income source vary by bank account ownership. Those
who did not hold bank accounts were more likely to mention income through
piece labor work (37 percent), unskilled work in the private sector (23 percent),
and remittances (12 percent). Account holders—both frequent and infrequent—
were more likely to mention income through crop sales (28 and 27  percent,
respectively), self-employment (57  percent of infrequent users), skilled work in
the private sector (13 and 18  percent, respectively), and work with nongovern-
mental organizations or associations (7 and 8 percent, respectively).

15.1	      PROJECT BACKGROUND AND SCOPE
The last few decades have seen a tremendous expansion of the availability of
financial services to millions of individuals previously deemed “unbankable.”
Microfinance and microinsurance institutions have grown dramatically and
have now entered mainstream finance. Innovations in financial products and
service delivery methods now make it possible to offer affordable products
even to very poor or remote individuals. These developments have success-
fully provided millions of households with new opportunities to save, borrow,
and manage liquidity and risk. While this expansion in financial access has
the potential to significantly increase the welfare of consumers in developing
economies, several challenges lie ahead.
    The new client base is largely comprised of poorer, less educated individ-
uals than the traditional consumers of financial services. This poses the ques-
tion of whether consumers will be able to make complex financial decisions
or if low financial literacy will limit the spread of financial products to the less
educated segments of the population. Moreover, even among the fraction
of the population already taking part in the financial system, behaviors that
significantly depart from those predicted by standard economic theory are
prevalent. These departures raise the concern that disadvantaged individuals
may fail to realize the full benefits generated by financial access because
they are ill prepared to make complex financial decisions.

                  There has been a growing interest among practitioners in financial educa-
              tion courses to mitigate these issues. These programs have the objective of
              illustrating the costs and benefits of savings, credit, and insurance, as well as
              familiarizing individuals with financial products. Financial education is expected
              to help individuals become more comfortable with financial institutions and help
              them amend behaviors detrimental to their financial security. The underlying
              assumption is that suboptimal behaviors—such as insufficient savings, exces-
              sive amounts of debt, use of expensive sources of credit when cheaper sources
              are available, and insufficient adoption of insurance—are due to consumers’ lack
              of financial knowledge. The provision of financial education would correct this
              market failure, allowing mutually beneficial transactions between consumers and
              financial institutions to occur.
                  To this end, several governments, firms, and international organizations
              around the world have started funding financial education programs. These proj-
              ects aim to improve people’s financial skills, with the ultimate goal of reducing
              inequality by giving individuals the opportunity to benefit from financial access.
              For example, in 2004, the government of South Africa adopted the Financial
              Sector Charter, which requires financial institutions to contribute 0.2 percent of
              after-tax profits to financial education. Old Mutual—an international investment,
              savings, insurance, and banking group operating in South Africa since 1845—
              dedicated R 8.69 million to its financial education program in 2011 alone, training
              almost 36,000 individuals. This considerable outlay had the objective of improving
              people’s financial skills, helping them make sounder financial decisions, and
              encouraging saving. However, there is little substantive evidence on the effective-
              ness of these financial education programs. While low levels of financial literacy
              seem to be correlated with worse financial outcomes, it is unclear if improve-
              ments in financial knowledge will result in better financial choices.
                  This study adds to the growing body of evidence analyzing the relation-
              ship between levels of financial literacy and poor financial choices and robust
              evidence on the effects of financial education on financial knowledge, behavior,
              and outcomes. The evaluation sheds light on the channels through which financial
              education is assimilated and internalized. The results of this study will help Old
              Mutual improve the effectiveness of its financial education program and provide
              valuable insights for financial education programs elsewhere.


              15.1.1	 Purpose and scope of the evaluation
              Financial access is widely recognized as being crucial to development. Thanks
              to innovations in products and technology, financial access has dramatically
              increased over the last few decades. Now more than ever, people in developing
              countries have the possibility of participating in the formal and semiformal finan-
              cial system. For instance, microfinance and microinsurance products are popular
              among millions of lower-income households. Despite this success, many questions
                                   15.  Evalution of Old Mutual’s On the Money program  ◾ 453




remain unanswered with regard to individuals and their behavior vis-à-vis the
financial system.
    While the benefits of savings, borrowing, and insurance products seem unde-
niable, a large share of the world population does not take advantage of these
opportunities. Chaia et al. (2009) report that 5.5 billion people—over half of the
world’s adult population—does not save or borrow through formal or semiformal
financial institutions. While part of this phenomenon is largely explained by a lack
of access, take-up is relatively low even when formal financial institutions are
available. Karlan, Morduch, and Mullainathan (2010) note that financial participa-
tion is especially low in Sub-Saharan Africa, averaging at about 20 percent of the
population. While supply factors partly explain low take-up of financial services,
they point out that demand-side factors should not be dismissed as important
explanations.
    Low demand for beneficial financial products and services is only one of the
many divergences from the behaviors predicted by the neoclassical economic
model of life-cycle consumption and savings. There is vast evidence attesting to
the fact that individuals undersave, borrow excessively, or borrow at an excessive
interest rate. Although no single explanation can account for such large depar-
tures from the predictions of rational economic models, several authors have
imputed part of the responsibility for these occurrences to imperfect information
(Lusardi 2008) and to behavioral biases such as hyperbolic discounting (Laibson
1997), lack of trust (Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales 2008), and lack of understanding
of compound interest rates (Lusardi and Tufano 2009).
    Financial education has often been viewed as a way to solve the problems
created by behavioral biases and imperfect information. Low levels of financial
literacy are correlated with poor financial outcomes (Cole, Sampson, and Zia
2011), and several studies find that the vast majority of the population struggles
with basic financial concepts in developed countries and developing countries
alike (Lusardi and Mitchell 2007; Lusardi and Tufano 2009; Cole, Sampson, and
Zia 2011). In an attempt to mitigate the problems arising from this disconnect,
there has been growing attention over the last few years to programs aimed at
promoting financial education.
    Financial literacy has been shown to be closely associated with portfolio
diversification (Guiso and Jappelli 2008), retirement planning (Lusardi and Mitchell
2009), the use of lower-cost sources of credit (Lusardi and Tufano 2009), and stock
market participation (Van Rooij, Lusardi, and Alessie 2007). Similarly, financially
illiterate households have a tendency to underestimate the cost of compound
interest rates (Stango and Zinman 2009) and fail to refinance mortgages at more
favorable conditions (Campbell 2006). Financial literacy might also have more
far-reaching implications for financial inclusion, since several studies find that
vulnerable groups such as minorities, women, youth, and less educated indi-
viduals fare much worse with respect to financial knowledge than the average
individual (Lusardi and Mitchell 2008; Lusardi, Mitchell, and Curto 2010). Despite
454  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              these findings, it is unclear whether increasing financial knowledge is the most
              effective means of improving financial outcomes.
                  Practitioners have viewed financial education as a way to increase savings,
              asset accumulation, and stock market participation, and to improve credit
              management. It is clear that low financial literacy prevents individuals from
              making optimal decisions concerning consumption, asset allocation, and debt
              management, but it is yet to be established if an intervention aimed at increasing
              financial education would be successful in positively affecting these variables.
              For instance, Cole, Sampson, and Zia (2011) conducted a field experiment in Indo-
              nesia, finding that despite the correlation between financial literacy and finan-
              cial access, an exogenously assigned financial literacy program has only modest
              effects on financial participation.
                  Caution should be used when interpreting the results, however, and varying
              programs and teaching methods may result in significantly different outcomes.
              For example, Fischer, Drexler, and Schoar (2010) obtained positive results on
              financial management when offering people a rules-of-thumb-based education
              rather than a more comprehensive approach, while Karlan and Valdivia (2011)
              found that short entrepreneurship training sessions over an extended period of
              time were successful at improving business practices in Peru.
                  Thus, while financial education may appear to be an important remedy for
              the problems of low financial participation and suboptimal financial behavior,
              reality presents a much more varied picture. Despite the positive correlation
              between financial literacy and financial outcome, the causal relationship between
              the two is unclear. This chapter aims to create a better understanding of whether
              improving financial literacy through an educational program would constitute a
              viable conduit to improve financial outcomes.


              15.1.2	 Main research questions
              Existing evidence on the effect of financial literacy is generally inconclusive, largely
              because existing studies fail to establish a causal link or suffer from limited data.
              To address these shortcomings, our study measures the causal effects of finan-
              cial education on financial behaviors and comprehensively examines the scope
              and pathways of these effects. To establish causality, this study incorporates
              random assignment of burial society support plan (BSSP) groups and borrowing
              groups of Women’s Development Businesses (WDB) organizations to receive Old
              Mutual’s On the Money financial literacy training. This procedure ensures that
              those who receive training are statistically indistinguishable from those who do
              not, and that any observable difference between the groups (in terms of saving,
              borrowing, etc.) after the intervention was implemented can be attributed solely
              to the training program.
                  Both the treatment and the control groups participated in baseline and
              endline surveys so as to detail the scope and pathways by which financial

education affects financial behaviors. The survey questionnaires included a
module on household demographic characteristics, saving and borrowing, finan-
cial knowledge, attitudes toward the financial system, numeracy, and well-being.
Study participants were divided randomly into treatment and control groups. The
treatment group received eight hours of financial education training provided by
Old Mutual. The course aimed at promoting sensible financial behaviors, such as
higher savings, reducing the debt burden, and financial planning.
    The intervention was specifically designed to improve subjects’ financial
knowledge and skills, targeting common misconceptions about money manage-
ment and financial institutions, and aimed to improve their ability to understand
financial concepts. Individuals could, for example, improve the way they manage
their income, debt, and household expenditures, potentially becoming more able
to cope with negative income shocks. The study results may be used to improve
the current curriculum of the financial education program to increase its effec-
tiveness.
    This study aims to examine a range of important channels and mechanisms
through which financial education could affect outcomes. Beyond evaluating the
effectiveness of one specific financial education program, we also hope to provide
some deeper insights into how financial education might work more generally both
in South Africa and elsewhere in the world. The goal of the study is to examine
a range of important channels through which financial education could work. In
particular, prior to the start of the study, we formulated the following hypotheses:

 1.	 Financial knowledge: Does financial education increase the participants’
      financial knowledge and understanding of financial concepts?
 2.	 Financial planning: Does financial education increase household finan-
      cial planning (e.g., drawing up budgets, making a will, forecasting future
      expenses)?
 3.	 Financial outcomes: Does more financial knowledge or better financial
      planning result in improved financial outcomes?
 4.	 Savings: Does financial education increase the participants’ savings (e.g.,
      savings amounts, frequency of deposits)?
 5.	 Financial choices: Does financial education affect the types of financial
      products participants choose (e.g., informal borrowing, fixed deposits,
      loans, insurance plans)?
 6.	 Heterogeneous effects: Does the impact of financial education vary with
      initial levels of financial literacy, education, or other demographic charac-
      teristics?
  7.	 Well-being: Does financial education affect the mental well-being of the
      participants (e.g., stress levels, aspirations, confidence)?
456  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              15.1.3	 Old Mutual’s On the Money program
              Half of the sample was randomly selected to participate in a financial educa-
              tion course four to six months after completing the baseline survey. The finan-
              cial education training course replicated Old Mutual’s On the Money curriculum,
              and was taught by facilitators selected and trained by Old Mutual. Instructors
              used materials developed to modify the audience’s financial behavior, encourage
              responsible financial decision making, and improve people’s money manage-
              ment skills. The On the Money course was divided into five modules, each to be
              completed in 1¼–1½ hours, over a single day of training. Various didactic activi-
              ties complemented the curriculum, including individual and group exercises. The
              instruction was supplemented with video clips and PowerPoint slides. In addition,
              a workbook was used during interactive group activities and discussions, with
              attendants practicing creating budgets together and discussing their financial
              plans for the future.
                  The course started by exposing some misconceptions about money manage-
              ment. In particular, the focus was on conveying the fact that even low-income
              individuals can attain financial security if they develop good money management
              habits and relinquish careless financial behaviors. The facilitator used two exam-
              ples to reinforce this concept, the ostrich and the peacock. The ostrich buries its
              head under the sand to hide from the truth and avoid facing problematic situa-
              tions, just as some individuals attempt to ignore their financial worries in the hope
              that they will disappear. The peacock uses its extravagant plumage to impress
              potential mates, just as individuals spend excessive amounts of money to assert
              their status within their social group. The facilitator then explained how aban-
              doning behaviors like those of the ostrich and the peacock will enable individuals
              to enjoy their money while working toward financial security.
                  Individuals were then asked to envision a scenario in which they had attained
              financial security and sufficient savings for a comfortable retirement and to focus
              on how satisfying reaching such a state would be. The facilitator explained that
              if they start embracing the secrets of the “Big Five of Africa,” that scenario could
              become a reality. Each of the five secrets comprises one of the modules and aims
              at conveying a core idea and two or three related ideas pertaining to behaviors
              that would improve individuals’ financial management. The “Secret of the Lion” is
              saving—in particular, prespending saving, in order to make it easier to set aside
              a suitable portion of income whenever a pay check is cashed. The “Secret of the
              Leopard” is setting a clear and realistic goal to motivate and reward good financial
              management. The “Secret of the Elephant” is to draft comprehensive budgets,
              listing sources of income and expenses. The “Secret of the Rhino” is to reduce the
              existing amount of debt insofar as possible and to avoid becoming unnecessarily
              indebted. Lastly, the “Secret of the Buffalo” is using insurance as a protection
              from life risks and increasing assets through careful investing.

        This curriculum hoped to generate positive attitudes toward saving and
budgeting, to encourage individuals to rely less on debt, and to present financial
institutions as a medium to achieve these goals. The treatment was expected to
improve individuals’ financial knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions as measured
by the endline survey and to affect behavior along the lines described above.



15.2	METHODOLOGY
Examining the scope and pathways by which financial education affects financial
behaviors requires that we obtain a rich data set on trained participants and the
control group. To that end, we obtained outcome measures through a baseline
and an endline questionnaire, which allow us to understand how financial literacy
evolves and the ways individuals change their financial behavior in response to
training. All individuals participating in the study completed a baseline survey.
For the next four to five months, individuals randomly assigned to the treatment
group took part in the Old Mutual financial education module. Five to six months
afterwards, the entire sample completed the endline survey (see figure 15A.1 in
the annex to this chapter for a more detailed timeline of the study).
        To estimate the true causal impact of financial education, we need to estab-
lish the correct counterfactual—i.e., what our trained participants would have
done had they not received the training. Studies that simply compare individuals
who receive financial education to those who do not are susceptible to selec-
tion bias, meaning that people who choose to take financial literacy courses may
differ from those who choose not to take such courses. Our evaluation meth-
odology—the randomized controlled trial—eliminates that bias. By randomizing
assignment to treatment or control group, we ensure the offer to attend training
is not correlated with any potentially confounding factors such as level of educa-
tion, income, or motivation.1
        The randomization thus allows us to interpret differences between treatment
and control groups in the endline as the causal effects of financial education. The
endline questionnaire allows us to discern these effects by collecting information
on a number of variables, including financial knowledge, attitudes, and outcomes.
This information lets us evaluate the possible pathways through which financial
education can affect behavior.


15.2.1	 Intention to treat analysis
The study’s setup allows for an intention to treat analysis. This means that the
results presented in the findings section depend on the initial random assignment

     This introductory information was drawn from the baseline report.
458  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              of individuals to a treatment and control group and not on the actual level of
              participation of individuals in the financial education module. In effect, individuals
              in the treatment group were merely offered the opportunity to participate in Old
              Mutual’s financial education program, and were not required to do so.
                  Whether individuals completed the assigned treatment or not is disregarded
              in an intention to treat analysis, to avoid the risk that underlying factors correlated
              with the treatment’s take-up might bias results. This is because some unobserv-
              able individual characteristics—personality traits such as conscientiousness, for
              example—might affect both the program’s take-up and financial outcomes such
              as savings. In measuring the effect of financial education only among individ-
              uals who attended the training without accounting for conscientiousness or any
              other unobservable characteristic affecting both participation and outcomes, we
              would in effect attribute the effect of these characteristics to financial education,
              creating a spurious estimate for the program’s effect.
                  Measuring the differences between the two groups as assigned in the
              randomization process ensures that the effect detected is truly attributable to
              financial education. However, it is important to keep in mind that these differ-
              ences are to be attributed to the option of freely attending a financial education
              training course, rather than participation in the program itself.


              15.2.2	 Sample selection
              The sample was selected among BSSP and WDB borrowing groups because
              these groups resembled the target population of Old Mutual’s financial education
              program. The selected sample includes 43 BSSP and 36 WDB groups located across
              13 geographic areas in the provinces of Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. Clusters of
              BSSP and/or WDB groups were located in Flagstaff, Bizana, Mount Frere, Matatiele,
              Queenstown, Mthatha, Butterworth, East London, Port Elizabeth, Underberg,
              Empangeni, Mtubatuba, and Port Shepstone (see figure 15A.2 for a map indicating
              these areas). Table 15A.1 presents a comprehensive list of the groups surveyed
              in the baseline; table 15A.2 presents a list of the groups surveyed in the endline.
              These groups are of varying sizes, ranging from those with 10 or fewer members to
              those consisting of more than 50 individuals. All members of the WDB groups are
              women, and men are a minority within the burial societies in the sample. Overall,
              the sample includes 1,291 individuals: 589 received the On the Money training, and
              661 were in the control group. In the final sample, 673 individuals belonged to a
              WDB group, while 585 individuals were members of a burial society.


              15.2.3	 Data collection methods
              The financial education training module was implemented by Old Mutual facilita-
              tors, who were selected and trained by Old Mutual. Surveys were conducted by
              10 surveyors from a professional survey firm, Reform Development Consulting,
                                       15.  Evalution of Old Mutual’s On the Money program  ◾ 459




based in Durban. The surveyors were hired and trained by the Abdul Latif Jameel
Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL Africa).
        Baseline data collection began July 4, 2011, and ended November 10, 2011; the
endline data collection began May 31, 2012, and ended November 20, 2012. The
baseline data collection was conducted in a single wave, with surveyors visiting
each location and moving on to the next one once collection was completed; the
endline was articulated in two distinct waves to reduce attrition. Surveyors visited
all locations in the first wave, between May 31 and September 3, 2012. During
the second wave, from October 24 to November 20, 2012, surveyors traced indi-
viduals who could not be contacted during the first wave to ensure continuity
between the baseline and the endline data.
        The baseline and endline survey questionnaires included questions on the
following:2

        ◾◾ General household and personal characteristics
        ◾◾ Financial literacy and behavior
        ◾◾ General and mathematical literacy
        ◾◾ Attitudes toward banks, hire purchase, and gambling
        ◾◾ Past experience with hire purchases
        ◾◾ Gambling behaviors
        ◾◾ Risk aversion
        ◾◾ Savings, debt, and insurance behavior
        ◾◾ Past, current, and future expenditure behavior
        ◾◾ Mental distress and well-being
        ◾◾ Future goals and aspirations.

        The information thus collected in the baseline was used to ensure that the
treatment and control groups displayed similar characteristics and to assess how
the initial levels of certain variables (e.g., income, education, financial literacy, or
mathematical abilities) can lead to heterogeneous impacts of the financial educa-
tion training. In order to improve statistical power, data from the baseline survey
were used to create group-level pairs among the BSSP and WDB groups, respec-
tively. Within each pair, treatment was randomly assigned to one group with the
other serving as control.
        The data collected in the baseline and endline surveys were recorded on
smart phones and automatically transferred to a server using a software called
Pendragon VI, from which data were imported for collating and cleaning.

              15.2.4	Randomization
              The assignment of individuals to the treatment group that would receive financial
              education or to the control group was determined through group-level random-
              ization. Random assignment occurred on a rolling basis: once all groups in a
              predefined geographical area were surveyed, the assignment of those groups
              occurred, before the surveyor began data collection in the next region. Assign-
              ment was done on the basis of pair-wise matching using the Mahalanobis distance
              algorithm based on eight variables:

                  ◾◾ Number of households
                  ◾◾ Median household income
                  ◾◾ Median household size
                  ◾◾ Median number of dependents
                  ◾◾ Whether the median household saved in any way
                  ◾◾ Median number of savings accounts
                  ◾◾ Median baseline math score
                  ◾◾ Median baseline financial literacy score.

                  Once the groups were thus defined, one group was randomly assigned to
              the treatment group, and the other to the control group. When the number of
              sampling units inside a stratum was odd, a “pair” containing three sampling units
              had to be generated. Within this type of “pair,” sampling units were randomly
              ordered, the first sampling unit being assigned to the control group, the second to
              the treatment group, and the third assigned randomly to one of the two groups.
                  This rolling-basis process was necessary because of timeline constraints,
              and it resulted in a de facto stratification by area and organization type (BSSP or
              WDB), while the matching mechanism ensured that the samples were balanced.


              15.2.5	 Sample description
              Of the 1,258 individuals in the final sample, 1,117 are women and 130 are men.
              Within BSSPs, 78.6  percent of the members surveyed are female compared to
              more than 99 percent in the WDB groups. The median respondent is a 51-year-old
              woman who has seven years of schooling, earns R 1,050 a month, and receives at
              least one government grant of R 260 per month.
                  While the collection of survey data at baseline served the primary purpose
              of ensuring that the treatment and control groups were comparable after the
              randomization, we can also use this information to draw a comparison between
              our sample and the rest of the South African population. For instance, it is possible
              to compare our data set with that of the National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS)
              collected by the School of Economics at the University of Cape Town. The NIDS
              data set is a comprehensive panel of surveys administered to 28,000 individuals in
              7,300 households in South Africa, collecting detailed information on demographic
                                   15.  Evalution of Old Mutual’s On the Money program  ◾ 461




characteristics, income and employment, health, education, and well-being. We
use the results from Wave 2 of the panel, collected in 2010–11, as a point of refer-
ence for our sample.
    There are some small but significant differences between the samples from
WDB and BSSP groups with respect to the NIDS sample. Members of WDB groups
are on average younger than BSSP members—respectively, 48 and 55 years old,
on average. The average NIDS respondent to the “Adult (15+) Questionnaire” is
significantly younger: 33 years old. While the native language of the majority
of our sample is IsiXhosa (64  percent of WDB respondents, and 71  percent of
BSSP respondents), IsiXhosa is the second-most common language in the NIDS
survey, spoken by less than 16  percent of the respondents. The most widely
spoken language in the NIDS sample is IsiZulu, spoken by almost 33 percent of
individuals. The remaining 36 percent of WDB members also speak IsiZulu; among
BSSP members, 20 percent speak IsiZulu and 9.4 percent speak Sesotho. It is thus
clear that because of the geographic concentration of our sample in the Eastern
Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces, certain populations were oversampled with
respect to the national average.
    While 17.3 percent of BSSP and 12.2 percent of WDB respondents have not
been educated, the two groups have on average completed about 7.54 years
of education if they were enrolled in school; this puts them slightly below the
national average, with almost 14 percent of individuals having no schooling, and
an average of 9.17 years of education among individuals who did receive some
education. Only 12.3 percent of BSSP and 6.2 percent of WDB respondents have
completed grade 12, obtaining a matric degree; in contrast, more than 23 percent
of the national sample did so. Individuals in our sample report a lower under-
standing of English than the national average; about 29  percent of WDB and
35 percent of BSSP respondents said they understood some English. In the NIDS
sample, almost 63 percent of individuals reported they read English well or fairly
well, and almost 62 percent said they wrote English well or fairly well.
    Our sample is also somewhat poorer than the national average, reporting
a median income of R 1,050 among BSSP members and R 1,260 among WDB
members. Individuals in the NIDS survey report a median gross income of R 1,850
and R 1,600 net of taxes and deductions. Only a minority of the national sample
reports receiving government grants; while in the sample under investigation this
is fairly commonplace, with almost 85 percent of respondents receiving at least
one government grant. Individuals in our sample are also somewhat less likely
to be salaried employees and more likely to be self-employed than the national
average. Slightly more than 10 percent of WDB members and less than 5 percent
of BSSP members reported being in salaried employment; the figure reported in
the NIDS survey is over 24 percent. While a little over 10 percent of NIDS individ-
uals reported being self-employed (or homemakers), this figure is at 20 percent
for BSSP members and at over 75 percent for WDB members.

              15.2.6	Attendance
              Randomization was carried out at the group level, meaning that all individuals
              belonging to the selected BSSP or WDB group were sent an invitation to partici-
              pate in the financial education training. Before the training, Old Mutual facilitators
              sent an open invitation to the entire group, and individuals were given the choice
              of whether or not they wanted to participate. While group members external to
              our sample were allowed to participate in the financial education module as well,
              because of the geographical distance between surveyed groups, it is extremely
              unlikely that any members of the control group participated in the training
              courses. Treatment spillover is thus not a major concern, and the control group
              can be thought of as an appropriate counterfactual for the treatment group.


              15.2.7	 Balance checks
              Because of the randomization in the treatment assignment, demographic charac-
              teristics as well as average responses to baseline survey questions are expected
              to be balanced across treatment and control groups. Furthermore, the random-
              ization was performed within the subsamples of BSSP and WDB groups; there-
              fore, even within these subsamples, observations are expected to be balanced.
              Table 15A.3 in the annex to this chapter reports the relevant statistics on demo-
              graphic characteristics and on the set of outcome variables later employed in
              the analysis of the effects of financial education training. The responses to these
              variables were collected in the baseline survey—i.e., before the financial educa-
              tion intervention—and the table reports a randomization balance test in the full
              sample as well as in the subsamples of BSSP and WDB groups.
                  All variables, with the exception of the respondents’ risk aversion, are balanced
              both in the full sample and within each subsample. Risk aversion is measured by
              a question asking the respondent to choose between a gamble and a safe choice
              of equal expected pay. There is no reason to believe that this variable should be
              unbalanced, and we attribute this solely to chance. In a relatively small sample of
              about 400 respondents, it is not out of the ordinary to occasionally have a slight
              imbalance for a specific characteristic. While statistically significant, the differ-
              ence in the fraction of risk-averse respondents in the full sample is very small in
              absolute terms—83 percent in the control group compared to 87 percent in the
              treatment group—and we do not expect this discrepancy to affect the endline
              results. Furthermore, we conducted the randomization ourselves, by computer.



              15.3	FINDINGS
              To estimate the effect of financial education on the groups that were offered
              to take part in Old Mutual’s On the Money program, we use regression analysis
              to estimate the difference between the financial outcomes of the treatment
                                            15.  Evalution of Old Mutual’s On the Money program  ◾ 463




and control groups. We use the ordinary least squares method to estimate how
financial outcomes depend on treatment assignment. The estimated coefficient
reports the treatment effect—i.e., the average difference in outcome between
the treatment and control groups. The control mean reports the control group
average for a particular outcome. The mean outcome for the treatment group can
be calculated by adding the value of the coefficient to the control mean.
     A statistically significant coefficient means that we can, with high confi-
dence, reject the hypothesis that the difference between the treatment and
control groups is due solely to chance. The level of confidence is indicated by
asterisks in the following tables: one asterisk next to the coefficient means that
there is a 90 percent likelihood that the observed difference is the causal effect
of treatment assignment, as opposed to a difference due to chance; two asterisks
are reported when this likelihood is higher than 95 percent; and three asterisks
indicate that this likelihood is beyond 99 percent. The tables report these values
for the entire sample as well as separately for the subsamples corresponding to
the BSSP and WDB groups.


15.3.1	 The effect of financial education on financial
        awareness and attitudes
Table 15.1 reports the effect of financial education on financial awareness. The
first five variables are indexes created to summarize various responses on each
topic. The last variable reports the response to survey question F21. Responses
were coded using dummy variables, which took the value of 1 if the individual
was aware of the discussed topic, and the value of 0 if she was not. These values
were then averaged to create a financial awareness index. See table 15A.13 for
the breakdown of each index into the original variables.

                           Financial education seems to have a significant effect on budgeting both in
                    the full sample and within the BSSP sample. It should be noted that this is the
                    topic with the lowest initial level of awareness in the sample, and thus the topic
                    for which the largest potential gains from financial education could be accrued.
                    Within the BSSP sample, there is also an effect on the awareness of savings
                    accounts, while WDB groups increased their awareness of purchasing on credit.
                           Within this sample there is also a negative effect on the awareness of sepa-
                    rating business and household accounts.
                           Results are more mixed for financial attitudes and perceptions. The BSSP
                    sample seems to have considerably improved its attitudes and perceptions
                    vis-à-vis financial institutions and products, feeling less nervous going into a
                    bank, attaching more importance to understanding the contractual terms of hire
                    purchase agreements before undertaking them, and appreciating the benefit of
                    lowering interest payments through saving (table 15.2). However, BSSP members
                    seem to display a lower recognition of the importance of saving early to ensure
                    their children’s education.
                           In contrast, WDB group members display a slight decline in financial atti-
                    tudes. They seem doubtful that they can improve their finances and seem to fail
                    to appreciate the cost of borrowing versus saving. Results reported in table 15A.5
                    show that these differences between the BSSP and WDB groups are not driven
                    by education levels.

15.3.2	 The effect of financial education on behavior
Financial education seems to have significant effects on savings. It significantly
raises self-reported saving, both in terms of the number of people who report
saving and in terms of the average amount of savings, as shown in table  15.3.
Within the treatment group, not only do more BSSP and WDB respondents report
saving money in any way, but both the average monthly savings and the expected
future monthly savings increase. BSSP members are less likely to withdraw money
as soon as it is deposited; the opposite is true for WDB individuals.
     Our analysis in table 15.4 also shows an overall decrease in the average
number of individuals who applied for a loan in the last six months. Within the
BSSP sample, there is also evidence of a decrease in the use of hire purchase
agreements as a source of consumer credit. This result does not hold for WDB
groups, which instead seem to rely more heavily on hire purchase agreements.
Again, this divergence in results does not seem to be driven by education level
(see table 15A.7).

                           Financial education seems to play a role in reducing gambling and decreasing
                   risk aversion (table  15.5). The treatment effects vary significantly between the
                   two groups: in the WDB sample, there is a slight decrease in gambling and an
                   increase in the self-reported preference for saving versus gambling; these vari-
                   ables have a virtually null treatment effect in the BSSP sample. Within the BSSP
                   sample, there is instead a decrease in risk aversion.
                           Lastly, financial education does not seem to have an effect on financial plan-
                   ning in the full sample (table 15.6). There is, however, a negative effect on retire-
                   ment plans within the WDB sample.

                   Financial education does not seem to have an effect on the well-being of the
                   entire sample (table 15.7). Individuals in the BSSP sample report feeling less over-
                   whelmed, while results are mixed within WDB groups. WDB individuals feel some-
                   what more confident and less stressed, but also more overwhelmed.
                           These effects are null if the sample is disaggregated along educational lines
                   (table 15A.10).

either mathematical skills or problem solving.

      have enough savings and will need to take out a loan.
      Nsako has two options: (1) he can buy the TV on hire
      purchase and buy a big TV, or (2) he can take a loan
      only from a relative and buy a smaller TV. What would
      you advise Nsako and his wife?
E24   Buying a TV or other appliance that will last a long time   -1 agree
      from a shop and paying on instalments is a cheaper way      -2 disagree

      hire purchase from the other shop means that she will
      have to pay back less each month but over 36 months
      instead of 12. Ntombi decides to go with the option of
      paying less each month but over 36 months. Do you

F       inancial management and

Impact and network effects in
informal industrial clusters

MATTEA STEIN, AND BILAL ZIA




T   he Russia Financial Literacy and Education Trust Fund grant has
    cofinanced the ongoing impact evaluation of a comprehensive finan-
cial management and vocational training program for small-scale industries
in Uganda. With the contribution of this grant, we are also identifying the
effects of the intervention on entrepreneurs’ business networks.
    The grant was a contributor for the first two post-intervention surveys on
both firms participating in the training and the control group. We also inter-
viewed business owners of firms that interact with our sample (treatment
and control) to share information on new products, new designs, training
programs, credit opportunities, etc.
    This chapter summarizes the work up to now—one baseline survey
including enterprise, business owner households, and employee surveys;
technical and financial management training interventions; and two follow-up
surveys on both businesses that are part of the study and their contact
networks. The impact evaluation will comprise an endline, replicating inter-
views from the baseline. The analysis from the first of these follow-ups is also
documented in this chapter but is still very preliminary.

Identifying the determinants of entrepreneurship is an important research

              and supporting infrastructure often imposes stringent constraints on business
              growth. While much of the literature has focused on access to physical capital
              and external finance (e.g., Banerjee et al. 2010; de Mel, McKenzie, and Wood-
              ruff 2008), a number of recent papers argue that “managerial capital” or busi-
              ness skills are another important driver of firm growth and a key determinant of
              productivity (e.g., Bloom et al. 2010; Bruhn, Karlan, and Schoar 2010).
                  This interest has spawned a limited number of experimental evaluations of
              business training programs across different settings. For example, Karlan and
              Valdivia (2010) evaluate a business education program for female microentrepre-
              neurs in Peru and find that it improves recordkeeping, though not profits. In the
              Dominican Republic, Drexler, Fischer, and Schoar (2011) show that a basic rules-
              of-thumb-based training, but not formal business training, leads to improvements
              in business outcomes. Finally, Bruhn and Zia (2011) focus on medium-scale enter-
              prises in Bosnia-Herzegovina and find that formal business and financial training
              improves business practices and investments, although not business survival.
              These and other studies are summarized in McKenzie and Woodruff (2012).
                  But businesses do not operate in a vacuum. They interact with neighboring
              businesses, with close associates operating in other areas, and with businesses
              above and below in the supply chain. Importantly, many businesses are part of
              larger networks, some of which make joint production and sales decisions, and
              share costs, revenues, and working capital. While the above-mentioned impact
              studies identify positive effects of business education on targeted business
              segments, an outstanding research question is how, if at all, such enhanced knowl-
              edge spreads to other businesses and across business networks. Also, are the
              diffusion paths of observable and unobservable skills different? This latter ques-
              tion can help us understand the nature of market and network interactions—e.g.,
              are neighboring businesses considered competitors or partners? Are network
              members more likely to benefit from enhanced skills than others? These insights
              can help us better design and/or adjust training programs for target populations.
                  Further, these questions have substantial policy relevance, as any identified
              positive externalities could justify scaling down spending on financial literacy
              programs while still being able to reap many, if not all, of the benefits. For example,
              if we find network effects are significant, then policy can be designed to provide
              financial literacy for businesses to only a subset of those targeted, which can then
              spread the knowledge to others. The resources saved in doing so could be spent
              on expanding business training in other areas or on other development projects.
                  On the direct impact of training, we are primarily interested in the following
              questions:

                1.	 Does the training increase profitability and growth of enterprises? Specif-
                    ically, does it reduce costs and wastage of raw material? Does it improve
                    sales and revenues, profits, worker efficiency, quality of products, and
                    employment for workshops that benefit from the training?
                         16.  Financial management and vocational training in Uganda  ◾ 497




 2.	 Does the training lead to better quality jobs and higher earnings for workers
     and workshop owners; and further, does it improve their access to credit,
     diversification of earnings, and job security?
 3.	 Do the benefits of training translate into higher standards of living for
     beneficiaries and their households? For example, does the training and
     accompanying increase in income lead to improvements in dietary diver-
     sity, children’s health and education, asset accumulation, investments, and
     possibly a reduction in domestic violence?
 4.	 How do the above impacts vary by gender and age?
 5.	 Are there heterogeneous effects of the intervention across other aspects,
     particularly by the size of the enterprise (self-employed versus firms with
     employees; micro versus small) or the sector of activity (industrial versus
     services)?

    On network effects, our research questions are the following:

 6.	 How are informational networks between small and medium enterprises
     formed? Is there assortative matching on enterprise characteristics (such
     as sector, size, location, years in business) and business owner character-
     istics (such as gender, education, experience, family ties)? What are the
     observable differences between network and non-network small and
     medium enterprises, or between those in large versus small networks?
  7.	 Are business and technical skills diffused through business networks, and if
     so, through what mechanisms (e.g., direct observation, secondary training,
     temporary or permanent worker exchange, etc.) and across what lines
     (neighbor to neighbor, exclusive to network members, etc.)? Since tech-
     nical training is highly observable while managerial training is not, does the
     observability of skills matter in how (and to whom) knowledge is diffused?

    Questions 1–5 are being addressed through a comparison of baseline and
follow-up outcomes between treatment and control groups. Question 6 is
addressed through the baseline survey, where in addition to recording baseline
outcomes for each firm, we recorded the names and contact details of the closest
self-identified business associates. The baseline asked a series of questions on
how information, knowledge, working capital (such as labor), and sales orders are
shared with these businesses. This enabled us to map out the network tree of
each entrepreneur in our sample.
    Finally, we addressed Question 7 through follow-up surveys not only on
the sample of businesses in our study (both treatment and control), but also
on network members identified in the baseline. We are then able to compare
outcomes between these groups to identify the extent and magnitude of any
network effects.

              16.2	      PROGRAM AND INTERVENTION DETAILS
              Our main implementation partner is the Katwe Small Scale Industries Association
              (KASSIDA), an association comprising members from nine diverse and informal
              industrial clusters—from metal fabricators, carpenters, machinery workers to
              barbershop owners, tailors, and caterers. KASSIDA member workshops operate
              in the outskirts of Kampala, and are bunched together in physical clusters. Such
              industrial clusters are quite common in developing countries, and previous
              research has documented the benefits of localization economies such as favor-
              able access to market information, low transaction costs, ease of monitoring, and
              division and sharing of capital and labor (Nadvi and Schmitz 1994; Ruan and Zhang
              2009; Sonobe and Otsuka 2006).
                  In the Ugandan context, such small-scale operators constitute 13 percent of
              the share of employment and absorb 30 percent of new labor market entrants.
              Recent estimates suggest that nearly 40 percent of Ugandan households own and
              operate a nonfarm household enterprise, and the sector has grown at an average
              annual rate of 8 percent over the last 10 years. Women are active participants,
              with almost 46 percent of enterprises managed by women.
                  Despite the fast growth, most employees and entrepreneurs operating in
              these sectors do not have formal technical or financial management training;
              instead, they rely on old and sometimes obsolete production methods and rarely
              maintain financial or transactional records. As a result, productivity is low, enter-
              prise management is weak, and the risk of failure remains fairly high.
                  Through the support of the World Bank and the Second Private Sector
              Competitiveness Program, KASSIDA recently launched a Workers Apprenticeship
              and Training Skills Program, with the goal of improving skills, enhancing capacity,
              and boosting output among workshop owners and workers who operate in the
              Katwe area. KASSIDA is also introducing a comprehensive financial literacy and
              managerial training program for its members and plans to implement both tech-
              nical and financial skills training together.
                  Our study is evaluating the second wave of training, which was conducted in
              the first half of 2012, and targeted both workshop owners and their employees.
              In all, 384 workshop owners and approximately 1,026 workers were offered
                          16.  Financial management and vocational training in Uganda  ◾ 499




training in this wave. The financial management component of KASSIDA’s training
was administered to workshop owners only. Business owners participated in
12  working sessions for a period of three months. The management training
focused on four main areas: (1) marketing of products or services, (2) finance and
bookkeeping, (3) customer service, and (4) taxes and regulations. The curriculum
included the following key components:

    ◾◾ Defining working capital
    ◾◾ Defining fixed versus variable assets
    ◾◾ Importance of keeping financial records
    ◾◾ External finance options
    ◾◾ Business investment
    ◾◾ Steps for participating in public procurement as a supplier of products
    ◾◾ Cluster-specific marketing
    ◾◾ Process of registering an enterprise in Uganda as a private limited company

    Both workshop owners and workers in the treatment group were invited to
participate in the technical training. This training was sector specific and often
located in model workshops where participants practice more efficient produc-
tion techniques.
    The objective of the training is to improve firms’ productivity by intro-
ducing new methods and products with increased value added to customers
and expanding efficiency in resource management. The financial management
and technical trainings seek to address market failures such as (1) the lack of
availability of profitable training opportunities, (2) the difficulty on the part of
firm owners in valuing the benefits of investment opportunities before actually
pursuing them, and (3) credit constraints that prevent firms from pursuing training
opportunities. These lead to firms operating under insufficient quality standards
and lacking managerial skills to grow their enterprises.



16.3	     EVALUATION METHODOLOGY
The core methodology is a randomized evaluation of the KASSIDA training
program. Among the 735 workshops that have applied to participate in the
second wave of training, we randomly assigned firms to treatment and control
groups.


16.3.1	 Clustering of firms by sector and location
When randomly assigning workshops to participate in the training exercises, we
needed to take into consideration the fact that firms in Katwe often operate side
by side, sometimes not even separated by physical walls. For instance, in the
catering sector, women who own separate firms produce and sell meals every
day in the food market sitting very close to each other. In the carpentry industry,
500  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              namely in handicrafts, self-employed individuals working in single-table work-
              shops are frequently located in premises where they share a common roof.
                  Therefore, it is not possible to randomize at the workshop level, since spill-
              overs are inevitable. Although one of our evaluation goals is to measure spillovers
              through network effects, we have to maintain our ability to statistically detect
              primary effects of the trainings. Our evaluation design balances both of these
              goals.
                  To avoid spillovers through direct observation of neighbors—which would
              in effect reduce the possibility of estimating the real impacts of the training
              program—we initially grouped workshops into clusters based on the location and
              sector where firms operate. Firms in the same sector located within a radius of
              each other are thus part of the same cluster. Each cluster was pair-matched with
              a similar one on observable characteristics including size of the cluster and socio-
              economic features of the firm and business owner. Pairs of clusters of firms were
              then randomly allocated to either the treatment or control group, ensuring that all
              firms have the same 50 percent chance of being part of the program.
                  To group the firms into clusters, we conducted a listing exercise of all
              workshops that applied to the program and recorded their global positioning
              system (GPS) coordinates. We mapped the location of the workshops which,
              along with their industry, allowed us to lump together firms into clusters. We
              have created clusters by adding all firms in the same sector, until there is no firm
              that is 20 meters or less away from one of the cluster members. This 20-meter
              distance—our cut-off—is seen by the local KASSIDA team as sufficient to avoid
              direct copying of techniques between businesses (as well as being a politically
              acceptable distance at which to randomize access to training).
                  With this design, where randomization is done at a cluster level rather than
              at the individual firm level, we hope to mostly eliminate the direct copying of new
              techniques learned in training—the first source of potential spillover effects—
              because those operating side by side are either all receiving training or are part
              of our control group.


              16.3.2	 Spillover effects
              We aim to assess the size of the spillover effects that may still be prevalent by
              mapping the full spectrum of interrelations between workshops that are part of
              our study (both within and across treatment and control groups) and also with
              those outside our sample. We analyze the existing networks on (1) information
              sharing about designs, techniques, skills, and tools; (2) sharing of employees;
              (3)  sharing of inputs/materials; (4) sharing of contacts and orders to suppliers;
              (5) sharing of contacts and orders by customers; and (6) partnership and sharing
              of information on usage of financial services. To assess the spillover effects, we
              are tracking through surveys the main enterprise outcomes of interest for up
              to five network contacts for both treatment and control groups and comparing
                          16.  Financial management and vocational training in Uganda  ◾ 501




the change in performance for the contacts of each group that are outside our
sample. Any difference in the outcomes of interest between these two parallel
groups of firms can be attributed to spillovers from the training program as a
result of the selection design.
    The data for the impact evaluation is obtained from a baseline and multiple
follow-up surveys for the treatment and control groups. The baseline and follow-up
surveys collect data for all workshop owners (735) and workers (1,965), as well as
for network members identified by each workshop owner.


16.3.3	Data
We are conducting multiple rounds of follow-up surveys—a full survey similar to
the baseline on enterprises, employees, and business owners’ households will be
conducted 15 months after the end of training; and a set of enterprise/business
owner mini-surveys were completed three to six and nine months after the end
of the training. The short surveys (30 minutes long) have two objectives: (1) to
improve the statistical power of the analysis on the main outcomes of interest
including sales, profits, product range, number of employees, and household
assets/consumption; and (2) to track the change in behavior on intermediate
outcomes—e.g., bookkeeping, safety measures, business/technical knowledge—
with the objective of ascertaining the erosion of learning over time.
    We have currently completely two rounds of follow-up surveys with both the
enterprise owners and their networks of businesses and are preparing the final
round.


16.3.4	 Outputs and dissemination
The main outputs of this impact evaluation are baseline and follow-up data, policy
notes, and research papers. After the baseline, we examined the labor practices
and business networks that prevail in the region. After the follow-up surveys, we
will prepare a pair of research paper and policy notes to present the results of
the impact evaluation. In addition to extensive discussions within KASSIDA, these
outputs will be presented to policy makers in Uganda, as well as other countries
worldwide.



16.4	RESULTS
We have analyzed thus far the results of the first follow-up for the core members
of the study. Any of the following findings are very preliminary and are solely
representative of the initial short-term effects.
    We find some short-term effects of the training on the core sample of
members on financial literacy and technical knowledge, optimism, and adherence
to standards and procedures, but limited short-term effects on core business
502  ◾  ENHANCING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND BEHAVIOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES




              outcomes. Subgroup analysis on the dimension/size of the business, gender of
              the owner, and baseline financial literacy provide some additional insights.
                  Trained entrepreneurs are significantly more likely to think that their business
              will be growing in the next few months, which is driven by smaller enterprises
              (those with below-median baseline profits). There is also initial evidence that this
              may be linked to those with below-median baseline financial literacy scores.
                  There are several positive effects of training on adherence to standards
              and procedures: trained entrepreneurs are more likely to say they have a valid
              quality standard certificate, and to be able to show it, and are more likely to have
              a written safety code of conduct. Training also seems to have a positive effect
              on having written a business plan in the past six months, but not on providing
              receipts to customers. There is some evidence that there may be an effect on
              providing receipts for female-operated firms and large firms.
                  In terms of business outcomes, there is some evidence that trained entre-
              preneurs may be consolidating their activities—they have opened fewer busi-
              nesses in the past six months and own fewer businesses in total. They are more
              likely to have cut costs in that period, but also less likely to have developed new
              products. There is no overall effect on the number of workers, which is driven by
              differential effects by gender: men in the treatment group are more likely to have
              any employees than are control group men, while women in the treatment group
              are less likely to have any employees than control group women. We do not see
              a statistically significant positive short-term effect on revenues and profits, even
              though the coefficient on past month profit is relatively large.
                  As said, these short-term results are based on the first follow-up survey of
              the core sample of members of the small industry association. Further results
              will become available once the second follow-up survey—already completed—is
              analyzed.
                  The network dimension of the project, including the survey of network
              members of the core sample, will be analyzed next, to determine which effects
              spread through the core sample’s business networks.
                  This impact evaluation led to a spin-off study of a particular group of women
              who operate in male-dominated sectors (which were identified at baseline in the
              KASSIDA sample). Gaps in profitability between male- and female-owned enter-
              prises are widely documented, and research points to the role of sector choice
              as a determinant of those differences, finding that women entrepreneurs tend to
              cluster in low value-added industries with less growth potential. This potentially
              constrains the effects of interventions such as financial literacy programs that
              have shown to have mixed results for this type of firms. We hence conducted
              additional qualitative and quantitative data collection to interview 183 women,
              part of them from the initial KASSIDA data. We find that women working in
              male-dominated sectors earn nearly double those working in traditional indus-
              tries, and also work fewer hours per week. At the same time, large informational
              gaps exist among women operating in traditional industries about the returns
                             16.  Financial management and vocational training in Uganda  ◾ 503




available in male-dominated sectors. Linking quantitative analysis with qualitative
insights from focus groups, we conclude that both normative and informational
factors are predictive of a woman’s decision to “cross over” to a male-dominated
sector. We advocate that informational campaigns combined with mentorship
interventions may facilitate the growth of female entrepreneurship in nontradi-
tional industries. Coupling these interventions with financial literacy programs for
instance can potentially have more sustainable effects in driving female entrepre-
neurship growth.
