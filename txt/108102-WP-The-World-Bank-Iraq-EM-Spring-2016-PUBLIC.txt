                                                    Box 1. Global oil prices continued to fall sharply


   Global crude oil prices fell by 47 percent from US$96.2 per barrel in 2014 to US$50.8 per barrel in 2015, the lowest
   annual level since 2004. From November 2015, oil prices declined steadily, slipping below US$30 per barrel in mid-
   January in a slide that may not reflect fundamentals. Weak oil prices mirrored continued ample supply from non-
   OPEC producers, expectations of an expansion of Iranian exports in light of earlier-than-expected lifting of sanctions,
   OPEC’s continued resolve to defend market share, high stocks due to mild weather conditions in the northern
   hemisphere, and weakening growth prospects in major oil-importing economies.
   Oil production in non-OPEC countries recorded gains, averaging nearly 2 million bpd over 10 consecutive quarters
   until the third quarter of 2015. More than two-thirds of production gains came from the United States. Despite sharp
   cuts in investment, U.S. production has remained more resilient than projected, thanks to efficiency gains and cost
   cuts. OPEC (excluding new member Indonesia) crude oil production averaged 31.6 million bpd, up from 30.5 million
   bpd a year earlier. Most of the gains came from Iraq and Saudi Arabia. Iraq’s output reached a record 4.3 million
   bpd in September, but the country is not expected to exceed this level in 2016 under the strain of low oil prices and
   a costly conflict against ISIS. At the OPEC meeting on December 2015, the Organization decided to keep producing
   at current levels, with key exporter, Saudi Arabia, intent on maintaining market share. The group abandoned its 30
   million bpd production target, which had been in place since the beginning of 2012. Adding to the uncertainty were
   expectations that Iran would increase exports earlier-than-expected.
   Global oil consumption has faced two offsetting pressures: weakening real income growth and sharply lower prices.
   While weakening growth, especially in emerging countries, has weighed on consumption, the sheer magnitude of the
   oil price decline, two-thirds of which was attributable to production increase, has spurred consumption. On balance,
   consumption growth reached a five-year high at 1.8 percent in 2015, despite some weakening in the fourth quarter
   to 1.1 percent as a result of lower heating oil consumption amidst mild winter weather in the northern hemisphere.
   While gasoline demand remained robust, weak diesel demand reflected economic rebalancing in China and tepid
   global industrial activity.

          Box 2. Regional conflict and economic and social disruptions exacerbated the structural vulnerabilities


 The structural vulnerabilities that were evident prior to the crisis have been exacerbated by the ongoing violence and
 economic and social disruptions. Microsimulation estimates suggest a reversal of the hard-won welfare gains of the
 past, with poverty rising from 19.8 percent in 2012 to 22.5 percent in 2014. Poverty was accompanied by a massive
 human capital deficit—in health, education and access to basic services. Many Iraqis live close to the poverty line,
 vulnerable to increases in the price and availability of necessities, and/or the loss of assets and livelihoods. According
 to the World Bank projections, the recent shocks have increased the number of people living below the poverty
 line by an estimated 2.8 million by end-2014. IDPs make up half a million of Iraq’s poor in 2014, with an estimated
 poverty rate of 40 percent, almost twice the average. The Kurdistan Region experienced a quadrupling of poverty
 rates to 12.5 percent, due to the large influx of IDPs and Syrian refugees and the increased competition for jobs,
 goods and services. In the ISIS-affected governorates, the direct impact of economic, social and security disruptions
 is estimated to have doubled poverty rates to 41.2 percent.
 The increasing trend in poverty is expected to continue during the regional crisis. The ensuing population displacement,
 and the postponement of spending on socio-economic infrastructure, will further hinder the government’s ability to
 deliver services. The population remains extremely vulnerable to the ongoing security problems, the continued lack
 of basic services, scarcity in access to food and basic necessities and increases in their prices. Available data and
 analysis suggest a weak relationship between economic growth and welfare. The resumption of growth alone will not
 suffice to restore welfare and livelihoods. Estimates covering the crisis period suggest that welfare is getting eroded a
 lot faster than it was built up, and that many of the new poor have fallen from closer to the high end to the middle of
 the distribution. This vulnerability to poverty and shocks will remain an enduring challenge during the crisis period.
 Large existing human capital deficit and lack of access to infrastructure and services further limit coping strategies
 and resilience to these shocks.
 In the short term, the dominant effect of the renewed insurgency on poverty is not through slower growth, but
 displacement. IDPs will have lost access to whatever employment they had, along with their access to PDS rations,
 as well as the basic social services needed to maintain their quality of life. Insecurity will further deter the creation of
 formal private sector jobs, which would have provided an alternative path out of poverty. Preliminary projections of
 poverty for 2014 and 2015 only take into account the slowdown in GDP per capita growth and suggest an increase in
 poverty by 5 to 6 percentage points. While this does not take into account internal displacement, insecurity and loss
 of livelihoods, it provides a rough lower bound—one that already eliminates the small gains of the past.

     The Iraq’s current security and fiscal situation has affected the Government’s capability to provide basic services, and
     spending priorities. The scale and speed of the displacement crisis created a major challenge for both the Baghdad
     and Erbil governments. Many Iraqi IDPs and Syrian refugees reside in the same host communities, placing strains
     on the local economy and access to public services. Shelter and food security are of particular concern. Other issues
     relate to access to clean water, power cuts, and a severe shortage of fuel. Electricity demand has sharply increased in
     host communities. Significant upgrades to the electricity sector would be needed to supply additional power.
     Iraq’s economy was already seeing supply side strains in public service delivery prior to the crisis. Fragile network
     infrastructure and electricity shortages in Iraq are binding constraints on the quality of life and private sector
     development. The security situation made it difficult for the Government to focus on reconstruction, especially for
     the water and electricity network infrastructure. Lack of sanitation and inadequate electricity are the most prevalent
     deprivations in Iraq. A recent World Bank poverty assessment shows that almost all households are connected to
     the public electricity grid, but that connection is no guarantee of electricity supply (World Bank, 2014). In fact, on
     average, electricity supply is rarely higher than 12 hours per day. Baghdad is by far the worst hit in terms of electricity,
     with more than three-quarters of all households in the capital receiving less than 8 hours of electricity a day. Garbage
     collection and the availability of sewage services have increased over time, but are still very limited overall, reaching
     less than 50 percent of the population. In particular, rural areas seem to have almost no garbage collection and
     sewage services, and the North, Center and the South are also underserved. Similar to the other services, the quality
     of sanitation does not appear to be satisfactory. Access to water continues to be significantly lower in rural areas:
     while access is above 90 percent in urban areas, it falls to 63 percent in rural areas.

      The effectiveness of monetary policy in Iraq continues to be hampered by the weakness of the monetary transmission
      channels due to an inefficient banking sector. The challenging fiscal situation has resulted in an increase in directed
      lending that the leading state-owned banks (Rasheed and Al-Rafidain) have provided to state-owned enterprises,
      mostly to cover current operating costs (e.g., wages), as well as the Government deficit. Banking supervision remains
      weak, including regulatory forbearance with Rasheed and Al-Rafidain.
      Amid a weak banking sector, the Central Bank of Iraq is pressing ahead with reforms and is tightening supervision.
      The CBI has gained some momentum to clean-up of the balance sheets of these banks from pre-2003 assets and
      large valuation losses. The Iraqi authorities are taking steps to open government business to private banks. The
      CBI is strengthening banking supervision and is pushing ahead with financial sector reforms through the planned
      introduction of a deposit insurance scheme, a credit information bureau, and with the restructuring of Rasheed and
      Al-Rafidain. The authorities are also promoting growth and lower distortions in the banking sector by improving
      the playing field between public and private banks. The rise in insecurity, however, may deter foreign banks from
      entering Iraq or prompt those already there to leave, thus slowing the development of the sector.

                                Box 5. Global oil prices are projected to gradually recover


 For 2016, crude oil prices are projected to average US$37 per barrel, a 27 percent decline from the 2015 average. Oil
 prices is expected to gradually recover from their current lows over the course of the year, resulting from a number
 of factors. First, part of the sharp oil price drop in early 2016, which does not reflect fundamentals of oil demand and
 supply, is likely to reverse. Second, high-cost oil producers are expected to sustain persistent losses and increasingly
 implement production cuts that are likely to exceed any additional capacity coming to the market. Third, demand is
 expected to strengthen somewhat, along with a modest pickup in global growth.
 The magnitude of expected recovery in oil prices would be smaller than the rebounds that followed sharp drops
 in 2008, 1998, and 1986. In these declines, prices rebounded from their troughs by around 50 percent within a
 six months, and approximately doubled after twelve months. In 1998 and 2008, significant OPEC production cuts
 contributed to the price recovery, while in 1986 OPEC sought to regain its market share, somewhat similar to its
 current intent on defending its share. The currently expected price recovery over the course of 2016 is less than that
 in the previous episodes owing to large stocks and prospects for continued ample supplies (including from OPEC)
 and anemic demand.
 On balance, the price outlook remains subject to considerable downside risks. These include a larger-than-expected
 increase in Iran’s exports and a possible recovery of exports from Libya. Short-cycle U.S. shale production may again
 turn out to be more resilient than currently anticipated if companies achieve further productivity gains. Ample supply

 to fall further to reduce production and investment, especially for short-cycle U.S. shale production.

                   Box 6. Global and regional economies are expected to pick up but at a slower pace


 2016 global growth is expected to pick up, though at a slower pace than previously projected, reaching 2.9 percent in
 2016 and 3.1 percent in 2017-18. A modest upturn in global activity in 2016 and beyond is predicated on a continued
 recovery in major high-income countries, a gradual slowdown and rebalancing in China, a stabilization of commodity
 prices, and an increase in global interest rates that is gradual and stays well contained.
 Growth forecast for high-income countries is projected to show some improvement in 2016 in light of gradual
 tightening cycle of the U.S. Federal Reserve, and continued accommodative policy stance in the euro area and Japan.
 Conditions for a continued but fragile upturn in the euro area still appear in place, despite soft external demand
 and rising geopolitical concerns. Though gradually dissipating, legacies from the global financial crisis continue to
 be felt across high-income countries, limiting both aggregate demand and the underlying growth potential of these
 economies.
 The modest pickup in growth in developing countries is expected in 2016 and 2017, thanks to continued growth
 momentum in high-income countries, stabilization of commodity prices, still-accommodative monetary policy
 in major economies, and a steady process of rebalancing in China. With stabilizing commodity prices, growth
 in commodity exporters is expected to resume. Among low-income countries, growth is mostly steady or rising.
 However, forecasts for 2016 have been downgraded for some countries from previous projections, reflecting lower
 commodity prices and rising security and political tensions in some countries. Also, developing countries will likely
 face rising borrowing costs. In particular, countries with large borrowing needs and high levels of dollar-denominated
 debt could be adversely impacted by rising U.S. interest rates.
 A combination of low oil prices, currently estimated at US$37 per barrel in 2016, several major conflicts and subdued
 global economic recovery is expected to keep economic growth in the MENA region low at 3 percent in 2016. Since
 2013, MENA has not been able to escape the spiral of slow growth for a variety of reasons including the incidence
 of war and conflict. These factors are expected to dampen the short-term economic prospects in the region, unless
 there is some progress in the peace talks. If the recent truce in Syria and the ongoing peace talks in Yemen and Libya
 materialize, which in turn reduces the spread of insecurity and conflict elsewhere in the region, economic growth in
 MENA could improve over the medium term. But the base case estimate is that real GDP in the MENA region will
 grow close to 4 percent in 2017 and 2018, still low by historical standards.

in 2012, of the 2,667 orders of arrest which were

corruption in Iraq is driven by weak institutions, a
lack of experienced staff, confusing legal framework
and weak oversight, which provide incentives and
opportunities for corruption. The existing anti-
corruption framework is ineffective. In August 2015,
Prime Minister al-Abadi announced actions to fight
corruption and money-laundering including plans
for institutional and administration reform, and the
adoption of ‘E-Government’ to reduce corruption
risk. Implementation of the reforms has suffered
a setback due to constitutional constraints and
systemic resistance to changes. By end-2015, the
Government closed six ministries, consolidated
others and cut more than 300 senior officials. Social
tensions are growing among both those negatively
affected by the reforms and those frustrated against
delayed implementation of the reforms.

                                     Box 7. Iraq’s Doing Business reform highlights



 From 2014 to 2015 Iraq retreated from 146 to 156 in ease of doing business according to the World Bank Doing
 Business Report. That put the country near the very bottom of the Middle East and North Africa. The nations that did
 the best were the United Arab Emirates at 22 out of 189 countries, followed by Saudi Arabia at 49, and Qatar at 50.
 The remainders were in the bottom half and included Iraq at 156, Syria at 175, and Libya at 188. Iraq has regularly
 been at the wrong end of that spectrum due to its lack of reforms to promote business post 2003. The topics that Iraq
 did the best back then were construction permits and paying taxes. Getting construction permits took eight steps,
 and approximately 119 days which put it in the top of the ranked economies at 9 out of 189 in this topic. In the region
 only the United Arab Emirates at 4 did better, with Saudi Arabia at 21, and Oman at 49. Paying taxes Iraq ranked 52
 which put it in middle of the region with the UAE, 1, Saudi Arabia, 3, Oman, 10, and Jordan, 45, doing better, while
 Iran, 124, and Egypt, 149 did worse. 
 The 2016 Doing Business report changed its methodology which makes it challenging to compare some date directly
 with previous years. However, the report ranked Iraq at 161 out of 189 countries. Iraq performs particularly well in
 one Doing Business indicator: ranking 59 out of 189 economies on the ease of Paying Taxes. In spite of sustained
 reform efforts over the past years,  in several of the other areas measured by Doing Business, Iraq compare less
 favorably including Enforcing Contracts (122nd), Resolving Insolvency (189th), Getting Credits (181st), Starting a
 Business (154th), Trading across Boarders (178th), dealing with construction permits (147th) and Protecting Minority
 Investors (115th ).
