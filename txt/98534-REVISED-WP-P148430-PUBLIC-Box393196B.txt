                             The Global Framework for Climate Services is a WMO-led initiative that started in 2009. Its objective is to “enable
                             better management of the risks of climate variability and change and adaptation to climate change, through the
                             development and incorporation of science-based climate information and prediction into planning, policy and
                             practice on the global, regional and national scale” (WMO 2009e).
                             GFCS work at present focuses on four sectors: agriculture and food security, water, health, and disaster risk
                             reduction. GFCS has four main pillars:
