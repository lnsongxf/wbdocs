THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

from 1 to 189 by the ease of doing business ranking.           Population: 123,799,215

frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where    DB2015 rank: 42*
0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in this year’s economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

      linear meter in the front of the building, plus a general fee for
      the official number at MXN 242.30. In this case, the front of the
      building is assumed to be 22.5 meters, so the total cost would be
      MXN 1,080.20 (= 37.24 x 22.5 m+242.30) .

      and documents and verifies the progress of the construction
      work under the terms stated in the Administrative Verification
      Rules (Reglamento de Verificación Administrativa) for the Federal
      District.

      The director responsible for the construction work undertakes to
      post a signboard showing the registration number in the
      construction work statement and the general construction work
      data, including the location and statement validity. The
      signboard must be posted in a visible place and legible from the
      public pathway.

      The validity of the statement (for construction work completion)
      is as follows:

      The cost breakdown for water and sewage:

      A) Services of Hydraulic Construction and Operation (Art. 181)
      • Water Connection: MXN 13,924.20 (DF Tax Code Article 181,
      Section A, fr. I, p. c)
      • Water measurer device: MXN 6,986.34 (DF Tax Code Article
      181, Section A, fr. III, p. c)
      • "Armado de Cuadro": MXN 1,461.50 (DF Tax Code Article 181,
      Section A, fr. IV, p. c)
      • Sewage Connection: MXN 9,428.22 (DF Tax Code, Article 181,
      Section B, fr. I, p. a) (Escogemos terreno tipo I y II)
      B) Authorization to use the Water and Sewage Network (Art. 182)
      • Technical assessment: MXN 39,908.58 (DF Tax Code, Article
      182, fr. I, p. 2)
      • Water pipes usage fee: MXN 1,211.85 (DF Tax Code, Article 182,
      fr. III)

      TOTAL = 72,920.69

      Thus, the total cost to Register Construction Statement Type B
      based on "Codigo Fiscal del Distrito Federal" amended in
      December 2014 is the following: MXN 715,628.39 + MXN
      72,920.69 = MXN 788,549.08

      The cost for the water connection includes the installation of the
      main pipeline, board, and meter. The cost to connect to water
      and sewage services are included in this procedure since the
      proof of payment of such fees are needed to request connection
      to these utility services (procedure 10). The cost is established by
      the Financial Code of the Federal District.

        * Update the building record at the Tax Ministry

        The time and cost of updating the building record are
        established by the Financial Code of the Federal District, Article
        217. The building is not actually registered with the Property
        Registry. Once built, a cadastral actualization document
        (manifestacion de actualisacion del valor cadastral) is filed for tax
        purposes with the Tax Ministry. The information in the new deed
        is updated only when the property (with the building included) is
  10    sold. In Mexico, the owner of the land is automatically the owner           1 day          no charge
        of the building unless otherwise specified. Only in cases where
        the owner of the building and the owner of the property are two
        different people would the building be registered.

        If the wiring is done within the provisions of the Mexican Standards,
        usually one inspection is sufficient to issue the approval (Dictamen de

        within the rules, then the Unidad Verificadora must make several visits to
        ensure that the wiring corresponds to the standards.

      The monitoring of the internal wiring installations is done by a

      which is responsible for checking that the wiring was done according to
      Mexican standards.

      The applicant must go to a Unidad de Verificación de Instalaciones
      Eléctricas (UVIE), accredited with the Entidad Mexicana de
      Acreditamiento (EMA) and registered with the Ministry of Energy
      (Secretaria de Energia). The firm will verify that the electrical installation 2 calendar days     MXN 25,000

      A certificate issued at the end of the inspection is needed by the time the
      supply contract is signed. This procedure may be performed
      simultaneously with other procedures. The costs associated with this
      procedure are determined by the Unidad Verificadora and the applicant.
      If the wiring is done within the provisions of the Mexican Standards,
      usually one inspection is sufficient to issue the approval (Dictamen de

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March (for 11 economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city). As noted, the
warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff schedules may apply if a time-of-
use tariff is available.

      may hire the appraiser they choose. When banks are involved in the              (simultaneous MXN 3,000 - MXN

      Sometimes parties have a previous valuation, and the notary can have it           1, 2, 3 & 4)
      reviewed to see if it suffices. However, these previous valuations are
      usually not fiscal ones and therefore another one has to be done to
      determine the value of the property for the ISAI tax, but also for the VAT
      tax to which commercial constructions are subject to when transferred
      (please note that the land is not taxable under VAT, just the commercial
      constructions).

DB year            Reform

                    Mexico strengthened its secured transactions system by
DB2012              implementing a centralized collateral registry with an electronic
                    database that is accessible online.
                    Mexico improved access to credit by amending its insolvency
                    proceedings law and establishing clear grounds for relief from a
DB2015              stay of enforcement actions by secured creditors during
                    reorganization procedures. This reform applies to both Mexico
                    City and Monterrey.
                    Mexico improved access to credit by implementing a decree
DB2016              allowing a general description of assets granted as collateral.
                    This reform applies to both Mexico City and Monterrey.

PAYING TAXES
Economies around the world have made paying taxes                 and exemptions. Many have lowered tax rates. Changes
faster, easier and less costly for businesses—such as by          have brought concrete results. Some economies
consolidating payments and filings of taxes, offering             simplifying tax payment and reducing rates have seen
electronic systems for filing and payment, establishing           tax revenue rise. What tax reforms has Doing Business
taxpayer service centers or allowing for more deductions          recorded in Mexico (table 8.1)?

                   Mexico increased taxes on companies by raising several tax
                   rates, including the corporate income tax and the rate on cash
DB2011             deposits. At the same time, the administrative burden was
                   reduced slightly with more options for online payment and
                   increased use of accounting software.
                   Mexico continued to ease the administrative burden of paying
                   taxes for firms by ending the requirement to file a yearly value
DB2012
                   added tax return and reduced filing requirements for other
                   taxes
                   Mexico made paying taxes easier for companies by abolishing
                   the business flat tax—though it also made paying taxes more
                   costly by allowing only a portion of salaries to be deductible.
DB2016
                   These changes apply to both Mexico City and Monterrey. In
                   addition, the payroll tax rate paid by employers was increased
                   for Mexico City.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

                                            The Law of the Commercial Insolvency Law (LCM) provides a unitary
                                            form of insolvency proceedings (concurso mercantil) which has two
                                            phases: Conciliation (reorganization) and Bankruptcy (Liquidation).

                                            its debts as they mature. One of the main advantages of this option is
                                            that once the “concurso mercantil” commences, all all enforcement
                                            actions against the debtor would be automatically suspended,

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in
figure 14.2 in the Doing Business 2016 report). And for
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 in the Doing Business 2016 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
