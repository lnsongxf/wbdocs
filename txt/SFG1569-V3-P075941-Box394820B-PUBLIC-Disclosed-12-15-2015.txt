Background to the RAP development;
Rusumo Falls Hydro power Project RAP and ESIA, were completed by Artelia in 2012 /13, and
worked with the data which had been gathered by SNC-Lavalin and Fichtner in 2010 /11. It is at
this time that the project design changed from intermediary development scheme to the Run of
River scheme. Individual household evaluation of affected assets, i.e. census was not done;
instead general estimation of cash compensation for all affected assets was undertaken.
Around the same time a number of development projects were ongoing within the same
project area such as the One Stop Border Post that included the bridge by JICA which caused
road diversion on Rwanda side that resulted into voluntary relocation of former project
affected people.

In regard to the changes in the numbers of PAPs mentioned above, PIU carried a compensation
monitoring survey to be able to determine the actual number of PAPs on ground. The survey
showed that 134 households and 5 commercial entities as opposed to 133 households and 0
commercial entities on Tanzania side. On Rwanda side the survey indicated 53 affected
households and 2 commercial entities as opposed to 90 households and 0 commercial entities.
Table 1 below shows the variations in both number of PAHs and the related compensation.

Total for stage one ( Construction impacts only)                                    3,111,301



Reasons for the differences between the RAP estimated and actual compensation figures:

1. The RAP compensation figures are general estimates for both Rwanda and Tanzania, In other
words the RAP does not give compensation estimation for PAHs for each country. It gives the
total compensation figure for all affected households in both Rwanda and Tanzania as
2,236,645 USD as indicated in the table above. The actual compensation figures based on the
actual census and assets’ evaluation for individual affected households as conducted by official
government property valuers using the market values, separately for Rwanda and Tanzania.

Further, the estimated compensation figures for the RAP took into account considered
compensation calculation for affected assets which had been done by SNC Lavalavin in 2009. In
addition there were preset prices for land as indicated in the Official Gazette n°19 of
10/05/2010 for Rwanda which were considered during RAP estimation of cash compensation
for affected assets. The preset prices for land were lower compared to the real market values as
given by the property valuers in 2014. See the table below as extracted from the 2010 gazette
for clarification.

The above Official Gazette n°19 of 10/05/2010 was a reference for land prices during the
estimation of compensation cost for land during RAP development. However at the time of
conducting evaluation of affected assets which was done in 2014, the resettlement policy for
Rwanda changed. There was a new gazette i.e. Official Gazette no Special of 16/06/2013 which
guides compensation. This 2013 gazette cancelled the preset prices for land and instead
required for consideration of the market value / prices. The table below indicates land prices
considered during evaluation exercise of affected assets in 2014 depending on the location of
the land as compared to the pre- set land prices in the 2010 gazette. The same costing was
considered for Tanzania and Rwanda. See table 3 below:

Conclusion:
1. There was a significant difference between the RAP estimation- 2009 and the actual
   compensation figures as a result of change in the policy and market prices -2014.
2. Changes in cost of living and changes in land prices within Rusumo village, between 2009
   and 2014 were also put into consideration.
3. Compensation for project affected households was undertaken in Rusumo village located
   on the border of Tanzania and Rwanda and therefore no differences in compensation were
   expected.
