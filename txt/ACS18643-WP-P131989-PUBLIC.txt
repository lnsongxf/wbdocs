Development Objective
The development objective of this TA is to improve decision making of the provincial government clients towards improved
access and quality of water supply, sanitation, and hygiene services for all, including the poor, by identifying, recognizing
and addressing service delivery bottlenecks and enable the poor to get improved and sustainable WASH services.

                                                              strategic recommendations of the SDA.

                                                              In both Punjab and Sindh there was a heightened emphasis on the
                                                              rural sanitation sector which the SDAs contributed to, given the
                                                              severe weaknesses highlighted in this sector in the SDAs.

                                                              In both Punjab and Sindh the â€ ˜ visualâ€ ™tools of the SDA

                                                           which had been dispersed, and bring a new awareness of the key

Client capacity increased             8-Effective          Based on the recommendations for Punjab, a new emphasis was
                                                           accorded to rural sanitation with a new program emerging using
                                                           CLTS based approaches to scale up sanitation.


                                                           In Sindh the SDA highlighted severe weaknesses in the rural
                                                           sanitation sector. This contributed to the development of new

                                                           The SDAs highlighted the shortcomings of existing approaches to
                                                           rural sanitation. This has contributed to the development of a new

                                                           sanitation efforts. This is embodied in both the Punjab programs

Risks to Achieve Objective

achieve the development objective within the        Moderate             1. Sector activities are spread across a broad range of
time period envisaged and how they can be                                agencies/departments. It will remain challenging to
mitigated. Does the team seek any specific                               garner consensus across this fragmented group of

Comments

The TA/ studies analyze sector bottlenecks in each sub-sector, and determine which specific weaknesses in the service
delivery pathway are hampering the translation of investments into outcomes.      They provide an overview of the range of
service delivery approaches taken by specific provinces/ regions and how these translate (or not) to sector outcomes.    A
key component is the dialogue with sector agencies and governments during this analysis, to ensure an understanding of
these issues, and how addressing these can result in more efficient and effective use of finances and sustainable services.
Ultimately, the SDAs contribute to the attainment of sector goals and MDGs/SDGs.

In the absence of any concrete sectoral analysis and estimation of financial needs to 'enable a well functioining sector',
SDAs serve as the principle tool for decision making within the government planning and design for water and sanitation
sector. Special task forces have been constituted in each provincial government to assess and implement the
recommendations of the report. The report has been highly beneficial to design Bank Operations such as Multi-Sectoral
Action for Nutrition - P158769 and also helps the government to design sectoral projects such as the PKR 400 million PATS
program addressing open defecation in Punjab. The data and analysis of the SDA have been instrumental to conduct the
WASH Poverty Diagnostic at provincial level (P150794) especially the institutional analysis and political economy analysis.

Lessons Learned/Next Steps
1. Major Findings and Lessons Learned

There were some important lessons which have emerged during the SDA processes. These lessons have informed each
subsequent SDA.
i)       It was challenging to induce interest in a study with no assurance of follow-on investments. It would be useful to
sequence the SDA as part of a dialogue or preparation for future investments.
ii)      Client ownership and lead of the SDA is critical; in Pakistan the role of the Steering Committee and on a day to day
basis, a technical â€ ˜ sub-committee â€ ™     ensured â€ ˜ buy inâ€ ™ to the findings. While consultants can lead technically,
several rounds of consultation and consistent engagement in developing technical findings and recommendations is key.
iii)     It is useful for a coordinating ministry to house the SDA exercise- in this case this was the Planning and
Development departments.
iv)      Where secondary data alone is being used governments were skeptical of the utility of the exercise in introducing
any new findings or thinking. It was difficult initially to get â€ ˜ buy-inâ€ ™ where no surveys or primary data collection was
being undertaken. However, the analytical tools used (scorecard and access and financial projections), presented
findings in a visual manner which encouraged sector dialogue and brought key constraining factors in the sector to the fore.
v)       In a data scarce environment, it may be useful to allow time and resources for some primary data collection as part
of the SDA exercise, particularly in relation to critical financial data.
vi)      It would be useful to broaden the stakeholders involved to engage with other sectors such as education, health,
agriculture and nutrition, as part of the exercise.
vii)     Agreement on mechanisms for follow up could usefully be built into the SDA process at an early stage.

2. Next Steps (Describe expected follow-up)

One of the key issues in relation to the SDAs is ensuring that these do not remain as static â€ ˜ one-offâ€ ™exercises, and
the findings and recommendations feed into future investments and sector reform. One way of ensuring this is, as
mentioned in the key lessons, sequencing these as part of an on-going sector dialogue, and using the findings as an
essential part of sector dialogue, not just by the Bank but by the range of donor agencies. This will require certain actions
both on the part of the Bank and the governments involved.
i.       As part of the dialogue during the SDA, there should be an emphasis on forming an institutional vehicle for
follow-up. This could comprise an official â€ ˜ committeeâ€ ™ which could take the lead in following up on
recommendations and engaging with donors. This was the case in the Punjab following the Punjab SDA, and there needs
to be on-going dialogue with the Government of Sindh, KP and FATA for similar mechanisms.
ii.       The findings and recommendations of the SDAs need to be more widely disseminated. While findings have been
shared with high level government officials as part of the Steering Committee overseeing the process, these need to be
more widely disseminated both within government and across the range of sector stakeholders.

                                                                                                                      Page 7 of 10
iii.   Sector donors need to be engaged with in discussing the findings of the SDA, so that these can inform future
investments. The findings should be discussed within the WB to allow future sector work to be informed by these, and to
make a case for new investments- a core need identified in the SDAs.
iv.    Updating the SDA, particularly in relation to the financial projections will be important on an annual or bi-annual
basis.
