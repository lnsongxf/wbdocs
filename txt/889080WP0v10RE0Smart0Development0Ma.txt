  Box 3.1: Sector Policy Case Study 1 Benefits: Shift to Clean Transport
  A transformation of the transport sector in the six focus regions, through more fuel-efficient internal-combustion vehicles, more widespread
  adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles, greater use of public transport and advanced biofuels, and a shift to more efficient freight, would
  generate substantial benefits (all values are annual results in 2030 for the six focus regions, unless noted), including:

  Local* Socioeconomic Benefits
  •	 Lives saved: roughly 20,000 premature mortalities from air pollution avoided per year, with a monetized value of about $87 billion.
  •	 Energy saved: about 4,700 TWh, roughly equivalent to 12.5 percent of projected energy consumption in the transport sector and 2.3
     percent of projected total global energy demand (cf. IEA WEO 2013).
  •	 Effect on global GDP**: increase of about 0.5–0.8 percent above the baseline, or $600 billion–$1 trillion, equivalent to $250–400/tCO2e,
     with uneven effects among countries.

  Global Public Goods
  •	   CO2e emissions reduction: roughly 2.4 Gt per year.
  •	   Average mitigation cost: –$169/tCO2e (MACC).
  •	   Estimated social value of CO2e reductions: $132 billion.
  •	   Additional lives saved: roughly 1,300 premature deaths from air pollution avoided per year outside the six focus regions, with a monetized
       value of about $6 billion.

     A more energy-efficient industrial sector would be a key step in the
     global effort to contain climate change. As shown in Figure 3.4,
     such a transition would also have significant global economic,                                Emerging economies could reap significant gains from lower energy

     1–1.2% above baseline levels in 2030, with uneven impacts across                              capital investments; by reducing their production costs more on

        Box 3.2: Sector Policy Case Study 2 Benefits: Energy Efficient Industry
        A transformation of the industrial sector, through policies that spur a shift to clean fuels and reduced energy consumption, would generate
        substantial societal benefits (all values are annual results in 2030 for the six focus regions, unless noted), including:

        Local* Socioeconomic Benefits
        •	 Lives saved: 52,000 avoided premature mortalities from air pollution, with a monetized value of $240 billion.
        •	 Crops saved: roughly 1.26 million metric tons, enough to feed 3.8 million people for one year and valued at $216 million.
        •	 Energy saved: more than 5,700 TWh in 2030, equivalent to more than 14 percent of projected energy consumption in the industrial sector
           and about 3 percent of projected total global energy demand (cf. IEA WEO 2012).
        •	 Effect on global GDP**: increase of about 1–1.2 percent above the baseline, or $1.2–$1.4 trillion, equivalent to $280-$336/tCO2e, with
           uneven effects among countries.

        Global Public Goods
        •	 CO2e emissions reduction: roughly 4.3 Gt per year.
        •	 Average mitigation cost: $7/tCO2e (MACC).
        •	 Estimated social value of CO2e reductions: $237 billion.
        •	 Additional lives saved: roughly 5,880 premature deaths from air pollution avoided per year outside the six focus regions, with a monetized
           value of about $28 billion.
        •	 Additional crops saved: roughly 460,000 metric tons per year outside the six focus regions, with a monetized value of about $79 million.

  Box B.1: Examples of Integrated Planning Approaches

  Europe: The Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution
  The innovative Regional Air Pollution Information and Simulation (RAINS) model was the predecessor to today’s Greenhouse Gas and Air
  Pollution Interactions and Synergies (GAINS) model. Maintained by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, RAINS informed
  national emission caps that employed cost-effectiveness as the rationale for differentiated obligations. The model had to quantify the costs
  of the entire range of emissions reduction possibilities and ensure that the desired environmental outcomes were achieved across an entire
  geographic area. By putting all measures into a broader context, RAINS helped decisionmakers identify strategies that maximize synergies
  between different measures, ensure attainment of all environmental goals, and minimize costs (Amann et al. 2011).

  United States: Multi-pollutant Planning under the Clean Air Act
  Implementation of air quality protection under the Clean Air Act is complicated by the act’s pollutant-by-pollutant approach; the many chal-
  lenges that followed spurred development of tools that attempt to deal with multiple air quality issues simultaneously.Integrated multi-pollutant
  planning has been shown to be a more economical way to address environmental and public health issues than traditional single-pollutant
  approaches (Weiss et al. 2007; NYSERDA 2012). By concurrently looking at multiple air quality goals and potential controls and their en-
  vironmental, public health, energy, and economic impacts, a more complex set of policy questions emerges that can then be addressed.
  Multi-pollutant approaches identify the tradeoffs of implementing one strategy over another, help set priorities and appropriate planning hori-
  zons, and identify the optimal mix of policies and controls that will result in greater synergistic benefits than discrete policies covering individual
  pollutants.

As in other sectors, the key transmission channels are the impact of
the change in capital expenditures and reduced energy consump-
tion. In the short run, capital expenditure is generally higher than
in the baseline; as a result, GDP is increased as a result of the rise
in expenditure. Over the long term (after the spending has taken
place), however, the positive boost fades as firms must increase
