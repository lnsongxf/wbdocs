land holdings in parcels of up to 0.07 hectares in the Capital City and along the main roads connecting the aimag centers with UB
(except soum centers), up to 0.35 hectares in the centers of aimags, and up to 0.5 hectares in the soums.

  Bold purchased a khashaa plot with a house on it from Nergui in 2004. The khashaa plot is located in Bayangol
  district in one of the prime ger area locations close to city center—the Zuragt area. After the purchase, Bold reg-
  istered the khashaa plot/land parcel with the District Land Office (now the District Property and Land Relations
  Department—DPLRD) and received a land possession right certificate. Bold then registered the house on the
  khashaa plot with the Administration of State Title Registration (now General Authority for State Registration—
  GASR) and received the immoveable property ownership title certificate. These processes were conducted and
  completed legally within existing procedures.

  Bold left Mongolia shortly afterward to work abroad for an extended period. He returned to Mongolia briefly in
  2014 and applied to the Property Relations Department (PRD) to transfer his land possession right into land own-
  ership right. Bold was thereby exercising his right to obtain a land parcel once and free of charge for ownership
  according to the Law on Land Allocation to Mongolian Citizens for Ownership. To his surprise, PRD informed
  him that his land parcel had been allocated to Nergui for land ownership in 2006. Nergui was able to transform
  his already transferred land possession right into land ownership right with assistance of the Bayangol District
  Land Office and Land Administration Department of UB City (now PRD). He was even able to register it with the
  Administration of State Title Registration and obtain the immovable property ownership title certificate for this
  land. Currently, there are two immovable property ownership title certificates for property on the parcel: one
  is for the house on the land parcel under Bold’s name and the other one is for the land on Nergui’s name. The
  value and desirability of both the building and the land are now greatly diminished because improving, selling,
  or transferring either would require the consent of each certificate holder.

   Box 2.2:	 Case Study: Improving Revenue Collection through Integrating Information Systems:
             The Case of Arusha, Tanzania

   Tanzanian cities rely heavily on own-source revenues collected through local taxes, including a property tax.
   However, the database held by valuation and tax collecting authorities is often separate from cadaster, engi-
   neering, or other departmental records. With assistance from the World Bank and DANIDA, the city of Arusha
   developed the Land Government Revenue Collection and Information System (LGRCIS) to centralize land and
   property records held by different city departments with the intent of improving revenue collection from four
   main revenue sources: property taxes, service fees, business licenses, and billboard permits. These sources com-
   bined constitute 64 percent of the city’s total revenue base.

   LGCRIS is composed of a comprehensive GIS database that links cadaster maps to valuation and tax collection
   records. It is possible to “map” the city according to areas or individual properties that have or have not paid tax-
   es. The Web-based format allows for the rapid generation of current reports on particular parcels. It also permits
   automatic updating of records based on new inputs, such as transfers of ownership through sales or inheritance,
   which reduces the incidence of filing errors from lost or mismatching paper records. The system not only allows
   the city to more efficiently locate and follow up with delinquent payers but also allows tax payers to file payments
   directly through commercial banks or mobile phones. Since the 2014 rollout, the total amount of property tax has
   increased by 327 percent, user fees 214 percent, business license fees 235 percent, and billboard permit revenue
   by 380 percent.

  Box 2.3:	 Case Study: Cadaster Database Tampering in UB

  Sukhbat obtained a land possession right certificate for 1,300 square meters (m2) of land in Songinokhairkhan dis-
  trict in 1997. The the land is desirable as it is located near urban infrastructure utilities and is included in the one
  of the ger area redevelopment sites. In 2003, he subdivided the land into two pieces of 700 m2 and 600 m2 each,
  transfered the 600 m2 piece to his brother Boldsukh, and retained the rest for himself. As required for subdividing land,
  in accordance with the law allowing ownership of up to 700 m2, Sukhbat hired a surveyor to complete the map as part
  of his application. Then Sukhbat obtained a land ownership decision from the UB City Governor. Yet, like many other
  land owners, he he did not apply to the General Authority for State Registration (GASR) to obtain the immovable
  property ownership title certificate for his land parcel, because his permanent residence is in another location.

  In 2014, Sukhbat learned from his brother Boldsukh that someone had removed the fences surrounding his land
  parcel. He went to Bayanzurkh District District Property and Land Relations Department (DPLRD) to report this
  and learn what may have happened. The DPLRD informed him that Sukhbat’s neighbor Itgel had obtained the
  land possession right certificate and then the land ownership decision of the UB City Governor. He then took the
  next step and received the immovable property ownership title certificate from GASR on Sukhbat’s land. Then
  Itgel sold this land to someone else, who was the person that had removed the fences.

  In the process of clarifying the circumstances, it revealed that the cadastral map, which had been completed
  done when the land was subdivied in 2003, was not recorded in the cadastral database. Also, it became clear
  that Itgel had persuaded an official to delete the parcel boundary in the cadastral database separating his and
  Sukhbat’s land parcels.

   Baatar obtained 150 square meters of land in Khan-Uul District and received a land possession right certificate
   legally in 2006. He built a five-story building for service/commercial use on that land. Unfortunately, he passed
   away before he managed to obtain the related immovable property ownership title certificate.

   Baatar’s widow, Khorloo, decided to make her youngest son Zorig the sole heir to the property and initiated the
   process to formalize the inheritance. Her decision was also supported by Baatar’s daughters Naran and Saran.
   However, another son, Bat, wanted sole inheritance of the property. Two different notaries issued a total of three
   inheritance certificates. One notary worked for Khorloo and her son Zorig and the other notary for Bat. The land
   possession right certificate and subsequently immovable property ownership title certificate were issued to Bat
   by the District Property and Land Relations Department (DPLRD) and General Authority for State Registration
   (GASR) based on the inheritance certificate issued in Bat’s name. Khorloo and Zorig submitted their inheritance
   certificates to DPLRD, but they were misplaced and eventually re-issued. Eventually, however, Bat managed to be-

   Box 2.5:	 Case Study: Land and Property Transfer as a Commercial Transaction

   A property located in Sukhbaatar district, located on the ground floor of a multistory building with a built area of
   around 400 square meters (m2) and land area of 558 m2, was sold in September 2013. The titles for the property
   included an immoveable property ownership certificate issued by the General Authority for State Registration
   (GASR) for the building and a land possession right certificate issued by the Land Administration Department of
   UB City (now the Property Relations Department—PRD).

   The parties negotiated the total sales price, payment conditions, who pays for the notary services, and other con-
   ditions. A “Contract for the Sale and Purchase of Immovable Property” was concluded and notarized. A fixed fee
   of MNT 300,000 (US$166.6) was paid for the notary service. This was necessary as the contract amount was more
   than MNT 500,000,000 (US$277,750). The contract concerned only the building. The contract was then submitted
   to GASR to register the change in ownership, which required submission of the following documents:

   •	 notarized contract for sales and purchase of immovable property
   •	 notarized IDs, company registration certificate, company statute (the notary fee for each ID and company reg-
      istration certificate is MNT 2,500 [US$1.4]; MNT 500 is paid for each page of the copy of the company statute)
   •	 immoveable property ownership certificate—original
   •	 receipt confirming payment of a 2 percent tax on the sale of immoveable property
   •	 service fee of MNT 20,000 (US$11); MNT 40,000 (US$22) in case of expedited/urgent registration
   •	 application for registration

   The immovable property ownership certificate was issued in two working days in the name of the buyer. The
   company received the certificate on the third day after it submitted the request for transfer of ownership of the
   building. If the transaction had not involved “land or land possession right,” then it would have been completed
   in three to four days.

   After the company received the ownership certificate, the parties entered into a separate contract to transfer the
   land possession right to the buyer. A notary service was used and a fee for 10,000 MNT (US$5.5) was paid, the
   fixed rate for this type of contract. The process was finished only after the immovable property ownership was
   transferred to the buyer as advised by the notary.

   The parties submitted the following to the Cadastral Division of PRD for the land rights transfer:

   •	 official request to of both parties to PRD to transfer the land possession right
   •	 notarized contract to transfer the land possession right
   •	 a confirmation from the PRD that all land fees due were paid, obtained from the Land Fee and Payment Divi-
      sion of PRD
   •	 original land possession right certificate and contract for land possession for citizens and legal entities
   •	 notarized copies of IDs, company registration certificates, and the immovable property ownership certificate
      (for each, a notary fee of MNT 2,500 (US$1.4) is paid)
   •	 payment of MNT 35,000 (US$20) to PRD for the land possession certificate

   The land possession right certificate was issued by PRD after three months. The Law on Land requires that a
   decision on the transfer of the land possession rights be made by the UB City Governor within 15 working days
   after submission. However, in practice this took about three months.

  Box 2.6:	 Case Study: Successful Land Administration in Georgia

  Georgia has markedly improved its land administration and management systems since the pro-democracy Rose
  Revolution in 2003 (World Bank 2011). The case of Georgia has particular relevance for the Mongolian experience
  because both countries have recently undertaken a series of market and institutional reforms following a demo-
  cratic transition. Land reform has become key issue in both countries.

  The goal of the reforms was to separate and streamline land management and administration tasks and to re-
  duce the incidence of corruption in land certification and registration functions. To do this, Georgia:

  •	 created a new agency (National Agency for Public Registry—NAPR) solely responsible for land administration
     that was charged with issuing titles, and maintaining the cadaster and registry records
  •	 separated public land management responsibilities to other ministries
  •	 reduced registration time by offering online services and information about parcels, waiving notary require-
     ments in certain cases, and having a single caseworker in charge of applications
  •	 introduced a fee-based financing structure for NAPR in order to ensure proper fees are collected in a timely
     manner for services offered, which has made the agency fully self-financed and even generating additional
     revenue for the national budget

  As evidence of the success of these changes, Georgia has consistently ranked at the top of the World Bank/IFC
  “Doing Business” ratings, having the highest ranking (out of 183 countries) for property registration systems
  since 2012 (World Bank 2012:13).

   Box 2.8:	 Case Study: Missing Revenue from an Alternative Property Value Assessment in UB

   In September 2013, a private company located in Sukhbaatar District sold about 400 square meters of com-
   mercial immovable property at market value for MNT 1.1 billion (US$611,000). However, the value recorded in
   the company’s books was only about MNT 50 million (US$27,750). The current rule of property taxation of com-
   mercial properties allows the use of the property’s book value for taxation. Therefore, the company had been
   paying only MNT 300,000 (US$166) annually in property taxes (MNT 50 million x 0.6%) instead of MNT 5,280,000
   (US$2,933), which would have been due to the city on a market valuation. Thus, for this property alone, the city
   has been forgoing close to 4,000,000 MNT per year.

   Box 3.1:	 Additional Corruption Allegations Concerning Public Land Allocation in UB

   The daily news website www.medee.mn reported that in 2013 the Prosecutor’s Office reviewed 14 significant
   cases that were filed with charges related to corruption and abuse of power. The cases were sent to Prosecutor’s
   Office to initiate legal proceedings, but each case was eventually dismissed.

   Examples of the dismissed cases include the following:

   Transfer of 5,000 square meters (m2) land from the Mongolian National Chamber of Commerce and Industry
   (MNCCI) to the World Trade Center nongovernmental organization (NGO). The case was filed against possible
   abuse of power by the chairman of the MNCCI, who is also a member of parliament.

   The director of the Mongolian-Indian Joint School was accused of selling land possessed by the school to third
   parties in parcels of 422 m2, 837 m2, and 450 m2 (see figure 3.2 and box 3.2).

   The examples highlight the regularity of allegations of corruption related to public land allocation in the city and
   demonstrate the need to support transparent land management practices.

   Box 3.3:	 Unpermitted Development on Public Lands in UB

   In September 2012 two teenagers, a school girl and a university student, were killed in separate incidents under
   similar circumstances; both cases highlight the problems of illegal development in Ulaanbaatar. In one incident,
   a girl returning home from school was struck by a cement pumper installed on a truck at a construction site
   Bayangol District near State Hospital No. 3. Later that month, a boy was walking past a construction area near
   the Tengis movie theater when he was struck by a falling iron fastening bar.

   In each of these cases, the construction sites did not have approved building plans or appropriate permits for
   construction. The land occupied by State Hospital No. 3 had originally been allocated for the construction of a
   private hospital, but a 13-story apartment building with commercial and service facilities was carved out of the
   parcel and built instead. The first seven stories of the building were under construction without building permits.
   Similarly, the land near the Tengis theater had permits for the development of a 16-story commercial and office
   center. However, the development plans were changed without approval, increasing the land area and expand-
   ing the project to 22 stories.

   These incidents underline the importance of the need for transparent and effective land management and ad-
   ministration for public safety and liability reasons. In each case, the developer sought to change the use of public
   land allocated for another purpose in order to maximize private returns. Development that occurs outside of
   official plans, approvals, and permits places the public at risk. With unpermitted development, there is no guar-
   antee that the siting and layout of the buildings or the construction techniques and materials are appropriate
   and compliant with standards.

   Box 3.4:	 Berlin’s Experience in Managing Surplus Property: Liegenschaftsfonds Berlin

   Liegenschaftsfonds Berlin is a wholly state owned company responsible for marketing and managing city-owned
   properties no longer needed for public purposes. It aligns marketing with the state of Berlin’s economic, urban
   development, and housing policy goals; and sells properties at market value. City boroughs receive a share of
   profits as an incentive to agree to property disposal.

   The company employs a staff of around 120 people, whose scope of activity comprises the documentation,
   valuation, management, and marketing of over 4,500 surplus properties owned by the State of Berlin. Since it
   was founded in 2001, it has concluded contracts for a total of nearly 6,300 properties comprising a total area of
   almost 16 million m², which generated over €2 billion for the State of Berlin. Its portfolio contains residential,
   commercial, mixed-use, industrial, special-use, and niche-properties, which it sells both to private buyers and
   project developers.

   The company determines a portfolio for each year, and its Steering Committee participates in defining sales
   goals and sale procedures for each property, choosing from three forms of competitive procurement. Sale of
   properties for over €3 million or below market value requires approval of the supervisory board and Berlin’s
   House of Representatives.

   Box 3.5:	 International Debate and Lessons on Market Valuation of Government Land

   About 50 countries across the world either have adopted accrual accounting or are doing so, based on expecta-
   tions that this transition would enable them to manage their finances better, including the production of balance
   sheets. While usefulness of balance sheets is broadly recognized, there is less consensus on the introduction of
   full accrual accounting and budgeting in the public sector.

   There are two most common approaches governments use to valuing capital assets on the balance sheet: the
   historic cost and fair market value. Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom use fair
   market value for both buildings and land, while Canada, Denmark, Kyrgyzstan, Serbia, and the United States use
   historical costs, with depreciation (except land, which is valued at the original cost, without depreciation).

   The debate over the pros and cons of both concepts of accounting valuation—historic cost versus market val-
   ue—and their methodological implications continues. Opponents of market valuation argue that it wastes public
   resources to assess market value for land and property that is not marketable (such as national parks); opponents
   further argue that market valuations can be volatile due to changing market conditions and can also be manipu-
   lated. Opponents of the historic cost approach argue that such valuation leads to substantial undervaluation of
   government land.

   The implications of land accounting at historic cost for former socialist countries are significant. The majority of
   municipal land was obtained by local governments free of charge, as part of property devolution from central
   governments that did not account for the land at any value. In Kyrgyzstan, for example, such freely obtained land
   is not recorded on the municipal balance sheet at all, despite the fact that land market values can exceed munic-
   ipal budgets many times over, even by partial accounting. Hungary has recognized the fundamental distortion
   created by assigning zero value to local government land. In 2000 a compulsory revaluation of municipal land
   was conducted, following which approximate market values were assigned.

  Box 4.1:	 Zaisan: The Cost of Illegal Fringe Development

  Zaisan is a neighborhood located on the south central edge of Ulaanbaatar at the base of Bogd Khan mountain.
  While the area is officially designated as a special protected zone, over the last decade hundreds of apartments
  have been constructed there. Zaisan’s location and superior air quality initially made it an attractive alternative to
  the city core for investors and wealthy home buyers. However, because development proceeded against official
  planning standards and without official approvals, heating and infrastructure connections are unevenly distribut-
  ed, schools are lacking, traffic circulation is poor, flood risks are present, and the design and siting and setbacks
  of buildings is disorganized. Due to the disputed legal status of the area, property rights of land holders are in
  question.

  The accumulation of these negative impacts has now been reflected in the local property market. Real estate
  professionals indicated in late 2013 and early 2014 that prices are dropping and vacancy rates in some develop-
  ments remain at 10–15 percent. The case demonstrates that land and property values are sensitive to a set of de-
  velopment rights, planning controls, and public infrastructure coverage. When these are absent or incomplete,
  the value and demand for these properties will decline.

   Box 5.1:	 Development Fees as a Source of Municipal Revenue

   Cities can raise revenue to pay for infrastructure by requiring developers pay a fee for the right to build. The
   basis for development fees is that any new private development, such as apartments, offices, and commercial
   spaces, production uses impose additional burdens on the existing public infrastructure or require expansion.
   The developer then pays a fee, which the city uses to offset the extra infrastructure demands that the project will
   impose. A new apartment complex, for example, will house more families and increase the need for new or larger
   schools. It will also place additional burdens on the city’s overall water, power, and heating needs once these
   lines are connected to the system.

   Development fees are a one-time charge assessed on anybody before they can start construction. The fees amounts
   are in proportion to the expected cost needed to provide the service improvement. Fees can be charged in several
   ways, such as per square unit of developed area (sometimes differentiated by land use, so that developers of com-
   mercial real estate pay more than builders of single-family homes, for example); according to a zone system based
   on location; or as a proportion of estimated construction costs. The city uses the fee revenue to pay for addi-
   tional infrastructure, such as additional school space, trunk water lines, lane space on access roads, and so forth.

   Development fees represent an important source of revenue for many cities across the United States and Eu-
   rope. In the Balkan region, for example, they constitute up to half of local government revenues (Garzon and Fri-
   ere 2014). In the United States, they are one of several tools used to support urban growth while also generating
   revenue for service provision. They are also a less-risky alternative to municipal borrowing, and also transfer more
   of the government’s infrastructure investment risk on to the private developers.

   However, there are several caveats to the use of development fees. First, because development fees represent
   an additional cost to development, a fee that is too costly may limit private investment in construction or en-
   courage illegal development (Peterson 2009). Second, it can be difficult for cities to assemble enough fee rev-
   enue quickly enough for large public investments. This is the case when new developments are relatively small,
   infrequent, and spread across the city (Fulton 1999). Finally, setting up the development fee that would generate
   sufficient but not excessive revenues is a difficult task, and the use of these revenues in transitional economies is
   sometimes criticized for being not transparent.

  Box 5.2:	 Using a Land Task Force in Establishing Strategic Land Management

  The City of Nis, Serbia (population 255,500) created a special temporary Task Force (TF) to improve land manage-
  ment. The TF was composed of the Mayor; Advisor to the Mayor (Acting TF Chair); a member of the City Council;
  Head of Property and Inspection Department; Head of Finance, Local Revenues, and Procurement; Acting Head
  of Planning and Construction Department; Deputy Public City Attorney; Head of Information and Communica-
  tion Technology (ICT) Department at City Administration; Financial Manager, Municipal Enterprise for Construc-
  tion; and Representative of the Republic Geodetic Department (Cadaster). The TF focused on four activities:

     i.	 inventorying land

     ii.	 conducting demonstration land auctions based on current best approaches to offering land to investors

     iii.	 developing land policy

     iv.	 developing a Strategic Land Management Plan
                                                                                                          (continued next page)




                                                        C h a p t e r 5 : C o n clu s i o n   and   R e c o m m e n d at i o n s   |   6 7
   Box 5.2 (continued)

   According to participants, the TF played a critical role in improving land management for the following reasons:

      •	 The TF functioned with a “think tank” capacity because it combined the expertise and knowledge of multi-
         ple departments.

      •	 The inclusion of the member of the City Council on the TF allowed the group to informally liaise with the
         Council and prepare the members for the suggestions and recommendations the TF would provide.

      •	 Similarly, TF members from two central government institutions (a local branch of the State Cadaster Agency
         and the municipal court) secured cooperation with agencies that held data critical for land inventorying

      •	 Unexpectedly, the TF also helped to depoliticize the land management issues. Although TF members repre-
         sented different political parties, the temporary nature of the TF, the technical nature of the tasks considered,
         and the use of a Chatham House Rule provided some level of anonymity to participants and allowed for
         more candid discussions. The Chatham House Rule allows participants to discuss opinions, ideas, and infor-
         mation from a meeting without mentioning the identity of the person responsible for them. These aspects
         supported a collaborative and constructive environment for the work of the TF.

      •	 The TF became an important setting for knowledge transfer from the technical assistance provider to mem-
         bers of the TF.

      •	 The temporary nature and cross-department composition of the TF was a good platform for developing and
         preparing permanent organizational changes that were eventually introduced.

   Key results of TF activities included:

      •	 In 15 months, a newly developed database on municipal land was populated with 15,835 parcels identified
         in the Real Estate Cadaster; of those, 3,011 parcels were verified in field audits.

      •	 The city successfully auctioned five municipal parcels, despite the fact that the auction happened in the
         middle of the financial crises (March 2010). Factors of success included: (i) preparation and formal approval
         of a new set of good-quality procedures and legal documents, substantially attuned to efficiency expected
         by potential buyers, and (ii) marketing of the sites by a professional brokerage company.

      •	 “Big picture” principles for the draft of the city’s land policy (though the policy was not formally adopted).

      •	 Formulation of central issues to be addressed in the Strategy of Land Management and partial solutions
         (also not formally adopted).

   Room for Improvement:

      •	 One of the overall lessons learned and incorporated into land management practice was that the City Ad-
         ministration needs better “public diplomacy” and a good public relations approach in order to educate and
         influence the public opinion and to secure the understanding and support of particular groups such as local
         business circles and political parties.

    Box 5.4: Property Valuation for Taxation Purposes: Area-Based Valuation

    There are several methods for conducting property valuation for taxation. A property tax is derived from a
    combination of a tax base and a tax rate. The tax base refers to the value of the property taxed, which in de-
    veloped economies is based on some portion of the property’s market value.a A tax rate applied to the taxable
    value results in the tax amount due for payment. In developed economies, price information on most types
    of land and properties is widely available and can be used to estimate the market value and compute the tax
    base. However, in areas where market price data are inaccurate or incomplete, accurate property tax valuation
    is much more difficult. The capacity of a government to collect accurate market price data on individual prop-
    erties and develop a valuation system for tax purposes is complex and takes years to establish.

    Area-based valuation is the simplest technique and has been implemented in countries where market-based
    valuation systems are weak or do not yet exist, including Hungary, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Romania, and
    the Czech Republic. Area-based valuation is a simple first-step toward developing more sophisticated mar-
    ket-based valuation systems as more reliable price information becomes more available and tax assessment
    capacity improves over time (Norregaard 2013). In the most basic form, the tax base is determined by the floor
    or land area of the property, which is combined with a base value per square meter. The base value should also
    be updated every 3–5 years to reflect inflation and general market trends. The tax rate can be fixed or adjusted
    according to the type of the property. This resembles the system that is already in place in UB, though the price
    assumption for the tax base does not reflect current market values.

    An area-based system can be adapted in order begin to accommodate variations in market values of land. For
    example, tax rates on land and property can be set to vary according to their location relative to amenities (such
    as schools, hospitals, and transportation hubs, among others) throughout the city. Properties that are located
    near amenities can be taxed at a higher rate than those that are further away, as is done in Chile and Romania
    (Bahl 2009). This approach allows the property tax structure to have some sensitivity to differences in market
    values of property based on location prior to developing more precise price records or price estimates for indi-
    vidual properties in order to improve the accuracy of tax base.

    Note: a. Market value is the most probable price that can be expected for a particular property in a sale between a typical
    buyer and seller under the following assumptions:
      •	 An open and competitive market exists for the type of rights involved in the transaction.
      •	 The buyer and seller are acting prudently in their best interest and without undue stimulus.
      •	 Marketing efforts were adequate and a reasonable time was allowed for exposure of the property on the open market.
      •	 Payment was made in cash or comparable terms.

should also be eligible for taxation based on market val-                   ment of debt. This is especially germane to any discussion
ues. In contrast to income taxation, property taxes are                     of using borrowing instruments like municipal bonds,
less regressive for the poor and represent a more stable                    because funds obtained through borrowing are not real
source of revenue. As property taxes represent a stable                     revenues—they need to be repaid over an extended peri-
and reliable revenue source, the city needs to consider                     od, at a cost.
