FOREWORD

                       he last decade has witnessed a rapid increase in
                       incomes in South Asia, but significant devel-
                       opment challenges remain. Some challenges,
                       such as industrial water pollution, have proved
           difficult to resolve. The case of Bangladesh is illustrative.
           Bangladesh’s economy has benefited from the growth of
           its garment sector, but the country faces considerable
           challenges managing industrial standards. Despite donor
           and Government involvement, pollution remains a
           growing problem.
                 Tackling this issue necessitated the development of
           a large, strategic, multi-stakeholder program in collabora-
           tion with the private sector, drawing on the World Bank’s
           expertise as a provider of knowledge and convener, as well
           as a financier. This was not easy. The team had to think
           carefully about how the private sector could be brought in.
           The importance of the global textiles sector to many of the
           Bank’s client countries required identifying an appropriate
           entry point and bringing the right people to the table.
                 Three actors were instrumental in supporting this
           process: The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC),
           who pioneered work with textile mills in China. The
           International Finance Corporation (IFC)—particularly the
           Bangladesh team—, who provided knowledge of the local
           apparel sector and their cleaner production program. And,
           several global apparel brands, which possess enormous
           sourcing power and influence to improve the environmen-
           tal performance of mills through their own supply-chain
           policies.
                 The result of these efforts—the Responsible Sourcing
           Initiative in Bangladesh—is an innovative approach to
           address these problems. It demonstrates how collaboration
           between the Government, the World Bank, IFC and the
           private sector (global apparel brands, and textile mills) can

 SUMMARY




            T
                       he objective of this report is to document a new
                       approach to tackle systemic industrial pollution
                       in the textile industry. The Global Responsible
                       Sourcing Initiative (RSI) was created in 2010 in
            response to this challenge. The initiative brings together
            the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation
            (IFC), the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), and
            eight leading multinational brands. This platform allows
            non-traditional partners to explore a joint approach to
            address environmental concerns within the global apparel
            supply chain by collectively changing the “business as
            usual” mode of operation.

            BANGLADESH CASE STUDY: A MAJOR
            EMERGING TEXTILE EXPORTER

            Chapter 1 outlines why Bangladesh was selected as
            the first fully-fledged RSI pilot. There were a number of
            reasons. First, its ready-made garment industry is a major
            exporter, accounting for around 5 percent of the global
            ready-made garment sector, as well as being a major driver
            of Bangladesh’s economy. Second, its market is domi-
            nated by a handful of leading multinational brands, which
            therefore exert considerable influence. Third, Bangladesh’s
            rapidly growing textile industry is placing an increasing
            environmental footprint.
                 Chapter 2 further expands on the importance and
            characteristics of Bangladesh’s dynamic and fast-evolving
            ready-made garment export sector.

            Bangladesh’s ready-made garment sector in more detail.

                          industrial pollution in the textile industry in
                          Bangladesh and other countries.
                              The purpose of this report is to document
              and share the Bangladesh RSI pilot as a new model1 for

              society, and private sector to tackle industrial pollution in
              the textile industry, under the auspices of the RSI.
                   The report also provides a number of additional
              insights to support the Government of Bangladesh and
              its partners by: (a) showcasing the potential benefits
              of cleaner production for Bangladesh textile mills; and
              (b) providing a menu of options with recommendations for
              scaling up cleaner production uptake by leveraging non-

                        he ready-made garment sector in Bangladesh is
                        an important driver in the economy, with annual
                        growth rates of around 12 percent a year. The
                        sector currently accounts for around a sixth of
              Bangladesh’s economy and employs 4 million workers,
              around 80 percent of whom are women. It remains a key
              export sector for Bangladesh, representing around three
              quarters of export earnings.4 Globally, Bangladesh accounts
              for 5 percent of the $376 billion ready-made garment mar-
              ket (Gereffi and Frederick 2010).
                   The ready-made garment sector in Bangladesh is
              predominantly locally owned (Montfort and Yang 2004).5

                        he global ready-made garment supply chain can
                        be categorized into four distinct phases: (a) the
                        production of raw materials (such as cotton); (b)
                        manufacturing; (c) transport; and (d) end-point
              consumer care. Each has its own distinct environmental
              impact, as presented in figure 3.1.
                   Most of Bangladesh’s ready-made garment sector
              involves manufacturing. Typical manufacturing processes
              include yarn production, fabric production, wet processing,
              and garment production. As shown in figure 3.2, the degree
              of environmental externalities generated by each of these
              processes varies markedly. The WDF textile-processing units
              have the greatest environmental footprint, due to:
               •	 The intensive use of clean freshwater to wash, dye, and
                  finish textiles;
               •	 The associated generation of large volumes of
                  wastewater;
               •	 To a lesser extent, the use of energy to heat water and
                  generate steam and associated emissions.

                         he Government of Bangladesh has developed a
                         set of environmental policies and legislation that
                         provide an acceptable regulatory framework for
                         environmental management and industrial pol-
              lution control. The environmental standards for the textile
              industry in Bangladesh are regulated by the Environmental
              Conservation Act, 1995; the Environmental Conservation
              Rule, 1997; and the Forest Act, 1927. Specific effluent
              concentration-based standards exist for the discharge of
              treated wastewater directly into the natural environment
              (table 4.1).17 The Bangladesh Environmental Conservation
              Act (1995, amended in 2002) also places a strong emphasis
              on prevention of industrial pollution.

              Sourcing Initiative

              5.1	 BACKGROUND TO THE BANGLADESH
              RESPONSIBLE SOURCING INITIATIVE




              T
                        he Bangladesh Responsible Sourcing Initiative
                        (RSI) was established in 2010 as part of the
                        broader RSI multi-stakeholder platform (see
                        chapter 1). The purpose of this country-level
              incubator activity is to test how multiple non-traditional
              actors can be brought together to help the Government
              of Bangladesh achieve relatively simple quick wins as an
              additional, innovative way to shift the industrial pollution
              debate from a traditional command and control approach
              to one centered around green growth.
                   The Bangladesh RSI is an incubator that seeks to test
              a new approach for greening supply chains at the country
              level. The initiative was built on two simple pillars:
               •	 Selection of a non-controversial entry point—the
                  identification of cleaner production best practices for
                  textile mills—that most stakeholders would buy into;
               •	 Development and nurturing of multi-stakeholder
                  partnerships to work together in identifying cleaner
                  production best practices and exploring options for
                  their implementation.

     THE RACE TO THE BOTTOM—AND BACK TO THE TOP?

     The demands from consumers coupled with globalization have led multinational corporations
     to source production from the lowest-cost locations in the world: the so-called “race to the
     bottom.” These multinational corporations control global production networks and stipulate
     supply specifications. Multinational corporations have, however, recently become increasingly
     concerned with non-production factors in their supply chain, such as social compliance (see for
     example the Better Work program26) and—even more recently—environmental standards. The
     relatively new focus of multinational corporations on environmental standards in their supply
     chain, and their impact on water resources in particular, can be ascribed to four factors:
     •	 Reputational risk. Pressure is increasing from more demanding consumers;
     •	 Physical risk. Textile production is highly dependent on large volumes of clean freshwater.
        With areas of production often in highly water-stressed areas, degradation and over-exploi-
        tation of water resources is a major threat to production processes;
     •	 Regulatory risk. Sudden changes in legislation or enforcement may also pose threats to
        production if large numbers of suppliers are non-compliant;
     •	 Financial risk. All of the above risks represent significant potential financial losses to the
        bottom line of multinational corporations.
     There have been significant advancements made on so-called sweatshops (any working envi-
     ronment considered to be unacceptably difficult or dangerous) and child labor issues in the
     garment industry, largely due to public pressure and media involvement. Following the 2013
     Rana Plaza disaster, over 100 global retailers have signed up to the Accord on Fire and Building
     Safety in Bangladesh, including agreeing on joint standards, monitoring, training and remedial
     programs to ensure worker safety in over 1500 of their direct suppliers.
     However, to date, efforts of multinational corporations to improve the environmental perfor-
     mance of textile mills remain far more mixed.
     This is partly because environmental impact is often more complex, harder to define and less
     controversial than the social dimension, since most pollution occurs further down the supply
     chain, where the less direct relationship and large number of mills make it difficult to apportion
     responsibility. In a highly competitive market, there is less incentive to push for pollution treat-
     ment, as this results in higher production costs, particularly where the playing field is uneven.
     In spite of various initiatives, multinational corporations are still grappling with defining new
     ways to meaningfully engage on the environmental front.
     Cleaner production thus offers multinational corporations a very attractive entry point, because:
     •	 It enhances efficiency and competitiveness;
     •	 It is a positive way to get to know and develop fruitful relationships with second- and third-
        tier suppliers;
     •	 It is a first step toward reducing four key risks (reputational, physical, regulatory, and finan-
        cial risks).

   SUMMARY OF KEY FINDINGS FROM NRDC’S CLEANER PRODUCTION BEST-
   PRACTICE METHODOLOGY IN CHINA

   NRDC first collaborated with international brands on an RSI in China, the world’s largest cen-
   ter of manufacturing. Following a review of more than a dozen textile mills, NRDC identified 10
   cleaner production best practices involving simple, cost-saving opportunities to reduce water,
   energy, and chemical use via improvements in manufacturing efficiency. The China pilot dem-
   onstrated significant savings: the practices identified could save approximately 25 percent of
   water and 30 percent of fuel use through initiatives that pay for themselves in less than eight
   months. A showcase mill, Redbud Textile Company in Changshu, China, adopted just three
   of these practices with a one-time cost of $72,000. The result was a 23 percent reduction in
   water use and an 11 percent reduction in coal consumption, with savings of nearly $840,000
   per year accruing for Redbud (NRDC 2010). The 10 recommended best practices for China are
   illustrated below.

              costs, current uptake is low, even among top-performing
              factories. Tangible environmental benefits will therefore
              only be achieved if a significant proportion of mills in
              Bangladesh start to adopt these cleaner production
              best practices.
                   The factory audits highlighted the complementary
              market failures that are inhibiting uptake of cleaner
              production best practices, namely: externalities, which
              mean that cleaner production uptake is lower where firms
              do not have to internalize their costs imposed on society
              and the environment; and information asymmetry and
              missing markets, which raise the costs for firms to adopt

                         he following actions are recommended as part
                         of a holistic, incremental, multi-stakeholder
                         approach to promote cleaner production uptake
                         among selected textile mills. Activities can be
              implemented as stand-alone activities, simultaneously or
              sequenced over a number of years, depending on resource
              availability and emerging windows of opportunity for
              change. The proposed plan of action is in three parts:
               •	 Part I. Immediate efforts should focus on enhancing
                  access to cleaner production information and advisory
                  support;
               •	 Part II. A number of complementary market-based
                  actions should also be considered to further strengthen
                  incentives for uptake;
               •	 Part III. Proposed changes to the regulatory framework
                  for water use and disposal could yield transformational
                  change, provided there are sufficient resources, demand
                  for change, and broad-based multi-stakeholder support.

NATIONAL CLEANER PRODUCTION CENTERS	

The international community has supported cleaner production initiatives in countries with
developing and transitional economies since the early 1990s. UNIDO and UNEP have adopted
a multi-pronged approach combining advocacy, training, industry demonstrations, policy
advice, and facilitation of technology transfer and investment with institutional development
through over 45 national cleaner production centers (NCPCs). NCPCs contribute to improved
environmental performance and resource efficiency of enterprises and other organizations,
which also increases productivity and competitiveness. Key services include:
•	 Technical assistance and in-plant assessments;
•	 Training;
•	 Information dissemination and awareness creation;
•	 Policy advice;
•	 Cleaner production technology and investment promotion.
A 2007 evaluation found that the program had been especially successful in: (a) putting
cleaner production on the agenda of businesses and government; (b) training of professional
cleaner production auditors; (c) implementation of, in particular, low- and intermediate-cost
technology options in assisted companies; and (d) policy change and technology transfer in
several countries.
Key lessons learned included:
•	 Cleaner production is of continued and rising relevance as a result of several trends,
   including worsening industrial pollution and high industrial resource use; multilateral
   environmental agreements entering into force; globalization and trade liberalization; and
   buyer pressure.
•	 NCPCs are appropriate for cleaner production capacity building, but institutional devel-
   opment and positioning of NCPCs amid other business service providers in their home
   countries deserve greater attention.
•	 There was a trade-off between the financial independence of NCPCs and the sustained
   impact of the program. The priority assigned to financial sustainability (independence)
   of the NCPC as a national institution (largely through income from services) can become
   counterproductive to achieving sustained effects and impacts as measured by the pro-
   gram’s objectives.
•	 The NCPC program has great potential. The predominantly country-based funding strategy
   has, however, not been conducive to networking, knowledge management, and learning
   between NCPCs operating in different countries and regions. Moreover, the potential for
   cooperation and leverage with other initiatives was not fully exploited (UNIDO and UNEP
   2008, 2010).

     THE APPAREL INDUSTRY’S ZERO DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS
     ROADMAP

     The Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals (ZDHC) initiative was established by the apparel
     industry in 2011, largely as a response to the publication of a Greenpeace report Dirty Laundry,
     which highlighted the widespread discharge of untreated chemicals by textile companies into
     waterways in China. The objective of the ZDHC is to provide the industry with a roadmap for
     zero discharge of hazardous chemicals within their supply chain by 2020.
     Current members include Adidas Group, C&A, Esprit, G-Star Raw, H&M, Inditex, Jack Wolfskin,
     Levi Strauss & Co., Li Ning, NIKE, Inc., PUMA SE, and key influencers in the chemical industry.
     The founding group of brands developed a roadmap to detail specific projects and actions that
     can be taken collectively with other brands to drive the apparel and footwear industry toward
     the goal of ZDHC.
     Challenges ZDHC is trying to tackle include:
     •	 The contract manufacturing model;
     •	 The complexity of the supply chain (with thousands of direct contract partners and tens of
        thousands of material suppliers, in multiple tiers);
     •	 Hundreds of individual chemicals are used at each material supplier;
     •	 Limited visibility into the formulation of preparations (mixtures of chemicals) used by sup-
        pliers, in particular incomplete information on hazardous ingredients in material safety
        data sheets;
     •	 Chemical preparations of lower quality (often containing unwanted ingredients) are in
        direct competition with better alternatives;
     •	 Directly controlling chemical formulations deep into the supply chain (suppliers of suppli-
        ers to factories) has not previously been attempted by brands;
     •	 Large volumes of water used in dyeing/finishing and other processes;
     •	 Facility by facility wastewater treatment (rather than centralized wastewater treatment);
     •	 Import/export barriers for chemicals and technologies.
     The joint roadmap is highly ambitious, and it is a plan that sets a new standard of environ-
     mental performance for the global apparel and footwear industry. It includes specific commit-
     ments and timelines to realize this shared goal.

      CHINA’S CLEANER PRODUCTION LAW

      On January 1, 2003, the Cleaner Production Promotion Law came into effect in China. The law
      seeks to reduce pollution and promote resource recycling by regulating all stages of the produc-
      tion chain, including design, choice of energy resources and raw materials, type of technology,
      equipment maintenance, and waste recycling. It gives each local administration responsibility
      to initiate appropriate regulations on the basis of the level of economic development of the
      locality and the nature of its pollution problems. This is because the huge size and diverse eco-
      logical conditions of China’s different regions make it extremely difficult to develop a general
      and standardized policy applicable to all regional environmental problems (Geng et al. 2010).
      This new law is the most significant of a number of initiatives the Chinese government has
      taken to establish cleaner production nationwide as one of China’s key strategies for sustain-
      able development. The law seeks to raise the profile of cleaner production and raise aware-
      ness of its benefits, contributing to a change from downstream management to a more holistic
      supply chain approach.
      However, no comprehensive independent evaluations have yet been carried out to assess its
      full impact. Certainly, the results from NRDC’s RSI factory audits suggest there is still room
      for improvement, even among low-cost cleaner production measures. Clean production still
      remains mainly targeted toward particular manufacturing processes and business strategies
      within individual companies. In order to further enhance its success, governmental agencies
      should play a leading role by coordinating different initiatives, enacting appropriate regula-
      tions, stipulating feasible guidelines and standards, providing substantial financial support,
      and carrying out international collaboration.

     LOAD-BASED STANDARDS

     Load-based environmental standards are based on the total amount of a substance that passes
     through a particular point within a given amount of time. The standard is calculated by the con-
     centration times the total volume of water, and therefore requires both variables to be measured.
     Load-based standards have been increasingly used in Canada, Germany, India, and the United
     States to target critically impaired water bodies under situations of serious water stress or to
     promote a more integrated catchment-wide planning.

     TOTAL MAXIMUM DAILY LOAD

     In the United States, for example, total maximum daily load (TMDL) standards have been used
     extensively since the 1990s by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and
     state environmental agencies under the United States Clean Water Act. A TMDL establishes
     the maximum amount of a pollutant that a water body can assimilate and still meet water
     quality standards. These load-based standards have been particularly useful in establishing
     maximum pollution limits for industrial wastewater dischargers around specific water bodies
     that are classified as impaired or threatened for beneficial uses. This process incorporates
     both point sources and nonpoint source pollutants, and has been increasingly applied at the
     watershed level.50

     ZERO LIQUID DISCHARGE

     Zero liquid discharge legislation was enacted by the Indian state of Tamil Nadu in response
     to severe pollution of local freshwater sources from wastewater by textile mills in Tirupur,
     India’s leading knitwear hub. The renewed threat of permanent closure in 2011 led to radical
     changes in the way mills’ wastewater was treated, with Tirupur’s common effluent treatment
     plants becoming the first to implement zero liquid discharge technology in India, by recovering
     water and salts. However, it remains to be seen how the enforcement of zero liquid discharge
     standards will affect long-term competitiveness (Vishnu et al. 2008; Yew et al. 2012).

     PUBLIC DISCLOSURE PROGRAMS: INTERNATIONAL BEST PRACTICE

     Community-based instruments (including public disclosure programs) have been used for
     over two decades as a complementary tool in reducing pollution emissions. In 1995, Indonesia
     put in place a voluntary, pilot public disclosure scheme that encouraged firms to clean up
     their water pollution. The Program for Pollution Control, Evaluation and Rating (PROPER)
     required firms to self-report their water pollution levels, which were subsequently checked by
     the government’s environmental agency, and then assigned a color-coded rating (from black
     for the factories that made no effort at control, to gold for those that demonstrated adherence
     to international standards). The detailed findings were first shared with the companies, and,
     after a suitable period of time to allow for retesting, were made available to the public, thus
     bestowing either honor or shame on the rated factories and encouraging offenders to clean
     up their act. China followed suit with a similar program, Green Watch, in 2000, when two
     Chinese municipalities established pilot programs covering 150 factories. In 2005, 20 munici-
     palities adopted similar programs covering 8,500 factories. Research shows that the Green
     Watch program has significantly reduced pollution emissions in China. Today similar systems
     are also in place in several countries, including Ghana, India, Republic of Korea, Philippines,
     and Vietnam.

                         omplex global supply chains present particular
                         challenges for promoting green growth. Textile
                         manufacturing has become a major contributor
                         to gross domestic product for many developing
              countries, including Bangladesh, but also has a significant
              environmental footprint due to overstretched environmen-
              tal regulation and enforcement capabilities.
                    Both national governments and major multinational
              brands are searching for more sustainable ways of nurtur-

              8.1	 POTENTIAL FOR CLEANER
              PRODUCTION: KEY FINDINGS

              Encouraging mills to adopt cleaner production measures
              offers a useful, non-controversial entry point. Factory
              audits in Bangladesh confirmed the large potential savings.
              The implementation of seven low-cost cleaner production
              best practices alone could help reduce water and energy
              consumption by 25 percent and chemical use by up to 10
              percent. At the same time, it would save the industry up
              to $200 million a year in efficiency savings and up to $90
              million in avoided wastewater treatment costs.
                   However, uptake of cleaner production measures by
              industry remains low. Tangible environmental benefits will
              therefore only be achieved if a significant proportion of
              mills in Bangladesh start to adopt these cleaner production
              best practices.
                   The factory audits highlighted three complemen-
              tary market failures that are inhibiting uptake of cleaner
              production best practices: (a) the failure to internalize
              externalities associated with water scarcity and pollution
              due to weaknesses in the broader enabling environment

   SPIN-OFF ACTIVITIES FROM RSI

   Gap Inc. is now partnering with NRDC to pilot supply chain policies in its fabric mills and dye-
   houses in China. The objective is to establish a set of policies that lay out clear expectations
   of suppliers’ environmental performance, and that integrate this performance into business
   decision-making. The pilot will have several phases: understanding mills’ current social and
   environmental compliance with the law; creating social and environmental performance stan-
   dards aligned with local law; communicating Gap Inc.’s expectations to mills; and integrating
   social and environmental performance metrics into business assessment considerations. The
   pilot, which will be carried out with selected mills in China, is now in its initial phases, focus-
   ing first on establishing compliance status and collecting baseline information on the mills’
   performance.
   The Institute for Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE), a Chinese NGO, has developed the
   China Pollution Map Database, which compiles publically available records of environmen-
   tal violations by industrial polluters across China. The database is an invaluable resource to
   multinational companies who want information about the environmental compliance status of
   their suppliers, a first step in establishing supply chain policies. During the RSI World Bank
   led round tables, multinational apparel retailers and brands identified a number of improve-
   ments that would allow them to use the database more effectively. The NRDC RSI team is now
   working with IPE to implement a number of these recommended changes, including modifi-
   cations that will improve methods to search the database and make it easier for brands and
   retailers to identify new entries and other changes.
   City-track The RSI World Bank led round tables discussed the challenge of scaling up the pos-
   itive results of the RSI pilot projects to a larger number of suppliers, and suggested concen-
   trating on key geographies as one possible strategy. Starting in 2013, the NRDC RSI program
   plans to use a “city track” approach to scale up the Responsible Sourcing Initiative. Under this
   geographically based plan, the program will select cities that have a large concentration of
   textile mills as well as relatively progressive officials who are under pressure to reduce energy
   use, improve water quality, and showcase international partnership in their localities. Those
   cities with mills in the supply chains of the RSI partner retailers and brands will be of special
   focus to enable these partners to influence suppliers to take part in the program. Factories
   involved in the program will receive technical assistance and training in exchange for imple-
   menting environmental improvements in their facilities.
