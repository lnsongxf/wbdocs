   THE ICSID CASELOAD –
          STATISTICS
         (SPECIAL FOCUS:
SOUTH & EAST ASIA & THE PACIFIC)
                           The ICSID Caseload – Statistics
                          (Special Focus: South & East Asia & the Pacific Region)
          This issue of the ICSID Caseload – Statistics (Special Focus: South & East Asia & the Pacific
          Region) provides an overview of the ICSID caseload involving States in the South & East Asia &
          the Pacific region (SEAP or SEAP Region; see Annex 1 for a list of the SEAP Region 1). It is based
          on ICSID cases registered as of October 1, 2014.

          This document looks at cases involving a SEAP State as the State Party to an ICSID dispute and
          illustrates the number of cases registered, the type of cases registered, the basis of consent to
          ICSID jurisdiction invoked in such cases, the economic sectors involved, and the geographic
          origin and type of investors involved in such cases. It also contains data on outcomes in
          arbitration proceedings involving a SEAP State, including further information on disputes
          decided by tribunals and on settled or discontinued cases.

          This document further looks at cases involving investors from a SEAP State and illustrates the
          number of cases registered, the basis of consent to ICSID jurisdiction invoked in such cases, and
          the economic sectors concerned in disputes involving SEAP investors. It also contains data on
          outcomes in ICSID arbitration proceedings involving an investor from a SEAP State, including
          further information on disputes decided by tribunals and on settled or discontinued cases.

          Finally, this document looks at the geographic origins of arbitrators, conciliators and ad hoc
          committee members appointed in all ICSID cases, and includes a breakdown of appointments
          involving nationals from the SEAP region.

          The analysis considers all ICSID cases involving a SEAP State irrespective of their date of
          registration.

Chart 10: Basis of Consent Invoked to Establish ICSID Jurisdiction in Cases Registered under the ICSID Convention and
Additional Facility Rules involving Investors with SEAP Nationality:


Investors with SEAP nationality relied only on the arbitration mechanism established by the ICSID Convention (100%).

Of the ICSID cases involving an investor with SEAP nationality, 51% were based on an ICSID dispute settlement provision
in an investment contract between the investor and the Host-State. Thirty-nine percent (39%) asserted ICSID jurisdiction
on the basis of a bilateral investment treaty (BIT). The remaining cases invoked the State’s consent to ICSID jurisdiction
in the ASEAN (5%), and the State’s consent found in the investment law of the Host-State (5%).
