                                           EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

1.    Financial inclusion in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) performs relatively well
compared to peers, but gaps remain for selected market segments. A total of 56.2 percent
of adults in BiH have an account at a formal financial institution and 31.9 percent of these
account holders use it with high frequency1, compared to the regional average of 44.9 percent
and 22.5 percent, respectively. Lending services have a high outreach compared to regional
peers, while the usage of saving services are low with only 13.5 percent of adults reporting
saving any money in the past year compared to the regional average of 20.4 percent. In
particular, for the bottom 40 percent, the ratio of adults reporting saving any money in the
past year is even lower at 9.8 percent.2 Moreover, BiH is facing one of the largest gender gaps
in the region, with the difference between male and female account holders at a formal
financial institution amounting to 19.5 percentage points.3

2.    Financial sector development and access to finance for firms is constrained by
weak domestic demand, high collateral requirements and inadequate credit
enforcement mechanisms. Credit to the non-financial private sector expanded by only 0.9
percent year-on-year in the first nine months of 2014, and by 1.1 percent in 2013. A significant
portion of the loans were used to finance working capital rather than investments, mostly due
to unfavorable growth prospects. Reducing the stock and flow of NPLs remains a challenge, as
financial institutions and borrowers alike have been deeply affected by the economic
slowdown following the global financial crisis. The banking sector faces high NPL ratios of
around 15.5 percent at Q2 2014, with higher default rates in corporate loans. Weaknesses in
the corporate insolvency and creditors’ rights regimes also pose important obstac les to debt
resolution. Moreover, collateral requirements are high, with collateral-to-loan values at 216
percent for small firms in BiH.4 Overall, 14.1 percent of firms in BiH identify access to finance
as a major constraint in the Enterprise Survey 2013.

3.     Banks are liquid, but are tightening lending standards and segmenting clients
more distinctly. In general, there is a situation of over-liquidity in banks as they are
cautious in extending credit. The large foreign banks tend to find SME lending too risky,
viewing this segment as lacking stable repayment capacity or adequate collateral. This
perception of financial vulnerability has been aggravated by the financial crisis. Nevertheless,
some of the locally-owned banks have aggressively expanded their SME portfolio, in part by
taking over some of the clients of foreign banks. Banks report a sharper segmentation of their
SME clients, and smaller enterprises with less complete or formal documentation and lacking
collateral tend to be excluded from the market. Regarding micro loans, banks are not
interested to serve this segment of the market as the opportunities for cross-selling of products
and services are limited.

  Usage statistics show that this gap arises mostly from the fact that women are using their accounts much
less than men for receiving wages and government payments. This is an expected result, as according to the
International Labor Organization (ILO) statistics, the female labor force participation is very low at 34.1 percent
in BiH in 2012.

4.     The microcredit organizations (MCO) sector in BiH is less than 3 percent of
financial system assets in 2013. The size of sector has been declining since the microcredit
crisis hit in late 2008. The crisis had followed a period of rapid expansion between 2006 and
2008, which was accompanied by weak MCO governance, imprudent lending and inadequate
monitoring. The weakening of the loan portfolio and over-indebtedness of borrowers was
aggravated by the global crisis in 2008. Although the Law on Microcredit Organizations (MCO
Law) was passed in 2006, it came into effect only in mid-2008, when supervision was also
introduced. The industry used the gap in between the adoption and full enforcement of the
law to continue their imprudent practices in advance of supervision controls.

5.      The separate laws governing microcredit organizations (MCOs) in the two entities
are not aligned, which creates an uneven playing field in the sector. The market structure
is different in the two entities: in the Federation BiH (FBiH), there are 12 MCFs and one small
MCC; in the Republika Srpska (RS), the market is dominated by one large MCC and five smaller
players. 5 As MCOs licensed in one entity can operate in the other, differences in the legal and
regulatory frameworks are creating grounds for unfair competition. In the FBiH, it is
recommended that two actions be taken in parallel: i) strengthen the supervisory powers of
the Banking Agency, by expanding its enforcement toolkit and improving the framework of
appeals; and ii) ease the corporatization process for MCFs.

6.     The Federation Banking Agency (FBA) lacks a sufficient range of enforcement tools
for the MCO sector and it is recommended that the Law on MCOs be amended to
strengthen the supervisory powers of the FBA, and improve the framework of appeals
against FBA’s supervisory actions. Currently, the FBA’s enforcement mechanism is limited to
issuing orders or the severe action of revoking licenses, with no intermediate tools available.
Providing the FBA with a broader menu of corrective actions will give it the authority to impose
the necessary sanctions on MCOs that commit offences, while providing the rest of the market
with a more conducive operating environment. The expanded range of explicit powers could
include appointing advisors, imposing temporary administrators, removing or replacing
management and board members, and other measures. This will also be in line with the powers
already possessed by the Banking Agency of Repubilka Srpska (BARS)6. Furthermore, the
framework of appeals against FBA’s supervisory actions should be improved to enhance the
effectiveness of FBA supervision and authority.

7.     In parallel, the formal facilitation of corporatization is recommended. Easing the
transition from MCFs to MCCs in the FBiH would help to strengthen corporate governance.
Companies would then be subject to the application of the Company Law, which provides
better internal checks and balances. Corporatization can also bring about other benefits: i)
fairer competition by leveling the playing field between the entities, ii) higher lending limits to
be better able to meet the needs of clients, iii) clearer liquidation processes, and iv) allows for
the sustainable growth of MCOs through their assessing a broader range of funding options.

5 The microcredit sector in BiH is composed of non-profit organizations (microcredit foundations, MCFs) and
for-profit companies (microcredit companies, MCCs). Minimum capital requirement for MCFs and MCCs are
BAM 50,000 and BAM 500,000 respectively, while credit limits are BAM 10,000 for MCFs and BAM 50,000 for
MCCs.
6 The strengthening of BARS’ supervisory powers was enabled through the amendment to the RS Law on

MCOs in 2011.
                                                           3


    Currently, the process of corporatization is impeded by the requirement for MCFs to continue
    on-lending in parallel with the acquired MCC. There are also issues regarding the transfer of
    assets of MCFs to MCCs, in particular of donated capital. It is recommended to i) amend Article
    15 of the Law on MCOs, to ease the establishment of MCCs; and ii) to resolve the issue of
    donated capital.

    8.    The leasing sector is facing significant challenges and its viability is at stake.
    Leasing sector assets have continuously declined from more than 6 percent of financial sector
    assets in 2008 to 2.4 percent in 2013. This trend is likely to persist due to the following three
    sets of impediments: i) VAT is applied on the interest of financial leases, which makes it
    disadvantaged compared to banking products; ii) repossession of assets in the event of default
    is cumbersome and lengthy, and can lead to further depreciation of the value of the asset; iii)
    supervision of operating leasing within leasing companies puts them at a disadvantage
    compared to companies providing similar services outside the scope of Banking Agency
    supervision. It is recommended to: i) exempt the VAT on interest for financial leases to make
    leasing on the same level playing field as other types of credit; ii) update the by-laws of the
    pledge registry and regulatory framework for enforcement to enable more effective
    repossession of assets; iii) revise the legal framework to clarify the business activities of
    operational leasing; and iv) streamline the tax and fees imposed on leasing to avoid
    duplication.

    9.     The financial sector consumer protection framework was significantly enhanced in
    recent years in BiH, but improvement is needed on the transparency and disclosure
    regimes. Reforms adopted in the consumer protection area include: i) placing the
    responsibility for the regulation and supervision of consumer protection in the banking, MCO
    and leasing sectors to the respective Banking Agencies; ii) establishing the Ombudsman offices,
    and iii) introducing consumer disclosure requirements in line with the EU Credit Directives.
    Going forward, it is recommended that transparency and disclosure of information in the
    banking and MCO sector should be further improved through standardized disclosure formats
    and price comparison tools to foster competition and increase the comparability of financial
    products and services.

                I.    OVERVIEW OF THE REAL ECONOMY AND FINANCIAL SECTOR8

                                 A. Overview of the Real Economy

10.     Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) accomplished significant economic growth before
being adversely affected by the global financial crisis. GDP per capita nearly quadrupled
and poverty dropped from a level close to 20 percent to about 14 percent between 1998 and
2008. However, the financial crisis in 2009 caused the GDP to shrink by 2.9 percent and
economic growth remained subdued since then, averaging 0.4 percent per year till 2013. The
economy is domestic demand driven and remains dependent on capital inflows, especially
remittances from other parts of Europe to finance a large current account deficit. On the
production side, the manufacturing of automobile parts, energy and metals dominate. As of
end-2013, unemployment remains high around 27.5 percent and the deflation trend is
continuing on the back of subdued domestic demand. Going forward, BiH needs to boost
exports to increase potential growth sustainably.

11.      The economy was slightly recovering prior to the recent floods, but is expected
to contract in 2014. The economy grew by 2.5 percent in 2013, following a recovery in exports.
The trend was projected to continue in 2014 prior to the floods, albeit with a slower pace at 2
percent due to weak domestic demand and an unfavorable external environment. However,
the recent floods have considerably deteriorated the economic outlook for 2014. Preliminary
estimations from the damages and losses associated with the floods put the costs of the floods
at the equivalent of nearly 15 percent of GDP in damages (9.3 percent of GDP) and losses (5.6
percent) in 2014. This amounts to around USD 1.8 billion of damages and USD 1.1 billion of
losses. The hardest hit economic sectors were agriculture, transport and productive activities.
As a result, the economy of BiH is now expected to contract by 0.7 percent in 2014. On poverty,
simulations suggest that as a result of the recent floods, the share of households below the
poverty line may have increased by between 0.4 and 1.8 percentage points – prior to the
disaster, it was around 19 percent.

12.      SMEs dominate the real sector in BiH. As of end-2013, there are 31,409 active
enterprises registered in BiH Statistical Business Register, 31,108 of which are SMEs. There are
also 30,278 “inactive” enterprises that are not closed in the administrative registers, and which
have not submitted financial reports. 74 percent of active firms in BiH are classified as micro-
level while 19 percent and 6 percent are small and medium respectively (see Table 1 for
definitions of size segments and details by entity). The transition of enterprises within size
segments appears to be limited, and this is mostly due to the lack of corporatization and weak
economic growth prospects. Meanwhile, these numbers do not include the “craftsmen”,
owner-entrepreneurs who are registered in municipalities. The number of these craftsmen is
estimated to be considerable – although data is available, it is still not reliable enough for
publication, according to the BiH Agency of Statistics.

13.      SMEs play a very important role in the economy owing to their crucial role in
generating income and employment. SMEs are estimated to account for 67 percent of total
employment, 73 percent of total turnover and 61 percent of total valued added at factor cost
in BiH. They are also dominant in top export-oriented sectors including manufacturing,
electricity and, water supplies (see Table 2 and Figure 1).

                                     B. Overview of the Financial Sector

14.     BiH’s financial sector is heavily bank-dominated and moderately concentrated.
There are 27 banks in BiH accounting for 87.1 percent of financial system assets, which are
equivalent to 84 percent of GDP as of end-2013. The banking system comprises mostly foreign
subsidiaries—91 percent of the banking sector assets, while domestically-owned and state-
owned banks account for 7 and 2 percent respectively. There are 17 banks in FBiH and 10 in
RS, with a share of 70 and 30 percent of the banking system respectively. The five largest banks
represented about half of banking sector assets in 2013.

15.      The rest of the non-banking financial system is small. There are 25 insurance
companies, 19 microcredit organizations (MCOs), 34 investment funds, 8 leasing companies
and 1 factoring company in Bosnia as of end-2013. The non-bank financial sector grew rapidly
thanks to the microcredit and leasing sectors, and its assets reached 22 percent of GDP in 2007.
However, with the financial crisis in 2009, all non-bank financial institutions except the
insurance sector started to shrink continuously; with the largest contraction in the leasing
sector followed by the microcredit sector (see Table 3). There is one stock exchange in each
Entity, but capital markets remain underdeveloped.

16.     The banking system is well capitalized and liquid, yet the adverse impact of the
Eurozone crisis is still evident in the weak asset quality and low profitability. The banking
sector’s capital adequacy ratio (Tier 1) is high at 15.6 percent while liquid assets are 43.4
percent of total short-term liabilities as of Q2 2014. The loan-to-deposit ratio remains
reasonable at 116 percent thanks to the acceleration in deposit growth in 2014 (see Figure 2).
However, banks are struggling with non-performing loans (NPLs) which amounted to 15.5
percent in Q1 2014, compared to 3.1 percent before the global financial crisis (see Figure 3).
Furthermore, there are pockets of vulnerabilities among individual banks.

17.    The floods also affected the financial sector, prompting forbearance measures.
The authorities introduced provisions allowing the banks to apply for loan restructuring or
moratoriums, while exempting the loans from being classified as NPLs. However, only about 1
percent of total loans have been restructured as of September 2014 —suggesting a limited

impact of the floods on borrowers—although more loans could be restructured going forward
as banks continue to file for NPL exemptions.

18.    Overall, the level of financial intermediation is broadly in line with the country’s
income level. Private sector credit growth has significantly slowed down in recent years as the
deleveraging process in EU and high level of NPLs prompted financial institutions to be more
conservative (see Figure 4). Despite this deceleration in loans, domestic credit reached 67.8
percent of GDP in 2013 which is broadly in line with its income level (see Figure 5).

19.      Financial inclusion in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) performs relatively well
compared to peers, but over 40 percent of adults did not have an account at a formal
financial institution. The percent of adults who have accounts at a formal financial institution
stood at 56.2 percent in 20119, above the developing ECA10 average of 44.9 percent. While this
ratio is broadly in line with the upper middle income average of 57.2, countries with higher
incomes in the Western Balkans (Croatia and Macedonia) perform better than BiH (see Table
4), signaling room for improvement. Disaggregating this data into urban and rural populations
does not alter the picture as the gap between two is relatively low at 5 percent points. In terms
of income distribution, the same picture holds again with the access to an account ratio for
adults in the bottom 40 percent of the total income being 5.4 percent points higher than the
average of developing ECA countries. Nevertheless, gaps remain relative to higher-income
neighbors.

20.     The gender gap in access to finance is the largest among comparators. On an
aggregate level, 47.7 percent of females have an account at a formal financial institution in BiH,
which is somewhat comparable with the income level and regional average. Yet, crucially, the
gap between female and male access is 19.5 percentage points, and is the third largest among
all ECA countries after Turkey and Kosovo (see Figure 6). Usage statistics show that this gap
arises mostly from the fact that women are using their accounts much less than men for
receiving wages and government payments. This is an expected result, as the female labor
force participation is very low at 34.1 percent in BiH in 2012, according to the International
Labor Organization (ILO) statistics (see Figure 7).

21.      The main delivery channel of the financial system is branches. There are 963 bank
branches and 359 MCO branches in BiH as of Q2 2014. The number of bank branches per
100,000 adults is significantly higher than most of the comparators. In contrast, the country
lags behind the region in ATMs per 100,000 adults mostly due to cultural and security reasons
rather than an infrastructural gap (see Figure 8). In line with these trends, the main mode of
both deposit and withdrawal is the bank teller in the country (see Figure 9). In terms of the
mode of payments from the accounts, BiH performs worse than most of its peers (see Figure
10) in the usage of both checks and electronic banking, although the latter has been improving,
as reported by banks. Meanwhile, the usage of point-of-sale (POS) systems has been increasing
in recent years with the number of POS terminals per 100,000 adults increasing from 459 in
2009 to 552 in 2013.

22.      Lending activity is high while savings remain limited. Lending services have a high
outreach compared to regional peers, while savings are low with only 13.5 percent of adults
reporting saving any money in the past year compared to the regional average of 20.4 percent.
In particular, for the bottom 40 percent, the ratio of adults reporting saving any money in the
past year is even lower at 9.8 percent (see Figure 11). Accordingly, the domestic savings to
GDP11 ratio is -3 percent as of end-2013 while the deposits stood at 54 percent of GDP. This
picture is in line with the country’s large current account deficit.

23.    Accounts are used mostly for receiving wages. In terms of the usage of accounts,
34 percent of adults in BiH used their accounts to receive wages, the highest ratio among
comparators (see Figure 12). The country performs better also on usage for receiving
remittances as remittances inflows are more than its peers at 10.6 percent of GDP11 (see Figure
13). On the contrary, BiH lags behind similar countries on the account usage for business
purposes which was only at 2.7 percent.

                                             B.   Firms

24.     Firms’ access to credit in BiH performs better than benchmark countries, but
credit growth to the private sector has been muted since the Eurozone crisis. In BiH only
14.1 percent of firms identify access to finance as a major constraint to growth compared to
the ECA average of 17.1 percent. In addition, firms in BiH perform better than their regional
peers in terms of having a loan and using banks to finance investments and working capital
(see Figure 14). Despite this positive picture, credit to the non-financial private sector expanded
by only 0.9 percent year-on-year in the first nine months of 2014, and by 1.1 percent in 2013.
As a result, the share of the corporate sector in total loans fell to 44 percent in September
2014, the lowest since end-2010. These trends show that economic and institutional challenges
remain to be addressed in the short-term.

25.      Low growth prospects diminish the investment appetite of firms while their lack
of repayment capacity makes banks more conservative on lending decisions. A significant
portion of the loans were used to finance working capital rather than investments, mostly due
to unfavorable growth prospects (see Figure 15). The NPL ratio for corporate clients is
significantly higher than that for retail clients, which indicates that the lack of repayment
capacity among firms is a crucial problem. This also prompts banks to be more conservative
and tighten lending standards for the corporate sector although banks are liquid. Meanwhile,
data on SME credit penetration is lacking as banks do not use a common definition for SMEs.

26.      The lack of formal documentation is a challenge for banks to lend to smaller
enterprises. Banks report a segmentation of their SME clients, and smaller enterprises with
less complete or formal documentation. It is recommended that the authorities further
implement financial reporting frameworks based on the IFRS for SMEs standard. A simplified
framework reduces the burden on SMEs and improves the quality of SME financial statements.
This in turn would help SMEs in their efforts to access financing from potential lenders.
                                                     15


27.      The value collateral is another constraint on firms’ access to credit. The value of
collateral needed for a loan remains considerably high at 216 percent for small firms in BiH12,
which is consistent with the levels reported by financial institutions. The main factors that keep
collateral requirements elevated are the higher perceived risk of the firms, and challenges in
collateral enforcement and liquidation processes. These factors prompt financial institutions
to discount the present value of collateralized assets (see Section IV: Legal and Market
Infrastructure).

     III.     MARKET PLAYERS AND INSTITUTIONAL POTENTIAL TO EXPAND FINANCIAL
                                      INCLUSION

                                           A. Commercial Banks

28.      The BiH financial sector is dominated by commercial banks, which comprise 87
percent of the sector’s assets. A large number of players are foreign-owned, with parent
banks from the Eurozone (in particular Austria and Italy). Ever since the global financial crisis
hit, many of the local subsidiaries of these parent banks have been deleveraging, and reducing
their credit to SMEs. The group-wide strategy of foreign banks also affects the strategy of the
local subsidiary to a large extent, particularly on the focus market segments and types of
products offered.

29.     Banks are liquid, but are tightening lending standards and segmenting clients
more distinctly. In general, there is a situation of over-liquidity in banks as they are cautious
in extending credit. The large foreign banks tend to find SME lending too risky, viewing this
segment as lacking stable repayment capacity. This perception of financial vulnerability has
been aggravated by the financial crisis. Nevertheless, some of the locally-owned banks have

aggressively expanded their SME portfolio, in part by taking over some of the clients of the
foreign banks. A handful of small banks also have a targeted focus on SMEs (see Box 1). Banks
report a sharper segmentation of their SME clients, and smaller enterprises with less complete
or formal documentation (e.g. financial statements, business plans, etc), and have less collateral
tend to be excluded from the market. As for micro loans, banks are not interested to serve
this segment of the market, as it is riskier and costlier. Furthermore, the opportunities for
cross-selling of products and services to this segment are limited.

 Box 1. Examples of banks with a specific focus on SMEs

 MF Banka is a small local bank owned by Mikrofin, a microfinance company headquartered in
 RS. MF Banka targets SMEs and has taken over the enterprise clients of Mikrofin, which is
 focusing more on households and agricultural workers. MF Banka has a unique business model
 – loan officers provide consulting services to the client by making field visits to assist them in
 their loan applications, including by helping SMEs project their cash flows.

 Procredit Bank focuses on the SME sector exclusively, after moving away from the
 microenterpreneur sector. It is registered in the Federation. The bank prides itself on providing
 good client advisory services and training its staff to understand and serve the needs of SME
 clients. Procredit is also aiming to expand its electronic offerings through e-banking and other
 services.




30.      Collateral requirements are high, with real estate the preferred collateral. Banks
report a minimum of 150 percent collateral-to-loan value and generally prefer deposits and
real estate. While movable collateral is accepted, they are not extensively used as banks do not
consider such securities as being safe. Banks report of movable assets being sold even while
the execution process is ongoing. In general, the enforcement of collateral in the case of
default is lengthy and difficult (see section IV: Legal and Market Infrastructure).

31.      Banks do not use standardized definitions for SMEs, making it difficult to track a
comparable portfolio. The definitions used by banks are based on annual turnover figures
or loan exposures, and tend to vary considerably. For loans classified as micro, some banks
define it by the type of activity of the borrower. It is recommended that a standardized
definition of SMEs is used, at least for statistical purposes. A good candidate could be the
definitions used in the 2009 Accounting and Auditing Laws, which set out thresholds for small,
medium and large enterprises based on number employees, revenues and asset sizes. Reliable
and comparable statistics that use common definitions will enable a better understanding of
the needs and gaps of the sector as a whole. 13




13Ideally, these definitions are used consistently across the country, e.g. across different government
agencies and the financial sector.

                                    B. Microcredit Organizations (MCOs)

32.     The microcredit sector in BiH experienced rapid growth before peaking in 2008,
and crashed thereafter. The industry experienced two years of very rapid growth from 2006
to 2008, with a significant supply of funds by foreign investors. Data from the Microfinance
Information Exchange (MIX) showed that the gross loan portfolio doubled from 2006 to 2008.
Market growth was driven by expansion to new and existing markets, including through
increases in loan size14 and the introduction of new products. In 2008, the industry began to
show signs of stress, with sharp increases in portfolio at risk (PAR) values.

33.     Structural factors were at the root of the crisis, and the impact was exacerbated
by the global economic recession. The microcredit crisis was chiefly caused by the saturation
of the market and imprudent lending; which led to over-indebtedness of borrowers. MCOs
competed aggressively in already concentrated markets, with market penetration reaching 15
percent in 2008. The competition for the same target groups enabled clients to engage in
multiple borrowing and to increase their total loan amounts. During the crisis, about 40
percent of active borrowers had loans from more than one microcredit organization (MCO),
and 16 percent of borrowers in BiH reported being close to exceeding their repayment
capacity. Staffing and internal controls did not keep up with the rapid growth of the industry,
which led to a decline in monitoring quality, and new products were introduced without sound
borrower assessment tools and proper staff training. The Law on Microcredit Organizations
was passed in 2006, but came into effect only in mid-2008, when supervision was also
introduced. In between the adoption of the law and its full enforcement, industry players
continued their imprudent practices in advance of supervision controls. Weakening loan
portfolios, due to highly indebted borrowers amid a global crisis, resulted in net losses for the
sector in 2009 and a contraction in the number of MCOs. The decrease in portfolio was
followed by more restrictive credit policies, and the access to credit for the most vulnerable
population of BiH was affected (see Figure 16).

34.      The assets of the MCO sector have been declining from almost 5 percent of
financial system assets in 2008 to 2.6 percent in 2013 (see Figure 17). The number of
institutions has also consolidated, from 27 in 2008 to 19 in 2013. Performance has generally
improved since the crisis, with the overall sector showing positive income over expenses and
lower portfolio-at-risk (30 day) values (see Table 5). In the Federation, the deterioration of a
large MCF had affected the recent results of the sector.

35.     In general, MCOs and banks serve different targeted market segments. MCOs are
not allowed to accept deposits, but only to grant credit as well as provide advisory services to
microcredit beneficiaries. Loan sizes are smaller, with the average around BAM 2,500. The
maturity of loans in the MCO sector are also shorter term in nature (around 2 years), and the
interest rates are higher than banks (see Table 6 for weighted average effective interest rates
of the MCO sector). MCOs require less documentation from their loan clients compared to
banks, and use a different credit analysis process where loan officers often make field visits to
assess the creditworthiness of a borrower using a broader approach. Most microcredits are
provided to individuals, although there is still some group-lending done through “solidarity
groups” in “village banks” (e.g. in Mikra). Two of the MCFs have a gender-focus, with Mi Bospo
targeting women entrepreneurs and Mikra having women-only clientele.

36.      Microcredit organizations (MCOs) can be categorized into non-profit
organizations (microcredit foundations, MCFs) and for-profit (microcredit companies,
MCCs). MCOs are governed by the Law on Microcredit Organizations of the respective
entities, and supervised by the respective Banking Agencies. MCFs have a minimum capital
requirement of BAM 50,000 and are restricted to granting credit of up to BAM 10,000 per
client. MCCs have a minimum capital requirement of BAM 500,000 and can offer loans of up
to BAM 50,000 per client (see Table 7). MCOs registered in one entity can perform operations
in the other entity, although the playing field is not even due to the lack of alignment between
the MCO laws governing the two entities. The share of the MCO market by entity is shown in
Figure 18. The market composition in the two entities is very different, reflecting to a large
extent the differences in the legal basis of each entity when the current law on MCOs was
adopted. In the RS, MCOs operating under the former law had a choice to be incorporated as
MCFs or corporatize into MCCs; while in the Federation, all MCOs were obligated to first be
incorporated as MCFs. 16

   In BiH, the process of corporatization is known as “transformation”. Nevertheless, it is not “transformation”
as it is commonly known elsewhere – in BiH, it means the MCF’s investment in an MCC, and the MCF continues
to exist alongside the MCC. This Note uses the term “corporatization” to encapsulate a broader meaning, to
allow for the future possibility of complete transition from an MCF to an MCC (without the need for retaining
the MCF, if the institution so desires).

37.     The Federation MCO market is comprised of 12 MCFs and one MCC.17 The MCO
sector in the Federation has more than 171,600 borrowers who received credit equivalent to 4
percent of total credit extended in the banking sector. There are 286 MCO branches compared
to 576 for banks. Average weighted effective interest rates were 25.68 percent as of end-June
2014 (end-2013: 25.29 percent). Provision of credit is dominated by the MCFs, which supply
almost all the credit in the sector. The sole MCC is very small and was purchased by another
MCF in 2013.

38.      The RS market is dominated by one MCC, Mikrofin, which has 95 percent of the
assets of the sector in RS. The remaining players consist of two MCCs and three MCFs. In
total, there are more than 49,500 MCO borrowers (banks: 300,611) served across 73 branches
(banks: 387). Microcredit is 3 percent of total bank credit at the end of June 2014, and the bulk
of MCO loans are split almost evenly between micro loans (up to BAM 10,000), and loans
between BAM 10,000 and BAM 50,000. Almost all the loans are to individuals, including
craftsmen, with a large proportion going to the agriculture (43 percent) and services (10
percent) sectors, and non-purpose loans. Average weighted effective interest rates were 21.83
percent as at end-September 2014 (end-2013: 21.33 percent).

39.     The separate laws governing MCOs in the two entities are not aligned, which
creates an uneven playing field in the sector. As MCOs licensed in one entity can operate
in the other, differences in the legal and regulatory frameworks are creating grounds for unfair
competition. In the Federation, two parallel actions are recommended: i) strengthening the
supervisory powers of the Banking Agency, and ii) easing the process of corporatization for
MCFs. It is important that both actions be done concurrently, as both are needed to ensure a
balanced and prudent growth of the sector, as well as to protect vulnerable customers.

40.     The Federation Banking Agency (FBA) lacks a sufficient range of enforcement
powers for the MCO sector and it is recommended that this be strengthened. Currently,
the FBA is limited to the enforcement tools of issuing orders, or the severe action of revoking
licenses, with no intermediate actions available. Providing the FBA with a broader menu of
corrective actions will thus give it the necessary authority to regulate the market more
effectively, and contribute to the strengthening of the sector. It is recommended that the Law
on MCOs in FBiH be amended to include, among others, explicit powers to appoint advisors,
impose temporary administration, and remove or replace management and board members.
In the RS, the Banking Agency has broader and more nuanced enforcement options. The RS
Law on MCOs was amended in 2011 to strengthen the supervisory powers of the Banking
Agency, allowing it to undertake intermediate corrective measures such as appointing advisors,
appointing external administrators and suspending board members in the event of any
violations.

41.     An improved framework for appeals against FBA’s supervisory actions should be
considered. Past attempts of the FBA to impose remedial actions on MCOs have been at times
challenged with court cases through the Administrative Dispute process. After an appeal, the
Court can suspend the decision of the FBA. This adversely affects the effectiveness of FBA
supervision and undermines its authority. Suspension of the operation of the supervisory
actions can promote continuation and proliferation of unethical and unhealthy behavior by the
regulated entities (MCOs). Eventually, these could undermine the viability of the sector. The
provisions of appeals by MCOs should therefore be improved. The case of the MCF Prizma,
                                                 22


whose license was revoked in October 2014 and subsequently reinstated18, illustrates how the
gaps in the legal framework allowed it to continue operating its questionable practices (see
Box 2: Prizma).



 Box 2. Prizma

 The MCF Prizma had its license revoked in October 2014. As of end-June 2014, Prizma was the
 third largest MCO in FBiH, with BAM 65 million in assets and a gross portfolio of BAM 63 million.
 The FBA’s decision was challenged in court, which ruled in Prizma’s favor as at end-November
 2014, and Prizma’s license was reinstated.

 The litany of Prizma’s alleged misdoings was long: among others, it had failed to send audit
 reports on time, had qualified audit reports for several years, and irregular financial statements.
 Prizma had also failed to meet certain financial covenants such as write-off ratios and portfolio
 at risk (PAR) ratios, and its transaction accounts were blocked due to the inability to meet its
 obligations to creditors.

 The problems in Prizma had been brewing for several years. Upon the discovery of certain
 offences, the FBA had issued orders, but did not have any intermediate enforcement tools to
 issue corrective actions such as changing the board or installing temporary administrators. The
 orders on Prizma to stop the practices deemed unlawful were also challenged with court
 proceedings filed through the Administrative Dispute process. At the same time, Prizma filed a
 proposal to delay the execution of FBA’s orders, which was granted by the court. This effectively
 allowed Prizma to continue with the disputed activities. As the administrative dispute process is
 lengthy, the activities suspected to be fraudulent continued on for a few years. The gaps in the
 legal framework that allowed this to happen demonstrated how the continuation of suspicious
 activities could tarnish the reputation of the sector, and ultimately prove detrimental to
 borrowers and creditors.

 The revocation of Prizma’s license also revealed the lack of clarity regarding the liquidation
 process for MCFs. The termination of an MCF is not governed by the Law on Business Companies,
 as it is considered a foundation. The uncertainty regarding the return of creditors’ claims has in
 turn created concerns over the future funding for the rest of the sector.

42.     Providing the FBA with expanded enforcement powers could also prevent the
imposition of burdensome regulation on MCOs that are operating within the bounds of
the law. In their efforts to rein in the fraudulent activities of some MCOs, the FBA has relied
on heavy-handed regulation, e.g. the requirement of numerous borrower verifications, and
disallowing cash disbursements to borrowers. While these regulations are intended to prevent
fraud, they impose increased costs for the borrowers, and might reduce access for those who
cannot afford them or who live in areas where bank branches are not easily available.
Increasing the powers of the FBA to deal with the offending MCOs would thus release the rest
of the market to operate in a more conducive environment.


18
   Prizma challenged the FBA’s decision in court. As at end-November, the courts had ruled in
Prizma’s favor and its license was reinstated. Subsequently, Prizma sued the FBA for damages.
                                                     23


43.     In parallel, it is important to enable greater ease of corporatization for MCFs who
        19
seek it. Easing the transition from MCFs to MCCs in the Federation would help to strengthen
corporate governance, as companies are subject to the application of the Company Law which
provides better internal checks and balances. It is recommended that authorities amend Article
15 of the Law on MCOs to ease the corporatization of MCFs for those who seek it, as well as
resolve the issue of donated equity.20

44.    Besides stronger corporate governance of MCOs, corporatization could bring
about fairer competition, higher lending limits, clearer liquidation processes and a
broader range of funding. By leveling the playing field between entities, fairer competition
can be achieved. Furthermore, MCCs would be better able to serve the needs of clients
through higher lending limits. MCCs have clearer liquidation processes, as they are governed
under the Law on Business Companies. Corporatization will also enable MCOs to access a
broader range of funding, enabling expansion and growth.

45.     An important measure to ease corporatization is to remove the requirement for
MCFs to continue lending in parallel with the MCC under its ownership, as well as resolve
donated equity issues. Currently, the law in FBiH (Article 15 of the Law on MCOs) is
interpreted in such a manner that MCFs are required to continue their direct lending activities
even after the establishment of an MCC. International experience shows that the founding
non-profit foundation and newly established company might ultimately compete against each
other, generating difficult governance issues and conflicts of interest.21 Finally, authorities
need to resolve the issue of donated equity, in consultation with stakeholders. Currently,
equity contributed by donors is considered separately from the rest of the equity raised by the
MCFs. There are ambiguities related to the treatment of this donated equity, with regards to
when an MCF corporatizes or faces termination. The treatment of donated equity is an
impediment towards corporatization and should be resolved appropriately, including by
looking at models used in other countries and lessons learnt from international experience.

46.      Extensive identification requirements to fulfill the Anti-Money Laundering (AML)
Law risks excluding the poorest borrowers from the market. Based on the Law on
Prevention of Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorist Activities, the Banking Agencies
have issued guidance on risk assessments and the proportional Customer Due Diligence (CDD)
measures to be applied.22 The nature of the product, limits on thresholds, type of clients served
and lack of cross-border transactions would suggest low vulnerability to money laundering
and thus a simplified CDD for most of the clients in the MCO sector. Nevertheless, the
identification requirements for the simplified CDD still appear to be onerous, particularly the
requirement for proof of income. This could shut off access to the borrowers who do not have
a stable means of income, or sufficient records to prove ownership of assets, or sources of


19 Likely candidates who might be interested at present would be the two largest MCFs in the FBiH.
20 The path and model of corporatization as well as the resolution of the issue of donated equity is beyond
the scope of this Technical Note.
21 One example is of the Bolivian NGO PRODEM, which created the commercial bank BancoSol. The initial

arrangement of dividing the market resulted in a falling out between the two institutions. See Lauer (2008),
“Transforming NGO MFIs: Critical Ownership Issues to Consider”.
22
  CDD is classified as simplified, standard, and enhanced, corresponding to the low, medium and
high risk categories of risk assessment respectively.
                                               24


income (e.g. remittances received via informal channels, sales of excess agricultural produce
within the community, sub-letting of short- or long-term room or plots of land).          It is
recommended that authorities review the identification requirements for the simplified CDD
to ensure that an appropriate balance is achieved, as overly hefty requirements could raise
costs and undermine financial inclusion.

47.     In the RS, it is recommended to reconsider plans to impose interest rate
restrictions on the MCO sector. Interest rate restrictions could price out the least credit-
worthy from the formal market, and force them to turn to informal lenders which often lend at
much higher rates. Global evidence shows that attempts to control interest rates as a means
to lower spreads are almost always counter-productive. The best way to lower prices on
lending is through encouraging competition, better transparency and effective disclosure
regimes.     These could be achieved for example through strengthening disclosure
requirements, and facilitating better comparison of products and services for consumers (see
Section VI: Consumer Protection).

                                         C.     Leasing

48.      The leasing market in BiH is small and declining, and its viability is threatened.
As of November 2014, there are seven leasing companies in BiH (six headquartered in
Federation, one in RS), with many of the companies owned by the subsidiaries of foreign-
owned banks. Prior to the enactment of the Law on Leasing in 2008, the assets of leasing
companies had grown at a rapid clip, due to an expansion in activities that were akin to shadow
banking rather than “true” leasing (see Figure 21). While the regulation in the market was
necessary to prevent such activities, several factors discussed further below have stifled leasing
activity, threatening its long term viability. The assets of the leasing sector have continuously
declined from more than 6 percent of financial system assets in 2008 to 2.4 percent 2013 (see
Figure 22).



 Figure 21. Leasing volume                        Figure 22. Total assets of the leasing
                                                  sector




 Source: Authorities                              Source: Authorities
                                                25


49.     The majority of leasing in BiH is for vehicles (both passenger and commercial),
with some equipment leasing and very little real estate leasing. This is in part due to the
prohibition of the financing of construction activities by leasing companies after the enactment
of the Law on Leasing. Also, real estate leasing is unattractive for the lessee because a property
sales tax has to be paid at the beginning of the lease (when the asset is purchased), and at the
end of the leasing period (when the ownership of the asset is transferred to the lessee). This
real estate tax varies by municipality, and is around 5 percent of the asset value.

50.     The bulk of leasing is done through financial leasing. The supervision of operating
leasing within leasing companies puts them at a disadvantage compared to companies
providing similar services outside the scope of Banking Agency supervision. In recent years,
rental car companies have been renting out cars through longer term contracts (e.g. for 3 to 4
years, with insurance, gas, etc). The legal framework defining the business activities of
operational leasing needs to be revised to clarify the activities of operating leasing.

51.     The VAT treatment on financial leases puts it at a disadvantage to loans by banks.
VAT on financial leasing is paid up-front, on both the asset and the implied interest of the
whole lease. This makes leasing less attractive compared to loans, as banking products are
exempt of VAT on the same product. It is recommended to exempt the VAT on interest for
financial leases to make leasing on the same level playing field as other types of credit, and
stimulate the growth of this sector.

52.     The difficulty of repossessing leased assets is an additional, significant obstacle
hindering the growth of the market. If the lessee does not voluntarily return the asset in
the event of default, the lessor has to go through full court procedures. The efficiency of the
courts varies widely depending on the municipality, and courts face a high backlog of cases.
Furthermore, judges have little understanding about the sector. The execution process is
lengthy, and is further delayed if the lessee obstructs the process, e.g. by moving the asset to
different locations.

53.     Leasing companies are subject to an inconsistency in the interpretation of laws,
as well as differing treatment between the entities. Leasing companies claim that the
Indirect Tax Authority (ITA) is inconsistent in their opinions in the span of different inspections,
causing uncertainty in business processes, and at times, penalties on actions deemed
acceptable in past inspection opinions. Leasing companies are also subject to double direct
taxation, as well as double supervision fees from the two entities.

                                         D.    Factoring

54.      The factoring market is nascent in BiH. There is only one factoring company, Prvi
Faktor, which is foreign-owned. The bulk of the company’s clients are large corporates, and it
purchases receivables only with recourse. Very few banks have offered similar products, and
they are mostly loans secured by receivables. A draft law on factoring is being prepared in
FBiH, and it is recommended that the regulation of factoring should be decided upon only
after consideration of best international practices, particularly on ensuring a level playing field
for all market participants (see Box 3).

 Box 3: Regulating factoring
                                                        26



 One fundamental issue with factoring resides in recognizing the commercial status of the
 industry, which in turn determines the oversight structure. In some countries, factoring is
 recognized as a commercial activity and is, therefore, regulated by commercial law, but it is not
 unusual in certain countries to see factoring companies undertake the functions of financial
 intermediation without authorization.

 The regulatory environment has an important effect on the factoring industry. In some countries,
 factoring operates entirely outside the purview of any regulatory structure or authority, and in
 others it is regulated along with other financial services such as banking and insurance. In most
 countries, however, the level of regulation falls somewhere in between (Bakker, Klapper, and
 Udell 2004). For countries where factoring is developing, a law setting out minimum standards
 for the management of factoring companies and specifying the tools to be used to manage key
 risks in factoring operations could be envisaged.

  Some countries simply restrict market entry to formally registered financial institutions such as
 banks or other specialized financial institutions. However, those restrictions could hinder
 competition by excluding the emergence of independent factors.

                         IV.         LEGAL AND MARKET INFRASTRUCTURE

                                     A.     Credit Reporting Systems

55.     The Central Credit Registry (CCR) is a credit registry operated by the Central Bank
of BiH (CBBH). It is governed by the Decision on Central Registry of Credits of Legal Entities
and Physical Entities in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The registry for legal entities was operational
in May 2006, with the addition of physical persons in early 2007. The CRC is a structural division
of the Payment Systems department at the CBBH.

56.     Reporting to the CCR is mandatory for financial institutions supervised by the
Banking Agencies. It is a state-level registry, and collects data from all the banks, MCOs and
leasing companies in the country. Insurance companies report their information on a voluntary
basis. MCOs and leasing companies were obligated to report to the CCR only after they came
under the supervision purview of the Banking Agencies. Prior to that, MCOs were not
mandated to report to the CCR but could do so on a voluntary basis. MCO mandatory
reporting to the CCR was part of the response to the problem of over-indebtedness, which
was caused by the multiple borrowing of individuals and the lax lending policies in the MCO
sector.

57.      The CCR is deemed to fulfill its purpose well and is functioning effectively. Each
year, the CCR receives an average of two million queries. Data is updated on a daily basis, and
credit reports show current as well as historical information of up to five years. Both positive
and negative information is reported, with no minimum threshold for reporting. Borrower
identification is not an issue. Access to borrower information requires consent, and borrowers
                                               27


have means to correct errors in information, although the process of dealing with disputes and
complaints is not sufficiently clear. In general, data coverage and quality is good. Nevertheless,
the quality of data reported by organizations purchasing claims from financial institutions (e.g.
the transfer of non-performing loans), but which are not regulated by the Banking Agency,
could be further enhanced.

58.      There is a private credit bureau in operation, which focuses mainly on the credit
information of legal entities. The private credit bureau, LRC Credit Bureau (LRC) was set up
in 2000 as a limited liability company, and has voluntary membership. Aside from financial
institutions, it also collects information from non-financial creditors such as utility companies
and municipalities. The private credit bureau is required by law to seek the consent of
borrowers in the form of signed documents, and to keep these signed documents. Prior to
the introduction of this requirement, LRC had operated a credit database on physical persons.
The current operations are focused on the credit reporting of businesses, as well as credit-
scoring services, market analysis and debt collection.



                     B.     Insolvency and Creditor Rights’ Framework

59.      The basic rights governing creditor/debtor relationships and the procedures for
enforcing these rights enable parties to rely on contractual agreements, fostering
confidence that fuels investment, lending and commerce. An effective enabling
environment for debt recovery protects creditors’ rights and helps mitigate the risk of bank
exposure. This strengthens the credit environment and helps expand access to finance.
Conversely, uncertainty about the enforceability of contractual rights increases the cost of
credit to compensate for the increased risk of nonperformance or, in severe cases, leads to
credit tightening.

60.      In BiH, the registration of collateral is not an issue, but collateral enforcement is
difficult and lengthy due to the ineffectiveness of execution procedures. The creation of
security rights over both immovable and movable assets is not problematic. Bank loans are
usually secured, with real estate as the preferred form of collateral for banks and mortgages
as the security mechanism. While the legal framework over pledges for movable assets is
modern and largely sound, movable assets are not extensively used because the recovery of
such assets is difficult. Execution processes can be prolonged by debtors raising objections
and appeals. Furthermore, the courts face a high case backload, and inefficient case
management likely also contributes to aggravating the slow resolution of cases. Market players
report that execution procedures take on average over 4 years (and even longer in some
jurisdictions). In the case of movable assets, the depreciation of collateral value is significant
over such an extended timeframe. It is recommended to update the by-laws of the pledge
and regulatory framework to enable more effective recovery of assets, streamlining execution
procedures, and enhancing the capacity of the judges and court system.
                                                          28


     V.        GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND PROGRAMS RELATED TO FINANCIAL INCLUSION

61.      In general, BiH lacks a defined policy towards financial inclusion, with no strong
champion. Programs and policies for SMEs are mostly ad hoc and driven by different
ministries. Consideration should be given to develop and implement a financial inclusion
strategy, possibly as a component of a larger financial sector development strategy, providing
a framework for stakeholder coordination, prioritization, and sequencing of reforms and
actions.

Federation BiH

62.      There are 13 programs for SMEs in the FBiH. These include assistance for startup
companies and specific subsidy programs. Most of these programs are carried out through
different line ministries, including the Ministry of Development, Entrepreneurship and Crafts,
as well as the Ministry of Energy and Industry. The Ministry of Development and Industry has
a credit line channeled to end beneficiaries through Union Bank, a state-owned bank.

63.     The Federation Development Bank (FDB) has limited capacity and lacks a clear
strategy. The FDB was established in 2008 in accordance with the Law on Development Bank
of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and has an asset size of BAM 284 million.23 The
current loan portfolio funded from its own sources is around BAM 210 million, offered through
nine credit lines. The FBH also places a similar amount of loans on behalf of the government
through three credit lines. Loans placed are for project financing, and offer maturities of up to
10 years. The FDB is supervised by the Banking Agency under a special decree, but the Banking
Agency has no sanctioning power over the institution. Due to its constrained balance sheet,
the FDB plays a very limited role in supporting access to finance.

64.      The FBiH government has plans to establish a credit guarantee fund, though it is
hampered by capacity constraints. While the proposal has been in discussion for several
years, stronger interest has been rekindled recently due to the flood damage on the assets of
firms and households. There is also an export credit guarantee fund, the Investment Guarantee
Agency (IGA), which is facing problems in fulfilling its obligations. IGA suffered from a lack of
internal risk controls and management procedures, which led to large over-exposures of credit
risk.

65.      The FBiH government has established a fund in response to the floods, but it is
smaller than expected and lacks clarity in the allocation criteria. At the end of June 2014,
the FBiH government adopted a law establishing a fund to support the areas affected by the
floods. The purpose of the fund is to collect and distribute funds to assist the affected areas,
and finance and support the preparation, implementation and development of programs,
project and other activities aimed at revitalizing the affected areas. The fund includes
contributions from the government, government-owned companies, the Federation
Development Bank, citizens (though not mandatory)24 as well as the diaspora population. The
contributions to the fund have been smaller than envisaged by the government, and as of end-
October the fund size is BAM 9.6 million. There is lack of clarity surrounding the criteria of

23   www.rbfbih.ba
24   There is the ability to opt out from contributing.
                                                   29


allocation of the funds – municipalities are responsible for the allocation as well as decisions
on targeted beneficiaries.

Republika Srpska

66.     In the RS, the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Mining is the primary ministry
responsible for the development of SMEs and entrepreneurship. A new strategy has been
developed, which includes support to competitiveness, promotion of SMEs and strengthening
of the business environment; however the implementation is yet to take place. The Republic
Agency for the Development of Small and Medium Enterprises, as well as local development
agencies in the municipalities run several programs to provide non-financial technical support
to SMEs, including education and consulting services.

67.     RS government financial support to SMEs is directed through the Republic of
Srpska Investment-Development Bank (IRBRS). The IRBRS is a major player in the financial
sector, with BAM 2.25 billion in assets.25 Aside from the government funding, the IRBRS also
channels credit lines from international financial institutions. IRBRS offers a range of credit
lines intermediated through the commercial banks, including those supporting SMEs,
microbusiness in agriculture, startup activities and war veterans. Some of these credit lines
offer beneficiaries capped interest rates at low levels. The IRBRS also places loans (of maximum
size BAM 5 million per loan) directly on behalf of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water
Management. The list of potential beneficiaries of these loans is defined by the Ministry, and
the Government of RS makes the final decision after the credit analysis of the IRBRS and
opinion of the Ministry.

68.       A credit guarantee fund has been established in RS but banks have shown little
interest in utilizing it. The guarantee fund started operations in 2011, and current active
guarantees total BAM 20 million.26 The coverage ratio is up to 50 percent of the loan, and the
guarantee fund proportionally shares the collateral with the banks. Commercial banks showed
disinterest in utilizing the credit guarantee fund, citing complicated procedures, the inability
to determine the terms of the loan, and uncertainty in the event of collateral enforcement.
Consideration should be given in improving the design of the credit guarantee scheme. Best
practices include building attractiveness while ensuring additionality through well designed
eligibility criteria, proper coverage ratio and fees, sound risk management, and efficient
operational procedures.27

69.     The RS government has taken several measures related to the floods, including
establishing a Solidarity Fund, and allowing for certain tax and fee exemptions. The
Solidarity Fund includes funding from the government, as well as mandatory contributions
from the citizens collected for a year up to the end of May 2015. The fund size is expected to
be BAM 80 million and provides vouchers of up to BAM 5,000 for affected households. The
vouchers are given in the form of electronic payment cards, which can be used through POS
terminals with certain designated stores. The RS government is also postponing tax obligation

payments of affected companies for up to five years without interest. Affected companies are
also exempted from certain fees (e.g. special fee for performing business activities, fee for use
of natural resources), as well as real estate tax in certain locales. The IRBRS has also extended
the repayment and grace periods for affected companies using its credit lines.




                VI.        CONSUMER PROTECTION AND FINANCIAL LITERACY

70.      The Consumer Protection Act of 2005 covers the protection of all manners of
consumer products and services at the State level including those provided by the
financial sector. While the Act includes some aspects of the EU Directives on Consumer Credit
2008, it only broadly and unclearly defines the consumer credit giving room to the entities to
form their own legal frameworks on consumer protection in the financial sector. Under this
Act, the Consumer Protection Council and the State-level Ombudsman institution have been
established as key institutions at State level but both have limited institutional capacity to focus
on financial sector issues.

71.     The financial sector consumer protection framework has been significantly
enhanced in recent years in BiH. The amendments to the Laws on Banking Agency in both
the RS and FBiH placed the responsibility for the regulation and supervision of consumer
protection in the banking, microfinance and leasing sectors to the respective Banking Agencies.
Even for the branches of financial institutions that do not have headquarters in their territories,
both Banking Agencies are authorized to initiate onsite inspections within the context of
consumer protection.

72.     RS has adopted additional consumer protection regulations within the existing
framework of financial legislation in 2011. With the amendments to the Law on Banks28, RS
introduced mandatory disclosure elements for financial services provided to individuals
broadly in line with EU Consumer Credit Directive. Among these elements are: the effective
interest rate (EIR), references or indices used for variable interest rate calculations, fees, terms
and manner of early withdrawal/repayment, beneficiary’s rights to renouncement, and
protection procedures. The indexation of variable interest rates and the disclosure of its
calculation are particularly important as these were the main areas of complaints prior to the
amendments.

73.     Along with disclosure requirements, the introduction of an independent banking
system ombudsman office29 yielded successful results in RS. An independent ombudsman
office has been established under the RS Banking Agency in 2011 in order to improve the out-
of-court dispute settlement mechanism between financial institutions and individuals. In 2012
and 2013, the ombudsman office received around 212 complaints30 and 93 of those were
solved in favor of the beneficiaries. Most of the complaints were related to disputes before the



28 In addition to the Law on Banks, the Law on Micro-Credit Organizations and the Law on Leasing has also
been improved in compliance with EU Directives.
29 This covers the microcredit and leasing sectors in addition to the banking sector.

30 Excluding the ill-founded complaints and well-founded complaints withdrawn after submission.
                                                31


adoption of amendments to the Law on Banks on consumer protection, with 90 percent of
complaints on banks and 70 percent related to loan operations.

74.     In the Federation, a Law on Protection of Users of Financial Services has been
enacted in November 2014 and is an important step towards improving the financial
consumer protection framework. The law includes most of the elements of the EU Consumer
Credit Directive, including providing information in the negotiations phase, the disclosure of
annual effective interest rates, uniform calculation methodologies for effective interest rates
and variable interest rates, and the introduction of a cooling off-period. Meanwhile, an
ombudsman department established in the FBiH by amendments to the Law on Banking
Agency of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2012 (“Official Gazette of the FBiH”,
No. 77/12) has started operating in April 2014. As of September 2014, the Ombudsman has
received over 100 complaints but most of them were ill-founded and none were taken to the
mediation stage. Variable interest rate calculations, fees and repayment obligations of
guarantors were among the areas receiving the most complaints. While the authorities are to
be commended for these steps, more time is needed for an in-depth assessment of their real
impact on financial consumer protection.

75.      The Law on Protection of Guarantors was adopted in FBiH in November 2013. As
more and more borrowers have failed to repay their loans following the global financial crisis,
guarantors came under severe pressure. In response to this, the government of FBiH adopted
a new law that includes a subset of disclosure requirements in the Law on Protection of Users
of Financial Services as well as the passing of the Law on Protection of Guarantors introducing
stringent requirements such as the right to safety of the guarantor, in cases when the creditors
fail to undertake all legal measures to check the primary borrower. The response of the financial
sector to this regulatory change was to use co-debtors instead of guarantors, or to require
loan insurance from the borrowers. The impacts of these developments on consumer
protection and access to finance are yet to be seen. Thus, it is recommended to conduct an
assessment of the law within a year after its adoption.

76.      Despite improvements in the financial sector consumer protection framework,
improvement is needed on the disclosure regimes and dispute settlement mechanism in
BiH. It is recommended that transparency and disclosure of information in the banking and
MCO sectors should be improved by

               Aligning the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) calculation methodology with EU
                standards to ensure comparability,

               Developing a standard Key Facts Statement31 to help consumers understand
                the essential conditions of their contracts,



31
  “Key facts statement” summarizes in plain language on 1 -2 pages the key terms and conditions
of the contract for any financial product or service. The key facts statement would neither replace
nor be a part of the terms and conditions for a financial product or service, but would be required
to be given to the consumer to help him or her understand every essential term and condition.
Such statement should clearly indicate all fees and charges related to a financial contract or
product, as well as the mechanisms for recourse available to the consumer in the event of a
                                                  32


                Publishing a tariff comparison table for banks and MCOs on a public sector-
                 operated website e.g. website of the Banking Agencies or Banking
                 Ombudsmen (which could also lower the interest rates by increasing the
                 competitiveness in the market).32 The tariff comparisons would be based on
                 standardized products.

In addition, the dispute settlement mechanism could be strengthened further by enabling the
ombudsmen to give binding decisions for complaints on transactions below a certain small
amount.33

77.      A greatly expanded code of conduct, or consumer protection code, could help to
improve the practices of commercial banks vis-à-vis their retail customers in both
entities. While a code of conduct has already been developed by the Banks’ Association and
AMFI, this code is not well-known, even to members of the associations. The value of any code
of conduct is its widespread distribution so that consumers know that in principle, financial
institutions commit themselves to provide minimum service standards and to respond to
individual consumer’s complaints and disputes. The code of conduct should be placed in all
bank and MCO branches, and on their respective websites. Consumers should be advised that
if a bank or MCO fails to comply with the code of conduct, a complaint can be submitted to
the institution, the relevant Association, and the Banking Agency.

78.     In general, financial knowledge of BiH citizens is low and the number of financial
education initiatives is limited. The World Bank funded a Financial Literacy Survey in mid-
2011, based on a random, nation-wide sample of citizens of BiH aged 18 or older. The Survey
showed that the general financial knowledge of BiH citizens was low, as indicated by the
average score of about 5.5 correct answers out of 13. There are some isolated measures
undertaken by government agencies and consumer organizations, as well as certain financial
and private institutions. However, there is no coordination of activities or a national strategy
on financial education.

79.      The development and implementation of a financial education strategy or
program is recommended. There is a significant need for a comprehensive, nationwide
financial education strategy taking into account the issues related to financial planning and
customer rights. It is recommended that a Task Force or Steering Committee be established,
potentially comprising the financial regulators, CBBH and other stakeholders in the financial
sector, to bring together various ongoing and planned initiatives into a coordinated program
that has resources, among others, to extend to women and bottom-40 income earners. Also,




complaint. Examples of key facts statements include the EU’s Standard European Consumer Credit
Information, the US’ Schumer Box for credit cards and Peru’s Hoja Resumen (Summary Sheet).
32 Such comparison tables exist on both privately-run and publicly-operated websites, yet they are not
updated frequently and not known by most of the population. Some examples can be found at:

ANNEX I
Partial Credit Guarantee Funds: the Case of FOGAPE
FOGAPE is a guarantee system in Chile that allows SMEs to overcome their lack of collateral
or require longer maturities. It is a public fund managed by Banco Estado (a government agency)
that provides partial credit guarantees to working capital loans or investment loans provided by
commercial banks to SMEs. Its design includes several features to reduce moral hazard problems:
partial credit guarantees that force banks to share part of the risk, a bidding process that determines
how risks are shared among FOGAPE and financial intermediaries, the exclusion of banks with high
default rates on guaranteed loans from future bidding processes, and limits on the guarantees that
each bank can obtain from FOGAPE.

                                    - Fee varies by FI, depending on loss (claim) rate
                                    - Loss rates (default) less than 2%
                                    - FIs keep responsibility for analysis and collection



Larraín and Quiroz (2006) investigated the impact of the fund. Their findings indicate that FOGAPE
achieved not only credit additionality but also economic additionality. It appears that customers of
FOGAPE are 14 percent more likely to get a loan than non-customers. The scheme appears to have
contributed to an increase in the volume of credit by 40 percent; turnover in the companies
benefiting from the fund increased by 6 percent. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the study
only looked at loans made in larger cities. There are still some questions about the impact of
FOGAPE in rural areas.
