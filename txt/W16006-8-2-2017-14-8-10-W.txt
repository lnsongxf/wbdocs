T
         his paper considers some of the economic implications of climate change scenarios as described in
         the  Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). By comparing potential water demand with estimates of
          sustainable) water availability in different regions, it identifies regions whose future economic growth
         (­
potential is likely to be constrained by the scarcity of water resources. The paper assesses the macroeconomic
impact of water scarcity under alternative allocation rules, finding that constrained regions can effectively
­                related climate risks and adapt to a changing water environment by assigning more water to
neutralize water-­
sectors in which it has a higher value, shifting production to less water-intensive sectors, and importing
more  water-intensive goods. However, this adaptation effort is likely to imply some radical changes in water
management policies.

       Box 1.   A Brief Description of the GTAP Model


       The Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) is an international network that builds, updates, and distributes
       a comprehensive and detailed database of trade transactions among different industries and regions in the
       world, framed as a Social Accounting Matrix (SAM). The SAM is typically used to calibrate parameters for a
       Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model. The GTAP database is accompanied by a relatively standard
       CGE model and its software. The model structure is quite complex and is fully described in Hertel and Tsigas
       (1997). For brevity, summaries of the meaning of the main equations of the model are presented, and a
       graphical representation of income flows in the model is shown in figure B1.1.

Simulating the Macroeconomic Impact of Future Water Scarcity                                                                              11

     Equation and identities in the model include the following conditions:

     Production of industry i in region r equals intermediate domestic consumption, final demand (private
     consumption, public consumption, demand for investment goods), and exports to all other regions.

     •	 Endowments of primary factors (such as labor and capital) matches demand from domestic industries.

     •	 Unit prices for goods and services equals average production costs, including taxes.

     •	 Representative firms in each regional industry allocate factors on the basis of cost minimization.

     •	 Available national income equals returns on primary factors owned by domestic agents.

     •	 National income is allocated to private consumption, public consumption, and savings.

     •	 Savings are virtually pooled by a world bank and redistributed as regional investments, on the basis of
       expected future returns on capital;

     •	 The structure of private consumption is set on the basis of utility maximization under the budget
       constraint.

     •	 Intermediate and final demand are split according to the source of production: first between domestic
       production and imports, and then the imports among the various trading partners. Allocation is based on
       relative market prices, including transportation, distribution, and tax margins. Goods in the same industry
       but produced in different places are regarded as imperfect substitutes.

     •	 There is perfect domestic mobility for labor and capital (single regional price), but no international
       mobility.

     •	 There is imperfect domestic mobility for land (industry-specific price), but no international mobility. Land
       allocation is driven by relative returns.

     From a mathematical point of view, the model is a very large nonlinear system of equations. Structural
     parameters are set so that the model replicates observational data in a base year. Simulations entail
     changing some exogenous variables or parameters, bringing about the determination of a counterfactual
     equilibrium. The partition between endogenous and exogenous variables, as well as the regional and
     industrial disaggregation level, is not fixed but depends on the scope of the simulation exercise.
