2	   IFC Guide for Investors in Private Health Care in Emerging Markets
Foreword


Always present in every health care system, the contribution of the private health sector
has grown rapidly in emerging markets, in particular over the last two decades. Although
it remains fragmented, rapid consolidation has occurred in recent years, resulting in the
emergence of a more corporate health care sector in many countries. Investors and financial
institutions—which should constitute the major financing sources for the health sector—
often have limited knowledge of the opportunities and risks pertinent to the sector. As a
result, health care organizations, particularly small and medium enterprises, have limited
access to financing to expand and improve their operations.
The Guide for Investors in Private Health Care in Emerging Markets shares our understanding
of this market opportunity. It also consolidates the lessons IFC and its partners have learned
about providing financing to the health sector, and discusses success factors in entering the
market and growing sustainable and impactful activities. This guide can be used by investors
and financial institutions that are considering entering this growth market for the first time
or by those that want to formalize and expand their health sector investment strategy. I hope
that it will stimulate higher levels of interest and investment in this important sector.
IFC is the largest multilateral investor in private health care in emerging and developing economies. Since 2002, we have
provided more than US$1 billion of mainly debt and equity financing to over 80 projects in more than 30 countries. This
support has enabled over $3 billion of investment in the private health sector. We are proud of our leadership role in financing
socially responsible private health care in emerging economies.

Introduction
The private health sector is growing rapidly in emerging market countries. Across the developing world, people increasingly
rely on private health care organizations to address their health needs. This trend will continue due to the fundamentals that
drive demand – population growth, increasing life expectancy, growing disease burdens, and patients’ demand for treatment.
As a result the private health sector in emerging markets can offer attractive returns to investors – from both commercial and
social perspectives.
The sector is not without its challenges. Consequently, financial institutions, that often are unfamiliar with its characteristics
and dynamics, perceive it as risky. As a result, many private health care organizations in developing countries, particularly
small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), remain underfinanced and constrained from achieving their full potential.
The Guide for Investors in Private Health Care in Emerging Markets is intended primarily for potential investors and financiers,
such as commercial banks, investment funds, microfinance institutions (MFIs), leasing companies, and other types of financial
institutions. Reflecting the typical profile of the sector, the guide focuses mainly on health care SMEs. It aims to reveal
potential market opportunities, to promote understanding of the most common business models, and to assist investors in
how to identify opportunities and evaluate potential projects. It also discusses the most common risks and barriers that face
investors in the sector as well as ways to manage these risks and overcome barriers.
In order to achieve these aims, the guide makes extensive use of practical case studies which draw from real-life experiences.
Other sources of relevant information, including sector data and website resources, are included in the annexes.
IFC hopes, by sharing this relevant market intelligence and key insights and experience, to encourage greater investment in this
important sector.

      outlines factors to determine the private health sector’s scale and viability in a given country so that investors may identify the
      risks and take advantage of opportunities in this rapidly growing and capital-intensive sector.

     Case Study on Managing Portfolio Risk through High-Performing Health-Sector Loans in Romania
     Four financial institutions in Romania expanded into the health sector and quickly experienced its risk-mitigation effect
     on their overall portfolios. These institutions received technical assistance from the United States Agency for International
     Development (USAID)-funded Banking on Health project that paved their entry to this market, including supplying market
     research on the needs of private health facilities and advice on tailoring their financial products. Between 2007 and 2008,
     the cumulative loan portfolio of these institutions grew from $19 million to more than $195 million. When the global
     financial crisis hit Romania in late 2008, these health portfolios helped the institutions to survive the downturn. Health care
     facilities have relatively constant demand for their services and are not reliant on external markets, which can make them
     relatively stable borrowers. When there is a dip in the economy, people may lose their health insurance and they have
     less to spend on health care. Yet there is a tendency for the sector to be more resilient than other sectors. Consequently
     borrowers in the health field in Romania continued to make repayments when most other sectors, from export-led
     businesses to real estate, faltered. 25

          Investing in the Health Care Market
          An Interview with Guy Ellena, Director, Health and Education Department, IFC

          Why do you think banks and investors should consider entering the health care market?
          It is a good business proposition. The private health sector is growing fast as a result of innovations, population growth,
          epidemiological changes, and reform to name a few drivers. And health care is showing a strong resilience during the
          economic downturn, particularly in emerging markets. People spend money on health. We are seeing the emergence of
          stronger health care businesses that are better run with deeper management capacity. We believe that the growth of the
          sector is a stable long-term equation.

          Are there specific factors that you think are necessary for a successful health-sector investment?
          The health care market is different and financial institutions need to be able to adapt to it. It’s a longer-term investment.
          Banks need to be able to offer longer-term products to meet the financing needs of this sector and investors need longer
          investment horizons. Financial institutions should consider hiring specialized staff that understands the health care market.
          Size matters. Consider the size of the market in your country and how the private health sector is segmented between
          large, medium, and small enterprises. Many health care businesses are relatively small and structured around professionals,
          like doctors and pharmacists. Look for local businesses with a solid track record, that present a good case, strong financials,
          and better-than-average governance and management structures.

          How has IFC invested in the health care market?
          IFC is the largest multilateral investor in the private health sector worldwide. Since 2003 we have provided more than
          $1 billion of financial support (primarily debt and equity financing) to more than 80 projects in 30 countries. We have not
          had a non-performing loan since 2004. Last year we launched the Health in Africa Initiative, which is mobilizing $1 billion
          over the next five years in investment and advisory services for the health sector in Africa. Our investments in the health
          sector are wide-ranging. We have financed the expansion of most of the leading health care companies across emerging
          markets – for example, we recently approved a $50 million financing package to India’s Apollo Hospitals Enterprises that
          will expand a network of hospitals to less-developed population centers. And we have also supported smaller frontier
          businesses – for example, we financed the expansion of a small hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan and we have supported
          three hospitals (and a medical training college) in Yemen. We also provide indirect support through loans to local banks,
          including in Romania and Brazil, that are lending to health care SMEs. Our aim is to support sustainable and commercially
          viable health care organizations that also make a positive contribution to their societies. We are proud of our record in both
          of these regards.

      many health care businesses have collateral. For example, in
      Romania a survey of family doctors indicated that 74 percent
      of them would be able to offer a guarantee or collateral to
      secure a loan.27 Smaller-scale practices, particularly those
      owned by other types of health care professionals (such as
      midwives or nurses), may not have land or property but can
      offer equipment or personal guarantees. For example, of the
      53 percent of surveyed midwives in the Philippines that can
      provide security on a loan, only 30 percent can offer land or
      a building.28
      Financial institutions also express concerns about the type of
      collateral that health care service businesses offer, citing the
      political risk of seizing a hospital or clinic if a loan goes into
      default and the lack of a secondary market for specialized
      medical equipment. In fact in many countries the market
      for used medical equipment is growing and in some cases
      medical equipment suppliers have signed agreements with
      banks to buy back medical equipment. Refer to the case
      study from Uganda on a medical equipment buy-back
      guarantee. Owners of health care businesses often have
      personal assets that can be used to supplement collateral
      requirements as well. Figure 15 is a summary of the Five Cs

      Referrals or References from Provider Associations
      A health care business’ membership in a provider or
      industry association can give investors a measure of comfort,
      particularly if the association has the capacity to censure
      members. Investors may request a letter of reference from an
      association as part of the credit-appraisal process.

      Customized Credit Analysis for the Health Sector
      Investors are encouraged to tailor credit analysis and
      requirements for the health sector, which can lower the cost
      of analyzing health care businesses and help loan officers
      make appraisals. Customized credit analysis is most often a
      function of the health-sector financial products. Figure 17
      is a customizable template for the credit analysis of a
      small- or medium-sized health care facility.29 This template
      complements an investor’s research, which should include
      financial analysis of an organization’s ability to repay a loan
      or make a return on an equity investment. (See Annex 4 for a
      sample hospital project screening tool.)

      One of the features of health service providers in many
      countries is the prevalence of informal and/or unreported
      income. This is particularly prevalent, although not confined
      to, smaller businesses. This issue clearly presents a major
      challenge to potential investors as
      • it is difficult to ascertain true current earnings and earning 	
      	 potential based on financial statements (if these exist)
      • there is a risk that future earnings may be undeclared, thus 	
      	 imperiling direct investors’ equity
      • businesses and individuals that do not properly declare 	 	
      	 income to tax authorities are at risk of fines and other 		
      	 penalties
      29	 IFC defines a small- and medium-sized business as one that must meet at least two of three characteristics: to be considered small, a business must have fewer than 50 employees, $3 million in assets, and $3 million in 		
      	    annual sales; to be medium, it must have between 50 and 300 employees, $3 million and $15 million in assets, and $3 million and $15 million in annual sales. The loan size proxy for a small business is less than $100,000 		
      	    and less than $1 million ($2 million in some advanced countries) for a medium-sized business.

      Banca Transilvania, a commercial bank in Romania, has made a significant investment in the health sector in recent years,
      successfully employing most of the market- and credit-analysis techniques described in this guide.

Marketing Techniques for the Health Sector
From its inception Banca Transilvania’s health care division
had the objective to offer the best overall service to the health
sector, focusing on product delivery and communications.
Consequently its management decided on a unique strategy
for staffing the division: initially loan officers worked in
pairs, one with a financial background was matched with
one from a health-sector background. This approach enabled
them to speak their clients’ language, understand their
needs, evaluate the quality of the practices, and identify and
meet financing needs. The strategy evolved and the health
staff became roving specialists who worked with a group of
loan officers as advisors. The photo shows a team of Banca
Transilvania health-sector lenders at the Romania Medical
Exhibition in 2008.

Customized Credit Analysis
Banca Transilvania’s market analysis determined that certain
types of practices could be expected to have income in a
predicable range. Using these findings the bank developed
a standardized credit-analysis technique for each subsector
in the health care market. For example, specialist physicians
with an established practice could take a loan up to a
predetermined amount without collateral depending on their
specialty. If collateral was offered, a higher amount could be
approved with extended terms, depending on the purpose
of the loan. The data input sheet Banca Transilvania’s loan
officers used is in Figure 20.

      ensuing economic challenges in the country.

Key Success Factors and Common
Pitfalls for Health Care Businesses
Overview
Previous sections of this guide provide investors with tools for analyzing health-sector investment opportunities. This section
deepens investor’s knowledge of the sector by presenting key elements of different types of health care businesses, including
hospitals, clinics, laboratory and diagnostic facilities, pharmaceutical retailers and distributors, and medical education and
training institutes. Each is characterized by distinct factors to consider when appraising credit and investment worthiness. A
discussion follows of success factors and common mistakes that investors see in financing requests from each of these types of
businesses. The box on this page describes one banker’s experience with health-sector borrowers in Uganda.

emerging from developing countries; these include Al Borg

Diagnostic facilities depend on equipment that can be
expensive and may be difficult to service, particularly

      specialize in health) may work well in larger markets at a
      national or regional level or when combined with exclusive

      Common pitfalls: It may be difficult to hire and retain
      qualified staff, depending on the market, and pharmacies
      may rely too much on the main pharmacist. Many
      pharmacies can struggle with getting reliable and steady
      supplies of stock. Counterfeit and substandard drugs are
      a major problem in many developing countries. While
      there is no reliable accounting of the amount of fake drugs
      in circulation, according to some estimates they account
      for between 10 and 50 percent of supply in some areas.
      Infrastructure and facilities should be adequate for safe
      storage and distribution for distribution platforms.

      Medical Education and Clinical Training Institutes
      Key elements for analysis: The number of students
      multiplied by the cost of tuition typically determines the
      revenue for medical and nursing education facilities. As well
      as enrollment numbers, the student dropout rate is another
      factor that should be considered when evaluating revenue
      projections. Most education facilities charge tuition once or
      twice a year, and this clearly impacts cash flow. Education
      institutes must be able to provide students with practical
      medical training and often are affiliated with hospitals.
      Typically, major expenses for medical and nursing education
      institutes include staffing costs and room and board, if
      they are provided. Private medical schools tend to be much
      more difficult to establish than nursing schools because they
      require higher startup costs and are more heavily regulated.

Moving Forward


The private health care markets in emerging and developing
economies worldwide are increasingly stable and growing—
and also largely underfinanced. Commercial banks and large
private equity firms have begun to make notable forays into
the health sector on several continents.
Investors can position themselves to enter the market by
recognizing key success factors and managing risk through
market research, development of appropriate products, and
sound credit analysis and structuring. This high-growth,
capital intensive market for commercial financing can provide
investors with stable cash flows, healthy profitability, and a
more resilient portfolio in times of economic volatility.
                                                                      Market research is an important tool for understanding

      Annex 5: Financial Ratios, Metrics, and Definitions33

      Asset turnover ratio: Calculates the total revenue for every dollar of assets a company owns. It is calculated by dividing total
      revenue by average assets for the period.

      Current ratio: A liquidity ratio that measures a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It is calculated as current
      assets/current liabilities.

      Debt/EBITDA: Measures a debt’s pay-back period. The longer the payback period the larger the risk.

      Debt/Equity ratio: A measure of a company’s financial leverage calculated by dividing its total debt by total equity. It indicates
      what proportion of equity and debt the company is using to finance its assets.

      Debt service coverage: It is the amount of cash flow available to meet annual principal and interest payments on debt.

      EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization): Shows a company’s profitability, but not its cash
      flow.

      EBITDA margin: Refers to EBITDA divided by total revenue. It measures the extent to which cash operating expenses use up
      revenue.

      Gross margin: Assess a firm’s financial health by indicating the proportion of money left over from revenues after accounting
      for the cost of goods sold. The gross profit margin serves as the source for paying additional expenses and future savings. Gross
      margin = (revenue − cost of goods sold)/revenue.

      Net margin: The ratio of net profits to revenues for a company. It shows how much of each dollar the company earns is
      translated into profits. It is calculated by dividing net profit by revenue.

      Return on assets: Calculated by dividing annual earnings by total assets. It indicates how efficient management is at using its
      assets to generate earnings.

      Return on equity: Measures the amount of net income returned as a percentage of shareholders’ equity. It is calculated by
      dividing net income by shareholder’s equity.

      Annex 7: IFC Code of Conduct for Health Care Organizations
      PURPOSE
      To establish a culture of openness, trust and integrity in business practices. This document will serve to guide behavior to
      ensure ethical conduct based on the values of the International Finance Corporation (IFC).

      POLICY
      Organizations receiving funds from the IFC are expected to maintain high standards of professional and business integrity,
      to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, deter wrongdoing and to avoid situations and behaviors that could
      reasonably be foreseen to reflect negatively on the integrity or reputation of IFC.

      Prior to financing agreements, officers of the organization are to receive this document and are required to execute a Code
      of Conduct Statement. This statement will indicate that the document has been read and understood, that the organization
      will conduct business to the expectations outlined, that prohibited conduct will be avoided, and any relevant conflicts will be
      disclosed.

      The intent of these guidelines is not to attempt to foresee or define each situation that does or might involve a breach in ethics.
      The intent is rather to focus on situations that are viewed as likely to pose actual or potential concerns or to reflect negatively
      on the integrity or reputation of IFC. The intent is also to focus on IFC’s expectation that, in questionable or unforeseen
      situations, timely disclosure will facilitate satisfactory resolution before any such situation becomes problematic.

      During and, as applicable, subsequent to the agreement with IFC, the following issues shall be disclosed and avoided or
      managed as appropriate:

      1.	 Compliance with laws and regulations
          The organization will ensure all activity by or on behalf of the organization is in compliance with applicable laws and
          regulations.

      2.	 Adherence to ethical standards
          Organizations will accurately and honestly represent their services and will not engage in any activity intended to defraud
          any individual or organization of money, property or honest services.

      3.	 Client focus
          The organization has the responsibility to ensure that there are no compromises in delivering the highest standard of services
          and that every aspect of their operations promotes and reflects these standards. No one is to take unfair advantage of anyone
          through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information or misrepresentation of material facts.

      4.	 Non-discrimination
          Discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, nationality, age or disability is not tolerated.

      5.	 Confidentiality
          The organization shall maintain the confidentiality of clients and that of their service users and other confidential
          information in accordance with applicable legal and ethical standards.

      6.	 Records
          All organizational records, documents and reports must be accurate, complete, and un-tampered.

      7.	 Avoidance of conflicts of interest
          Executives, managers, employees, and Board members owe a duty of loyalty to the organization. Persons holding such
          positions may not use their positions to profit personally or to assist others in profiting in any way at the expense of the
          organization.

8.	 Business relationships
    Business transactions with vendors, contractors and other third parties shall be transacted appropriately, without offers,
    solicitation or acceptance of gifts and favors or other improper inducements in exchange for influence or assistance in a
    transaction. Business activities must be conducted on the basis of fair competitive practices. All purchases of services and
    supplies must be from qualified and reliable sources and be based upon objective factors, consistent with the organization’s
    policies and procedures.

9.	 Occupational safety
    The organization abides by all laws and regulations regarding occupational safety. This requires an active participation
    in maintaining a safe working environment and includes observance of established safety procedures and making
    recommendations for changes where they are needed.

10.	Organ donation and transplant
    The organization complies with the WHO Guiding Principles on Human Organ Transplantation.
    Organ retrieval from living persons is not undertaken where there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the donation is
    coerced or that a financial consideration is expected by the donor.
    The organization permits the allocation of organs on the basis of morally relevant criteria only.
    Transplantation is prohibited when the chance of success is insufficient to justify the risks.
    The buying and selling of organs are not performed or condoned by the organization.
    The harvesting of organs without prior consent from dead patients (or their legal representative) is not performed or
    condoned by the organization.

11.	Clinical research
    The organization has a committee or other mechanism to oversee all research within the organization. Any person enrolled
    in clinical research is fully informed of the risks and benefits and their right to refuse to participate or drop out of the
    activity without risk of reprisal.

12.	Gender selection
    Sex selection, by selectively terminating a pregnancy for non-medical reasons, is not performed or condoned. This
    encompasses a number of related practices, including pregnancy ultrasound scanning, where there are reasonable grounds
    to suspect a risk of termination of pregnancy dependent upon the determined sex of the embryo.

13.	Assisted reproductive technologies
    Interventions of human procreative processes [e.g. invitro fertilization (IVF), gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT),
    artificial insemination by donor (AID)] are carried out with due consideration to issues including donor confidentiality,
    parental age limits, same sex couples, ownership of donated sperm/eggs, multiple embryo transfer and genetic testing. All
    such procedures are carried out within the laws and regulations of the country.
    Exploitation of clients seeking reproductive assistance (e.g. non-required testing procedures or procedures unlikely to yield
    results), or of egg donors is prohibited.
    Harvesting of stem cells must be done with the express permission of the donor under the laws and regulations of the
    country.

14.	Female genital mutilation
    Female circumcision is not performed or condoned by the organization.
