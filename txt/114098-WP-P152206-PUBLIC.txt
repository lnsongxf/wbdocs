The Future
of Big Data
in Agriculture
                                                                         The Future of Big Data in Agriculture




Data Driven, Cost-Effective Climate Insurance
 Data Source: Sensors, Cameras                                          Stakeholders: Farmers, Businesses

In developed economies all around the world, commercial farmers are turning to the use of a combination of sensors, cameras
and probes to generate data and analytics for optimized risk management and cost effective selection of crop insurance. As an
example, the Climate Corporation, recently acquired by the Monsanto Company as part of their Big Data and Analytics offerings
suite, utilizes field sensors to collect crop yield, soil quality, and weather pattern data, along with farmer reported inputs, to help
commercial operations make the best decisions with regards to choosing crop insurance. The technology and data analytics suite
quantifies risk factors and combines historical data with predictive intelligence in order to suggest best practices that can mitigate
specific risk elements. The platform is currently geared to benefit large-scale operations and requires significant investment in
setting up the data collection infrastructure. However, as developing countries leapfrog established technology in favor of cost-
effective alternatives (e.g. replacing costly sensor equipment with low cost cameras and software) more and more farmers will be
able to incorporate smarter techniques for managing agricultural risks and insuring risks to their livelihood.

Mapping with Drones to Feed the World
 Data Source: Drones, Cameras                                           Stakeholders: Farmers, Policy Makers

Remote sensing and monitoring via the use of drones is increasingly becoming a reality for developing countries as the underlying
technology becomes cheaper. To take advantage of this increased accessibility that drones will have in the future, Raptor Maps a
startup based in the United States, has created a novel platform that uses remote sensing (mainly drones, among other sensors)
and associated data analytics to monitor crop and irrigation health, with the objective of managing environmental impact of farming
while increasing crop yields. Through a web-interface, the company can provide insights and key statistics directly to farmers and
commercial growers. Expanded, this same technology can be repurposed for the remote data collection for policy makers and
governments with the associated analytics, resulting in early detection and monitoring of crop and animal disease outbreaks,
irrigation and water level control, management of food security, and production deficits, among many others.

Using Data and Analytics to Practice ‘Precision Agriculture’
 Data Source: Sensors, Drones, Cameras                                  Stakeholders: Farmers

‘Precision Agriculture’ is the collection of real-time data on weather, soil and air quality, crop maturity, and even costs and
availability of equipment and labor, followed by predictive analytics that guide smarter dynamic decision making. Traditionally,
precision agriculture has been limited only to developed countries and the most large-scale operations due to significant
requirements on technology and capital with control centers collecting and processing data in real time and providing direct
action items for immediate implementation. This results in farmers making the best decisions with regard to planting, fertilizing,
and harvesting crops at any given time. Expensive sensors that need to be placed throughout the fields to measure data points
such as temperature and humidity of the soil and surrounding air, yield tracking, and microclimate responses are fast being
replaced by insights derived from drones and satellite imagery which are low cost alternatives. Further, in developing countries, the
availability and relative cheapness of human capital makes it possible for large-scale manual collection of data – providing low tech
alternatives that still achieve the same level of results for precision agriculture. Data-driven precision agriculture - which is already
increasing yields by close to 20% and cutting costs by close to 50% in many operations - will be a crucial component that will help
the sector sustainably keep up with demand while advancing prosperity for all.
