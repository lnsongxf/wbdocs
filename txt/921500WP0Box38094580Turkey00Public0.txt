THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW

environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

        Obtain zoning plan (Imar Durumu)

        BuildCo applies to the District Municipality - Planning Department for a
        1:1000 scaled zoning plan which is already prepared and approved by
        the greater municipality. The plan shows the construction conditions of
        land such as the gross floor area ratio, footprint area ratio, and the
        function (e.g. commercial, residential, office, etc.)

        According to annual indexation of official fees for issuing the lot plan,
        the official fee schedule is as follows:

        1 -- 1,000 sq. m.: 333 TRY
        1,001 -- 3,000 sq. m.: 498 TRY
        3,001 -- 5,000 sq. m.: 710 TRY
   1    5,001 -- 10,000 sq. m.: 862 TRY                                                   4 days             TRY 380
        10,001 -- 20,000 sq. m.: 937 TRY
        20,001 -- 50,000 sq. m.: 1,073 TRY
        50,001 -- 100,000 sq. m.: 1,284 TRY
        100,001 -- 200,000 sq. m.: 1,587 TRY
        200,001 -- 500,000 sq. m.: 2,569 TRY

        The fee applied for the BuildCo case is TRY 333, which is then
        multiplied by a ratio based on the actual location of the warehouse. The
        ratio for Istanbul is 1.14. Therefore, the total fee is calculated as follows:
        TRY 333 * 1.14 = TRY 379.6

        Agency: District Municipality - Planning Department



        Obtain cadastral plan (Aplikasyon Krokisi)

      Agency: District Cadastral Office




      Obtain construction direction plan (Insaat Istikamet Rolevesi) and
      elevation of cross section (Kot Kesit Belgesi)

      BuildCo must apply for a construction direction plan and elevation of
      cross section at the district municipality with the documents obtained
      in the previous procedures. The technicians set all the necessary levels -
      - road, entrance, plot, building corners, etc. -- to be the basis for the
      design process of the works that will follow, and issue a construction
      direction plan and elevation of cross section. The construction direction
      plan includes stated directions on the land, distances from neighboring
      plots, and the building corners. The elevation of cross section identifies

      Hire an independent building inspector

      The company must select an independent building inspector and sign a
      service contract with this inspector. The inspector must check and
      approve all the project’s plans before they are submitted to the
      municipality. The list of project plans is extensive and includes the
      architectural design of the building done by design consultants; the
      reinforced concrete and insulation project plans prepared by a civil
      engineer; the fire safety project plans prepared jointly by an architect
      and the mechanical engineer for utilities; the project plans and
      documents for hot water, and those of central heating facilities
      prepared by a mechanical engineer; the electrical wiring project plans
      prepared by an electrical engineer; the telecommunications system

      project plans prepared by a landscape engineer.

      Selecting an independent building consultant takes only a day.
      However, practitioners agree that it takes at least 3 days for the
      building inspector to review and approve all the documents before they
      are submitted to the municipality. Hence, for the case considered here,
      it is assumed that 4 days are needed to complete this procedure.

      The building inspector charges a fee of 1.5% of the total cost of
      construction, according to the amendment of Article 5 of the Law on
      Building Inspection No. 4708 of August 17, 2011. This fee is paid in six
      installments.

      The inspector receives the following payments at the following stages:

      • 10% when the building permit is obtained
      • 10% when the foundation is completed
      • 40% when the static structure is completed
      • 20% when the detailed works are completed
      • 15% when the mechanical and electricity system are completed
      • 5% when the construction completion minute is approved by the
      municipality

      However, for the case considered here, it is assumed that any
      interaction with the independent building inspector is an internal
      process within BuildCo. Hence, the phased-out payment is included in
      this procedure as a one lump sum, for methodological reasons.

      The municipality must approve the project’s proposed designs. The fire
      safety project should also be submitted to the municipality for approval
      and can be included in this procedure.
      If the municipality asks for changes to be made to the architectural
      designs during the approval process, these changes should be reflected
      in the engineering and landscaping projects as well. For final approval,
      these project plans are submitted to the municipal project branch, for
      static, sanitation facility, heating and heat insulation, and landscaping
      project plans to the Turkish Electricity Distribution Corporation (TEDAS),
      for the electricity project plans; and to the telephone company, for the

      Article 22 of the Land Development Law establishes a 30-day statutory
      time limit for this procedure. Although in some cases the approval may
      be granted within 7 days, practitioners agree that most cases require
      the full 30 days allowed by law.

      The cost estimated for this procedure ranges from TRY 3,000.00 to TRY
      3,500.00. The fees found on one district municipality’s Web site show
      the cost breakdown to include fees for examination, approval, and

      must be attached to this request. The company must pay the fees
      before receiving the building permit and starting foundation work.

      The fee schedule is as follows:

       Although not mandated by law, non-encumbrance check is a must
       Procedure without which buyers do not proceed with the transfer
       process. The buyer almost always checks whether or not the property is
       free of liens and encumbrances. For this, the seller would need to obtain
       the document showing that the property is free of disputes. By law, the
       records are not open to public: the buyer can obtain this document only
       with a power attorney of the seller. Therefore, this document is typically    1 day                no cost

       legal right to search titles). The information is computerized, takes

      It is possible for parties to make an online appointment from the general

      payment, and makes an appointment on the very day or on the

ENFORCING CONTRACTS
Economies in all regions have improved contract                   reducing backlogs by introducing periodic reviews to
enforcement in recent years. A judiciary can be improved          clear inactive cases from the docket and by making
