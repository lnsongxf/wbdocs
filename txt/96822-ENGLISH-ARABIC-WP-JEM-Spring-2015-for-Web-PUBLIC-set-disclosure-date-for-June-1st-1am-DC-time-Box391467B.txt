14.	     The banking sector in Jordan is largely
resistant.7 By June 2014, banks’ nonperforming
loans (NPL) ratio remained at 7.0 percent, unchanged
from end-2013 and down from a 2011 peak of 8.5
percent but still far from the pre-crisis level of 4.1
percent in 2007 (Table 1). Banks’ Return on Equity
(ROE) and Return on Assets (ROA) both improved
in 2013 (latest annual data) to 9.9 percent and 1.2
percent, respectively, the highest rates since 2008.
At 17.4 percent end-June 2014, the capital adequacy
ratio is robust, as is the leverage ratio which (12.5
percent at end-June 2014 which is well above the
3 percent stipulated by Basel III). The net foreign
asset position of commercial banks registered minus
US$2.8 million at end-2014, down from minus
US$2.2 million a year earlier reflecting a higher
stock of foreign reserves at the central banks as well
as a continuation in the de-dollarization which, at
17.5 percent end-2014 (compared to 19.6 percent
at end-2013), is back to pre-tension levels. Banks’
exposure to sovereign debt8 has been increasing,
however, accounting for 40.7 percent of total assets
in end-2014, up from 38.8 percent in end-2013.

 An analysis of Jordan’s contemporaneous output gap reveals a closing gap over time, while a cumulative gap
 persists. Sensitivity analysis using three Hodrick-Prescott filters reveal a closing output and even slightly positive
 output gap by end-Q3 2014 (Figure 15). However, while the contemporaneous output gap appears1/ to be closing
 since mid-2014, after several years of below-potential economic growth, a sizeable negative cumulative output gap,
 which started in early 2013, remains (Figure 16).

 Coupled with other indicators, especially labor market ones, this tends to indicate that the Jordanian economy
 still has spare capacity that could be mobilized should growth continue to gather pace. For example, the labor
 force participation rate (LFPR) is currently significantly lower than it was prior to the sharp economic slowdown of
 2011 (the latest LFPR is at 36.4 percent in end-2014, against 40.1 percent in end-2009). As indicated earlier, part of
 this drop in the LFPR could be due to demotivated people that have given up on competing with Syrian refugees at
 the low end of the skills spectrum. The drop in the LFPR is all the more concerning given that Jordan’s population has
 a youth bulge which should have led to an increase in the participation rate.

 The policy implications are that the CBJ still has time before needing to tighten monetary policy. While the
 closing contemporaneous output gap would indicate an economy operating at full capacity, reducing justification
 for continued expansionary policy, the relatively large output gap reflects spare capacity in the economy. As growth
 starts to pick-up, it is expected that some spare resources would come back into production, including discouraged
 labor that dropped out of the labor force. Policy-wise, this would indicate that the CBJ does not need to tighten
 monetary policy at this stage, particularly given decelerating inflation and the time lag between its action on reducing
 key policy rates and their pass-through to commercial banks (Figure 17).

and Regasification Unit at Aqaba, with a send-out
capacity of 500 million cubic feet of liquefied natural
gas for imports, is expected to be operational in the
summer of 2015. The first shipment is scheduled
in August as part of an agreement between the
NEPCO and Shell to sell and purchase a minimum
of 150 million cubic feet of liquefied natural
gas estimated to cover 15 percent of Jordan’s
energy needs. The government continues towards
achieving its 10 percent renewable energy target
by 2020 with 400 MW of contracts for wind and
PV power projects already awarded (of which 130
MW capacity is under construction) and more
expected to be contracted by end-2015/2016.
With respect to natural gas, Jordan has suspended
talks to import natural gas from Nobel pending
an antitrust case. A US$18 billion pipeline was
planned to export crude oil from Basra in Iraq
to Aqaba but the security situation is likely to
hinder the project. Additionally, Jordan is keen to
improve the balance of its power generation mix
by utilizing its abandoned domestic deposits of
oil shale. In 2014, the government signed a long
term agreement for purchasing electricity from a
500 MW privately develop shale oil power plant
expected for operation in 2019.

concern because job creation is Jordan’s key
development challenge. Jordan’s labor market
suffers from severe structural deficiencies. As a result

industry’s growth, and streamline SMEs access to
Shariah-compliant financing.

34.	    In addition to facing regulatory hurdles on
the supply side, MSMEs can attribute their lack
of access to finance to a myriad of other factors.
Although 18 banks have dedicated SME departments
increasing their capability to lend to SMEs, several
rely primarily on collateral-based lending rather
than cash flow-based, leaving creditworthy SMEs
unfinanced; most loans require collateral amounting
to about 23 percent more than the loan value (small
firms report having provided higher collateral
than large firms); and, the enforcement of basic
contractual rights is cumbersome, time consuming
and costly, representing a significant disincentive
when lending to SMEs. Furthermore, the internal
ratings systems used by Jordanian banks for SME
lending are often based on outdated techniques that
do not effectively manage risk or lower costs.

financing. The Government of Jordan is very active

the important role that small firms in play in the
Jordanian economy.

42.	    The downward trend in access to finance
in Jordan does not hold for firms with at least some
female ownership. Such firms “outperform” their
exclusively male-dominated counterparts across
several Access to Finance metrics. By 2013, each
and every firm surveyed in Jordan that had some
female ownership possessed a checking account,
while nearly one in five firms owned exclusively
by men had no checking account. Similarly, while
the percentage of gender inclusive firms having an
overdraft facility and/or a line of credit increased to
57 percent and 64 percent, respectively, in 2013, the
number of male-owned firms with access to such
financial instruments languished in the 15 percent
range after declines from previous years (Figure 24).

43.	    In addition to having limited access to
checking accounts, lines of credit, and other
financing instruments, Jordanian firms that do
manage to secure loans face increasingly stringent
collateral requirements. While the number of
firms subject to only one form of collateral was
low in Jordan in 2006—only 14 percent of firms in
2006 enjoyed that luxury—by 2013 it had become
even rarer, with 95 percent of firms required to
provide more than one form of collateral. Generally
speaking, land and buildings are the most commonly
required form of collateral, but as more and more
types of collateral are being required for each loan,
the use of machinery and equipment, accounts
receivable and inventories has increased. The use
of accounts receivable and inventories, in particular,
has surged. In 2006, fewer than 20 percent of firms
used accounts as collateral, compared to 33 percent
by 2013—the most affected firms have been those
located in Amman and Irbid, as well as older firms
(over 25 years), over 50 percent of which cited
accounts as one of the types of collateral required of
them to obtain their loans (Figure 25).
