                                Identification in Social Protection
   When mechanisms for identification are weak, individuals may experience difficulty proving their
   eligibility for social protection assistance. Without a common identity, coordination among different
   development programs on the identification of potential beneficiaries becomes more difficult and
   costly. Invariably, multiple databases result, with beneficiaries’ identities not necessarily linked across
   them. These programs become vulnerable to misuse and sizeable leakages.
      Examining how fraud could manifest itself within this illustrative context underscores the scope of
   vulnerability of identification-based service programs in general:
   •	 An individual may assume multiple identities, using false or assumed names when registering for
      benefits, and thereby receive more than his or her fair share of assistance (monetary, food, etc.).
   •	 A head of a household may inflate the size of his or her family by “borrowing” children from
      other households during household registration. Often those same children are lent back to other
      households and registered again, resulting in exaggerated family units.
   •	 When aid is in the form of guaranteed employment, an individual who secures work may “outsource”
      that labor by selling it to another individual who performs the work in his or her place.
   •	 In long-term programs, the death of a beneficiary may not be communicated in a timely fashion.
      The ration or benefit card of the deceased could continue to be used by a family member or
      another individual.
   •	 The registration of fictitious individuals (or ghost workers) through collusion with local government
      may aid workers who see the lack of identity accountability as an opportunity to defraud the
      program.

                                                                   fingerprints, iris texture, and face

                                                                   The images are then converted, using
     proprietary algorithms, into a set of templates, which are mathematical codes intrinsic to the individual,
     insensitive to extrinsic image variability (skin condition, eye color, expression, hair style, viewing
     conditions, etc.). Given a large enough set (e.g., using enough numbers of fingers), this code can be
     demonstrated to be unique for each individual within a population size, with reasonable accuracy.
     Thus, identity can be conveniently fixed through a set of biometric identifiers that have sufficient
     resolving power to distinguish unambiguously any given person from the entire group. In addition to
     fingerprints, face prints, and iris scans, additional forms of biometrics have emerged in recent years,
     including voice prints, retinal scans, vein patterns, and DNA. Other ways to fix identity that do not use
     biometrics include the use of robust civil registration procedures.

                                             Identity and Trust
   It can be argued that the role of identity has not changed since the beginning of civilization. Humans
   use identification to determine in which type of interactions to engage with other people. More
   specifically, we use identity to facilitate the actions of those we know and trust, and to protect us
   from those we do not trust or from those we do
   not know.
      Identity is what binds a person to his or her
   reputation, and reputation is what earns that
   person trust within the community, which in turn
   facilitates or inhibits that individual’s actions           TRUST                             ACTIONS
   depending on his or her level of trust. The cycle

                                       Data is Pervasive in eID
      eID systems are heavily data-centric: they consume data and they generate it. During registration,
      enrollment data is collected, transmitted, stored, and archived (upon death for example); but that
      is not all. Every time an eID is asserted by its bearer, it generates usage and transaction records that
      can accumulate in audit trail databases, controlled commercially or by government institutions.
      As such, the management of identity has gone from the issuance of ID cards in the past to the
      management of databases of large amounts of personally identifying information, and this data
      will only continue to grow as more eServices rely on eID and eID becomes more pervasive.
         Add to this the massive amounts of unstructured data that is accumulating online and on social
      media. In this way, one can see that we are heading towards a regime in which massive amounts
      of data are digitally available concerning people, their actions, and their reputations; all of this is
      linked through a reliable, unique, and traceable eID. These databases are likely to become key for
      organizations seeking to perform identity or entity resolution, identity harvesting, and reputation
      discovery, as well as other identity intelligence and analytics for the purpose of developing interest
      or risk profiles (targeted marketing or security risk assessment).
         The implication of this growth in data is that, increasingly, identity will be defined based on
      data external to the enrollment process, such as vetted social résumés (community vetted self-
      declarations), open-source reputational data, as well as from audit trails of use of eID. This
      situation could raise major concerns, the severity of which may vary according to each country,
      its policy and laws, and regional differences. Significant discussions are taking place around
      the world related to how to address this potential mega-data problem. These include use of
      Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PET), distributed databases, match-on-card, improved notice
      and consent provisions, as well as frameworks of trust that manage identity alongside anonymity.
      See Section III below for further discussion.

Note: For example, a Social Welfare organization could collect biometric enrollment data as part of its door-to-door poverty survey using the NIA
standard. The survey data needed for establishing the poverty score of a household would be retained in the information systems of that ministry, while
the biometrics, if collected, would be sent directly to the NIA for de-duplication, issuance of a UIN, as applicable, and registration of the identity in the

 Accuracy                  Provides adequate 1:N accuracy such that each individual can be identified unambiguously from the population.
                           This is the resolving power of the biometric set. The more biometric data is available, the higher the resolving
                           power.

 Inclusion                 Ensures that everyone is able to provide some biometric sample, including those that represent challenges for
                           certain modalities (e.g., children, manual laborers, or amputees that typically challenge fingerprints) but seem to

                                  Capturing Biometrics of Children
      Capturing biometrics of children is a challenge. The papillary ridge structure of fingers does not
      develop before the age of six, which means no reliable identifiers can be extracted from children’s
      fingerprints before that age. Above the age of six, fingerprints continue to change with growth until
      adulthood. But that variation is predictable and is compensated for by some of the leading AFIS
      software.
         Some countries, including the European Council (Presidency meeting document 9403/1/06), use
      12 years as the minimum legal age for capturing fingerprints from children. An alternative could be
      to capture iris, which is a biometric that is fully formed in the first year after birth, and seems to be
      practically feasible to capture down to five years without any challenge and down to one year with
      significant assistance of mother noted.
         In any case it is always a good policy to capture a face starting from birth, even though it is not as
      accurate as a finger or iris and the photo would have to be updated over time.

   Trust Element                                                         Key Considerations

 Registration      This is a crucial element in the chain of trust. The registration process should ensure that only legitimate identities are
 Integrity         able to enroll.
                   Required Measures:
                   •	 Assurance of captured data integrity at the enrollment centers and during transmission to prevent alternations,
                      substitutions, or other manipulations.
                   •	 When using biometrics, controlling captured image quality as measured metrics such as NIST NFIQ for fingerprints or ICAO
                      face image quality 19794–5. If image quality is not kept high, fraud perpetrators could attempt evasion by intentionally
                      providing bad-quality samples, since match accuracy is directly related to quality.
                   •	 Matching accuracy of ABIS, if used, in the backend system should be high enough that (together with deterrence) it can
                      lead to practically zero duplicate enrollments.

 Trusted           The digital credential as well as the physical proxy should be virtually impossible to fabricate outside the NIA process.
 Credential        Required Measures:
                   •	 Mature and consistent information security, digital signature, certificate management, and encryption practices that leave
                      no loopholes.
                   •	 Minimum security requirements for any medium that will carry the credential, such as smartcards or mobile phones.

 Identity          Relying parties need to be assured that the person conducting a transaction is who he claims to be and not someone who
 Assurance         stole a legitimate identity.
                   Required Measures:
                   Strong authentication: multifactor or biometric 1:1 match.

 Combating         Preventing the issuance of true-false identity, where a human operator could issue a genuine document for a false identity
 Malfeasance       due to bribe or coercion.
 (Human Factors)   Required Measures:
                   •	 Supervised procedures and technology to limit the ability of enrollment agents to fabricate fake enrollment data (often by
                      presenting wrong sequence of fingers, or by mixing and matching fingers from multiple people including their own as
                      they reconstitute the 10-print).
                   •	 Internal controls at the NIA to ensure that no single operator is capable of surreptitiously modifying or enrolling identity
                      records without supervisor approval.
                   •	 A higher standard for screening of new hires and ongoing monitoring of agents.

 Data Protection   The public should be assured that their data at the NIR is protected against unauthorized access, including external (hacking),
 and Security      internal (rogue employee), as well as organized mission creep.
                   Required Measures:
                   •	 Information security measures that emphasize strong data rights management.
                   •	 Physical security measures to protect data centers.
                   •	 Identity data segregation.
                   •	 Enforced internal policy and procedures for access.
                   •	 Public policy on data use.

 Trust Model       Underlying the eID program, there is technology for trusted communication. This includes enabling authentication for
                   access to online services, digital signature for commitment and non-repudiation, and encryption to secure transmission of
                   transactions. Not only technical measures have to be in place, but also clearly defined responsibilities and liabilities of the
                   authority providing this trust (e.g., CA) should be set in a Legal Act.

          Measure                                                              What is Involved

 Legislation               Bodies of privacy laws that impact eID:
                           •	 Industry-specific laws (for example HIPAA covers privacy of medical information, while GLBA covers financial records
                              in the USA).a
                           •	 Omnibus privacy laws covering all ID data (identity bill of rights). For example European Commission Data
                              Protection and Privacy Directives 95/46 and 2009/136; Article 8 Charter of Fundamental Rights of EU; Convention
                              108/81 of the Council of Europe (COE). These types of laws cover privacy of PII no matter what type of data or
                              application is involved.
                           •	 eID specific Legal Acts: sometimes the acts that authorize the establishment of eID in a country also reiterate or
                              introduce new bodies of legislation that explicitly provide privacy protection to people.

 Access and Data           The protection of identity data and limiting its use, using technical measures:
 Protection                •	 Data rights access management.
                           •	 Anti-data retention measures (e.g., retention of audit trail data only for the period required by law for
                              non-repudiation).
                           •	 Use limitations.

 Notice                    •	 Individuals’ right to have notice regarding the data gathered about themselves and the right to know how and
                              for what purpose it will be used. This may be required by law or it may be a good practice for all eID processes
                              (enrollment, use).
                           •	 Clear, meaningful, and prominent notice when collecting identifying data (iconic plus information link).

 Consent/Choice            The individual’s right to consent to the collection and use of their personal data.

 Privacy by Design         These include privacy-enhancing technologies and measures such as:
                           •	 Data minimization and proportionality: capture data in proportion to risk.
                           •	 Identity data segmentation and segregation: e.g., store identifiers separately from PII.
                           •	 Do-not-track (DNT).
                           •	 Right to be forgotten.
                           •	 Right to view.
                           •	 Pseudonymous, or anonymous transaction management (Trusted Agents).

 Privacy Policy            Program-specific (eID program-wide), as well as specific applications.

 Privacy                   An independent body that reports directly to the legislative body (parliament) and acts as an advocate for privacy
 Commissioner              rights, with powers that include:
                           •	 Investigate complaints, conduct audits, and publicly report on the privacy practices of public and private sector
                              organizations.
                           •	 Educate the public regarding privacy.
                           •	 Pursue legal actions for violations, where supported by law.

 Enforcement               Meaningful legal instruments and mechanisms that provide sanctions for noncompliance. Enforcement is not
                           necessarily limited to the scope of action of the Privacy Commissioner’s Office.
   HIPAA stands for Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 in the USA, while the GLBA stands for

 Operational            These involve internal policies and procedures for the operation of the NIA as an autonomous corporate entity:
 Governance             •	 Information security policies
                        •	 Privacy policy and notices
                        •	 Human resources policies
                        •	 IT governance policy
                        •	 Business continuity management and disaster recovery
                        •	 Data retention policies
                        •	 Communication to and acknowledgement by employees of policies
                        There are a number of sources that provide guidance on this matter, including the ISO/IEC 38500:2008 on standards
                        for corporate governance in IT organizations. In addition, regulatory requirements may have significant operational
                        governance implications and should be consulted.

 Human Resources        Screening of all employees, contractors, and consultants prior to their involvement in the eID program. This may
                        include background checks, criminal history checks, and previous employment and credit checks. In some cases, a
                        formal security clearance may be required for certain sensitive roles.

 Supplier Vetting       Due diligence for suppliers as well as periodic review of performance. This is to ensure that they can actually deliver on
                        contractual commitments and that they have the qualifications and skills necessary for quality of implementation.

 Change Management      Procedures to facilitate the adoption of change within the eID system. Change control procedures should be
                        designed to ensure that changes are appropriately considered, approved by management, and are not disruptive
                        to the operations. Best practice standards are available, such as ISO/IEC 200000 Information Technology Service

 Awareness              •	 Marketing and public education programs to improve public awareness and understanding of the eID and to
                           promote its continued use.
                        •	 Internal training and awareness for employees to ensure they understand their roles and responsibilities in terms
                           of security and privacy, and all other internal policies.

 Security and Privacy   •	   Physical access control and security procedures to the eID issuance site to protect against unauthorized use.
                        •	   Role-based system and logical access controls to prevent system abuse.
