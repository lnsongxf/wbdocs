2           Preventing and Managing Boardroom Disputes
INTRODUCTION

A dynamic board seeks to stimulate the flow of ideas, identify key issues, consider alternatives, and make informed
decisions. And for that you need deliberation and debate. But these positive processes can sometimes turn into boardroom
disagreements that must be dealt with properly and promptly; otherwise, they can devolve into acrimonious disputes that
undermine the board’s effectiveness and the company’s performance.

This paper describes key steps that boards can take to mitigate the impact of disputes—and, even better, to minimize
the risk of disputes arising in the first place. It is intended as companion and post-training material for a course called
“Managing Disputes and Difficult Conversations on the Board.” This highly interactive course for board directors
was created by the IFC Corporate Governance Group in partnership with the Center for Effective Dispute Resolution
(CEDR). It is designed to help directors understand board conflict and conflict styles, and it covers difficult scenarios
that directors often encounter. The course offers guidance and practical tips for how to have a difficult conversation; for
handling avoidance, high emotions, and status issues; and for breaking through deadlock—and how to apply these skills
specifically in a board context.

This publication also can be used as stand-alone guidance for boards. While the training itself focuses heavily on individual
development of interpersonal skills relevant in the board context, this publication also deals with the board as a collective
body that needs to cultivate its ability to manage disputes effectively—starting by establishing good corporate governance
policies and practices.

The advice is geared toward a single-tier board, but the principles described in this publication can be easily adapted to
different board structures.

The paper builds on IFC’s “Resolving Corporate Governance Disputes”1 and its internal IFC “Board Toolkit.” In addition
to numerous people who contributed to those publications, IFC and CEDR would like to thank the following peer
reviewers and contributors: Amira El Saeed Agag (IFC), Phil Armstrong (IFC), Philip TN Koh (Mah-Kamariyah & Philip

    OVERVIEW

    Disagreements in the boardroom are unavoidable – especially when the board has independent-minded, skilled, and
    outspoken directors, each contributing expertise and talent that is relevant for the future of the company. A good board
    includes a diverse group of people, considers and debates a variety of issues, and aims for consensus decisions; no one
    person’s views prevail 100 percent of the time. A board that never argues or disagrees is most likely inactive, passive, or
    inattentive – in other words, an ineffective board that is neither fulfilling its oversight function nor carrying out its duty
    of care. Yet if boardroom disagreements are not dealt with properly, they can escalate quickly into public matters that can
    have severe, long-term consequences for the company and its key stakeholders.



    Disputes Can Put the Company at Risk

    In 2013, CEDR and the IFC Corporate Governance Group conducted a global survey of 191 directors and board members
    to learn about their experiences with and attitudes toward boardroom disputes.4 Our results show the significant effects
    that boardroom disputes can have on an organization, and the challenges that individual members of those boards find in
    attempting to resolve them. (See Box 0.1.) The following are some of the results of the survey:

    •	 A sizeable portion (29.6 percent) of respondents have experienced a boardroom dispute affecting the survival of
       an organization.

    •	 42.8 percent of respondents report that conflict reduced the level of trust among board members.
    •	 The most common subject matter of disputes is “financial, structural, or procedural workings of the organization,”
       closely followed by the “personal behavior and attitudes of directors.”

    •	 Disputes are most commonly resolved through internal negotiation (61.2 percent) or internal mediation (25.2 percent).
    •	 A significant proportion of respondents (67.2 percent) report that they have encountered unresolved issues; 15.6
       percent report that conflicts are not resolved “frequently,” and another 11.0 percent report that the issues are resolved
       “frequently” by “avoiding the conflict and letting it pass.”

    •	 Respondents say that the most frequent complicating factor in resolving disputes are “issues regarding handling the
       emotions of those involved,” and this was the second-most difficult factor to deal with after issues over “competing
       factions on the board.”

    •	 Respondents are extremely eager for training in dealing with personal factors, with 74.8 percent describing training in
       the “ability to deal with different personalities” as very useful.

    •	 A gender difference emerged regarding which skills respondents desired: women are far more interested in receiving
       training in negotiation skills, while men are more keen to receive training in how to deal with different personalities.

Box 0.1: Excerpts from CEDR-IFC Survey Responses




        “The CEO’s abrasive style with zero appetite for ‘changes’ has pushed

        the company to a stage wherein the company is under attack from the

        stakeholders, including the creditors.”




        “Factionalism [exists] on the board, and an unwillingness on the part of

        the chair to demand that members pull together—instead [there is] much

        manipulation and backroom dealing.”




        “Alpha members of the board [are] not listening to others or not ‘hearing’ them,

        especially women (or those perceived to be of no importance); [there is] lack of

        empathy or ability to appreciate motives of others.”




        “In my experience the avoidance of the dispute is the biggest problem,

        especially in a company with a dominant shareholder and two minority

        shareholders, where the minority shareholders are suffering most from results

        of avoidance but are hardly part of the conflict management, as the conflict is

        played outside the board/board meetings.”




                                                                  Preventing and Managing Boardroom Disputes   5
    Defining Corporate Governance Disputes


    Corporate governance disputes involve the board’s powers and actions or its failure or refusal to act. These conflicts may
    arise between the board and its shareholders or between directors and executive management. They may also involve issues
    among the directors themselves or between the board and other stakeholders.

    The list of possible sources of conflict is endless and includes issues related to the business itself (what is being done—
    strategic priorities, related-party transactions, company control), board processes (how things are done—appointment
    of new directors, defining board agenda, succession planning), and personalities (who is doing things—behaviors and
    attitudes of directors). Regardless of its source or nature, a governance dispute implicates the board in one way or another
    as a party or as an active participant, and resolving the conflict requires the directors’ concurrence.

    In further defining corporate governance disputes, we should distinguish them from other types of disputes that may
    involve a company. For example, a dispute over a contract, a labor claim, or a commercial matter involves the company as
    an entity but does not pertain to its governance. Such disputes are typically part of doing business, and it is generally up
    to management to resolve them.

    It is important to note that this paper does not deal with any specific type of conflict, such as a shareholder dispute or a clash
    over related-party transactions; for help with specific situations, you should seek independent professional advice. Instead,
    we focus on policies, procedures, and directors’ skills that help resolve disagreements in a constructive way, prevent some
    conflicts altogether by removing common “irritants,” and create the circumstances for a productive board environment.



    CGDR Self-Assessment and Progression Matrix

    To keep disputes from being destructive, the first and most important responsibility of the board is to apply good corporate
    governance practices, including initiating steps to minimize the risk of having disputes arise in the first place. The second
    responsibility is to see to it that individual board members develop the skills needed to better manage disputes and heated
    negotiations. To achieve these goals, a board should consider adopting the following interlinked steps, tailoring them to
    the board’s particular circumstances:
    1.	 Clarify the roles of management and the board.

    2.	 Establish orderly board processes.

    3.	 Ensure the proper flow of information.

    4.	 Encourage a board culture that allows for effective discussions, debates, and deliberations.

    5.	 Step out of the boardroom to gain new perspectives.

    6.	 Apply dispute resolution skills and techniques.

    7.	 Incorporate ADR into the company’s culture and practices.



    Table 0.1 presents the Corporate Governance Dispute Resolution Self-Assessment and Progression Matrix, which
    summarizes specific elements of those key steps. It is formatted to help boards conduct a basic self-evaluation of their
    readiness to prevent, manage, and mitigate the impact of corporate governance disputes. It shows boards where they might
    be in the matrix and what they need to do to build a roadmap to improve.

    These seven steps form the structure of this paper. Each section expands on one step, exploring it in greater depth.

SEVEN DIMENSIONS IN PREVENTING AND MANAGING BOARDROOM DISPUTES                                  LEVEL 1         LEVEL 2         LEVEL 3
                                                                                                              Somewhat/       Internalized
                                                                                                   No         Sometimes         practice
1. Clarify the Role of Management versus the Board
   There is clear and detailed delineation of board and management authorities/roles/
   responsibilities
   Each committee has a charter clearly delineating its functions

   The CEO has clear limits on expenditures not requiring board approval

2. Establish Orderly Board Processes

   There is a yearly calendar for board and committee meetings
   Board meetings protocol establishes procedural rules and behavior expectations,
   including how each director can add matters to the agenda
   Meeting agendas ensure an appropriate amount of time for each decision item to
   be discussed
   Meetings include “executive sessions” (sessions without management or CEO)

   Board minutes clearly present issues discussed, decisions made, and basis for decisions

3. Ensure Proper Flow of Information
   Key business performance indicators are established and regularly reported to
   the board
   Board is regularly updated on the implementation of previous decisions

   Board briefing papers are focused and allow for informed board decisions

   Board briefing papers are distributed no less than a week before the meetings
4.	 Encourage a Board Culture that Allows for Effective Discussions, Debates,
    and Deliberations

   Different points of view and debate are welcomed during board meetings

   Board deliberations are collegial and civil

   Consensus is the preferred way to make decisions

   Chair encourages frank and open discussion that each director can participate in

5. Step out of the Boardroom to Gain New Perspectives

   Regular informal settings give directors the opportunity to better know each other
   The chair or lead director meets at least once a year with all the other board members
   individually to know their points of view of the company and the board
   The CEO meets at least once a year with each director to hear his or her views about the
   company, management, and the CEO’s performance
   Board undergoes regular assessments/evaluations

   Board holds an annual retreat outside company premises

6. Apply Dispute Resolution Skills and Techniques

   Chair is adept at building consensus

   Directors have good interpersonal communication skills

7. Incorporate ADR into the Company’s Culture and Practices
   Board’s bylaws or governance principles or guidelines include a provision on how disputes
   will be resolved
   One or more directors on the board have mediation training and/or are trusted and able
   to play an internal mediation role, when needed
   The board has a code of ethics that directors sign during induction



                                                                                               Preventing and Managing Boardroom Disputes    7

    CLARIFY THE ROLES
    OF MANAGEMENT AND THE BOARD

    Clarifying the roles of the board and management is                be dealing with. Also, gaps can develop in areas that the
    crucial to preventing disputes. Failure to understand and          board believes are part of management’s responsibility but
    articulate these different roles invites disputes and impairs      management assumes the board is handling. For example,
    the board’s effectiveness. The board also should establish         the board establishes how much expenditure the CEO can
    committee charters that clearly define the committees’             authorize without requesting board approval, and it cannot
    jurisdictions and responsibilities. It is especially detrimental   permit ambiguity in that area; doing so would create room
    for boards or board committees to extend their roles into          for constant friction between the board and the CEO.
    management’s purview—for example, when the audit
    committee begins to redo the financial statements or               The board’s role does not include running the company. The
    conduct its own audit.                                             board hires people for day-to-day management, oversees
                                                                       and monitors management and corporate activities,
    Similarly, management must understand its role and that of         reviews and approves (or disapproves) key strategies and
    the board; otherwise, board meetings can become consumed           policies, and acts on significant matters after having fully
    by routine or irrelevant matters that management should            informed itself. (See Box 1.1.)

Box 1.1: Board Responsibilities




    The board’s role and responsibilities typically include the following,
    among others:
    •	 Approving a corporate philosophy and mission

    •	 Nominating directors for election to the board

    •	 Establishing an audit committee composed entirely or primarily of independent directors
       (depending on the jurisdiction)

    •	 Selecting, monitoring, advising, evaluating, setting compensation for, and—if necessary—
       replacing the CEO and other senior executives, while ensuring an orderly and proper
       management succession

    •	 Reviewing and approving:

        –– Management’s strategic and business plans

        –– The company’s enterprise risk management program and systems of internal control

        –– The company’s financial plans, objectives, and actions—including distributions
           to shareholders, significant capital allocations, expenditures, and other material
           financial obligations

        –– Material transactions not in the ordinary course of business, and making
           recommendations to shareholders when their approval of such transactions is necessary

    •	 Monitoring corporate performance against strategic business plans

    •	 Determining the limits of authority and expenditures and board delegations for the CEO and
       senior management.

    •	 Helping ensure ethical behavior and compliance with laws and regulations, accounting and
       auditing principles, and the company’s own governing documents

    •	 Assessing its own effectiveness in fulfilling board responsibilities

     ESTABLISH ORDERLY BOARD PROCESSES
     Orderly processes and procedures help create an               Some boards will establish their own protocols that lay
     environment that not only permits but also encourages         out the chair’s role, procedures for calling on those who
     discussion and debate. By contrast, disorganized, chaotic     wish to speak, debate procedures (rebuttal and counter-
     meetings not only impede the substantive aspects of the       rebuttal), and clear rules for how to ask directors to end
     board meeting but also create numerous irritants. Two         their remarks if they do not abide by the board’s rules.

Box 3.1: Briefing Papers



     Board materials should be summarized and formatted to allow board members to readily
     grasp and focus on the most significant issues in preparation for the board meeting. Papers
     relating to specific agenda items should be clearly structured, with headings such as “purpose,”
     “background,” “risks,” “issues,” “impact,” and “recommendations.” Briefing papers should be:

     •	 Short, concise, and material. Board papers associated with a particular agenda item need not
        be more than four to six pages, with any further detail provided in annexes. Many directors
        privately complain that their board papers are often twice as long as they should be.

     •	 Timely. Information should be distributed, preferably in the hands of directors, at least five
        business days in advance. This allows board members—particularly non-executive directors,
        who are not as familiar with the business as executive directors are—to fully consider the
        issues before the meeting.

     •	 Focused and action-oriented. The papers should present the issue for discussion, evaluate the
        risks of each identified alternative, offer solutions for how to effectively address the issue,
        and provide management’s view on which action to take. It should be clear what is required
        from the directors. Is this a matter for decision, for information only or to be noted (if
        exercised within existing CEO/management authority)?


     If a proposal is more complex or requires additional explanation, the board should consider
     delegating the matter to a board committee or arranging one-on-one briefings of each director
     by the proposal’s promoter.

Box 4.1: Factors to Consider for Director Nominations




     To promote a collegial environment that facilitates the board’s work, a board—and especially its
     nomination committee—should:

     •	 Encourage directors to meet with potential directors before they are nominated, and to
        weigh in on the nomination process. For example, the non-executive directors (NED) would
        individually meet with the proposed new NED and the entire board will have an audience
        with a proposed executive director;

     •	 Perform thorough background investigations of potential directors, and obtain as much
        information as possible on how the potential directors have functioned in group decision-
        making settings;

     •	 Avoid nominating people who are reputed to argue for argument’s sake;

     •	 Avoid nominating people who, because they are fearful of making decisions, prolong debate
        and resist developing collaborative solutions; and

     •	 Make sure the board has at least some people with skills and training in conflict resolution,
        consensus building, negotiation, and mediation.

     Box 4.2: Role of the Chair



          For managing the board’s business and acting as its facilitator and guide, an effective board chair
          is absolutely essential. While conducting the meetings, the chair should:

          •	 Maintain control of the proceedings without dominating discussion, treating all directors
             equally. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for a chair to make his or her opinion known
             before allowing all the directors express their views, thus preventing an honest exchange
             of ideas.

          •	 Facilitate decision making by stimulating focused debate, drawing on all contributions,
             encouraging constructive discussion, and ensuring that genuine disagreements are aired and
             resolved. Skillful questioning helps clarify issues and encourages the full participation of
             the directors.

          •	 Steer the board toward consensus. A good chair will always aim for a consensus decision, not
             just one based on majority vote. (For more information, see Building Consensus, on page 26.)
             In some jurisdictions, company bylaws allow the chair to exercise the “casting vote” to break a
             voting tie on the board. Even if allowed to do so, the chair should avoid exercising this right,
             as it exacerbates tensions on the board.

          •	 Ensure that the decisions that are made are properly understood and recorded.

     Box 6.1: Assessing the Board’s Interpersonal Skills



           Board retreats provide opportunities to assess individual and collective interpersonal skills and
           expertise that improve governance practices and help manage disputes. The set of questions
           below can serve as a guideline to assess those skills:
           •	 Are the board directors effective communicators?
           •	 What are their strengths and weaknesses?
           •	 Are board discussions focused yet sufficiently open to encourage a broad range of viewpoints?
           •	 Are there opportunities for individual board members to make presentations and lead
              discussions, particularly the ones on issues relevant to their committee responsibilities and
              areas of expertise?
           •	 Does the chair balance the extroverts and introverts to ensure open participation in board
              deliberations?
           •	 Do board directors relate well to one another and to senior management? If not, what are the
              problems and their sources?
           •	 Are social, cultural, political, economic, or personal factors creating tensions among board
              members and senior management?
           •	 Have tensions among directors obstructed the board’s ability to function? If so, why?
           •	 What steps has the board taken to defuse personal animosities among board directors?
           •	 Does the process that the chair or lead director uses to consider issues provide opportunities
              for reflection, analysis, debate, and consensus building?

Box 6.2: Techniques for Defusing Disputes in Boardrooms



    •	 Listen actively. As people communicate, pay close attention and demonstrate genuine
       interest by asking questions, summarizing key points, and linking relevant ideas
       and experiences.

    •	 Use open-ended questions. Ask questions that require more than yes-or-no answers.
       Open-ended questions encourage speakers to reveal their concerns and interests. Such
       questions usually begin with who, why, what, how, when, or where.

    •	 Clarify reasons. Encourage cooperation by clarifying shared goals and confirming objectives.
       Do this early in meeting discussions.

    •	 Be aware of body language. Show your interest and desire to communicate through
       friendly, open, and attentive facial expressions and posture. Notice others’ body language.

    •	 Speak on behalf of yourself. Use “I” statements, so listeners understand that you are
       not making universal statements but only expressing your own opinions, sharing personal
       observations, and offering alternatives. Others may have different experiences, perceptions,
       and ideas. Phrases that demonstrate respect for differences include I noticed, I suggest, or
       from my experience.

    •	 Recognize others’ positive ideas through constructive feedback, and explain why their
       proposals are useful. If more helpful contributions are needed, be specific in your requests.
       Ask for practical suggestions to improve specific situations.

    •	 Stay calm as you work professionally and diplomatically to defuse tension. At times, others
       will discount the value of your ideas, no matter how carefully you phrase your thoughts.
       People become defensive for many reasons, including circumstances beyond your control.
       When that happens, acknowledge and respect the different views. You have offered your
       perspective based on your experiences. Offer to meet at another time, when emotions have
       cooled, to continue the discussion.

    •	 Avoid misunderstanding. Paraphrase other board members’ statements to ensure proper
       understanding of their position. Allow them to acknowledge that your summary of their
       remarks is correct.

    •	 Allow others to “save face” by reframing their statements in less confrontational terms to
       unlock disputes. Saving face is especially important in some cultures; but generally speaking,
       no one likes to be publicly embarrassed—especially in the boardroom. To save face, directors
       may take a defensive position, although they actually don’t oppose a decision.

DOCUMENTATION THAT IS PART OF THE CREATION OF THE CORPORATION.

Charter (called articles     The charter is the baseline corporate document. It creates the company’s basic economic
of incorporation in some     structure, and it incorporates matters that are at the core of the corporate enterprise and
jurisdictions) provisions    provide protection for shareholder investments. If appropriate, the charter can contain
                             provisions requiring mediation or arbitration. Depending on the law of the jurisdiction of
                             incorporation, charters can also contain provisions as to the particular jurisdictional law that
                             will be applied to dispute resolution, as well as the site of any litigation against the company.
                             CAVEAT: Typically, charter provisions can only be changed by shareholder vote. Once a
                             provision is in the charter, it is very difficult to amend it. Cautious lawyers often keep charter
                             provisions to a minimum to ensure board flexibility as the enterprise develops.

Bylaws                       Bylaws contain governance requirements that the board of directors itself determines. Bylaws
                             can be changed by the board. They provide another place where binding procedures to be
                             used in the event of a dispute are spelled out.
                             Articles of incorporation can be drawn to permit shareholders to also change the bylaws;
                             so while shareholder approval may not be required for a bylaw, shareholders can retain the
                             right to do so. In some jurisdictions, the company law may give shareholders the right to
                             make bylaw changes.

Shareholder Agreements       Often, the documents that create the corporation are accompanied by a separate agreement
                             among shareholders. If the potential for dispute is high among various investors, a shareholder
                             agreement can be a potent tool. It can also provide a useful procedural roadmap that makes
                             clear for all disputants how matters will be resolved.

GOVERNANCE DOCUMENTS THAT CAN HELP AVOID DISPUTES OR PROVIDE A PROCESS FOR RESOLVING THEM

Statement of Corporate       This document lays out governance principles and practices that apply to the company’s board
Governance Principles        of directors. It can easily include provisions regarding procedures to be taken when disputes
                             arise. Debate and discussion is a positive attribute of a board. These debates typically are
                             resolved through a vote. However, when differences of opinion continue, whether among
                             directors, officers, or shareholders, this document can articulate the tone that disputes are to
                             take, as well as how they are to be handled.

Statement of Directors’      It is important and very helpful to articulate in advance exactly what duties directors have
Responsibilities             and what responsibilities each director is expected fulfill. This document, which can also
                             be incorporated as part of the Statement of Corporate Governance Principles, can help set
                             the tone for director conduct, including handling differences of opinion as they arise. This
                             document should be shown to all prospective directors so they understand in advance what
                             is expected of them and that their joining the board means they have agreed to its provisions.

Committee Charters           Committee charters articulate each committee’s jurisdiction and the specific responsibilities
                             it must carry out during the course of a year. Questions of committee jurisdiction—such
                             as which committee considers and decides certain issues—can be contentious. Charters
                             remove uncertainty from this process.

Board of Director Manuals    Every board should have a manual that 1) pulls together all relevant governance documents,
                             2) spells out various company policies, and 3) answers practical questions that may arise for
                             corporate directors, including questions about compensation and benefits. These manuals
                             do not themselves resolve disputes, but they are quick-reference guides for what to do when
                             matters become contentious. There is no reason why they cannot also include procedures
                             for handling disputes. Along with the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, they should
                             be shown to people before they join the board, and it should be made clear that their joining
                             the board involves an agreement to the contents of the manual.

Code of Conduct              Every corporation should have a written code of conduct that articulates the ethical and
                             operational culture of the company and its operating values. The code of conduct can include
                             a provision that facilitates the resolution of disputes.
