INDONESIA ECONOMIC QUARTERLY
Private investment is essential

March 2016
Preface
          The Indonesia Economic Quarterly (IEQ) has two main aims. First, it reports on the key
          developments over the past three months in Indonesia’s economy, and places these in a longer-
          term and global context. Based on these developments, and on policy changes over the period,
          the IEQ regularly updates the outlook for Indonesia’s economy and social welfare. Second, the
          IEQ provides a more in-depth examination of selected economic and policy issues, and analysis
          of Indonesia’s medium-term development challenges. It is intended for a wide audience,
          including policymakers, business leaders, financial market participants, and the community of
          analysts and professionals engaged in Indonesia’s evolving economy.

          The IEQ is a product of the World Bank’s Jakarta office and receives editorial and strategic

Indonesia needs to      Global growth disappointed in 2015 and a gradual recovery is projected for 2016.
adjust to a global      The trajectory of the global economy for the next few years will be characterized by
economy marked by       more modest growth in large emerging markets, low commodity prices and global
slower growth, low      trade and capital flows that are weaker than in the decade before the global financial
commodity prices,       crisis. With export revenues contracting for a fourth consecutive year, Indonesia’s
and weaker trade        economy, too, slowed down in 2015. GDP grew by 4.8 percent, a respectable
and capital flows       growth rate, especially for a commodity exporter, but one which is not sufficient to
                        absorb new entrants into the labor force and to reverse the recent trend of slower
                        poverty reduction. To accelerate the pace of growth, Indonesia will need to adapt to
                        a less favorable external environment, relying on fiscal expansion in the short run
                        but focusing on facilitating investment and reducing the cost of doing business in
                        the medium term.

In the short term,      Gaining momentum in the second half of the year, central government investment
fiscal stimulus will    increased by 42 percent year on year (yoy) in 2015. The shift in the composition of
help, but higher        expenditure away from poorly-targeted fuel subsidies, which accounted for 20
private investment is   percent of central government spending in 2014, created the fiscal space for the
required for a firm     significant rise in public investment which supported the economy last year. In 2016,
recovery                fiscal stimulus will be necessary to support the economic recovery. Revenues are
                        likely to be weaker than the target in the 2016 Budget, owing largely to lower than
                        expected global oil and gas prices. Thus, preserving capital spending would require a
                        higher fiscal deficit of 2.8 percent of GDP and cuts in non-priority expenditures.
                        However, in 2016 this fiscal expansion alone may not raise growth above 5 percent.
                        That will depend on an improvement in private sector activity, in particular
                        investment.

Growth picked up in     Driven mostly by public spending, as mentioned above, GDP growth increased to
the final quarter of    5.0 yoy in Q4 2015, from 4.7 percent in each of the preceding three quarters.
2015, supported         Central government fixed investment is estimated to have increased by 74.0 percent
mostly by public        yoy in real terms in Q4, compared with 49.5 percent yoy in the previous quarter.
spending…               The strong performance of public investment, however, implies that private capital
                        formation weakened further in the last quarter of 2015. Private consumption growth
                        remained moderate, while export and import volumes continued to decline.

… while export          A significant external adjustment was observed in 2015, with the current account
revenues, both from     deficit narrowing to 2.1 percent of GDP, from 3.1 in 2014. However, the
commodities and         improvement in the trade balance was due to significant import contraction, while
manufacturing,          export revenues fell by 14.4 percent relative to 2014. In the fourth quarter, subdued
continued to decline    global growth and a real exchange rate appreciation of 6.0 percent weighed on
                        exports, with the year-on-year decline in both goods and services exports
                        accelerating. Manufacturing exports, the biggest contributor to the overall decline,
                        decreased by 13.4 percent yoy. As commodity prices continued to fall, commodity
                        revenues remained a drag on exports, with oil and gas, coal and palm oil each
                        declining by 42.1, 26.5 and 19.3 percent yoy.

Foreign investment      In 2015, Indonesia’s financial account balance declined sharply too, as capital fled
into government         emerging markets in the summer. Total 2015 capital flows to Indonesia declined to
bonds in Q4 2015        USD 17.1 billion, from USD 45 billion in 2014. With the decline in global financial
stemmed the outflow     volatility towards the end of last year, Q4 net portfolio inflows rose to USD 4.8
of capital from         billion, USD 3.5 billion of which was investment in a government global bond.
Indonesia…              Overall, Indonesia performed better than the 30 emerging economies tracked by the
                        Institute of International Finance, that cumulatively (excluding Indonesia, and China
                        which experienced massive outflows of USD 676 billion) recorded an aggregate
                        outflow of about USD 70 billion in 2015. Despite the recent return in foreign
                        investor appetite towards Indonesia, external financing risks from weak trade and
                        capital flows remain elevated in the near term.

… stabilizing the       Higher government bond inflows since November have resulted in Rupiah
Rupiah and, coupled     appreciation. In addition, headline CPI inflation, at 4.4 percent yoy in February, is
with lower inflation,   expected to stay within the Bank Indonesia (BI) target range in 2016. A stronger
allowing monetary       Rupiah and lower inflation allowed the central bank to begin easing monetary policy
easing in 2016          in January with two consecutive interest rate cuts of 25 basis points each. Despite
                        better domestic and foreign funding conditions, bank credit remains tight and
                        lending rates have not yet responded to policy rate cuts. Nevertheless, monetary
                        easing is likely to be gradual on account of two factors. First, there is a risk of higher
                        than projected headline inflation as domestic food prices remain volatile, partly
                        owing to El Nino-related harvest delays. Second, BI is expected to remain
                        concerned about Rupiah stability amid continuing global financial market volatility.

                         support growth. The projected pickup in economic activity in 2016 also relies on

                        opportunities), integration into global value chains, and production and export

Downward revisions   Global growth disappointed again in 2015, declining to 2.4 percent, from 2.6
to global growth     percent in 2014 (Figure 1).1 The World Bank now projects growth to remain below
mean stronger        3.0 percent in 2016. A key reason for the prolonged growth slowdown is weaker
headwinds for        economic activity in emerging and developing economies. China’s economy is
Indonesia            forecast to continue to decelerate and rebalance, with growth at 6.7 percent this
                     year. Output in Brazil and Russia is expected to contract for a second year. Among
                     the BRICS2, only growth in India remains buoyant. Spillovers to other countries
                     from the slowdown in the BRICS could be significant. The World Bank estimates
                     that a one-off, one-percentage-point decline in China's growth rate reduces growth
                     in Indonesia – via trade and financial links – by about 0.4 percentage points after
                     two years.3

Commodity prices     Given the more modest growth trend in large emerging markets, Indonesia will have

decline…             trade flows are weaker than in the decade before the global financial crisis. Energy
                     prices have fallen to about 50 percent and non-energy prices to 70 percent of their
                     2011 peak levels. In January, the World Bank revised down the projected 2016
                     prices of all of Indonesia’s major export commodities, except coal: by 19 percent for
                     liquefied natural gas, 16 percent for rubber, 13 percent for copper, and 5 percent for
                     palm oil.4 These developments are likely to strain both export revenues and
                     government finances in Indonesia in the near term.

diminished                     trade growth is forecast to improve, the relationship between global trade and global
                               growth is expected to remain weaker than in the years before the global financial
                               crisis (Figure 1). Among the reasons for this are the slowing pace of international
                               vertical specialization, the loss of trade liberalization momentum, and a lower share
                               of investment (which has a larger import content than, say, private consumption) in

                               better growth prospects relative to peer countries and higher real returns (Figure 2).

                         outlook for 2016 to remain dependent on fiscal expansion, with private sector
                         spending picking up later in the year. Maintaining the fiscal stimulus in 2016 would
                         require an expansion of the fiscal deficit to 2.8 percent of GDP and non-priority

                        percent yoy in February, after the Government allowed rice imports (see also Box
                        1). The recent appreciation of the Rupiah and drop in global oil prices allowed the
                        state-owned electricity company PLN to lower the unsubsidized tariffs by IDR 100
                        per kWh in January and another IDR 20 in February, thus contributing to lower
                        inflation.

Headline inflation is   The World Bank expects an annual average CPI inflation rate of 4.0 percent in 2016,
projected to stay       increasing to an average rate of 4.6 percent in 2017 as economic activity gradually
within the BI target    picks up. The Government’s response to insufficient rice stocks in H2 2015 –
range                   allowing about 1.5 million tons of imported rice from Thailand and Vietnam – has
                        helped limit food price pressures. However, the main season rice harvest has been
                        delayed and food prices are expected to remain volatile in the next few months. The
                        risk of higher than projected headline inflation and the need to maintain Rupiah
                        stability amid continuing global financial market volatility are likely to keep
                        monetary easing gradual.

Box 1: Why are domestic rice prices higher than international prices?
In the 1970s through the 1990s, the Government succeeded in stabilizing domestic rice prices, which tracked the long-
term global trend and were less volatile (Figure 7). However, retail prices in Indonesia have diverged from declining world
prices in recent years. The reason for this is both higher farm prices and higher wholesale prices in Indonesia compared
to neighbors such as Thailand (Figure 8). High domestic rice prices benefit wholesale traders and 8.4 million rice-growing
households which are net producers, but hurt 53 million households which are net rice consumers.1

There are three main reasons for the divergence of Indonesian rice prices from the international trend since the mid-
2000s. First, demand continues to outpace supply, while imports are restricted. While per capita consumption of rice has
been declining, total consumption continues to grow with the increase in population and in the consumption of derived
rice products. At the same time, since 1990 total production has grown at less than half the rate of 1961-1990, with falling
yields as the main driver. Second, the political balance has shifted towards well-organized agricultural producers lobby
groups supporting policies to keep the rice price high.2 Third, the government’s main rice price stabilization measures:
market operations, a government rice purchasing program, and import restrictions, have only partially met their
objectives.

Considering the Government’s price stabilization programs in more detail: the Government sells rice through market
operations (Operasi Pasar, OP) when the medium-quality rice price has remained 10 percent higher than the average of
the previous three months for more than one week. OP are usually conducted with delay and do not target consumers
well. The second program sets a Government Purchasing Price (Harga Pembelian Pemerintah or HPP) at which Bulog, the
national logistics agency, procures domestic rice or paddy. During harvest seasons, as supply increases and prices fall, the
HPP should in theory become a price floor for rice producers. However, in recent years, market prices have always been
higher than the HPP, a sign of market rice shortages. Finally, instead of improving Bulog’s capacity to stabilize rice prices,
the Government’s discretionary rice import policy has actually undermined it. The difficulty of anticipating rice shortages
and correctly timing imports has resulted in market speculation and hoarding behavior, raising rice price volatility.

Based on empirical estimates of the drivers of rice prices at Jakarta’s main wholesale market, we find that keeping a
sufficient Bulog stock level has a significant price-reducing effect in January, before the main season harvest. Rice for the
Poor (Raskin), a social assistance program, which subsidizes up to 15 kg of rice per month for targeted poor households,
has about ten times the marginal effect of reducing prices compared to market operations.3 We also find evidence that
high wholesale rice stocks relative to wholesale sales are associated with higher rice prices. This seems to indicate hoarding
behavior by wholesale traders.

Notes: 1 The calculations are based on the 2013 National Social Economic Survey (Survei Sosial Ekonomi Nasional, Susenas). Because
Susenas does not collect data on rice production (except in 2004), we proxy rice production by adding rice consumed from own
production and rice sold as main income of households in paddy agriculture.

3 Note that, although Raskin targets an equal amount of distribution every month, it actually varies every month, leading to changes in

rice prices.

                     (Figure 10). In contrast, imports – across categories – seem to have bottomed out in

aim to strengthen     capital buffer that requires banks to form additional capital during economic booms.
banking sector        The objective of this macro-prudential measure is to protect banks from excessive
resilience            risk-taking behavior during economic upturns, which could increase banking
                      systemic risk. The magnitude of the countercyclical buffer ranges from zero to 2.5
                      percent of risk-weighted assets. BI has set the current rate at zero percent and will
                      evaluate the size at least once every six months. In line with this measure, the
                      Financial Services Authority (Otoritas Jasa Keuangan, OJK) issued a regulation on the
                      determination of systematically important banks and a capital surcharge for these
                      banks that aims to minimize the risk of systemic bank failures. Both regulations are
                      expected to strengthen banking sector resilience to potential risk of losses during
                      economic downturns.
               6. Revenue performance is expected to constrain the expansionary fiscal
                  stance
Fiscal policy         A higher fiscal deficit, as well as lower energy subsidy spending and natural resource
supported growth in   non-tax revenue sharing transfers to sub-national governments, allowed the
H2 2015, despite      Government to preserve public investment amid lower than expected revenues. The
weak revenue          2015 preliminary realized fiscal deficit was 2.5 percent of GDP, higher than the
collection            revised Budget target of 1.9 percent. Both revenue collection and expenditure
                      disbursement picked up significantly in December, recording stronger monthly
                      outturns than in the previous years. The Government was able to limit the financing
                      risks of a higher than targeted deficit by frontloading bond issuance and borrowing
                      from multilateral donors. In fact, the Ministry of Finance raised IDR 341.2 trillion

Revenues, especially    Total 2015 preliminary realized revenues were IDR 1,504 trillion, IDR 258 trillion
from the oil and gas    below the revised Budget target and 3.0 percent less than in 2014 (Table 4). Oil and
sector, decreased in    gas-related revenues contributed 11.4 percentage points to the decline in total
2015…                   revenues, owing to the significant drop in international oil and gas prices and lower
                        than targeted oil production (Figure 15). Although falling short of the revised
                        Budget target by IDR 249 trillion, tax revenues rose by 8.5 percent in 2015. In
                        particular, tax collection in December increased significantly to IDR 225 trillion,
                        compared with a January-November monthly average of IDR 92 trillion and with
                        IDR 144 trillion in December 2014. A strong pickup in December was recorded
                        across all major tax categories, including non-oil and gas income taxes, VAT, and
                        excises.

… despite unusually     While historically December is one of the strongest months for tax collection, the
high income and         increase observed in 2015 was significantly higher than in previous years. A key
excise tax collection   reason for this was the fixed asset revaluation facility.8 Between October 15, 2015,
in December             when the facility was established, and December 31, 2015, total tax revenue from
                        asset revaluation was IDR 20.1 trillion.9 In addition, a change in the rules on the
                        payment of excise taxes by tobacco producers resulted in a fourfold increase in the
                        monthly excise tax collection, to IDR 37.2 trillion in December.10

Maintaining the         In 2015, the Government increased the fiscal deficit to 2.5 percent of GDP, from
infrastructure          1.9 percent of GDP in the revised Budget, to preserve public investment. Lower

priority in H2 2015     Government made several expenditure adjustments: used the space provided by the
                        contingency budget; introduced measures, such as stricter rules for spending on
                        travel and meetings, to manage and control other expenditures; and improved
                        budget execution monitoring.11 As a result, capital expenditure increased by 42
                        percent relative to 2014, though it was 24 percent short of the target set in the
                        revised 2016 Budget (Figure 16).

                          This facility allows individuals and companies to apply for revaluation of their fixed assets, where the
                          increase in fixed assets resulting from the revaluation (i.e., the difference between the new value of
                          assets and the tax book value before revaluation) is subject to a reduced rate of “final income tax”
                          ranging from 3 to 6 percent, depending on when the application is filed. This compares to a standard

                          were allowed to postpone the payment of excise tariffs for 2 months after they ordered the excise
                          stamps, regardless of the month of order. Starting 2015, all payments for stamps orders have to be
                          made by December 31 of the current year. As a result, the December 2015 collection of IDR 37.3
                          trillion consists of payments for October, November and December 2015 orders of stamps (including
                          around IDR 7 trillion of advance orders for 2016).
                        11 The President formed a new team, TEPRA (see Part A.6 of the December 2015 IEQ), to monitor

                          and eliminate constraints to budget execution. In addition, the Government delayed payments for

In 2016, the                  Looking to 2016, the Budget approved in October 2015 sets a revenue target of
Government expects            IDR 1,822 trillion, which is 3.4 percent higher than the revised 2015 Budget and
lower oil and gas             21.1 percent higher than the 2015 preliminary revenue realization. This projection
revenues and                  assumes a decline in oil and gas-related revenues due to lower oil and gas prices. At
improvements in tax           the same time, a significant increase in non-oil and gas income taxes of 29.6 percent
collection…                   is expected. The 2016 Budget accounts for the impact of several tax measures,
                              including a planned adjustment in excise tariffs and improvements in tax
                              administration through IT, audit procedures, and law enforcement. The
                              Government expects around IDR 100 trillion of revenues from a tax amnesty, the
                              bill for which has been submitted to Parliament.12

… and further                 As discussed in the December 2015 IEQ, the 2016 Budget foresees further
improvement in the            improvements in the composition of spending, including further reduction in energy
composition of                subsidies and higher spending on health, infrastructure and social assistance. In
spending                      contrast to 2015, the increase in public infrastructure investment will be channeled
                              through transfers to local governments ear-marked for capital spending and capital
                              injections into state-owned enterprises rather than central government spending.
                              Total expenditure is set at IDR 2,096 trillion (16.5 percent of GDP), an increase of
                              16.7 percent relative to the 2015 preliminary outcomes. As with infrastructure, the
                              overall expenditure increase is primarily driven by a sharp rise in transfers to local
                              governments, including the Specific Allocation Grant (Dana Alokasi Khusus, DAK)
                              and Village Funds to support the Government’s priority to accelerate rural
                              development (see also Box 2).

Budget execution is           With respect to budget implementation, in 2015 the Government introduced
expected to improve           measures to increase the use of early procurement, particularly for infrastructure
in 2016                       projects.13 In early January, the Ministry of Public Work and Housing signed
                              contracts worth IDR 8.8 trillion for a number of infrastructure projects (644

                         contract packages).14 Additional measures aim to strengthen the regulatory
                         framework to facilitate private sector participation in infrastructure development.15
                         To reduce the high level of accumulated cash (“idle money”) at the sub-national
                         level, the Ministry of Finance issued a regulation that allows the central government
                         to provide government bonds instead of cash transfers to local governments with a
                         large surplus.16 This policy is expected to be implemented in March 2016.

The World Bank           The World Bank projects revenues to increase to IDR 1,547 trillion in 2016, which
expects revenues to      is broadly consistent with recent press statements made by the Ministry of
increase to IDR 1,547    Finance.17 The baseline forecast accounts for the sharp fall in international oil and
trillion in 2016…        gas prices, lower oil production, and continuing moderate rates of growth in
                         nominal GDP, import and private consumption expected in 2016 (see Section 2).
                         The World Bank baseline includes additional revenue mobilization from intensified
                         tax enforcement efforts and tax administration reforms implemented in 2014-2015,
                         including the roll-out of electronic VAT invoicing, expansion of electronic tax filing,
                         establishment of a unique taxpayer ID system, and improvement in access to land
                         asset data for audit purposes. The baseline forecast does not include any revenues
                         from the tax amnesty, as it is still unclear if and when the Amnesty bill would be
                         passed and implemented.18

… and a fiscal deficit Constrained by the relatively weak revenue growth projected for 2016, the
to reach 2.8 percent   Government has two policy options to support public investment and growth:
of GDP                 expand the general government deficit within the fiscal rule of 3 percent GDP, and
                       reduce non-priority (non-infrastructure related) spending. Assuming the
                       Government takes advantage of both options, in the base case the World Bank
                       expects 2016 expenditure disbursement to be limited to about 91 percent of the
                       target, at 1,906 trillion, and the fiscal deficit to reach 2.8 percent of GDP, higher
                       than the 2.2 percent of GDP target in the 2016 Budget.

Several policy           Looking beyond 2016, the Government has either undertaken or plans to introduce
options could help       a number of reforms to increase tax collection in the medium term. Some of these
deal with weak           measures provide an opportunity to broaden the tax base and reduce economic
revenues in the          distortions: e.g. revisions of the VAT and the Income Tax Laws planned for
medium run               submission to Parliament in 2016, and a planned revision of the final tax regime for
                         micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). On the administration side,
                         the Directorate General of Tax plans to ease the process of registering for and filing
                         taxes electronically, to make e-filing mandatory for certain types of taxes and
                         taxpayers, and to improve auditing processes and law enforcement. However, all of
                         these measures will need to be supported by strengthened IT and data management

                         14 Presidential Instruction 1/2015; Minister of Public Works and Housing Instruction 3/2015; and

                           governments that have accumulated cash balances higher than the sum of operational expenditure
                           and 30 percent of capital expenditure for the following three months.

                         18 In addition to differences in macroeconomic assumptions and the treatment of the tax amnesty, the

                           World Bank revenue forecast is lower than the 2016 Budget, because the latter was prepared in July
                           2015 when the full extent of the 2015 revenue shortfall was not known.

                                motivating factor to further improve the quality of public spending by improving

Box 2: Sub-national governments play an important role in delivering public investment
  Following decentralization in 2001, both provincial and local governments have played an important role in
  delivering public services, including investment. Management of and investment in local roads, schools, hospitals,
  and government building, and the provision of water supply are among the functions assigned to sub-national
  governments.
  Recent data suggest that sub-national capital expenditure increased on average by 19 percent nominally between 2011
  and 2015, but remains low as a share of total expenditure (24 percent) compared to 43 percent for personnel and
  administration (Table 5). Nonetheless, sub-national capital spending, equivalent to 1.9 percent of GDP, comprised
  more than half of total national public investment in 2015. The funding for subnational public investment comes
  from several sources: earmarked transfers (Dana Alokasi Khusus, DAK) which represented 25 percent of total sub-
  national capital spending in 2015 and are mainly used by local governments; own generated revenue; revenue sharing
  transfers from the central government; and non-earmarked transfers (Dana Alokasi Umum, DAU), and the Village
  Fund (Dana Desa).
  Given the large share of sub-national spending in total public investment, improving the quality of sub-national
  capital expenditure is an important policy challenge. Recent studies suggest that, though sub-national spending on
  roads has increased, the road condition has not improved. Spending on new road development has been prioritized
  at the expense of road maintenance.1 In the water and sanitation sector, despite a sevenfold real increase in total
  government spending in the sector since 2005, the usage of piped water for drinking has fallen and the use for
  cleaning purposes has been broadly flat.2 In addition, a substantial proportion of local government investment
  spending has gone to relatively unproductive assets, such as administrative office buildings.3 This was most likely
  driven by the increasing number of local governments following decentralization, from 336 in 2001 to 508 in 2015.

                    7. Poverty reduction has stalled
High food prices               The latest estimates by Statistics Indonesia (Badan Pusat Statistik, BPS) show an
continue to                    official poverty rate of 11.1 percent in September 2015, 0.2 percentage points higher
significantly impact           than a year earlier (Figure 17).19 Slowing poverty reduction can be attributed to
the poverty rate               moderating economic growth, slower job creation, significant Rupiah depreciation
                               since 2013, and persistently high consumer (especially food) price inflation.
                               Unprocessed food prices in Indonesia rose by 7.2 percent in 2015, contributing to
                               an overall CPI inflation rate of 6.4 percent. With food making up 73.1 percent of
                               the poverty line in September 2015, the high levels of food price inflation have
                               resulted in a poverty line increase to IDR 344,809, up 10.4 percent from September
                               2014. The relative stability of the Rupiah and lower inflation since November 2015
                               may be reflected in better poverty outcomes in 2016.

The trend of slower            The latest poverty rate follows the trend of slowing poverty reduction in recent
poverty reduction              years. Since 2010, the poverty rate has decreased by an average of 0.5 percentage
observed in recent             points per year, compared with the relatively large average declines of 1.2 percentage
years has continued            points between 2007 and 2009. In addition to the cyclical factors mentioned above,
                               there are several long-term causes of the slowdown in poverty reduction. Structural
                               factors in the agricultural sector, such as falling productivity, poor infrastructure,
                               and restricted imports, have driven domestic food prices higher when global food
                               prices have been declining (see Section 3). Second, there are persistent pockets of
                               poverty which appear relatively little affected by growth. The poorest one percent of
                               Indonesians were able to afford just over half of their basic needs in March 2015
                               (i.e. their consumption comprised 55 percent of the poverty line) (Figure 18). This
                               means that higher consumption growth – if shared equally – is required to maintain
                               the rate of poverty reduction. Finally, there are many Indonesians (67.5 million in


                               19 Although this is a slight drop from the March 2015 poverty rate of 11.2 percent, income seasonality
                                 makes comparisons between the March and September rates difficult. Note also that recent changes
                                 in the Susenas methodology, implemented with the March 2015 survey, have made the latest data not
                                 directly comparable to data from previous years. See also Part A, Section 7 of the October 2015 IEQ.

                8. External risks to the macro-fiscal outlook remain significant
The risks to the         Downside risks continue to dominate the World Bank’s outlook for Indonesia. With
projected global         respect to the external environment, the risks have become increasingly linked to the
growth and trade         economic performance of emerging and developing countries. A stronger-than-
recovery are tilted to   expected slowdown in China could have substantial spillovers on other countries,
the downside…            including Indonesia. The impact could be transmitted through both lower import
                         demand volumes and weaker commodity prices, as well as financial links. Despite
                         the significant decline in exports to China – which in 2015 were at two-thirds of
                         their 2011 level – the country remains one of Indonesia’s largest trading partners
                         with a 10-percent share in total exports (three quarters of which commodities).
                         Finally, although Indonesian assets have become relatively more attractive to foreign
                         investors in recent months, the country remains exposed to the risk of renewed
                         increases in global risk aversion.

… while fiscal           In a difficult macroeconomic environment and with growth dependent on fiscal
stimulus may require     stimulus, weak revenue performance has emerged as a major policy challenge.
a higher deficit and     Although energy subsidy reform reduced the impact of oil prices on spending, state
non-priority             revenues remain significantly affected by the global commodity price cycle. In 2014
spending cuts            and 2015, the Government undertook several short-term measures, such as a lower
                         tax tariff on asset revaluation, to raise revenue collection, but their effect was not
                         enough to compensate for the decline in oil and gas related revenues. Therefore,
                         weaker than expected revenues this year are likely to be offset by expenditure
                         adjustment (by reducing material and contingency spending) and a higher fiscal
                         deficit (but within the legal ceiling of 3 percent of GDP for the general
                         government), so that capital spending cuts are minimized as in 2015. On the upside,
                         the tax amnesty, if approved by Parliament in the first half of 2016 as planned, may
                         bring in additional revenues this year.

Despite more             Given a projected fiscal deficit of 2.8 percent of GDP and the debt amortization
favorable fiscal         and non-debt needs estimated by the Ministry of Finance,20 the World Bank
financing conditions,    estimates gross financing needs at IDR 711 trillion (5.6 percent of GDP). Such a
risks remain in 2016     significant increase, of around 19 percent relative to 2015, in financing needs may be
                         associated with higher financing risks and costs. Despite declining borrowing costs,
                         with local currency sovereign yields down by about 80 basis points in the year to
                         March 9 for the 10-year bond, financial conditions remain volatile (see Section 1).
                         However, as in 2015 the Government has proactively taken measures to manage
                         such risks, frontloading its market financing strategy. As of February 16, the
                         government has secured IDR 136 trillion from securities issuance.

               1. Beyond the ten economic policy packages: addressing significant binding
                  constraints
The Government has      Since September 2015, the Government has released ten economic policy packages
released ten            aimed at attracting foreign investment, revitalizing industry, facilitating trade and
economic policy         logistics, and easing access to raw materials. The packages are comprehensive and
packages of diverse     wide-ranging, covering areas such as trade, energy, investment licenses, small- and
policy measures         medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), minimum wage setting, tax relief, special
                        economic zones, land title registration, logistics, and investment liberalization. To
                        give one example, the revision of the Negative Investment List (Daftar Negatif
                        Investasi, DNI), announced on February 11, 2016, opens 29 business fields (e.g.,
                        crumb rubber and cold storage) to 100 percent foreign ownership. It also raises the
                        foreign equity limit to 67 percent for 29 business fields (e.g., one- and two-star
                        hotels, warehousing, and loading/unloading cargo) and opens 19 business fields
                        (e.g., passenger land transport, electricity installation), previously closed to foreign
                        owners, for foreign investment with some restrictions.21

This article proposes   The current packages are focused on micro-level regulations, aiming at dismantling
additional reforms      unnecessary regulatory barriers for product markets in various sectors and for
which could help        different types of businesses (foreign, domestic, large, and small). This section
relax binding           attempts to contribute to the public policy dialogue by offering a list of several
constraints to growth   reforms in a select number of key sectors – logistics, trade, investment, and financial
                        markets – which have the potential to address important binding constraints to
                        higher growth in Indonesia.



                        21However, the revision also introduces several restrictive measures. For example, 19 business fields in
                         the public works sector are reserved for MSMEs and firms in 3 business fields (e.g. retail trade
                         through mail order or internet) are added to the list requiring partnership with MSMEs.

                        a. Logistics reforms

The Indonesian             Efficient freight logistics are key in integrating domestic supply chains into global
logistics sector will      value chains. However, Indonesia’s logistics sector is far from efficient (see Part
benefit from               C.1). Surveys conducted by the World Bank suggest that almost two thirds of
efficiency gains…          Indonesian manufacturers have in-house as opposed to outsourced logistics
                           activities, a clear signal of the lack of trust in the capability of local logistics service
                           providers (LSPs). In addition, on average 19 out of 100 orders delivered to
                           manufacturers will either be late or some units will be missing, a higher share than
                           most countries. Logistics services are also expensive in Indonesia, with total logistics
                           costs comprising 20 percent of sales of manufacturers compared with 15 and 13
                           percent in Thailand and Malaysia.

… such as those            One important reason for inefficient logistics in Indonesia is the high minimum
obtained by lowering       capital and reserve requirements for LSPs. For example, the capital requirements for
the high minimum           freight forwarders, a key player in the logistics chain, are USD 1.8 million. This
capital requirements       requirement for foreign operators can be as high as USD 10 million. By
for LSPs…                  comparison, the capital requirement is USD 79,000 in Singapore and USD 65,000 in
                           Thailand.22 Evidence shows that such high capital and reserve requirements
                           significantly deter firm entry and reduce the ability of firms to spend on hiring,
                           training, equipment or developing services.23 At the same time, such requirements
                           also fail to serve their intended purpose of protecting consumers and creditors from
                           hastily established and potentially insolvent firms. Drastically reducing, or removing,
                           these capital requirements for LSPs can go a long way in increasing competition, as
                           well as firms’ investment in improving the quality and efficiency of their operations.

…and clarifying the        Another key factor behind the inefficient logistics services is the lack of clarity on
investment                 the roles of port authorities and port operators, which has led to severe under-
responsibilities of        investment in port infrastructure. According to the Shipping Law, the port authority
port authorities and       is responsible for investing in the port’s infrastructure. In practice, only the port
port operators             operators – the state-owned enterprises Pelindos – have been able to invest in
                           infrastructure development in recent years. The disconnect between the law and
                           reality has led to a general under-investment in port infrastructure, as no entity
                           appears to have both capacity and responsibility to invest in port development.
                           Under-investment, such as in berth length, access channels, yard space, gates, access
                           roads, and cargo handling equipment, is particularly severe in medium and smaller
                           public ports, especially in Eastern Indonesia. Most Indonesian public port
                           infrastructure is inadequate to host modern vessels and ensure rapid turn-around
                           times. Limited port capacity also hampers the expansion of cargo traffic.24 In

                           22 The minimum capital requirement for terminal operators is USD 72 million in the main ports,
                             including ports like Ambon. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that over 7 years of revenues
                             are needed to fulfill such a capital requirement. For shipping liners the capital requirement is USD 3.6
                             million, compared with USD 35,000 in Singapore.

                           24 For example, the ports of Jayapura and Kupang are expected to reach full capacity in 2016 and 2017,

                             respectively. On the other hand, when infrastructure expansion does happen, such as in the case of
                             the recent berth extension in the port of Ambon, then larger and more modern vessels are employed,
                             turn-around time is reduced and logistics costs are reduced. World Bank, 2015, “Port development

                        addition, the lack of clarity also hinders the ability of the state to act as an effective
                        regulator of the port terminal operators. The Pelindos effectively operate the ports -
                        sometimes in conjunction with private firms - and at the same time regulate much
                        of the ports’ operations. Unless the government clarifies the roles of port authorities
                        and port operators in the development and management of the ports, investment in
                        port infrastructure will remain inadequate.
                   b. Trade policy

Numerous trade-         Trade-related non-tariff measures (NTMs) are a legitimate tool to protect the health,
related non-tariff      safety, and security of consumers. However, governments often use NTMs to
measures remain in      restrict trade. In 2015, 62 percent of about 10,000 product categories of goods
place despite recent    traded internationally were restricted with NTMs in Indonesia.25 As part of its first
deregulation efforts    economic policy package, the Government announced a large number of revisions
                        to trade regulations. These included the elimination of a number of NTMs,
                        including product-specific import licenses such as surveyor verifications, registered
                        and producer importer licenses, and technical and administrative requirements. As
                        these regulations are product-specific, they make up only a small portion of all
                        NTMs.

Improving NTM           As part of the Government’s deregulation drive, an inter-ministerial team could be
regulations requires    tasked with reviewing, rejecting or approving NTMs. The team could focus on
a centralized review    reviewing existing NTMs based on a number of simple criteria: whether the
system                  regulation in question conflicts with another, whether it addresses a particular
                        market failure, and whether it is in line with Indonesia’s international trade
                        obligations. The team could also review future flows of NTMs to ensure that
                        markets remain competitive and businesses are not burdened by unnecessary
                        regulations. The creation of such an office, similar to the regulatory review body
                        proposed below, could play an important part in improving the quality of
                        Indonesia’s trade regulations.
                   c. Investment climate

To improve the          In the last two years, the establishment of an One Stop Service (OSS) for
investment climate,     investment licenses has been a priority of the Government to improve the
the Government has      investment climate at the national and sub-national level. The economic policy
further accelerated     packages introduced several simplified and accelerated licensing and non-licensing
and simplified          services. At the national level, approximately 160 such services have been delegated
several licensing       to the national OSS hosted by Indonesia’s Investment Coordinating Board (Badan
services                Kordinasi Penanaman Modal, BKPM).26 However, investors and businesses need to
                        obtain many other licenses from various levels of government. Also, there is no up-
                        to-date, comprehensive list of the licensing and regulatory requirements that firms
                        needs to comply with.

An objective and        A more systematic approach is needed to take stock of existing business, investment
systematic regulatory   and trade regulations and identify and cancel ones that are conflicting and
review mechanism is     unnecessary.. This applies especially to local regulations, which thus far have not

                         resulting in a complex and confusing environment for businesses and investors to
                         navigate. As is the case with NTMs, investment and business licensing lacks an
                         objective regulatory review mechanism. The National Regulatory Reform Roadmap,
                         as announced in the first economic policy package, could be the basis for such an
                         effective regulatory review process.

… as is a licensing      The Government could start by gathering information on licenses in a
inventory                comprehensive licensing depository of regulatory requirements that can be accessed
                         online. For the depository to remain up to date, its governance arrangements would
                         need to ensure that the various license-issuing bodies provide the latest information.
                         Collecting all licenses in a single depository can lead to concrete reform actions: in
                         some countries, such as South Korea, Sweden, and Mexico, a “regulatory guillotine”
                         was subsequently organized to test the legality, necessity and business friendliness of
                         a given regulatory requirement with three possible outcomes – abolish, amend or
                         leave as is.

Local content            An additional area for investment reforms is local content requirements. In the past
requirements could       few years, the Government issued several measures that regulate minimum local

they hurt firm           industry, a recent measure introduced a minimum 30-40 percent local content
competitiveness          requirement for 4G/LTE equipment.28 The Ministry of Trade imposed local
                         content measures for the franchise business sector (including for food and beverage
                         and modern retail) that require the franchisee to source domestically a minimum of
                         80 percent of its raw materials, equipment and inventory.29 Other business sectors
                         impacted by these measures include electricity and oil and gas.30 Although local
                         content requirements aim to stimulate domestic production, they could

                      risk that the revised, low-interest rate, high-disbursement rate KUR program may
                      encourage looser bank credit standards, thus weakening bank asset quality. The
                      current scheme could be improved by introducing sectoral differentiation of loans,
                      as MSMEs in different economic sectors face different constraints and risks. For
                      instance, farmers need several months to repay a loan as they wait for the harvest,
                      while movable food stall owners are able to repay after a month.

                         a. Public concern about rising inequality has increased in recent years

Inequality in                 Inequality in Indonesia has risen sharply in recent years. During the Suharto era, it
Indonesia has risen           remained stable even through periods of high economic growth, only increasing
sharply since the             slightly in the mid-1990s. During the 1997/98 Asian Financial Crisis, inequality fell
early 2000s…                  as those who were better off bore the brunt of the economic shock and saw their
                              incomes slow to recover. Since the crisis, however, Indonesia’s inequality has risen
                              steadily: the Gini coefficient, a measure of inequality where 0 represents perfect
                              equality and 100 represents perfect inequality, increased from 30 in 2000 to 41 in
                              2014 (Figure 20).

… but few                     In the decade following the Asian Financial Crisis, the Indonesian public showed
Indonesians worried           little concern about rising inequality. When the World Values Survey was conducted
about inequality in           in 2001, at a time when Indonesia’s inequality was still at a post-crisis low, a majority
the first half of the         of Indonesians favored higher inequality as an incentive for individual effort. The
decade                        2006 World Values Survey revealed that beliefs regarding the incentive value of
                              inequality had not yet changed, although inequality had risen significantly by then
                              (Figure 21).

  Indonesians today                           Indonesians think that the current level of inequality is higher than what they would
  perceive income                             consider ideal. The 2014 survey respondents indicated that the ideal income
  inequality as high…                         distribution would be one where the richest 20 percent of the population earn as
                                              much as the poorest 40 percent (Figure 24). This “ideal distribution”, if realized,
                                              would put Indonesia’s Gini coefficient at a level of 14, lower than any income
                                              distribution found in the real world. The respondents also estimated that the actual
                                              income distribution is higher, with the top 20 percent earning as much as the
                                              bottom 60 percent, roughly corresponding to a Gini coefficient of 30.

                         combined, with an actual Gini coefficient of 41. Furthermore, because household

                         level of inequality in Indonesia is likely to be even higher.

Indonesians support      There is strong public support for social protection policies that provide direct
policies that protect    assistance to the poorest 40 percent of the population. When asked about the main
the poor from            causes of poverty, 57 percent of respondents cited external reasons that are beyond
shocks…                  an individual’s control, such as coming from a poor family (22 percent) or having
                         bad luck (16 percent). So, when the perceptions survey asked respondents to
                         identify top priorities to address inequality, nearly half of all respondents supported
                         social protection programs as a key policy measure (Table 6). The survey provides
                         the following examples of social protection programs: subsidized rice (Beras untuk
                         Rumah Tangga Miskin, Raskin), unconditional cash transfers (Bantuan Langsung Tunai,
                         BLT), financial aid for poor students (Bantuan Siswa Miskin, BSM), and health
                         insurance (Jaminan Kesehatan Masyarakat, Jamkesmas).

                         32 The LSI survey asks specifically about income distributions. Susenas data measure consumption,
                           which is a standard proxy for income. However, income is always more unequal than consumption,
                           because the richest households do not use all of their income for consumption. Thus, consumption
                           distribution data usually underestimate actual income inequality.
                         33 The Rural PNPM program was phased out in 2015 and replaced by the 2014 Village Law (UU Desa),

                           which increased national and district government transfers directly to the country’s 74,000 rural
                           villages.

better jobs …           better work opportunities for people. When asked whether it was possible for
                        people to pull themselves out of poverty if they worked hard enough, 52 percent of
                        respondents answered that that would be easy to do, 41 percent said that it would
                        difficult but doable, and only 7 percent believed that it was impossible. Accordingly,
                        nearly half of all respondents considered job creation policies a top priority, while
                        complementary policies, such as credit for small- and medium-sized enterprises and
                        improving the quality of education, were also supported.

drivers of inequality   assessed four drivers of Indonesia’s inequality: inequality of opportunities,
                        fragmentation of the labor market, inequality of wealth accumulation, and unequal
                        resilience to shocks. The report then identified four main policy response areas.
                        First, public service delivery improvements are needed to provide an equal start in
                        health and education for all children. Second, the poor need access to more and
                        better jobs in order to address inequality in the labor market. Third, unequal
                        accumulation of wealth through financial assets can be addressed through making
                        the tax system more progressive and eradicating corruption. Finally, it is important
                        to introduce measures to help all people, but especially the poor and vulnerable,
                        mitigate and cope with shocks. The overlap between these research findings and the
                        perceptions survey results provides the Government with an opportunity to pursue
                        policies that are both publicly supported and proven effective in practice.

                1. Improving the freight logistics system in Indonesia35
Indonesia needs          Indonesia’s unique geography means that connecting spatially separated sources of
better connectivity      supply and demand is crucial for economic development. Connectivity enables the
to lower poverty and     flow of goods, services and people. Improved connectivity supports higher growth
boost growth             rates and helps reduce poverty. This section of the IEQ looks at the consequences
                         of failing to reform the logistics sector in terms of missed opportunities, highlights
                         the main challenges Indonesia faces in strengthening its freight logistics system and
                         improving connectivity, and discusses how some of the “symptoms” of Indonesia’s
                         poor logistics system might be addressed.

Indonesia needs to      If the higher rates of growth necessary to reduce poverty and share prosperity are to
help lagging regions    be achieved, Indonesia will need to remove barriers currently preventing lagging
to access growth-       regions from linking to more growth-generating opportunities. Lagging regions are
generating              home to some of the poorest people in Indonesia: 55 percent of the population in
opportunities           Papua is poor and vulnerable,36 compared with 30 percent in West Java.

Poor connectivity      Price differences between regions in Indonesia are often considered to be one of the
stokes inflation, the  most unfavorable consequences of poor connectivity, as unreliable supply chains
burden of which is     prevent traders and local producers from responding rapidly to price changes. Poor
felt the most by poor  logistics hampers the ‘tradability’ of goods and services in remote areas, triggering
households             faster price increases when demand surges. The resultant inflation reduces
                       purchasing power and spending on health and education, in turn increasing poverty
                       and vulnerability.

with demand and are economic expansion of the last 15 years. Furthermore, as exposure to more intense
making firms        competitive pressures from globalization has increased, the country has fallen
uncompetitive       behind its G20 and ASEAN peers. Indonesia ranks 53 out of 160 countries in the
                    2014 Logistics Performance Index, below all other G20 members and the other
                    middle-income ASEAN countries. Traders sending freight from Java or Sumatra to
                    other islands are confronted with long and fragmented supply chains, uncertainties
                    in delivery time, and high costs needed to compensate for 70 percent empty volume
                    on the return voyage (backhaul). Consequently, it is cheaper to ship a container
                    from Shanghai, China to Jakarta than from Jakarta to Padang in West Sumatra,
                    despite Shanghai and Jakarta being six times farther apart than Jakarta and Padang.
                        a. Some consequences of failing to reform Indonesia’s logistics system

Indonesia is missing       Without improving its freight logistics system, Indonesia faces missed opportunities,
out on crucial             not only from weak internal integration, as low connectivity impairs efforts by
opportunities, both        remote regions to diversify their economies, but also from its failure to integrate
from poor internal         more fully into global value chains (GVCs). Indonesia will also struggle to diversify
integration and weak       its production and exports, as businesses will be less exposed to competition and
participation in           will fail to develop competitive advantages in higher value-added manufactured or
GVCs                       processed goods. Such higher value-added goods go hand-in-hand with efficient
                           logistics: they need to meet tight delivery schedules in a cost-effective, reliable and
                           predictable manner.

Resource-producing         Poor freight logistics make it problematic to connect resource-producing regions in
outer islands need to      the outer islands with markets and manufacturing concentrations in Java and
ship to markets and        Sumatra. Most raw commodities need to be brought from the outer islands to be

                    b. Major “symptoms” of poor logistics in Indonesia

                        (i) High costs incurred by under-utilized logistics assets
Indonesia’s logistics Logistics costs can be measured in various ways. One commonly used method is to
costs exceed those of estimate logistics costs as a percentage of GDP. Recent estimates show that logistics
its competitors       costs comprise about 24 percent of GDP in Indonesia, while in neighboring
                      Thailand and Malaysia they account for 16 percent and 13 percent of GDP,
                      respectively. Micro-level, manufacturing firm surveys carried out by the World Bank
                      in Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia, also show that logistics costs, at 20 percent of
                      sales, are significantly higher in Indonesia than in both Thailand (15 percent) and
                      Malaysia (13 percent).

A significant           A recent World Bank survey of Greater Jakarta, Surabaya, Semarang, Palembang,
component of            Medan and Makassar provides a detailed breakdown of logistics costs in
logistics costs is      manufacturing firms in Indonesia. For manufacturers, the average total logistics
inventory costs,        costs of 20 percent of sales can be broken down as follows: 17 percent logistics
which are also          administration, 17 percent warehousing, 26 percent inventory, and 40 percent
significantly higher    transport and cargo handling. Indonesia’s inventory costs are significantly higher
than in neighboring     than those of its peers: in Thailand they contribute 16 percent and in Malaysia 13
countries               percent to total logistics costs. This reflects the uncertainty in supply chains in
                        Indonesia. Many manufacturers simply do not know when their inputs or parts will
                        arrive due to uncertainty in port handling, paperwork and road transport. To avoid
                        production delays, firms keep inventories high, which increases overall logistics
                        costs.

The under-              High logistics costs in Indonesia correlate with a low productivity of assets (trucks,
utilization of assets   vessels, warehouses, inventory, etc.). Most logistics assets are poorly utilized and
is a common thread      therefore unproductive. However, these costs are hard to quantify in isolation.
running through all     Examples include the excessive time ships spend in transit due to long turnaround
the components of       times of vessels in port, the time needed to have goods released from ports, the fact
logistics costs in      that trucks have to wait for hours at ports before cargo can be picked up, and poor
Indonesia               port-hinterland connections and congested roads. The same World Bank survey of
                        manufacturers found that trucks travelling between industrial estates in West Java
                        and the Tanjung Priok port in Jakarta spent 60 percent of their time either queuing
                        or stuck in traffic. Apart from reducing the productivity of trucking assets, this can
                        lead to trucks missing a vessel for cargo transfer or the late departure of a vessel
                        from port.

Maritime supply                The high logistics costs incurred by the poor utilization of logistics assets are

especially to the              standard shipment from Java to eastern Indonesia makes stops at two ports, and the
eastern islands, are           goods are loaded and unloaded manually at least three times before arriving at the
long and fragmented            destination (Figure 27). The typical supply chain also includes hinterland
                               connections in small trucks, and the use of small ferries and/or wooden ships to
                               arrive at the outer-most islands. These modes of transport are inefficient in terms of
                               time, handling, and ensuring goods arrive in good condition, further driving up
                               costs. In addition, the purchaser is usually unaware of the status of his shipment, as
                               tracking and tracing capabilities are limited. These information gaps and supply-
                               chain operating inefficiencies usually push both producers and retailers to carry
                               larger inventories than would normally be necessary, tying up cash and raising
                               inventory costs and overall logistics costs.

Fragmented supply              Such fragmented supply chains make it challenging to provide cost efficient logistics
chains add to                  in the return direction (backhaul) to help bring products from the outer islands to
backhaul problems,             meet domestic demand in Java and Sumatra, or for export markets. Often vessels

than half full                 being 80-90 percent full on their outward voyage.

In road transport,            The sources of uncertainty in land freight transport come mainly from congestion,
uncertainties arise           delays and the low quality of services. A World Bank survey of 83 trucking firms
from congestion,              operating in the Greater Jakarta (Jabodetabek) region highlighted prolonged idle and
delays and low-               waiting times due to congestion or queuing at the port (on average, one third of the
quality services              total roundtrip time to and from Tanjung Priok is spent waiting at factories or the
                              port), and low efficiency in synchronizing cargo deliveries and pick-ups. This
                              represents another example of the under-utilization of logistics assets.

                         time means delays in the availability of inputs, increasing uncertainty and requiring
                         higher inventory levels and carrying costs. Once again assets, both in the form of
                         inputs and logistics resources, are tied up instead of being put to productive use.

Long dwell times         The primary explanation for long dwell times is delays caused by administrative and
are mainly caused        bureaucratic procedures in submitting the customs declaration (persetujuan impor
by lengthy customs       barang, PIB). Although Tanjung Priok operates close to full capacity (thus giving the
clearance                terminal operators little physical room in which to maneuver), port infrastructure
procedures               cannot fully explain the frequent long delays in clearing containers (Figure 29).
                         There is very little correlation between the volume of cargo handled and dwell time.
                         Instead, long bureaucratic processes are the main cause of delays in the pre-customs
                         clearance stage and also during customs inspections.
                         (v) A fragmented regulatory environment, complex investment rules and restrictions on FDI
Too many                 Indonesia’s logistics service providers (LSPs), such as trucking firms and freight
institutions issue and   forwarders, operate in a highly fragmented regulatory environment. Too many
implement too many       institutions issue and implement regulations. Nine national laws and many more
regulations, raising     ministerial decrees and local government regulations guide the logistics
logistics costs          environment. This fragmentation means that laws and regulations are developed
                         independently by each ministry, resulting in frequent conflicts of interest. Making
                         matters worse, many local government regulations target logistics as an easy source
                         of revenue, requiring duplicative and unnecessary permits, fees for which no
                         services are provided, fees for the transport and loading/unloading of goods, and
                         trade barriers between districts.

The regulatory           As a growing sector, the logistics services industry is constantly evolving and trying
environment in           to meet new demands. However, complex rules for investing in the sector and
Indonesia does not       limited access to markets hamper this process. First, the regulatory framework does
facilitate investment    not fully recognize logistics as an activity in its own right, providing no facilitation
in multi-activity        for the integration of supply chain services. LSPs are required to separate their
companies and            business into different legal entities for each specific activity. For instance, trucking,
integrated services      freight forwarding and warehousing all need to be registered with different agencies.
                         Second, restrictions on FDI in logistics activities since 2014 have limited foreign
                         ownership to either 30 or 49 percent (depending on the activity) and the flexibility
                         needed to establish integrated LSPs. Third, transport operators are required to
                         obtain 12 permits at the national and regional levels and, as a consequence, the
                         Ministry of Transport has to process about 2,000 permits daily. Lastly, dominant
                         players in the sector, such as labor unions and state-owned enterprises, often have
                         monopoly control over bottlenecked infrastructure facilities such as ports and
                         container terminals.

Warehouses are           Burdensome reporting requirements and an incoherent FDI policy for commercial
overwhelmed with         warehousing also undermine the logistics sector. For instance, warehouse owners,
reporting                managers or tenants must submit to the local government, and also copy the
regulations, while       Ministry of Trade, a monthly administrative report on all item names, the number of
FDI is restricted        items, time of entry, time of release and the daily amount of goods stored in the
                         warehouse. In addition, in 2014 warehousing was listed under the Negative
                         Investment List (Daftar Negatif Investasi, DNI) with a 33 percent foreign equity limit,
                         while the cold-storage warehousing limit outside Bali, Java and Sumatra is 67
                         percent. On February 11, 2016, the Government announced a revision of the DNI,
                         according to which cold storage is expected to become open to 100 percent foreign
                         ownership and general warehousing to 67 percent.

Current fiscal rules     In addition, the existing value-added tax (VAT) regime contributes to higher
also add to logistics    logistics costs and reduced their international competitiveness. As sea and land
costs                    transport services and domestic air services, which are an integral part of
                         international air shipping, are exempt from VAT, firms cannot claim back the VAT
                         paid on their inputs, including bunker fuel.38 This places domestic companies at a
                         disadvantage to international competitors, as most countries apply a zero VAT rate
                         to international shipping, which allows them to claim the refund on their input VAT
                         and reduces their business cost. Finally, the different VAT treatment of domestic
                         and international shipping services results in higher accounting costs for large firms
                         providing both services.
                         (vi) Infrastructure gaps in logistics
All ports in             Lack of investment in infrastructure has long been one of the key impediments to
Indonesia, regardless    Indonesia’s economic development; this applies equally to freight logistics
of size, need            infrastructure.39 From a sea freight logistics perspective, inefficiencies in port
upgrading                services due to the lack of appropriate infrastructure greatly affect the performance
                         of the rest of the supply chain. Some of the larger and busier ports are currently able
                         to operate at an acceptable performance level, but are subject to the constraints on
                         hinterland connections and to the regulatory difficulties of expanding activities with
                         private sector participation. In fact, all ports in Indonesia, regardless of size, are in
                         need of capacity upgrades, better hinterland access, and/or technological
                         enhancements.

Land transport is        From a land transport perspective, trucking is the main mode of transport for
dominated by             distributing final products from production centers to markets. Historically, one
trucking, historically   reason for this was the availability of subsidized fuel. Traders use trucking services
encouraged by fuel       widely as few reliable alternative modes of transport, such as rail or inter-island
subsidies                shipping, exist in Indonesia. Despite subsidized fuel, trucking costs in Java were
                         higher than international benchmarks as a result of congestion. For example, the
                         distance between West Java’s industrial zones and ports is about 60 km on average,
                         but trucks make only one trip per day. The average truck-trailer transport cost
                         across Java is USD1.31/km, compared with a worldwide average of USD1.00/km
                         with a likely longer average trip distance than trucks in Java.

Box 3: A snapshot of the logistics industry in Indonesia
 Indonesia’s logistics industry is highly fragmented. With the exception of port operators, most LSPs are family-owned
 firms that focus on select markets or geographic areas. They usually operate as small freight forwarders arranging land
 and sea transport, especially from ports to inland destinations, and usually have few, if any, fixed assets. A small
 segment arranges inter-island shipments, but only a few LSPs have sufficient volume to act as non-vessel operating
 common carriers.

 Third-party logistics providers (3PLs) include international firms operating in Indonesia through joint ventures and
 larger, more innovative domestic freight forwarders, especially those experienced in courier services. The core business
 of modern 3PLs is warehousing and distribution, providing a platform for value-added services. These 3PLs tend to
 prefer to lease storage facilities and manage warehouses for others. Warehousing involves inventory management and
 distribution by 3PLs for vendors or retailers. The largest 3PLs use warehouse management systems that are able to
 interface with clients’ enterprise resource planning systems.

 The road freight transport industry comprises two main segments: freight transport to and from ports and regional and
 urban freight transport. Small freight forwarders and road freight firms with heavy trucks dominate the first segment.
 Regional and urban freight transport is provided by both small and large firms with a wide variety of vans and trucks.
 The trucking market is highly fragmented: analysis of firms that provide trucking services in Tanjung Priok reveals that
 over 75 percent have 20 or fewer trucks. While some consolidation is taking place, there is little policy support to aid
 the process. This fragmentation means that small firms enter a vicious circle of low revenues in which traffic
 congestion increases idle time, making operations increasingly unprofitable. This results in overloading practices to
 compensate losses, jeopardizing road safety. Smaller firms often have old trucks, as they cannot afford new ones.
 Larger firms involved in regional transport replace trucks every 8 years, as their trucks clock 80,000 to 120,000 km per
 year, allowing them to cover operational and depreciation costs.

 Inter-island container services are competitive. Five large lines operate a fleet of 170 vessels and carry about half the
 total traffic, while 52 smaller lines operate the remaining fleet of container vessels. Almost all container ships have
 cranes installed on deck (geared) and can call at ports that lack container-handling equipment. Capacity varies from
 below 100 TEUs up to 1,800 TEUs, with an average of about 300 TEUs. Larger vessels (>700 TEUs) account for only
 14 percent of the container fleet, but about one-third of total fleet capacity. The average vessel age is about 20 years.
 Most vessels are purchased second hand, although some younger vessels in the 300-600 TEUs are new. Shipping lines
 continue to purchase geared vessels despite the potential savings in capital and operating costs of gearless vessels, as
 there is a reluctance to depend on ports to provide reliable services. In addition, there is a large number of RoRo
 (ferries) and wooden vessels that transport unitized cargo. RoRo vessels tend to be small, with an average gross register
 tonnage equal to container vessels with a 20 TEU capacity.

 Interviews with firms suggest that the average operating speed of the container fleet is about 10 to 12 knots, even
 though the design speed for such ships is 15-18 knots. Slow steaming is a common practice in Indonesia because of the
 short distances travelled. For the shorter routes the inter-port distance can be covered in 1-2 days and so any increase
 in speed would only reduce the travel time by a few hours, which would then be spent waiting in port. The reduction in
 speed provides major savings in fuel costs, which account for most of the vessels’ operating costs.


                      c. Essential reforms and a framework for policy action

Four key areas of          Mapping of the various “symptoms” of Indonesia’s poor freight logistics system

evident, starting with     governance, supply chain fluidity, and service quality/competence. This inter-
the creation of a          relationship requires a holistic approach to logistics reform. First, the creation of a
Logistics Task Force       Logistics Task Force with strong political backing and a clear mandate to implement
                           and supervise cross-cutting reforms or public investments in the freight logistics
                           system would help to improve inter-agency coordination. It would also serve to
                           increase the quality and effectiveness of reform implementation.

Second, lower entry      Regulatory changes of the logistics sector are needed to encourage investment in
costs for LSPs and       more efficient and diversified logistics services. Such changes could be implemented
3PLs can foster          in areas such as barriers to entry, competition, the fiscal regime, and internal
development of high      barriers, with a view to lowering the entry and operating costs of quality LSPs and
quality logistics        3PLs. One option would be to reduce the multiple restrictions on FDI in logistics
services                 and recognize the importance of FDI as a source of expertise.

Third, improved          There is an urgent need to reduce regulatory bottlenecks in the supply chains which
supply chain             are essential for the competitiveness of firms and their ability to respond to market
efficiency can help      opportunities. Supply chain efficiency is undermined by, for instance, bottlenecks in
firms compete…           ports with long dwell times and industrial centers with poor warehousing facilities.
                         To shorten container dwell times, port operators could be mandated by the
                         Government to measure dwell times in all international ports and domestic
                         container terminals and make the data publicly accessible online.

… while genuinely        Indonesia has partially implemented a National Single Window (INSW) facility

improve trade            transit-related regulatory requirements. However, no effort has yet been made to
facilitation             revisit existing clearance procedures and risk management in border agencies.
                         However, the introduction of an INSW Agency in July 2015 is a step toward a fully-
                         automated single window facility and bodes well for the future.

Finally, the             To address the most urgent gaps in logistics infrastructure, decisions must be fast-

expansion or             which ports are simply too constrained by their congested urban environments and
relocation can help      should be relocated outside the cities they currently serve. Prioritized ports should
close urgent             receive sufficient investment funding to clear approach channels, extend existing
infrastructure gaps      quays to increase berthing capacity, and install dockside cranes to increase
                         loading/unloading capacity and efficiency. Finally, the participation of private
                         operators could be encouraged either through public-private partnerships (PPPs) or
                         through private sector projects. At present, only the Pelindo state-owned port
                         companies have an (international) private sector counterpart, which ensures that the
                         terminals operate with the most sophisticated technology to keep productivity high.

                    2. Aligning pricing, regulations and investments to support sustainable
                       energy development
The Government’s              At the 21st Conference of Parties (COP21) in Paris in December, President Jokowi
stated 23 percent             committed to reach a target of 23 percent renewable energy in the primary energy
renewable energy              mix by 2025. This is a clarion call to re-evaluate the energy mix in Indonesia,
commitment set the            particularly in the power sector. The stakes are high. New energy infrastructure is
stage for a re-               urgently needed to meet rising demand. Indonesia’s demand for electricity is
evaluation of the             projected by the Government to grow at about 8.8 percent per year from 2015 to
energy mix in                 2024, from 219.1 to 464.2 terawatt hours (TWh).40 Once built, infrastructure and
Indonesia                     the systems and policies that support it are hard to change, and their environmental
                              and social footprint will be locked in for decades. Getting the right packages of
                              pricing, regulations and investment policies, tailored to the characteristics of each
                              clean energy source and to energy consumers, is no easy task. But the benefits to
                              society, as well as the global community, are significant (Box 4). Given the
                              complexities of Indonesia’s diverse set of energy sector challenges, this article
                              identifies a few areas that can help to accelerate the achievement of the
                              Government’s sustainable energy objectives.

Box 4: Indonesia’s clean energy policies can yield local and global benefits
    The World Bank estimates that the implementation of a host of policy measures could contribute to a significant
    reduction in Indonesia’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and provide net economic benefits.1 Specifically, full
    implementation of the recent electricity tariff reforms, the Performance Based Regulation for calculating electricity
    subsidies to the state-owned power utility PLN, facilitation of licensing for Independent Power Providers (IPPs), and
    implementation of the 2014 Geothermal Law would yield a potential reduction of GHG emissions in the range of 254
    to 487 million tons on a lifecycle basis. It also saves the economy a conservatively estimated USD28.8 million annually
    in avoided environmental damages. This excludes other financial benefits from reduced budget subsidies. It should be
    noted, however, that the GHG impact of policy interventions is inherently uncertain compared to specific investment
    projects particularly because the number, size and timing of investments that may materialize as a result of specific
    policy interventions are harder to estimate with any certainty.

energy future                 increasing substantially from 2015 to 2024, both in terms of coal’s share in total
                              electricity generated (Figure 31) and share of installed generation capacity. The
                              projected increase in Indonesia’s installed generation capacity is 70.4 gigawatts
                              (GW) in the same 10-year period, and under current plans around 60 percent of new
                              generation capacity is expected to come from coal, 20.1percent from gas, 13.2
                              percent from hydro, 6.8 percent from geothermal, and 0.1percent from other

The Government has              Government policy and targets help provide a framework to make the transition to
a road map to a more            a more sustainable energy path. In June 2015, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral
sustainable energy              Resources (MEMR) issued a roadmap, “Accelerated Development of New and Renewable
future                          Energy (2015-2019),” to support achieving a goal of 23 percent of Indonesia’s
                                primary energy needs being met from new and renewable energy sources by 2025.
                                In addition, the 2015-2019 National Medium-term Development Plan (Rencana
                                Pembangunan Jangka Menengah Nasional, RPJMN) defines specific near-term objectives
                                for the energy sector. These include
                                           To reliably and efficiently meet rising energy demand by expanding
                                            domestic, primary energy supply through increased oil and gas production,
                                            as much as possible, to address energy security concerns;
                                           To transition toward a sustainable energy sector development path through
                                            increased use of domestic gas, renewable energy and by scaling up energy
                                            efficiency measures;
                                           To achieve a more efficient and competitive energy sector; and
                                           To achieve nearly universal access to electric power.
                                In addition, as part of its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), Indonesia
                                has committed to reducing its GHG emissions by 29 percent by 2030 (and by 41
                                percent with international assistance).

To achieve the road     As identified in MEMR’s roadmap, harvesting Indonesia’s clean energy potential
map’s objectives        can be accelerated with well-coordinated pricing policies, regulations, and well
sharper pricing,        planned investments. New policies promoting cleaner fuels will interact with
regulations, and        existing policies supporting infrastructure and short-term investments. A
investment policies     comprehensive and coordinated approach recognizes that no single instrument –
must work well          pricing, regulations or investment policy – will provide a silver bullet. This article
together                identifies some areas where supporting policies may be needed to achieve intended
                        outcomes. Generally, well-coordinated policies, regulations and investments that
                        lead to a cleaner fuel mix should be an outcome of a governance system where
                        incentives and accountability mechnisms are in place to plan for and reach
                        Government targets. Strengthening sector governance and improving its efficiency
                        and competitiveness are essential to delivering on more ambitious clean energy
                        targets. While the agenda is too broad to cover in one article, efforts towards greater
                        clarity in institutional responsibilities and accountability for setting and
                        implementing energy policies across and within government agencies should
                        continue.
                   a. Pricing

Pricing can go a long   Sound energy pricing policies are one of the sharpest instruments a government has
way towards             to create incentives for efficient production and use of energy. In addition to the
incentivizing           well-publicized reduction in fuel subsidies, the Government has made recent
efficiency and          progress in the power sector. First, since 2014 it has adjusted most electricity tariffs
production and the      to better reflect the actual costs of delivering electricity and customers’ ability to
use of renewables       pay. Second, an automatic electricity tariff adjustment mechanism has been
                        introduced to respond to changes in fuel prices, exchange rates, and inflation on a
                        monthly basis. These two measures have sent stronger signals to consumers to use
                        electricity more efficiently. Third, the Ministry of Finance adopted a Performance
                        Based Regulation with a new method to calculate PLN’s general subsidy, known as
                        the Public Service Obligation. When fully implemented, it will introduce multi-year
                        efficiency benchmarks in areas that are within PLN’s control. If PLN meets those
                        benchmarks within the regulatory period, it can keep the cost savings for
                        reinvestment. Benchmarks can be readjusted after each regulatory period.
                        Importantly, the regulation allows for a pass through of costs not controlled by
                        PLN. This is understood to include costs associated with PLN’s purchase of
                        renewable electricity, whose prices are fixed by the Government and not PLN. The
                        Performance Based Regulation creates incentives for PLN to become even more
                        efficient while ensuring the Government’s obligation to ensure PLN is financially
                        viable. A three year transition period is foreseen in the regulation, starting in 2017,
                        and is overseen by an Inter-Ministerial Team comprising the Ministry of Energy and
                        Mineral Resources, Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of State-owned
                        Enterprises.

But fixed tariffs for   Among the many issues that need to be addressed to spur investment in renewables,

mechanism to cover      targets for cleaner energy. While some tariff policies were introduced to reflect these
any of their            goals, they have not delivered the expected results. Small-scale feed-in tariffs for
incremental costs       hydropower and biomass have been adjusted because they were perceived to be too
                        low for investors. A recent ceiling price system based on competitive tenders for
                        large-scale geothermal power is also under review. Irrespective of how fixed tariffs
                        for renewable energy are calculated (feed-in tariffs or competitive selection of
                        qualified investors based on lowest evaluated prices up to a ceiling), there is a need

                        to have a credible, reliable financing mechanism in place to cover any incremental
                        costs of renewables. While the Performance Based Regulation appears to give
                        authority to cover these uncontrollable costs of PLN (because PLN does not set the
                        renewable tariffs), the lack of a clear and reliable source of funds to cover the
                        difference appears to be an obstacle for PLN and private investors. In other
                        countries, this source of funds is usually secured through an electricity consumer
                        surcharge as in the case of Germany, China and Malaysia.
                     b. Regulations

Sustainable energy      Regulations should facilitate policy implementation, set clear roles, accountabilities
policies also need      and align incentives so that government, state-owned enterprises, the private sector
supporting              and civil society all contribute to achieving the Government’s objectives. For
regulations to          instance, as noted above, the feed-in tariff will only be able to deliver results if
maximize their          accompanied with a policy decision and regulation on financing the resulting
effectiveness           incremental costs. Also, passing the 2014 Geothermal Law was a great leap forward
                        for geothermal power development and will help to remove many barriers.
                        However, to take full effect it requires supporting regulations that adequately cover
                        tariff setting and financing, environmental and social issues and provide a
                        framework for private sector participation. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to
                        renewables. For instance, the high upfront capital costs associated with geothermal
                        power development make its risk profile more like oil and gas as opposed to wind
                        and solar which require much less upfront capital. Wells drilled by investors may
                        come up dry or short of their estimated potential. The Government is re-assessing
                        the package of policies that promote geothermal power. Aside from getting the
                        pricing right, it is essential that it adequately addresses these upstream drilling risks
                        to help unlock private investment. In addition, the new Geothermal Law opened
                        doors to development in conservation forest areas. Implementing regulations are
                        needed to define requirements and procedures that provide a clear path to
                        developing geothermal power in these areas while addressing environmental risks
                        and ensuring local benefit sharing.
                     c. Investments

                        functions will be as effective as cutting red tape.

And planning is         In addition to sound pricing and regulations, and a friendly clean energy investment

                        means that only the most cost-effective projects should be implemented. This

                           faced similar rates of electricity demand growth in the past. Chile, Brazil, Peru and
                           Colombia offer some lessons (Box 5).

Box 5: Lessons in sound power sector planning from Latin America
   Detailed planning for power sector development by the central government (led by the energy ministry) is essential
    for the expansion of generation and transmission capacity in countries with high growth rates. The market cannot
    be expected to make policy decisions about a country’s optimal energy mix.
   The sector ministry assesses the country’s resources, defines projects that are least costly and are the most socially
    and environmentally acceptable, and identifies the projects for private investment. Such planning requires strong
    institutional capacity. Where this capacity is weak, power utilities have stepped in but found justifiable difficulties
    reconciling national and corporate objectives.
   Competition ensures that energy facilities are constructed and operated at the least cost. This requires appropriate
    contractual and regulatory arrangements implemented by competent entities. Serious investors will invest only in
    capital intensive projects that provide an assured revenue stream. For electricity, this implies credible, long-term
    contracts for production and an appropriate allocation of risks to parties that are best placed to manage them.
   Taxpayers ultimately pay for the outcomes of the planning process; therefore, public consultation on generation
    plans is a transparent way to obtain feedback and address criticism.

                           be implemented and results achieved. Transparent planning also needs strong policy
                           analysis and planning capacity. The growing complexity of the sector – and
                           increasing demands on it – requires a continuous upgrading of analysis and planning
                           skills.

The country faces a        Indonesia also faces a crisis of under-investment in gas supply, which requires
crisis of under-           policies in three areas: infrastructure planning processes, upstream contractual
investment in the gas      terms, and midstream regulation. First, gas infrastructure plans set out in the 2015
sector                     Gas Roadmap will need to be developed rapidly but require a well-designed gas
                           infrastructure planning process that addresses technical, economic, financial,
                           environmental and social considerations. A successful planning process identifies
                           project risks and informs decisions on which projects should be developed by the

                           public sector and which by the private sector. Second, the Government has begun
                           to review the contractual terms for oil and gas exploration and production to make
                           them more attractive while preserving the ability of the Government to capture
                           rent.42 Third, the Government also recognizes the need to establish a regulatory
                           framework to encourage incumbents in gas midstream to increase investment in gas
                           transportation, processing and storage infrastructure, and to clarify a role for new
                           entrants. In August 2015, MEMR proposed arrangements for a national gas
                           “aggregator.” The function of an aggregator is to pool gas supplies received at
                           different prices and assure delivery to power, industry and household consumers at
                           regulated prices linked to an average of costs of gas flowing through the system.43
                           International experience suggests that the efficient operation of national gas
                           aggregation requires regulation to encourage and accelerate investment in mid-
                           stream infrastructure and to guard against the possible abuse of monopoly power.
                           While some countries (e.g., Pakistan and Nigeria) have experienced poor efficiency
                           and governance outcomes which have been difficult to unwind once established,
                           others (e.g., the Netherlands and Turkey) have found ways to accelerate investment
                           and improve performance.

Box 6: Energy efficiency – the cleanest, but under-appreciated domestic resource
 One important element that could receive greater policy attention is energy efficiency. High energy intensity of existing
 and especially new infrastructure – power plants, manufacturing, buildings, roads, vehicles – will lock Indonesia into a
 pattern of energy consumption that will push it to seek out greater amounts of energy supply. High energy intensity
 contributes to lower competitiveness by increasing unit costs of production. It also drives up energy bills, increasing
 the cost of living. With energy efficient industry, appliances, infrastructure and vehicles, people can do more with less,
 bringing down the cost of consuming energy because less is required to meet the same need.



Policy interactions        The Government has set in motion a process of adjusting energy policies that match
matter more now            with the RPJMN 2015-2019 and MEMR clean energy ambitions. This will be a
than ever and              formidable challenge. Will it be able to lock into a virtuous cycle of high quality
Indonesia’s                growth of the energy sector or a vicious cycle of unsustainable development?
sustainable energy         Recent developments suggest the window of opportunity is still open. These
objectives depend on       include a commitment to reduce the energy sector’s draw on fiscal resources for
them                       subsidies, improve the investment climate in the power and gas sectors, expand
                           access to modern, reliable energy, promote energy efficiency and remove constraints
                           to renewable electricity development. This diversification strategy can strengthen
                           energy security and extract maximum value from vastly untapped renewable energy
                           resources. It can also reduce local pollution and environmental concerns from the
                           use of coal. In addition to being good for Indonesia, reducing its heavy reliance on
                           coal also contributes to global efforts to mitigate climate change—an effort that is
                           both economically efficient and socially inclusive. However, in Indonesia’s
                           increasingly complex energy sector, policies, regulations and government

                           42MEMR     has prepared a Ministerial Regulation that adjusts the fiscal and non-fiscal terms of
                             production sharing contracts for unconventional oil and gas. While such resources hold high potential
                             and there has been some success in licensing, only a low level of investment has taken place. MEMR
                             has expressed intentions to shift its focus to the terms and conditions for developing marginally
                             economic conventional oil and gas fields, which may result in a package of incentive measures during
                             the course of 2016.
                           43 The stated motivation for this arrangement is to reduce the burden of negotiation between sellers

                             and buyers, minimize end-use price disparities, curtail the activities of rogue traders, and, where
                             supply lags demand, allocate gas to the sectors in which gas has most economic value. The proposed
                             model envisages that the aggregator will perform gas processing, transportation and storage services
                             as well as the merchant function of taking and delivering gas.

                investments often interact. This is especially true when introducing policies that aim
                to shift the energy mix toward cleaner energy. These interactions need to be
                evaluated when introducing new instruments, with efficient coordination
                mechanisms in place to iron out discrepancies. The appropriate allocation of roles
                and responsibilities between government, state-owned enterprises, the private sector
                and civil society in the planning, investment and operation of the energy sector is
                critical to this system. With massive energy infrastructure yet to be built, redoubling
                efforts to get the right packages of pricing policies, smart regulations, investments
                and transfers will be good for Indonesia and the world.
