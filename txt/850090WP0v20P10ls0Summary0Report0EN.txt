Romania has the opportunity
to benefit from significant EU
structural assistance through
the Regional Operational
Programme (ROP).
In preparation for the 2014 – 2020 ROP, a key task at hand is to enhance
not only the absorption rate, but also the impact of ROP-funded investments.
One critical component in this process is improved project selection models to
help boost the quality of ROP investments, have a stronger linkage to strategic
development priorities, and focus on getting the highest “value for money”
projects. The proposed selection models for the ROP 2014-2020 should build
upon the strengths and correct the weaknesses of the 2007-2013 framework,
as well as incorporate best practices from other EU countries, appropriately
tailored to the Romanian context and capacity.

             9
The Regional Operational
Programme (ROP) is one of
seven operational programs
(OPs) financed through EU
funds during the 2007-2013
programming period.
The EU dedicated EUR 3.7 billion to the ROP to support Romania’s regional
development in the post-accession period. This amounts to 19% of the
total structural funds available through the National Strategic Reference
Framework (NSRF) between 2007 and 2013, making the ROP the third
largest program after transportation (23.7%) and environment (23.5%). In
2011, projects financed under the ROP accounted for nearly 27% of projects
financed by external grants and more than 12% of total public investment.
The total allocation of the 2007-2013 ROP is more than EUR 4.5 billion, of
which the EU contributes nearly 82%.

That said, the commitment and
absorption rates should be
neither the only, nor the most
important indicators for the
ROP’s success.
A high rate of absorption may be a sign that projects have been chosen for
financing simply because they were ready to be implemented, rather than
for their potential contribution to development objectives. In Romania and
more broadly across the EU, policymakers and key stakeholders should
pay increased attention to the impact of EU-funded investments in terms of
achieving social and economic goals – which, after all, is the ultimate aim
of such interventions.

One of the first steps in
elaborating an improved
selection model is to assess
the approaches of other
Member States.
This way, best practices can be collected and improved upon to generate even
better outcomes for the ROP. In the full report, project selection models from 8
Member Countries (Germany, Poland, Estonia, Italy, Slovenia, the UK, Ireland,
and Lithuania) are analyzed to identify potential suggestions for enhancing the
ROP selection model for the 2014-2020 programming period. The operational
programmes analyzed were chosen based on their similarities to the Romanian
ROP.

A number of key lessons can be drawn
from the analysis of these eight case
studies:	


1 Each Member State used unique approaches for project selection, with
  some focusing on the pre-selection of a number of large strategic projects
   (e.g., Lithuania), some focusing primarily on competitive calls (e.g., Ireland,
   Estonia), and yet others, particularly the larger countries (e.g., Germany,
   Italy, Poland), deploying a mix of methods.




2 The  evaluation and selection systems used by these countries are by-and-
  large simpler than the system used under the ROP 2007-2013. For example,
   most countries did not use the Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) for evaluating
   projects. Germany was one of the exceptions, and it only used CBA for
   large strategic projects. Similarly, the ROP’s evaluation and selection grids
   appear much more granular and detailed than comparable frameworks in
   other Member States.




3 For the most part, the case studies analyzed revealed a keen focus on
  impact and also used weights for individual criteria to differentiate between
   more important and less important evaluation factors.

7   While keeping in mind the need to ensure a stable
    and predictable playing field for all applicants and
    beneficiaries, the ROP 2014-2020 should feature
    flexible approaches, as needed.
    For example, even if most of the available funds will be pre-allocated (for
    strategic projects) or allocated using a First-In First-Out (FIFO) approach,
    the programme could adopt a competitive selection model for one priority
    axis or one key area of intervention (e.g., business infrastructure).
    For example, many Member Countries use competitive calls for
    private beneficiaries (e.g., SMEs) or for the development of business
    infrastructure. Another option is to enable the ROP’s shift to a competitive
    approach after a mid-term claw-back (e.g., if some beneficiaries have not
    used pre-allocated funds in due time).
