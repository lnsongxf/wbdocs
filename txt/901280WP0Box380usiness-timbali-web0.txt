1. SUMMARY
Timbali Technology Incubator in the Mpumalanga region of South Africa seeks to help rural farmers
whose livelihood has been undercut by high-volume large farms. Supported by government financing
and fee-based services, Timbali is largely based on a franchise model. Its clients supply cut flowers to
Amablom,Timbali’s commercial arm. Individual clients can begin generating revenue almost
immediately. Timbali helps clients both onsite and off, training them in business methods and helping
them find loans to get started. It is helping clients expand intoother product lines and value-added
food processing, and plans to export its model into other parts of South Africa.



2. BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
The Timbali Technology Incubator was founded in 2003 in an effort to positively affect rural farmers in
the Mpumalanga region of South Africa. The word “timbali” means not only “flowers” but “to bloom”
in siSwati, the language of the region. The incubator was founded with the concept of harnessing
both definitions.

The incubator’s first entrepreneurs began the incubation process in 2004. By 2005, Timbali had grown
to include 30 entrepreneur clients.In 2007, the incubation model was restructured to accommodate
both on and off-site agribusiness incubation.

In 1990, there were almost 79,000 active farmers in South Africa.Today, that number has decreased to
around 33,000, mainly because of the rise of larger, high-volume farming operations. From sales
volume to bulk material pricing to access to credit, smallholder farmers in Mpumalanga had little
chance of competing successfully with high-volume farmers’ greater sophistication. Today, 26.9
percent of Mpumalanga’s population is unemployed, with 33.9 percent of those being women.In a
culture where agribusiness is dominated by women and relatively simple input and training are
needed to promote sustainable success, the potential benefit of Timbali’sagribusiness incubatoris
obvious.

Timbali’s core values are ingrained in the incubator and apply to every executive board member, staff
employee, incubating client and pre-incubation hopeful. Those values are:

            a. Being part of something special.

            b. Hard work with a sense of pride, self-reliance and ownership.

            c.   Being a pioneer and not following others.

            d. Science-based innovation.

            e. Honesty and integrity.

            f.   Excellence in reputation.




	                                                 2	  
Timbali’s objectives are the promotion of the agricultural sector’s macro-economic goals, promoting
network linkages, ensuring effective and efficient management of investments, effective human
resource management and effective marketing and communication.

Timbali uses key performance indicators (KPI) to measure the success or failure of its objectives. These
indicators include the number of agribusinesses supported, how many are black-owned or woman-
owned agribusinesses, the number of new (pre-incubation) projects initiated, the total number of
clients supported,how many jobs have been created, how much growth has occurred in each sector,
and how many clients are in pipeline development.




3. STRATEGIC VISION, MISSION, AND TARGETS
Vision: To be leaders in creating wealth for all in agriculture and related industries.

Mission: To establish and support an environment to promote predominately broad-based Black
Economic Empowerment (BEE) agribusiness and related enterprises.

Timbali focuses its efforts on the least represented population groups in the Mpumalanga region:
Black and female clients. More than 97 percent of Timbali’s clients are black and 97 percent of those
are women.Without agribusiness opportunity, these groups have nothing. While its clients are the
obvious beneficiaries of the incubator,others who benefit include agricultural material suppliers,
financial institutions, off-site growers, packaging material suppliers and transportation companies.

To help its clientbase, Timbali staff has defined the following needs: Technology transfer, access to
production loan financing, basic business skills, market access (competing with the quality produce of
large commercial farmers), logistical coordination, standardized and coordinated production
processes, financial training, administrative and bookkeeping support, training and mentorship,
literacy education and market-driven production.




4. TIMBALI’S DISTINCTIVE FEATURES
       •   The most distinctive feature of Timbali is its ability to create sustainable relationships for its
           clients.
       •   The Timbali incubator model at Timbali is largely based on the franchise model—allowing
           clients to easily and immediately start supplying a customer (Timbali’scommercial arm).This is
           a tremendous benefit to the individual client, who can begin generating revenue almost
           immediately.
       •   Timbali boasts both on-site and off-site incubation models, a rarity in the incubation world,
           because of its cluster-driven approach to incubation.

5. BRAND AND MARKET POSITION
The name “Timbali” is almost synonymous with agribusiness incubation in its region; it dominates the
incubator space.

Timbali owns several commercial brands. “Amablom,” meaning “my flowers” in the local language, is
the commercial face of Timbali’s efforts, and is used in marketing initiatives locally, regionally, and for
limited exports to Europe.Amablom customers say the brand has a solid reputation for quality,
reliability and competitiveness.

The other brands owned by Timbali are “Amafruit,” “Amaveg” and “Amabrands,” all planned for future
use as Timbali pushes forward into more advanced crop diversification and value-added food
processing.Amabrands is intended to be the umbrella brand of the other three.Amafruitwill focus on
fresh fruit produce, as well as value-added juice, jam and dried fruit production.Amavegwill focus on
fresh vegetables, as well as value-added, shelf stable vegetables and other byproducts.All of the
brands are registered as for-profit organizations.




6. APPROACH TO INCUBATION
Timbali introduced its on-site and off-site incubation programs in 2007.Its goal was to offer a mentor-
based, franchise incubation model to accommodate clients within and outside the incubator.

Potential clients complete a Personal Strengths and Weaknesses Worksheet, evaluating their
experience and ability in critical areas including sales, marketing, financial planning and customer
service.They evaluate themselves on a scale from one to five (five being the highest).

The following criteria must also be metfor entry into the Timbali Technology Incubator program:

       •   Access to land.
       •   Ability to service infrastructure costs.
       •   Full-time involvement and commitment to business.
       •   Product and market accessibility.
       •   Sound track record and growth potential of the client and enterprise.
       •   Ability to pay for services in future through levies.
       •   Entrepreneurial inclination.

Once accepted into the one-year pre-incubation program, clients are walked through a series of
assessments, including needs analysis, land analysis (on their land, in the case of off-site clients), water
and irrigation.They also receive basic training in production.Finally, they are assisted in applying for an
initial loan from the Mpumalanga Economic Growth Agency (MEGA) for plants/seedlings, land
improvement, etc.The value of this initial loan varies based on the individual’s needs but averages
around R50,000.Clients in the pre-incubation program meet with Timbali technical leaders and
mentors once per month, and are evaluated on their technical expertise, professionalism and
commitment to the program and to entrepreneurship.Advancement to the full incubation program is
based on interest and readiness for the intensive program, and on receipt of MEGA funding.



	                                                   4	  
MEGA fundsare transferred into Timbali’s trust account and managed on behalf of the client. For this
service and for rent, utilities, etc, Timbali clients pay a monthly levy of 12 percent of sales to
Timbali.Within the first year of incubation, clients typically generate between R8,000 and R60,000 in
sales per month.

The incubation program thrusts clients into a full-time, three-year intensive program.The acceptance
rate from pre-incubation to incubation is over 98 percent, due in large part to Timbali’s extensive
screening process.Incubation clients interact daily with Timbali staff and receive a monthly stipend of
R2,000 per month.Their training includes mentoring, production planning, business planning, area-
specific planning, processes, bulk purchasing, spraying, fertilizer selection and uses, financial analysis
and branding.They are assigned sites in Timbali or, if off-site, are assisted in planning their own
farming sites.During incubation, clients provide product to the Timbali brand Amablom and also
pursue direct customer relationships with private business entities—a service enabled by Timbali’s
sales and marketing staff.

To graduate, incubatees must exhibit top-notch technical skills, exceptional business acumen, a
strong desire to graduate and a solid business plan for post-graduation activities.

Timbali has also created a Science Research Park, giving smallholder farmers the opportunity
to expand their businesses within the Timbali facility, where they have access to clusters and
technology.New practices are researched at the park, ensuring that best practices prevail in
fertilizer programs, updated IT systems, spraying programs, techniques for pre/post-handling,
product selection and testing cultivars for possible



7. INSTITUTIONAL SET-UP
Timbali Technology Incubator is a Section 21 company (not-for-profit) in South Africa created byCEO
and co-founder Louise de Klerk.

Timbali is overseen by a board of directors made up primarily of representatives from contributing
organizations.The current board consists of:

        § Mr. BhekiMamphaga (MEGA)
        § Ms. Anita Severn-Ellis (Agricultural Development Advisory Group)
        § Mr. Peter Hughes (Capespan)
        § Mr. Andre Scholtz (Industry specialist)
        § Mr. TervernJaftha (SEDA)



8. BUSINESS MODEL
Timbali is funded by the South African Department of Trade and Industry’s Small Enterprise
Development Agency (SEDA).Two grants totaling R20,000,000 have been dispersed since Timbali’s



	                                                   5	  
inception.Additional direct support comes from the Agricultural Research Council, which donated the
land for Timbali’s main office and on-site incubation program, and from MEGA.
Timbali has recently been approved to receive an additional R20,000,000 in funding from SEDA to
support its latest initiative of increasing off-site incubation of various agricultural activities and
product diversification. Continued funding remains a concern, as sporadic payments and fluctuating
government budgets make financial planning an uncertain challenge.
On average, Timbali spends approximately R80,000 on each client over the four-yearincubation
process.While the price of cut flowers (the industry of most Timbali clients)fluctuates, the typical
Timbali graduate produces approximately 8,000 stems per month.At an average price of R2 per stem,
the average Timbali client generates R16,000 of income per month, thus recouping Timbali’s
investment of R80,000 in less than one year.



9. STAFFING
The Timbali Technology incubator employs nine full-time staff members in three categories:
operations, technical and sales.

Timbali has an extensive network of public and private sector partnerships serving various internal
needs. Mr. Lombaard, the senior technical officer,says that “without those partnerships and that
network, we would not be able to meet the needs of our clients.”

One of Timbali’smost useful relationships is with MEGA. Since inception, MEGA has provided
Timbali clientswith micro-loans to develop and expand their business models.This allows
clients to not only receive much needed financial assistance, but also to establish a credit
history, which helps them both personally and professionally.



10. OUTCOMES AND CONCLUSIONS
Some key accomplishments include:

Product Diversification:More than 69 percent of Timbali’scurrently incubatees produce crops other
than cut flowers.These crops include foliage, citrus, pomegranates, a variety of vegetables, peppers,
tomatoes and grapes.

Off-site Incubation:Off-site incubatees now represent over 72 percent of Timbali’s total number of
clients. They are only way Timbali can broaden if impact, as on-site space is at capacity.

Business Systems Development and Technology Transfer:The program includes intensive
interaction aimed at addressing specific business needs through workshops, one-on-one and group
sessions, and clustering activities with Timbali personnel and field specialists.

Strategic Alliance Development and Incubator Sustainability:These play an important role in
business development for Timbali.One such alliance is the Amafruit initiative, which was developed in
collaboration with a multinational consortium.

11. CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS
       •     Development of a business model for a region where such services are desperately needed.
       •     Using clustering to advantage. Clients benefit from a cluster of experts in sound
             management, communication, administration (i.e. bulk buying, shared services and market
             access) and the business development process (weekly operations meetings and internal
             audits).
       •     Development of the cluster operations manual.Skills development and training are
             recorded and documented as they happen.
       •     Internal auditing ensures fair, accountable and transparent bookkeeping.This has enabled
             the habit of using quantified results and data-driven decisions to manage conflicts within the
             cluster.




12. LESSONS LEARNED AND IMPLICATIONS FOR
AGRIBUSINESS INCUBATORS
1. Access to production loans is one of the most critical elements of Timbali’smodel.

2. The franchise model seriously hinders one of business incubation’s most basic principles:
encouraging innovation.While franchising should be applauded and implemented in a best-practices
incubation model, it should be just one element of an agribusiness incubator’s operation, rather than
its central function. Entrepreneurial innovation and creativity must be cultivated in the agribusiness
incubator model, led by experienced incubator managers who know how to channel creativity into
competitive, marketable agribusiness products and services.

13. FUTURE GOALS
Timbali continues to expand and develop in an effort to meet its mission. It believes that its incubation
model has been successfully proven, and is ready to introduce the concept into other regions and
other product initiatives.To do so, Timbali seeks to develop a portfolio of “Timbali Agro-Parks™” that
will accommodate existing and graduated incubatees.

The staff at Timbali are working closely with South Africa’s Department of Trade and Industry’s SEDA
program to explore options of expanding its incubator concept into other regions of South
Africa.They are approved to begin operations in the Limpopo region.

Timbali also It seeks to expand the off-site incubation program to other agricultural products.
