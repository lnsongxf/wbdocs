Definition of carbon pricing: For the purpose of the State and Trends of Carbon Pricing report series, and also
applicable to this brief, carbon pricing refers to initiatives that put an explicit price on greenhouse gas emissions.
This includes emissions trading schemes, offset mechanisms, carbon taxes, corporate carbon pricing and results-
based finance, using a metric directly based on carbon (i.e., price per ton of CO2e). Policies that put an implicit
price on carbon, for example removal of fossil fuel subsidies, fuel taxation, support for renewable energy, and energy
efficiency certificate trading, are not included as they are outside the scope of the series and this brief.
