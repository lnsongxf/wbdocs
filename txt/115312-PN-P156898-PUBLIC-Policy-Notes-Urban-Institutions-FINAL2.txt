1 Metropolitan fragmentation describes the transition from “contained” urban areas, where the built up area is contained within a single municipal boundary, to “spillover”
    and “fragmented” urban areas (World Bank 2015). For “spillover” urban areas, one jurisdiction contains more than 50 percent of the total built up area while the remaining
    urban area is divided among smaller jurisdictions (e.g., Hangzhou in China, Nha Trang in Vietnam, and Bandung in Indonesia). For “fragmented” urban areas, no jurisdiction
    accounts for more than half of the built-up area (e.g., Jakarta, Tokyo, and the Pearl River Delta urban area in China).

There are a number of key challenges related to governance and institutions that are hampering successful urbanization.
These include: (i) absence of a comprehensive national urban policy; (ii) absence of a lead agency for urban development;
(iii) weaknesses in the fiscal decentralization framework; and (iv) metropolitan fragmentation and weak mechanisms for inter-
jurisdictional coordination.

     that central governments recognize the unique threats and opportunities from rapid urban growth and understand that the complex
     challenges faced by cities cannot be solved by spatially blind sectoral policies.

     Secondly, a political champion for the urban agenda can have different institutional locations, and there is no perfect model. Whatever
     structure is created has to be able to win support across different departments to ensure that sufficient resources of all kinds are mobilized
     to make a difference. Any structure also requires leaders who believe in the urban agenda and who are capable of persuading others to
     support the case – building a coalition of interests. Without high-level political support and vision, an NUP may achieve little in practice
     because of inertia and resistance to change.

     Thirdly, implementing an NUP means a sustained technical process of building the legal foundations, institutional capabilities, administrative
     procedure and financial instruments to pursue this agenda effectively. A NUP may also need aspects of established legislation (such as old
     land-use planning regulations and laws governing the ownership, use, and development of land) to be altered so that it is more relevant to
     contemporary conditions and better equipped to deal with growing informality.

     Fourthly, the proactive engagement of cities is critical to achieve national urban policy goals. Effectively implementing an NUP requires
     strong partnerships among national and sub-national governments as well as the decentralization of selected powers, responsibilities, and
     resources to city and metropolitan-level institutions.

     Box 2. Examples of National Urban Policies
     South Korea’s NUP has evolved through three phases. The first involved explicit spatial concentration and sectoral focus because resource
     limitations prevented spreading investment more evenly across the country. The country’s rapid socio-economic development is
     attributable in large part to an industrial modernization strategy pursued by the government from the 1960s to the 1980s, geared largely
     to boosting exports. Due growth pressures and high infrastructure costs, the government sought to de-concentrate jobs and people away
     from the Capital Area in the 1980s and 1990s to pursue “balanced territorial development.” Finally, growth demands and inflated house
     prices in the Capital Area forced the government to respond by constructing five additional new cities around Seoul in order to relieve the
     housing shortages, accompanied by a massive increase in apartment building. The government’s housing program was accompanied by a
     policy to relax government controls on mortgage lending by financial institutions, allowing more people to afford home ownership. Both
     initiatives contributed to a dramatic increase in the supply of housing over a relatively short period.

     During the 2000s, South Korea’s NUP shifted again towards trying to improve the quality of urban development, including livability,
     amenities, safety and environmental quality. This was partly a response to the previous emphasis on quantitative economic growth and the
     resulting inferior character of the built environment in many urban areas. One of the main lessons emerging from South Korea’s experience
     is the importance of aligning territorial planning, urban policy, housing programs and the provision of land for development. This example
     demonstrates the substantial benefits that can be derived if urban policy reinforces and contributes to economic development, with
     sufficient land and housing made available in the right places.

     Following the adoption of the 1988 Constitution, which included a chapter on urban policy, Brazil enacted a law called the Statute of
     the City in 2001 to promote equity and access to urban land. The law facilitated more democratic city management by making land-use
     planning mandatory throughout each city and subjecting development decisions to social control and participation. Furthermore, the law
     ensured that the social function of urban land and buildings was put before their commercial value by removing part of the land from the
     market. Urban planning has henceforth been seen as a collaborative process of shared decision-making and negotiation among different
     interests, rather than a top-down, technocratic activity undertaken by government experts, private developers or commercial investors.

     Colombia is a highly urbanized (75-80 per cent) country that has gradually developed a NUP to match the scale of its urban challenges.
     Two successive national development plans have set clear priorities for urban development. These are reflected in the 2005 “Livable Cities”
     Strategy, which focused on improving access to affordable land and housing, increasing water and sanitation services, and improving public
     transport. The strategy was reinforced when government responded to the global financial crisis with a major program of public investment
     to enable the construction of a million houses over a five-year period, starting in 2011. Additional reforms sought to develop new and
     innovative ways to finance urban infrastructure, such as public-private partnerships. Colombia has also learned from Brazil’s Constitution
     and urban laws by taking steps to facilitate more effective land readjustment and redevelopment. Special Zones of Social Interest were
     established to reduce the legal minimum plot size for houses and allow informal settlers to regularize dwelling conditions with less threat
     of speculation and eviction.

     Australia’s first broad-based NUP was approved in 2011 following a period of extensive research and consultation. It was a response to a
     series of looming challenges in the major cities, including the escalating cost of housing, rising fuel costs, urban sprawl and its impact on
     infrastructure networks, transport systems, road congestion, uneven access to job opportunities and the natural environment. National
     government involvement was vital because of the limited fiscal capacity of the states and local government. The NUP sought to address
     the broader issues of managing the big cities better, improving their contribution to national economic performance, and reducing their
     carbon emissions. It had four pillars - productivity, sustainability, livability and governance. A novel feature of the NUP was the clear
     rationale established for the national government to get directly involved in a way that went well beyond that of a single, stand-alone
     department or spending program, as in the previous urban initiatives. Coordination went to the heart of the NUP in order to ensure a wide-
     ranging, sustained impact on mainstream government policy, in particular to ensure that urban infrastructure considerations became a
     more important feature of the government’s agenda. This was achieved by setting up an elaborate architecture for institutional alignment
     across key departments and agencies, including special committees and reporting arrangements.

     Ghana is an example of a country that has prioritized the adoption of its NUP as its urban population has grown beyond 50 percent.
     After a four-year period of technical analysis, policy reviews, workshops and extensive domestic and international consultation, the first
     ever NUP was launched in March 2013, along with a five-year detailed Action Plan. The preparatory work included a public advocacy
     campaign to make the case for better-managed urbanization. The broad aim of the NUP is to promote sustainable, spatially integrated
     and orderly development of urban settlements, with adequate housing and services, and efficient institutions. Extensive investment in
     urban infrastructure funded by national government and managed by municipalities is intended to alleviate severe congestion in the big
     cities and create a sound living and working environment to accelerate the country’s all-round development. The implementation of the
     NUP is supposed to be coordinated by the Urban Development Unit within the Department of Local Government and Rural Development;
     however, there are no institutional mechanisms in place to encourage other government departments to follow the NUP. Consequently,
     the NUP at present is a coherent policy without an institution to implement it effectively. National and local forums have been set up to put
     urban issues on the agenda of other departments and external stakeholders but it is too soon to assess their effectiveness.

   Box 3. Overview of Intergovernmental Transfers

   Internal Revenue Allotment. The Local Government Code institutionalized the internal revenue allotment (IRA), which is the primary transfer of shared
   revenues from the national government to LGUs. The Code mandates that 40 percent of national internal revenues based on the collections of the third
   fiscal year preceding the current fiscal year shall be allotted to LGUs. The IRA is first subdivided among the different levels of LGUs using the following
   distribution: provinces (23 percent), cities (23 percent), municipalities (34 percent), and barangays (20 percent). The shares for each level of LGU are then
   allocated horizontal for provinces, cities and municipalities based on the following formula: population (50 percent), land area (25 percent), and equal
   sharing (25 percent). For barangays, the horizontal sharing is based on: population (60 percent) and equal sharing (40 percent).

   The IRA is an unconditional block grant that is automatically released to the LGUs five days after the end of each quarter. The LGC provides conditions for
   the national government to withhold a portion of the IRA during periods of national fiscal distress, although these cases have been very rare and there
   have been such cases in the past 15 years. The key restriction imposed by the LGC is for LGUs to set aside 20 percent of their IRA allocation for a local
   development fund.

   The IRA represents the primary source of income for the vast majority of LGUs (see Table 5.2). However, the current formula does a poor job of compensating
   for the varying levels of fiscal capacities across LGUs, often worsening the horizontal resource imbalances across LGUs. (Manasan, 2007). The data shows
   that on average the IRA distribution to the provinces is highly regressive, allowing those provinces with the highest own-source revenues to receive three
   times more IRA than those with the least own-source revenues. The distribution becomes somewhat less regressive for municipalities and progressive
   for cities.

   Non-IRA Transfers: LGUs also benefit from ad hoc grants from national government agencies, legislative funds, and foreign donors and creditors to support
   various local services. While these non-IRA transfers are cumulatively much smaller in scale compared to the IRA, there is no consolidated central tracking
   of data available that can be used to estimate the scale and distribution of such transfers. A study conducted to analyze the quantity and composition
   of non-IRA transfers to LGUs in 2003 estimated that the aggregate total for these transfers was equivalent to over 20 percent of the total IRA transfer for
   that year. The largest component of this total, comprising 61 percent, was funded by Priority Development Assistance Funds (PDAF) of legislators and the
   funds were mainly used to finance local infrastructure. However, the PDAF was declared unconstitutional in 2013 and has been discontinued beginning in
   fiscal year 2014. There is generally less transparency in the non-IRA funding systems, which has adverse effects on LGU planning and budgeting, and less
   information available for these miscellaneous transfers.

   In the past five years (2011-2016), reforms were initiated by key oversight national government agencies that have attempted to utilize additional fiscal
   transfers to LGUs as leverage to strengthen both supply-side and demand-side systems for local government accountability and created a space for
   genuine participation in municipal and city planning.

   •	    Through the Performance Challenge Fund (PCF), DILG provides small capital grants as incentives for LGUs that meet minimum standards in
         transparency and financial accountability (through the annual assessment of a “Seal of Good Financial Housekeeping”).

   •	    On a much larger scale, the Bottom-Up Budgeting (BUB) program was jointly developed by DBM, DILG, NAPC, and DSWD to facilitate poverty
         reduction by providing funding for local poverty reduction programs of LGUs that are conditioned on an annual participatory planning process

    Box 4. DILG Performance Monitoring of LGUs

     Since the mid-2000s, DILG has maintained the Local Government Performance Management System (LGPMS), a web-based system
     comprised of numerous indicators to help LGUs assess their capabilities and performance in the delivery of essential services. However,
     LGPMS is severely constrained by the fact that it is a self-administered tool, wherein the data entered is generated by the LGU itself, and
     access to its database is strictly restricted to the LGUs and DILG, which prevents the public from accessing and scrutinizing the data (World
     Bank 2012).

     More recently, DILG introduced the Seal of Good Local Governance (SGLG), which recognizes exemplary LGU performance based on
     an assessment of basic inputs and outputs for six broad areas: financial management and transparency, disaster preparedness, social
     protection, peace and order, environmental management, and business friendliness. The SGLG signals an increasing focus on the part of
     DILG to monitor local service delivery, however the initiative is still in the incipient stage (the first set of awardees were announced at the
     end of 2015) and DILG has not made the raw data used in the assessments available to the public.

     Brazil’s Ministry of Cities is responsible for urban development policy and sectoral policies for housing, sanitation and urban transportation.
     In January 2003, the Brazilian government created the Ministry of Cities with the objective of formulating national housing, environmental
     sanitation, and urban mobility policies that have a strong impact in urban development. The National Secretary of Transportation and
     Urban Mobility was created and the Brazilian Urban Train Company, which was part of the Ministry of Transportation, and the National
     Traffic Department, which was part of the Ministry of Justice, were incorporated by the Ministry of Cities to elaborate and implement
     urban mobility policy. The Ministry of Cities is charged with designing and implementing a national policy to upgrade informal and
     precarious settlements in conjunction with state and municipal governments, which are responsible for its execution. The Ministry of
     Cities is also tasked with strengthening municipal capabilities and a National Council of Cities engages diverse stakeholders in discussing
     national urban policy.


     In Chile, in the early 1960s, there were at least 28 institutions and eight different departments that intervened in matters of housing,
     urbanization, and equipment. To deal with this situation, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Planning was created in 1965 with the
     goal of improving and renewing the deteriorated areas of cities through rehabilitation and urban development programs. Among the
     priorities of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Planning is to address issues of urban equality, combat spatial segregation, and ensure
     that all residents benefit from the city, especially the most vulnerable. The ministry expanded programs to improve neighborhoods and
     condominiums, promoted a new program focused on interventions on small towns, and invested in infrastructure – all with a strategic
     vision and relevance to Chile’s distinct regions.


     In Colombia, a national Ministry of Housing, City and Territory was formed in 2011 and was tasked with the responsibilities for formulating,
     implementing, and orienting housing policy, urban planning, and water and sanitation services, particularly in the major cities. Prior to
     this, urban and housing issues were subsumed under a broader mandate of the Ministry of the Environment, Housing and Territorial
     Development. With the establishment of a separate Ministry of Housing, City, and Territory, the national government now has a focal
     agency responsible for housing and urban development issues, including disaster risk management.


     The Ministry of Urban Development is the apex authority of Government of India at the national level to formulate policies and programs
     and to coordinate the activities of various central ministries, state governments, and other nodal authorities concerning all the issues of

     many occasions, before finally becoming independent in 2004.

  Box 7. Global Approaches to Metropolitan Governance

  A common institutional approach in response to the challenge of metropolitan-wide governance has been simply to maintain jurisdictional fragmentation.
  In such cases, multiple jurisdictions function within a metropolitan area with some level of autonomy (Bahl 2013).

  •	    In a one-tier fragmented government model, a metropolitan area has a number of autonomous local government units responsible for delivering
        services within their own boundaries, which often leads to poor coordination among the various government units for critical metropolitan-wide
        issues such as economic development, environmental quality, social and spatial disparities, and the level of service delivery (Slack 2007). Jurisdictional
        fragmentation is prevalent in the United States, where there is a strong desire for local autonomy, and generally describes the metropolitan governance
        models of Mumbai and Sao Paulo.

  •	    Horizontal cooperation among local governments (which may take the form of case-by-case joint initiatives; contracting among local governments;
        and ad hoc committees, commissions, working groups, and consultative platforms) is a common approach to mitigate coordination issues within
        jurisdictionally fragmented metropolitan areas (Andersson 2014). However, voluntary cooperation is contingent on policy-makers of the various
        local governments having shared policy objectives. In cases where there are diverse objectives and motivations among local governments within
        a metropolitan area, voluntary cooperation is unlikely to succeed. Furthermore, given the magnitude of the challenges confronted by metropolitan
        areas (such as traffic congestion, pollution, global competition, and fiscal disparities) the required solutions are likely to require a more permanent
        institutional status. (Slack 2007).

  An alternative metropolitan governance structure is functional fragmentation, wherein the delivery of a single service or cluster of services is assigned to an
  autonomous agency (Bahl 2013). This approach may result in technical and cost efficiencies in service delivery because the autonomous agency would be
  able to specialize on a particular service while potentially leveraging economies of scale in providing services across a wider spatial jurisdiction.

  •	    The public service enterprise may take the form of a metropolitan-wide/regional authority or a special purpose district and, as is frequently the case
        in the United States as well as in the cities of Bangkok and Buenos Aires, different autonomous agencies may be established to deliver different
        urban services within a metropolitan area. Since it is unlikely that the spillover boundaries are uniform across different services (e.g., a regional transit
        authority may have a different spatial coverage than a solid waste management district), the advantage of such autonomous entities is that the
        externalities for each service can be addressed on an individual basis (Slack 2007). However, while there are economic efficiencies to be gained from
        pursuing metropolitan-wide authorities, this approach has also been criticized for reducing citizen control and local accountability for service delivery
        given that these autonomous entities are generally not directly under the control of any single local jurisdiction. Further, when independent special
        purpose bodies proliferate within a metropolitan area, it may become difficult to coordinate interrelated activities among them and to mitigate
        tradeoffs between competing investments and policies among sectors (e.g., transit infrastructure and water and sewer infrastructure).

  A more comprehensive governance structure is a metropolitan government where urban services are administered on a metropolitan-wide area (Bahl 2013).

  •	    Under a one-tier consolidated model, urban service delivery over an entire urban area is consolidated under a single metropolitan government,
        which allows it to leverage economies of scale and to internalize externalities to a greater degree compared to fragmented metropolitan governance
        structures. Such a structure also provides more potential for equalizing disparities in service delivery throughout the metropolitan area. Large single-tier
        governments have been created through the amalgamation of multiple local governments within an existing region or the annexation of a jurisdiction
        (or a portion of a jurisdiction) by an adjacent jurisdiction (Slack 2007). A diverse range of metropolitan areas has adopted this model globally, including
        Toronto, Shanghai, Cape Town, and Abidjan (Andersson 2014).

  •	    Another model of metropolitan government is a two-tier model where an upper-tier metropolitan body provides region-wide services while lower-tier
        jurisdictions are maintained to provide services of a local nature, such as local parks and amenities (Slack 2007). In such a model, the upper tier assumes
        responsibility for services that benefit from economies of scale, generate externalities, and are redistributive in nature. Examples of metropolitan areas
        that utilize this approach are Tokyo, Madrid, Istanbul, and Portland (Andersson 2014).

that the LGC can be revised to reduce the local autonomy                                administrative constraints that MMDA has historically faced,

more resources to the MMDA to realize its comprehensive                                 strengthen the quality and efficiency of metropolitan-wide

     Box 8. Key Issues in Metropolitan Governance

     While there is a wide range of experience globally in attempting to deal with the challenges of metropolitan fragmentation, there is no consensus on a single
     “best” approach for governing metropolitan areas. As Bahl, Linn, and Wetzel (2013) observe, “the great variation in practice that exists among developing
     countries suggests that almost any arrangement can work, if ‘work’ means that local services do not collapse.” Indeed, the key lesson from international
     experience is that the “appropriate” metropolitan governance model depends on national and local context (Slack 2007), including the strength of the desire
     for local autonomy vs. more efficiency in service delivery.


     A metropolitan government model where urban services are administered on a metropolitan-wide area would, in principle, be the ideal solution. However, in
     the context of developing countries, the option to adopt a comprehensive metropolitan-wide governance model is likely to be unrealistic because of rapid
     population growth, scarce resources, and the reluctance of central government to shift away from fiscal centralization (Bahl, Linn and Wetzel 2013). Even in
     cases of metropolitan consolidation in developed countries, the resulting metropolitan governments typically do not cover the entire metropolitan region
     (OECD 2006). For developing countries that are rapidly urbanizing, economic boundaries will continue to expand over time making it inevitable that even
     consolidated cities would still need to coordinate services such as transportation and economic development with neighboring municipalities (Slack 2007).


     Voluntary cooperation for the provision of some services may be more achievable than a full-scale metropolitan government in circumstances where a
     metropolitan area is too big to be acceptable as a political or administrative unit or where local autonomy is paramount and prevents a consolidation (Slack
     2007). In such cases, politics are more likely to dictate outcomes than efficiency or equity considerations. However, these approaches generally do not work
     well when objectives differ among local governments nor do they provide the needed regional foundation for metropolitan areas to coordinate service
     delivery.


     In many cases, adopting a metropolitan-wide/regional authority or a special purpose district to deliver different urban services within a metropolitan area
     may be a more politically and technically feasible compromise for a metropolitan region. In designing such arrangements, a key consideration is the need
     to balance between the potentials for economies of scale, externalities, and service coordination efficiency with the impact on residents’ access to their
     government and its responsiveness and accountability (Andersson 2014). Also, each urban service will likely achieve the lowest per-unit cost at a different
     scale of production, potentially leading to variations in the boundaries of different services (Slack 2007).


     While there is no single solution that is right for all countries, addressing governance issues of metropolitan fragmentation must begin with the central
     government taking a metropolitan-wide view of reform (Bahl, Linn and Wetzel 2013). Ultimately, central governments raise most of the tax money, spend
     the largest share of the public budget, and make rules on how sub-national governments operate. Hence, the road to better metropolitan governance and
     fiscal outcomes in metropolitan areas begins with national governments, which must consider that constantly changing conditions (such population growth,
     economic globalization, and climate change) demand a continuous evolution of metropolitan governance arrangements over time (Slack 2007, Yaro and
     Ronderos 2011).
