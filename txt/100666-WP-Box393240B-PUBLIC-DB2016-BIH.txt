THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

from 1 to 189 by the ease of doing business ranking.           Population: 3,824,746
Doing Business presents results for 2 aggregate measures:

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in the economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

       The seller requests and obtains the land registry excerpt from a
       competent court land registry office as the proof of ownership and to
       check the property against encumbrances. In practice, the excerpt must
       be obtained by the seller before starting the transaction formally. This
       information need to be obtained in hard copy and be sealed to have
       legal validity. The seller may hire a lawyer to perform this task. The           1 day

      Notarization of sale-purchase agreement

      The law on Notary of the Federal Republic of Bosnia & Herzegovina that
      passed in 2002 and became applicable in May 2007 prescribes notaries
      as the competent authority in the process of transferring a real estate or
      acquiring the ownership rights over the same or other real rights.
      According to the law, the purchase agreement of the real estate must be
      prepared as a notary deed. The cost of the procedure of notarization of
      the sale-purchase agreement depends on the value of the real estate at
      the time of purchase. Parties provide the notary with the land registry
      excerpt (obtained in Procedure 1) and well as with a court excerpt
      (obtained in Procedure 2). The presence of both parties is necessary at
      the notary's office or verification of the signatures should be based on a
      special power of notary. The notary needs to be provided with the
      following documents:
      (1) The land registry excerpt as well as the copy of the cadastre plan
      proving the ownership over the property;
      (2) The extract from the company’s court registry certifying the person is
      authorized to act on behalf on the company and to sign the purchase
      agreement;
      (3) The approval of the founder (i.e. the General Assembly or Supervisory
      Board if applicable) for selling the property in case that the value of the
3     property exceeds the amount of 1/3 of the company’s book value.                1 day        500 BAM

       New Notary Tariff has been passed on July 2013 (and replace previous
      one No. 71/07) and the same effected to the decresing of cost of
      notarization of sale-purchase agreement
      New Tariff of Notary Fees and Compensations has been passed on July
      24, 2013 and published in Official Gazzete of FB&H No. 57/13 and the
      same in general decresed the notary fees and compensations. Thus, the
      notary fee depends on the value of the property and will be calculated as
      follows:

      Value of property            notary fees in BAM
      above BAM            to BAM
      0                   5.000,00                    200,00 BAM
      5.000,00 50.000,00                     270,00 BAM
      50.000,00       100.000,00             350,00 BAM
      When the value of the subject of a legal transaction or other official
      action is over 100,000 BAM, notary is, besides the fee of 350,00 BAM,
      obliged to charge an additional fee of 50,00 BAM for every started
      100.000,00 BAM in the part in which the value of the official action
      exceeds 100.000,00 BAM, but in the amount not greater than 2.000,00
      BAM.

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

                               BizBank will initiate foreclosure, as Mirage can neither obtain a new loan from

                              It takes 3.25 years to finish foreclosure proceedings in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
                                Most delays in the proceeding are due to the sale of the immovable property.
                                 Steps for sale of movable property are simpler. Generally, movable property
                             could be sold by bankruptcy administrator either directly in negotiations with the
                              third party or at a public auction. The main steps in the foreclosure proceedings
                               (for sale of immovable property) are: 1. assessment of the immovable property
                               value; 2. sale of the immovable property. The sale of the property is conducted
                              by the court. 3. payment of the price and transfer of the immovable property to
                                                                    the buyer.
                              There are 3 main reasons for delay during the sale of immovable property: • the

                              For example, the immovable property cannot be sold below 1/2 of the assessed
                                   value at the first court hearing for the sale, respectively below 1/3 of the
                               assessed value at the second court hearing for the sale of the property. Only at
                                  the third court hearing for the sale, the immovable property might be sold
                                without any limitations regarding the assessed value. • potential objections of

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report). And for
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
