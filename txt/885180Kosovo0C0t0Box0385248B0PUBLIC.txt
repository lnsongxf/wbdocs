I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
       Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in Kosovo
        perceive the Bank;
       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Kosovo regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Kosovo;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in Kosovo;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
               work and activities, and communication and information sharing in Kosovo;
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in Kosovo.
       Use data to help inform Kosovo country team’s strategy.

II. Methodology
In June 2013, 204 stakeholders of the World Bank in Kosovo were invited to provide their
opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country survey.
Participants in the survey were drawn from employees of the office of the President, office of
Prime Minister, office of ministers, office of parliamentarian, ministries, ministerial departments,
or implementation agencies; consultants/ contractors working on World Bank-supported
projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of a project;
local government officials or staff; and respondents from bilateral and multilateral agencies;
private sector organizations; private foundations; financial sector/private banks; NGOs;
Community Based Organizations; the media; independent government institutions; trade unions;
faith-based groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; the judiciary branch, and other
organizations. A total of 101 stakeholders participated in the survey (50% response rate).
Respondents received questionnaires via courier and email and returned them accordingly.
Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Kosovo; their overall attitudes toward the
Bank; the World Bank’s effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge work and activities;
working with the World Bank; the Bank’s future role in Kosovo; and the Bank’s communication
and information sharing in Kosovo.
Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the World Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are
identified throughout the survey report.
A. General Issues Facing Kosovo: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Kosovo is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
   development priorities in the country, which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty
   and generating economic growth in Kosovo, and what best illustrates how “shared
   prosperity” would be achieved in Kosovo.
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in Kosovo, Bank staff preparedness to help
   Kosovo solve its development challenges, their agreement with various statements regarding
   the Bank’s work, and the extent to which the Bank is an effective development partner.

II. Methodology (continued)
    Respondents were asked to indicate the Bank’s greatest values, greatest weaknesses, the most
    effective instruments in helping reduce poverty in Kosovo, with which stakeholder groups
    the Bank should collaborate more, in which sectoral areas the Bank should focus most
    resources, and to what reasons respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts.
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps achieve development results and build existing country systems, the
   extent to which the Bank meets Kosovo’s needs for knowledge services and financial
   instruments, and the Bank’s level of effectiveness across thirty six development areas, such
   as education, job creation/employment, economic growth, law and justice, and anti-
   corruption.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge: Respondents were asked to indicate the areas on which the
   Bank should focus its research efforts and to rate the effectiveness and quality of the Bank’s
   knowledge work and activities, including how significant of a contribution it makes to
   development results and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank’s
   “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable, the Bank imposing reasonable conditions
   on its lending, disbursing funds promptly, increasing Kosovo’s institutional capacity, and
   providing effective implementation support. Respondents were also asked that to what extent
   they believed the Bank was adequately staffed in Kosovo.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in Kosovo: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the Bank should play in Kosovo in the near future and to indicate what the
   Bank should do to make itself of greater value.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, and their usage and evaluation of the Bank’s websites.
   Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s Access to Information policy,
   past information requests from the Bank, and their level of agreement that they use more data
   from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy. Respondents were also
   asked about their level of agreement that they know how to find information from the Bank,
   that the Bank’s websites are easy to navigate and useful, and that the Bank is responsive to
   information requests. Respondents were also asked to indicate whether they primarily use the
   Bank’s country website or the Bank’s main website.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in Kosovo, and their geographic location.


When possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey were
compared to responses from 75 respondents (75% response rate) who completed the survey in
FY 2006. Notations and/or charts are included when these comparisons were possible.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness

To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Kosovo, bivariate correlational
analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the forty-one specific areas of
effectiveness.
Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results increase.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Kosovo. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
                The Bank’s effectiveness at climate change;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at regulatory framework;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at social cohesion;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at equality of opportunity; and
                The Bank’s effectiveness at local governance and institutions.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in Kosovo, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
                The Bank’s effectiveness at disaster management;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at food security;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at urban development;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at climate change; and
                The Bank’s effectiveness at education.
