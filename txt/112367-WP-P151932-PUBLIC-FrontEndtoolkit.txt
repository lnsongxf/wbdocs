This FrontEnd Toolkit is about applying Design Thinking to transform new ideas into innovative products, services and

Foreword
Enhanced connectivity, inexpensive mobile phones, and the rapidly growing use of social media have radically altered the citizen’s behavior
everywhere. Increased openness and timely access to information also has the potential to reorganize the delivery of public services. Officials can
now engage citizens in design and service improvement by harnessing real time data - collected from sensor webs or crowd -sourced from users –
and customize content for various constituencies by language, location, and device.
Digitalization is also changing the innovation process from closed and linear to open and iterative providing parallel opportunities for a new
breed of coders, start-ups and SMEs. Forward-looking authorities already encourage software developers outside of government to co-create
applications in collaboration with citizens and to tap into knowledge generated as well as international networks. Co-creation can reduce
solution development costs, generate wider diversity of solutions and help to ensure that user needs and behavior are reflected in the final
solution before the launch of service.
This paradigm shift provides an opportunity for even the most resource-constrained public authorities to invest in low-cost development
of technology-enabled services. Innovation, however, is a social process shaped by culture, habits, convention and routines as much as
by technology or rules, laws and regulations. Often new projects fail to achieve the desired impact, and in many cases scarce resources
are not used in an optimal manner. This guidebook claims that how one begins to design a new project, often determines whether an
intervention succeeds or not. Mapping of all stakeholders and understanding their vested interests is critical knowledge that helps to
identify champions and hidden bottlenecks. Engaging with stakeholders at the early stage of design process helps to take all inter-
ests into account and build shared value for all partners.
Administrators want to learn from each other but approaches and methodologies applied in collaborative processes often still
reside as a tacit know-how in the heads of a few practitioners. This Front-End toolkit prepared by the World Bank team together
with leading experts, highlights the importance of political economy as a critical factor explaining why projects are working
or not. Taking into account the roles played by different stakeholders and their interest in planned interventions will have a
critical impact on development efforts and their outcomes. Authors of this guide provide a step-by-step guide to overcome
risks by engaging beneficiaries with local stakeholders to explore mutual interests and to build shared value in facilitated
workshop sessions.
II warmly recommend this guide for every policy-maker, project manager and individual interested in establishing a
solid foundation for their project.

Design Thinking
Complementary to analytical thinking, Design Thinking is a creative process based on
building up ideas and thinking outside of the box through “what if?” thinking. Often
the design thinking process is seen to have seven stages: define, research, ideate,
prototype, choose, implement, and learn. Within these seven steps, problems can
be framed, the right questions can be asked, more ideas can be created, and the
best answers can be chosen. The steps aren’t linear; they can occur simultaneously
and can be repeated. This FrontEnd Toolkit uses iterative planning processes that
include a series of canvas tools to map the key actors, interconnections, insights and
value created.

innovations that offer desirable experiences. These experiences      development process
should have the potential to permanently change behaviors,
provide opportunities for organizations and businesses to
succeed, and enable ecosystems to provide value to stakehold-
ers. These meaningful innovations must offer improvements to
quality of life in societies. Additionally, resources are required
to fuel activities, and the application of resources tends to
be limited by social constraints. This Toolkit aims to enable
communities to work within conditions of (potentially scarce)
resources in order to mature their ideas towards tangible and
actionable solutions.
The Front End of innovation is the very first step in the devel-
opment of new products, services and businesses. It is the
phase when initial ideas exist, together with notions of strate-
gy, some business intelligence, and a set of physical, financial
and human resources. Very often the Front End starts when
organizations, firms, or individuals realize that they need to
do something to change an existing situation – but often they
do now know what they should do. Correspondingly the Front
End ends when a decision has been made to continue planning
for implementation in a structured way, or, alternatively, when
further development is discontinued.                                 FIG.1.1.1 FRONT END INNOVATION | Source: Innovation Management Institute, Aalto University

                                 What are the workshop methods?
                                 Design thinking is an analytical and creative process that helps participants
                                 think outside the box and create products and services based on innova-
                                 tive ideas. In the early stages of design thinking, there are no judgments
                                 about “wrong” and “right” ideas. This helps eliminate the fear of failure and
                                 encourages maximum input and participation in the ideation and prototype
                                 phases.
                                 The design thinking process is often understood to have seven stages:
                                 define, research, ideate, prototype, choose, implement, and learn.
                                 Applying these seven steps, participants are able to clearly frame
                                 problems, ask the right questions to address them, create ideas, and
                                 choose the best solutions.
                                 The steps need not be linear; they can occur simultaneously and can
                                 even be repeated over and over.
                                 To bring ideas to life, activities are needed. Activities are the engines
                                 that bring products, services and business models together. This is
                                 why the workshop structure, method and approach is built on the
                                 idea of learning by doing, where participants build up their solutions
                                 in dense teamwork situations, build prototypes and test them.

                                                                                                           11

The aim of the Starter Pack is to make explicit the steps that need to be taken and the tasks that need
to be completed so that the toolkit workshop can have the best possible impact. It is often said that
preparation is half of the result, and the key lesson learnt from all of the workshops delivered to date
is that the choice of the participants, facilitators, and venue define the quality and scope of the results.

     Prepare workshop website
     You will need to share all workshop presentations and probably
     most videos and photos from the workshop with participants.
     Before the workshop, it is a good idea to set up a website where peo-
     ple can register, check the updated agenda, and speaker profiles.
     Prepare a simple website for that.
     Create social networks presence
     People will collaborate both during and after the workshop. A good
     way of staying looped in is through the creation of a social network
     group, such as LinkedIn or Facebook.
     Prepare a Twitter tag to raise awareness about the workshop and
     workshop activities.
     Invite media
     If you are aiming at publicizing your event, the best way is to invite
     the media.
     Prepare draft press releases and share them with participants, with
     your own media contacts or the contacts of other organizers.
     Consider arranging speaker and participant interviews. This is espe-
     cially relevant if you are inviting political representatives.

In this section we have the canvases that are used over the three days in the workshop. You will need to print the workshop canvases to at
least A1 size, at least one copy of each canvas for each participant group. We advise you to print at least one extra canvas in case you want
to split a group in two or do an additional exercise.

     Case Studies

Over the last two years, we have used this method to develop innovation activities in Chile, Finland,
Lebanon, Spain and Egypt, among other locations. In Beirut, Lebanon, the aim was to establish a set
of principles and the development of an action plan for a Mobile Innovation Hub. In Gran Concepción,
Chile, the objective was to establish the collaborative foundation for a local sustainable Urban
Innovation Hub. In Cairo, Egypt, the aim was to re-design a technology park to include an innovation
hub. Below we will provide short case studies of what was done in Beirut, Gran Concepción and Cairo.

the users interact with the software that is created, and our product
is valuable by itself. This way of thinking has a lot to do with sepa-
rate products and services.
The new kid on the block, business & technology platforms have
created a massive shift of business caused by the internet (e.g.
YouTube, Wikipedia, Airbnb). These “platform businesses” are very
close to product and service systems (PSSs), where users create and
consume value. The business models are very different from pipes,
as the PSSs need to be built up with both producers and consum-
ers in mind. The idea is that users interact with each other, using
software the business has created. The product has no value unless
users use it.
The key difference between pipe and platform business is linked to
the monetization strategies, which are distinct.
With pipe business, monetization is straightforward. One calculates
the costs of running a unit through a pipe all the way to the end con-
sumer and ensures that: Price = Cost + Desired Margin. The consum-
ers are charged the value that is created. With platforms, the mon-
etization is not straightforward. Producers and consumers transact
(e.g. Airbnb, SitterCity, Etsy): one or both sides pay the platform
a transaction fee. Producers create content to engage consumers
(e.g. YouTube), and the platform may monetize consumer attention
(through advertising). In some cases, platforms may license intellec-
tual property usage. On platforms, at least one side is usually subsi-
dized to participate on the platform. Producers may even be incen-
tivized to participate. The key question is to figure out who creates
value and who one charges for it.

The concept of the business ecosystems is a fairly recent idea, and
Moore introduced the idea in 1993 as an economic community of
interacting suppliers, competitors, customers, producers and oth-
er stakeholders (Moore 1993). Later on in 1998 he added financial
parties, trade associations, standardization bodies, labor unions,
governmental and quasi-governmental institutions into the equa-
tion. He emphasized the decentralized nature of decision-making
and self-organizing. He also thought that there were leadership
companies who influence the evolution of ecosystems. Moore also
introduced the idea of stages in business models: pioneering, expan-
sion, authority and renewal. The ecosystem renews itself, unless it
dies in the renewal stage.
Based on the works of Isenberg (2010) the model shown has been
adopted as the basic visual approach to understand ecosystems.
The model has an external perspective, whereas Moore’s model is
more internal. There are six main domains: enabling policy and
leadership, availability of appropriate finance, conductive culture,
range of institutional and infrastructural supports, quality of human
capital and characteristic of markets. These domains are divided
further into 12 categories, which represent key components of a          Source: Hubconcepts, 2011
healthy ecosystem.
When operating in ecosystems, businesses must decide if they are a
keystone or niche “player” and then formulate strategies appropri-
ate to that role and build up the foundations of sustainable perfor-
mance in a business ecosystem (Iansiti & Levien, 2004).
