Solutions for
Youth Employment
Strategic Plan • 2015 - 2020
About Solutions for Youth Employment
Solutions for Youth Employment (S4YE) is a multi-stakeholder coalition
among public sector, private sector, and civil society actors that aims
to provide leadership and resources for catalytic action to increase
the number of young people engaged in productive work. The S4YE
coalition was founded, in partnership, by Accenture, International Labour
Organization (ILO), International Youth Foundation (IYF), Plan International,
RAND Corporation, the World Bank, and Youth Business International (YBI).


About this Plan
This is the Solutions for Youth Employment (S4YE) five year strategic plan
for 2015-2020.
The plan outlines the key areas of work and approaches that the coalition will adopt over this five year
period. It is a living document that will be periodically reviewed and amended to reflect the changes
within the coalition, as well as most critically, the changes in context, learning, partnerships, and resource
flows that take place before 2020.

The S4YE coalition has an explicit commitment to work over a period of at least fifteen years to achieve
its objectives. This timeline is proportionate to the size and scale of the challenge: of understanding and
addressing constraints to employment that young people face. This plan is therefore, the first of three
plans that will be developed before 2030.

The Challenge of Youth Employment
Global growth over the next 20 years will be driven by young people.

However, young people face large-scale, complex challenges to finding productive work and employment.
There is no one solution and sustainable solutions for employment will not be found in a single sector.
For effective and scalable solutions, economists, industry specialists, politicians, entrepreneurs, trainers,
businesses, researchers, and policymakers will need to work together.

            The size of the challenge is enormous...                                                 ...and the complexity of the
                                                                                                        challenge is daunting...

The international community will soon set ambitious objectives in the form of the Sustainable Development
Goals. The World Bank Group has already set its ambitious goal to eliminate extreme poverty and to
boost shared prosperity for the bottom 40% of the population by 2030. The primary stakeholders in this
endeavor—those who will determine whether or not the world succeeds in meeting this challenge—are
today’s youth. In addition to the global goals of the international community, addressing youth employment
is necessary to achieve the corporate goals of the private sector and the regional goals of public actors.
Each sector has a compelling interest in youth employment, illustrated by the figure below.

     Our Vision - A world where all youth have access to work opportunities that
     empower them to escape poverty, thus boosting shared prosperity worldwide.

The vision captures key elements of the intended nature and purpose of youth employment:

•	    “all youth” – S4YE believes that all young people, regardless of gender, cultural background,
      political, religious or sexual orientation, economic or social status are entitled to the same
      opportunities that will facilitate their escape from poverty. “Youth” refers to those people
      between the ages of 15 and 29.

•	    “access to opportunities” – S4YE believes that policy makers and businesses can create
      more opportunities for young people, provided there is the right environment, capital,
      networks, and evidence. Young people are entitled to the right set of tools, skills, and resources
      that will put them in a position to use these opportunities to engage in productive employment.
      S4YE believes that facilitating access to opportunities rests on matching the supply of
      appropriately prepared, resourced, and skilled young people with the demands of local and
      international enterprises and private sector actors.

•	    “empower them” – S4YE recognises that young people are active agents in their own
      productivity and work, and that they will determine their own future. S4YE believes that with the
      right skills, information, and opportunities, youth will be enabled to make informed decisions
      about their future.


     Our Mission - To provide leadership and catalytic action and mobilise efforts
     to significantly increase the number of young people engaged in productive
     work by 2030.

The S4YE mission is to develop innovative solutions to youth employment, through practical research
and active engagement with public and private stakeholders to enable solutions at scale. S4YE combines
a pragmatic approach to identifying solutions for youth employment with an evidence-based advocacy
platform to increase access to productive work for young people.


     Our Goal - To provide catalytic support to employment and productive work
     for 150 million youth by 2030.

Worldwide about one-third of young people today, nearly 621 million, are not in employment, education,
or training. The S4YE coalition pledges to support 150 million youth to escape under- and unemployment
by 2030 – resulting in annual 1% reduction of young people not in employment, education, training, or
in vulnerable employment by 2030. In doing so, the S4YE coalition will become a recognised centre of
excellence, providing services and information to a wide array of industry actors engaged in implementing
solutions at scale. S4YE will track progress towards this figure by monitoring the collective efforts of
the broader ecosystem of actors and initiatives in which the coalition participates, as well as reviewing
global and regional youth labour market information and trends over the next fifteen years. S4YE’s
target of supporting 150 million youth takes into account historical trends, modelling impacts of future
interventions, and an appropriate level of ambition.

Our Approach: Link, Learn, Leverage
S4YE’s role is to advance and accelerate the development of solutions that
have the greatest potential to deliver high quality productive work at scale, for
young people.
S4YE’s unique approach to fulfilling this role is to:

•	   Link: S4YE will link public, private, and civil sectors to integrate
                                                                                   Learn
     lessons learned, identify effective solutions, and accelerate impact
     on the ground through cross-sector collaboration and innovation.

•	   Learn: S4YE will pursue a compelling learning agenda both by
     collecting and disseminating knowledge across the broad youth
     employment landscape, and through a targeted portfolio of
     high-impact initiatives. S4YE will generate and share open
     knowledge and data, as well as related practical insights
     across the globe.
                                                                                           Leverage
•	   Leverage: S4YE will leverage its knowledge and partners to
     catalyse the promotion of public, private, and civil sector
     innovations and operations that scale promising youth
     employment practices.
                                                                                   Link

The approach of linking, learning, and leveraging is cyclical, with each action
building off each other. Every learning opportunity becomes an opportunity to
leverage further resources for youth and to bring new partners in to operations.
Every linking opportunity becomes another opportunity to learn new lessons, or
reinforce existing ones. And every leveraging opportunity becomes a chance for
further learning and collaboration.

S4YE is a global coalition of stakeholders working on youth employment, namely civil society partners,
government officials, foundations, private sector entities, international organisations, and young
people. S4YE partners have operations in almost every country around the world.

The coalition aims to ensure we are able to link actors together and learn lessons from youth
employment interventions implemented in all countries around the world. Wherever possible, it will
manage knowledge and generate lessons that have clear value for application and replicability in
other contexts, in order to accelerate the volume of young people that can be supported to access
productive work. Additionally, in specific regions, the coalition aims to leverage resources for youth
employment interventions at scale.

While the youth employment challenge has a global scope, there are contexts where the nature
of the problem calls for immediate action. Accordingly, during the first five years of work (2015-
2020), the S4YE coalition will focus its interventions in the Middle East, North Africa, Sub-Saharan
Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, Asia, and countries where the youth employment challenge is
a national priority, applying lessons from linking and learning globally. The coalition will seek to scale
up proven solutions and focus on where the youth employment challenge is most pressing in order
to provide catalytic insights and maximise impact. It will encourage knowledge sharing particularly
through South-South learning and collaboration, and therefore contribute to improving global
understanding about what works to improve labour market outcomes for youth.

                   Priority #1: Build Partnerships

     Outcome 1: Foster global and regional coordination to increase local impact

S4YE will operate through its partners and network, working in the Frontier Areas to promote increased
collaboration. S4YE will cultivate cross-sector partnerships with key stakeholders that support the execution of
our coalition’s goal, including: civil society partners, government officials, foundations, private sector entities,
international organisations, and young people. S4YE will mobilise a Private Sector Advisory Group that will
support and guide deliverables in this priority, specifically in the development of further guidelines, tools, and
case studies.

S4YE will operate under a simple two-tier structure:
•	 Partner: A partner is an entity in the public, private, or civil sector who seeks to engage the coalition and act
   upon its mission by aligning resources to and for the work of the coalition. It may focus on the four Frontier
   Areas, seek to fill a knowledge gap for the research agenda, or commit to the coalition by joining an Advisory
   Group in either the technical, private, or financial areas. Their critical added value is to operate or influence
   youth employment at scale.
•	     Network: The network will consist of all non-partner supporters of the coalition. These will include all of
       those who wish to engage with the coalition by sharing and applying knowledge, specifically through good
       practices and lessons learned. The primary engagement forum will be the coalition’s website, which provides
       access to resources, tools, newsletters, and events that the S4YE coalition will organise.

                   Robust Evidence Base
 Outcome 2: Evidence-based use of existing and additional resources for youth employment

Learning around the four Frontier Areas is the foundation of the evidence-based advocacy and research agenda
of S4YE. The coalition will learn from a number of different sources including evaluations of interventions,
rigorous diagnostic work, private sector-specific work, research analysis, and project results.

The coalition will collect and curate a broad set of evidence that is of sufficient rigor for all sectors, noting that
rigor and standards are utilised differently by individual sectors. Equally important to the coalition’s work is to
provide a safe forum for experimentation, especially given that much of the programming in the four Frontier
Areas is either new or saturated, resulting in concerns around sharing “unsuccessful” stories. S4YE will work
in areas that are not yet tested and could be perceived as risky. Reporting on “failures in the field” in the four
Frontier Areas will be actively encouraged by the coalition.

By 2020, S4YE will build an evidence base of those                   By 2020, S4YE will have begun to set standards

                    Resources for Programmes
  Outcome 3: More and better resources aligned to scaling up proven demonstrations

Leveraging key partnerships and collective knowledge to provide more and better jobs for young people is the
ultimate aim of the coalition. Two critical means of achieving this are by using existing resources more effectively
(through scaling up proven solutions or not investing in interventions where evidence on effectiveness is
insufficient) and by mobilising new resources.

The resources available to any one sector to address the challenge alone are inadequate—to address the scale
of the youth employment challenge, we will need to align resources and leverage all available opportunities. One
of the central questions S4YE asks of its partners and network is: how to best align our collective resources to
complement each other’s actions and achieve more than we could individually?

For the size and complexity of the challenge ahead on youth employment, we know that current implementation
models, current knowledge, and current reach are insufficient. We need to innovate upon both how we act and
what we act upon if we are to be able to tackle the problem for this generation. While enormous emphasis has
been placed on technology, we must also be prepared to introduce innovative ideas to our practices, processes,

Four Frontier Areas
S4YE will focus on four Frontier Areas that purposefully shine a lens on key
trends that are heavily relevant to the S4YE network and key stakeholders in the
youth employment ecosystem today.
This will direct the coalition’s work over the next five years. In determining these Frontier Areas, S4YE notes that
there are several powerful converging trends that raise challenges and opportunities for youth employment:

•	   The need for enhanced strategies for youth transition to productive work: There is increased
     consensus on the multi-dimensional nature of this transition and the key role of governments and social
     partners in enabling it. There is also global recognition of the importance of (i) integrating and sequencing
     various components of active labour market policies targeting both demand and supply measures to ease
     the transition from school to work and to formality; (ii) increasing the productivity of the almost 80% of the
     workforce who are in the informal sector; and (iii) smoothing the transition of young entrepreneurs and
     business owners through better access to capital, both human and financial, and increased compliance with
     national labour legislation.
•	   Increased awareness of demand side constraints: There is increased recognition and concern that
     most development-led interventions have so far focused too little on understanding the constraints of what
     prevents the private sector from hiring young workers. Effective solutions are multi-sectoral and range from
     pro-employment macroeconomic policies that support stronger aggregate demand to programmes that
     address the skills mismatch. The latter calls for coordinated investments in skills development for youth
     that take into account the needs of the private sector, including cognitive and non-cognitive skills, as well as
     understanding the link between education and employment outcomes.
•	   The Digital Age reality: Technology is rapidly shaping the future of work. For young people, this translates
     into fast changing skills requirements and employment relationships. All young people wherever they are in
     the world, are either already working with Digital Age skills or will require Digital Age skills within the span of
     a generation to effectively cope with these technological changes.
•	   Increased attention to vulnerable employment among youth: For the next ten years, a significant
     number of young people will continue to work either on family farms (62% in Sub-Saharan Africa) or in
     household enterprises (22% in Sub-Saharan Africa).1 The large incidence of vulnerable employment among
     youth, particularly in developing economies, calls for better understanding of the challenge and further
     investments in measures to improve skills of youth and access to capital, particularly in rural areas.
•	   Recognised disparity between young women and men: Large gaps in labour force participation
     between young women and men continue, reflecting a lack of opportunity as a result of both cultural and
     systemic issues. Even where young women’s education levels are the same or higher than men’s, young
     women face additional barriers to productive work due to labour market discrimination. When young
     women find work, it may not be secure employment, with lower pay and in the informal economy. A better
     understanding of how to address the occupational segregation of traditionally accepted “male” and “female”
     jobs is needed.
Given these converging forces and the opportunities they present, youth employment actors are faced with the
challenge of creating resilient and flexible labour market systems that ensure high responsiveness to a variety
of social and economic factors. For example, in North Africa and in Central America, S4YE will explore migration
flow dynamics and its changing impact on youth employment. S4YE will identify and accelerate innovative
solutions through practical research and active engagement with public, private, and civil society stakeholders,
build evidence across the following four Frontier Areas, and engage strategic partners and its broader network
to reach its goal.

Note: The following are considered Frontier Areas because they remain knowledge gaps and are areas in which
S4YE can contribute across a number of evolving industries, including green economies and the digital industry.
1
  These kinds of jobs—working a small plot of land, selling vegetables on the street, sewing clothes in one’s home—often
generate low earnings, partly because the “enterprises” tend to be very small, typically involving only the family.
                                                                12
    Digital Age Impact            Skills Gap              Entrepreneurship               Quality Jobs
                                                          & Self Employment


                     The S4YE coalition will explore the impact of Digital Age technologies on youth
                     employment and how young women and men can be supported and better
                     prepared to respond. This includes learning about the impact of the Digital
                     Age on the formal and informal sectors as related to the access and delivery of
Digital Age Impact   information and services, as well as generating knowledge about efficiencies and
                     effectiveness gains that can be made in the delivery of services and programmes,
                     including those through vocational training. It also includes better understanding
                     of the comparative impacts of the Digital Age on women and men. The effects
                     of the Digital Age on public employment agencies and their services will be
                     investigated. S4YE will also seek to understand the changing nature of employment
                     relationships given new technological trends and their tangible effects on young
                     workers today. In addition to the need to develop digital skills, S4YE recognises
                     that the importance of basic skill development cannot be underestimated in
                     achieving the coalition’s goal.

                     The S4YE coalition will improve opportunities for young women and men,
                     including those on the lower end of the skills spectrum, to access quality training
                     and skills that are relevant to labour market requirements. This will be done by
                     examining market demand and trends, and engaging employers to understand
    Skills Gap       the current gap in skills and how they affect their organisations and the economy.
                     This may include technical, non-cognitive, leadership, digital, and entrepreneurship
                     skills. S4YE will work with its multi-sector partners to address these skills gaps,
                     through high-impact and demand driven solutions.

                     The S4YE coalition will support entrepreneurship and self-employment
                     interventions for young women and men, ensuring that they are increasingly built
                     on lessons from field operations. S4YE will collect and disseminate knowledge
                     about entrepreneurship and self-employment and how to ensure sustainability
Entrepreneurship &
                     in practice in a changing world. Understanding the informal sector, the often
 Self Employment     precarious work systems of youth in vulnerable households, and identifying the
                     potential for entrepreneurial activity within the youth population will be addressed
                     by this Frontier Area. The coalition will seek to strengthen entrepreneurial skills
                     and competence for women and men and better understand how to make
                     young people aware of specific opportunities for starting up a business, including
                     understanding existing value chains and the opportunities for linking young
                     women and men into them. S4YE will also seek to understand success factors
                     affecting small and micro enterprise development - especially critical for informal
                     economies lacking access to mentors, capital, and markets - particularly insofar as
                     how they relate to women and men.

                     The S4YE coalition will work to improve the number of quality jobs young
                     women and men are engaged in and better understand the incentives for
                     employers to improve working conditions in a changing world. Quantity measures
                     of unemployment do not always reflect the quality of jobs: unfair pay, temporary
   Quality Jobs      and part-time employment, lack of social protection, gender dynamics, and more,
                     need to be better understood. The coalition will address this issue by engaging
                     employers and civil society partners to understand how to improve the total
                     number of quality jobs for youth at scale.

S4YE’s Enablers
The following are tools that S4YE will draw upon to enable the coalition, its
partners, and its broader network to support youth employment around the
world. Each of these Enablers will be applied to S4YE’s Priorities and Frontier
Areas in collaboration with multi-sector stakeholders.

                  Access to actors and regional networks: No one stakeholder within S4YE can
                  achieve the ambition alone. S4YE is reliant on its partners and network supporters’
                  relationships with stakeholders across all sectors, including employers themselves.
                  S4YE will support existing regional networks to increase their impact, and focus on
  Access to
  Networks        growing its global network.

                  Youth Participation: S4YE knows that young people must be meaningfully present
                  in the operational and strategic guidance of the coalition. Youth participation will
                  include onboarding representatives to the Board of Directors, inclusion of youth in
                  S4YE’s Technical Advisory Group and Private Sector Advisory Group, enlisting youth
    Youth
 Participation    networks to join S4YE’s regional and global networks, as well as communicating and
                  engaging youth on projects and key products.

                  Quality Assurance: Generating quality and robust evidence is a stated outcome
                  of S4YE. A consistent and robust evidence base will ensure that S4YE is honest and
                  true to its purpose. S4YE will work to ensure that its learning and partnership work is
                  rooted in quality analysis and action, with appropriate quality standards and checks
   Quality        in place to ensure that the S4YE brand becomes synonymous with quality.
  Assurance
                  Data: Generating robust evidence requires quality data. Without quality data,
                  the strength and integrity of the evidence base will be compromised, as will the
                  knowledge management function and good practice tools that the coalition will
                  develop. Partners’ commitment to quality data collection and availability will be
     Data         paramount to S4YE’s outcomes.

                  Technology: Technology has catalysed the penetration of digital information and
                  advanced ways and means of operations for businesses and consumers around the
                  world. Trends in technology affect youth employment and create new opportunities
                  for engagement, skills training, and access to employment. S4YE is committed to
  Technology      understanding and leveraging the role of technology in taking youth employment
                  solutions to scale.

                  Shared Ambition to Scale: Scaling solutions is at the centre of the S4YE operations
                  and strategic vision. The diverse partnerships in S4YE all share a common ambition:
                  to learn, develop, collaborate upon, and implement effective solutions at scale. This
                  shared ambition is the foundation of the S4YE coalition’s priorities and agenda and
    Shared
   Ambition       includes the participation of employers in addressing the challenge at hand.

                  Local Projects: S4YE understands the need to engage a critical mass of projects
                  in order to generate learning and better understand what works and what does
                  not. S4YE is heavily reliant on its network to report findings and learn lessons from
    Local         projects being executed in real time. Without projects to generate learning in action,
   Projects       S4YE cannot progress towards its goal.

S4YE will begin to fill a significant gap in the existing youth employment ecosystem over the next five
years and measure its success in 2020 through practical research and active engagement with public
and private stakeholders, the foundation of an evidence-based advocacy platform, and the alignment
of new and existing resources to proven and innovative youth employment projects. Through its robust
framework and leading strategic partners and network of supporters, S4YE will catalyse impact for youth
across the globe.
