Overview
Tajikistan’s economy exceeded expectations during the first six months of 2015 despite a
challenging external environment. According to official data, GDP growth slowed only moderately
from 6.7 percent in the first half of 2014 to 6.4 percent year on year (y/y) in the first half of 2015,
even as remittances from Russia fell, global demand weakened, and prices for the country’s key
export commodities such as aluminum and cotton dropped significantly. Domestic factors continued
to drive growth, and both the construction and industrial sectors expanded as the economy’s focus
shifted from consumption to investment. The state budget surplus reached 1 percent of GDP, and the
external public debt to GDP ratio dropped to below 20 percent.

The sharp decline in remittances is limiting the growth of household consumption and could
threaten the sustainability of recent gains in poverty reduction and shared prosperity.
According to the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT), remittances dropped by 32 percent (y/y), in US
dollar terms during the first six months of 2015. Although the decline was less dramatic (about 18
percent) in Tajikistan somoni (TJS) terms, income losses were much larger than implied by GDP
statistics. Falling remittances, limited employment creation outside the public sector, and rising
prices are slowing the rate of poverty reduction. Moreover, the lack of well-targeted social programs
leaves households vulnerable to economic shocks.

The government is shifting its policy stance to reflect the worsening external environment.
The government is maintaining its commitment to fiscal discipline by setting clear spending
priorities and postponing less urgent expenditures while protecting social outlays. However, the
delayed revision of the budget until November has both heightened the risk of arrears and created
perverse incentives for tax authorities to exert excessive pressure on businesses in order to meet
their revenue targets. Monetary policy has been accommodative during the first six months of 2015,
and rising inflation rates have prompted the NBT to defend the somoni through a combination of
interventions and administrative controls, including ceilings on the exchange rates offered by
foreign-exchange offices. This policy has depleted the country’s already low stock of foreign reserves,
which stood at just one month of imports in early July. The NBT has recently ceased its interventions
and is gradually allowing the unification of the official exchange rate with both the cash and market
rates. The NBT is also intensifying efforts to rebuild its reserves and improve their management.

The country’s economic outlook is broadly positive, but current forecasts are subject to
significant downside risks. The recession in Russia—combined with slowing growth among
Tajikistan’s other major trading partners, including China, Kazakhstan and Turkey—is negatively
impacting its short-term outlook. After slowing to an estimated 4.2 percent for 2015 as a whole, GDP
growth is projected to recover gradually over the medium term, though it is expected to remain
below its recent historical average. The current-account deficit is expected to improve moderately,
narrowing from about 8 percent of GDP in 2014 to 6.3 percent in 2015 and remaining at around 6
percent thereafter. The fiscal accounts (excluding externally financed public investments) are
expected to remain broadly balanced over the near term. However, external-account volatility,
dwindling foreign-exchange reserves, contingent liabilities generated by state-owned enterprises
and systemic vulnerabilities in the banking sector all pose significant downside risks to Tajikistan’s
macroeconomic outlook. While weakening GDP growth is slowing the pace of poverty reduction, the
poverty rate is still projected to fall to 27.3 percent by 2017. As external and domestic pressures
continue to mount, addressing fiscal risks and implementing reforms to boost productivity, enhance
competitiveness and strengthen social safety nets will be critical to sustain growth and support further
progress in poverty reduction.

A.        Recent Economic Developments
Economic Growth and Domestic Demand

According to official data, economic growth remained strong in the first half of 2015 in the
face of a challenging external environment. Tajikistan’s GDP grew by 6.4 percent (y/y) between
January and June, down slightly from 6.7 percent for the same period a year earlier. The country’s
main trading partners—China, Russia, Kazakhstan and Turkey—have all recently experienced either
slowing growth rates or outright recessions (Figure 1). However, falling exports have been offset by
even larger declines in imports, as a steep drop in remittances has reduced household consumption.
As a result, net exports have made a positive contribution to economic growth despite worsening
external conditions. Moreover, internal dynamics continued to drive growth, and while consumption
declined, fixed investment grew by an extraordinary 41.4 percent (y/y), up from an already robust
28.4 percent a year earlier. Thirty-nine percent of total fixed-capital investment was foreign financed,
largely by Chinese investors. The public sector accounted for 37 percent of fixed-capital investment,
and the rest was comprised of private investment by domestic firms and companies with joint foreign
and domestic ownership.1

Construction and industry propelled growth in the first half of 2015 (Figure 2). The
construction sector’s remarkable performance reflected the completion of TJS 4 billion in investment
projects, an increase of 43 percent (y/y). Infrastructure, communications, electricity production and
transmission, and residential and commercial projects were all completed during this period. Sixty
percent of these projects were investments in productive capacity. The strong growth of industrial
production, which rose by 14.2 percent (y/y), was led by the extractive industries, the electricity
sector and manufacturing, especially the construction materials. Favorable weather conditions
boosted growth in the agricultural sector, which rose from 6 percent in the first half of 2014 to 6.9
percent in the first half of 2015. However, a frost in the early spring damaged orchards in northern

official estimates. After rising by 3.8 percent in the first half of 2014, services contracted by 5.3
percent in the first half of 2015 as falling remittances undermined domestic demand.2

The Russian recession, a weakening ruble, and tighter regulations on labor migration sharply
reduced remittance inflows in the first half of 2015. According to the NBT, the value of remittance
inflows in US dollars during the first six months of 2015 fell to US$1.2 billion, a 32 percent decline
from the same period in 2014 (Figure 3).3 Falling remittances have negatively impacted domestic
demand, causing the service sector to contract. Over 80 percent of Tajikistan’s inbound remittances
originate in Russia and are denominated in rubles, and the dramatic plunge in remittances is mainly
due to the exchange-rate effect of the ruble’s depreciation.4 In somoni terms remittances fell by a
more modest 17.5 percent.5 There is also evidence that tighter restrictions on immigration in the
Russian Federation since January 2015 may be affecting remittances.6 According to Russia’s Federal
Migration Service, as of June 2015 there were 992,170 Tajikistani migrants in the Russian Federation,
down 15 percent from the same period in the previous year. Furthermore, the number of Tajikistani



2 According to the 2015 National Human Development Report, “Tajikistan: Access to Resources for Human
Development,” a full 83 percent of Tajik households depend at least in part on remittance inflows. The survey
also revealed that 86.5 percent of remittances are used for immediate consumption and are not deposited in
the banking system. See:

ng.pdf
3 Data provided by the Central Bank of Russia indicate a decline of 46 percent (y/y) during the first half of 2015.

The disparity may be due to differences in the periodicity of ruble-dollar conversions, differences in the
analytical methodology and/or the definition of primary and secondary income, or differences in the
accounting of inflows from other countries.
4 According to the Central Bank of Russia the ruble depreciated by 42 percent against the dollar in 2014, then

appreciated slightly by about 1.2 percent as of end-June 2015.
5Using the unofficial (or “street”) rate would result in an even smaller decline of no more than 10 percent.

labor migrants banned from re-entry reached 324,634 by August 2015, up from 270,000 in
November 2014.

The sharp decline in remittances is slowing the growth of household income. In recent years
household income growth in Tajikistan has substantially outpaced GDP growth, but recent events
appear to have reversed this trend. Because of sharp decline in real remittances the projected drop
in purchasing power is over 10 percent in 2015, much more than suggested by the GDP numbers
(Figure 4).7 As discussed in the following section, micro-level data confirm the diverging trends of
GDP and income growth.8 Remittances comprise the country’s second-largest source of household
income, and households are struggling to cope with the decline in remittance values by increasing
the labor supply, both domestically and in foreign labor markets other than Russia, such as
Kazakhstan. However, this shift in labor dynamics does not appear to have fully compensated for the
income lost due to the depreciation of the ruble.

The Labor Market, Poverty and Inequality

There is evidence of mounting pressure in the labor market since end-2014. According to
Tajikistan’s national statistics agency (TajStat), the unemployment rate was just 2.5 percent in June
2015, unchanged from June 2014. However, the number of unemployed workers grew by about 5
percent during the first half of 2015 despite the creation of 120,404 jobs by the Ministry of Labor,
Migration, and Employment of Population.9 Furthermore, the number of job seekers rose by 4.1
percent, while the number of vacancies dropped by 22.1 percent (y/y), resulting in the increase in
the ratio of applicants per vacancy from 6.9 in June 2014 to 9.2 in June 2015—the highest rate of the
post-crisis period. Slow rates of employment creation have pushed many job seekers into the
informal sector, which accounted for about 49 percent of total employment in 2009. In February
2015 the government adopted a new strategy to reduce informal employment, which includes
measures to strengthen monitoring of the informal sector, reform labor laws, reduce barriers to
formalization and strengthen interagency coordination.

Agriculture offers the lowest compensation of any sector, yet it continues to dominate the
labor market, accounting for 45 percent of total employment. Employment in agriculture
declined by 3.2 percent over the last three years (Figure 5), and a combination of rising prices for
agricultural inputs, urbanization and emigration appears to be driving this trend. Repeated droughts
in the southern part of the country encouraged rural-urban migration and emigration, and the impact
of climate change has emerged as a subject of heated political debate following recent floods and
mudslides in Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast (GBAO) and the Rasht Valley in July 2015,
which caused about US$100 million in damages.10

vacancies were left unfilled in construction, industry, agriculture, transport and communication, trade and
other areas. Of all created jobs, 30.3 percent were permanent, 33.8 percent were temporary and 33.2 percent
were seasonal.

According to official statistics11 Tajikistan’s poverty rate fell by 4.4 percentage points over the
last two years to 32 percent, but gains varied across regions and between urban and rural
areas. The poverty rate fell most sharply in GBAO, from 50.9 to 37.3 percent, and in Regions of
Republican Subordination (RRS), from 45.9 to 37.8 percent (Figure 7). Poverty incidence is highest
in RRS, Khatlon, and GBAO and lowest in Sughd and Dushanbe. Poverty in Tajikistan is predominantly
rural, and almost four out of five poor people live in rural areas.

11On June 24th, 2015 TajStat launched a new official poverty series and methodological note using a new
approach in measuring poverty. The new method is based on the quarterly Household Budget Survey (HBS),
which has been consistently implemented and repeatedly improved. The national poverty line was set at TJS
158.71 per capita per month in 2014.

                                                                                                                                                 |5
Income inequality is relatively low overall, but urban centers are less equal than rural areas.
The Gini coefficient12 for per capita consumption increased by 0.6 percentage points between 2012
and 2014 to reach 29.0 in 2014 (Figure 8). This is below the conventional “low inequality” threshold
of 30. Inequality rose in most regions, except for Sughd, with Dushanbe and GBAO seeing the largest
increases of 2.2 and 3.5 percentage points, respectively. Overall urban inequality fell slightly, while
rural inequality increased.

RRS is by far the country’s most unequal district. RSS is relatively wealthy, with an average rate
of consumption per capita higher than that of Khatlon and GBAO; it also has the highest Gini
coefficient in the country (29.4), above even that of Dushanbe. Meanwhile, at 25.9 inequality is
substantially lower in GBAO than in all other districts. GBAO is Tajikistan's poorest district. It is
largely agricultural, and has few urban areas, which likely contributes to its relative equality. At the
national level inequality in Tajikistan is comparable to that of other countries in the region. Its Gini
coefficient is the same as Kazakhstan's last recorded figure in 2010, and well below that of the Kyrgyz
Republic, which was 33 in 2011.13

The national poverty rate fell to 31.6 percent in the first quarter of 2015, but the pace of
poverty reduction has recently slowed. Moreover, welfare indicators are worsening fastest among
poor households. According to the “Listening to Tajikistan” survey, between May and July 2015 the
average real income per capita dropped by 23 percent among households in the bottom 40 percent
and by 16 percent among households in the top 60 percent. These declines were primarily due to
lower remittance income, which was only partially offset by seasonal increases in the number of
remittance transfers—though even these were lower in total value—and by rising agricultural
income during the summer months. The decline in poverty in recent years has been driven by wage
growth, particularly in the public sector, and pensions, as well as remittances. Limited employment
creation outside the public sector, falling remittances, and rising prices have slowed the rate of
poverty reduction below its 2012-2014 average.


B.      Economic and Structural Policies
Fiscal Developments

Despite lower revenues the state budget showed a surplus of 1 percent of GDP in the first half
of 2015. Total revenues were 3.3 percent below target due to a sharp drop in import-related
revenues such as customs duties and VAT. In response, the government reprioritized its expenditures
and deferred certain capital investments. As a result total expenditures were under-executed by 16.8
percent, largely due to the Rogun hydropower plant, which spent 15.3 percent less than originally
planned during the first half of 2015.

Revenue performance was uneven during the first half of 2015, raising concerns that revenue
authorities may face perverse incentives to increase collections at the expense of the tax base.
As import tax and VAT revenues fell, a substantial increase in other tax and nontax revenues helped
mitigate the net effect on the budget. However, this appears to have been the result of tax authorities

equality of consumption, while 1 indicates complete inequality of consumption.

increasing pressure on businesses to meet revenue targets. While this tactic may boost revenues in
the short run, over time it threatens to erode the tax base by encouraging evasion and informality.

The government has largely protected social programs from the fiscal consolidation, and
social spending continued to represent roughly half of total expenditures. Social spending
remained at 16 percent of GDP, similar to the first half of 2014. At 2.2 percent of GDP healthcare
spending was 0.2 percentage points higher than a year earlier, yet it remains the lowest in the Europe
and Central Asia (ECA) region. The amendment of the budget has been delayed until the fall, and its
specifics have yet to be defined. Proposed amendments designed to protect social expenditures by
cutting spending in other areas, such as procurement, and by delaying capital projects that are far
from completion. A promised increase in public sector wages and pensions in September 2015 has
been postponed due to worsening economic conditions.14

The financial performance of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) has worsened, intensifying
fiscal risks. SOEs’ net arrears on accounts payable and receivable rose sharply during the first six
months of 2015. As of July 1st, the 24 largest SOEs had TJS 3.2 billion (US$547.8 million) in arrears on
accounts receivable and TJS14.4 billion (US$2.5 billion) on accounts payable, or about 6.8 and 30.8
percent of GDP, respectively (Figure 9). The state energy company Barki Tojik accounts for the lion’s
share of these arrears, almost 64 percent of payables and 29 percent of receivables. In August 2015
the government dismissed its top management, laid-off 50 percent of its personnel and mandated
that the new management maintain strict control over financial and human resources management.

14 In a January speech to Parliament, President Emomali Rahmon pledged to increase public sector salaries in
September 2015. Government, law enforcement and security sector salaries are slated to rise by 15 percent,
education sector salaries and pension payments by 20 percent, wages of social protection workers by 25
percent, and stipends by 30 percent. The minimum monthly wage will rise by 60 percent, from TJS 250 to TJS
400. The Ministry of Finance is considering postponing some of these increases due to the underperformance
of revenues.

The stock of external public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt declined to below 20 percent
of GDP. Tajikistan’s external PPG debt declined from 21.9 percent of GDP in the middle of 2014 to
19.6 percent in July 2015 (Figure 10) due to exchange-rate effects (US$58.4 million) and principal
repayments (US$55.1 million). The Chinese Export-Import Bank is Tajikistan’s largest creditor, and
its loans represented about 46 percent of total external public debt in the reporting period. Other
major creditors include the World Bank (15.1 percent) and the Asian Development Bank (12.7
percent). Despite low external debt levels and a declining risk of debt distress,15 the government is
continuing to pursue concessional loans exclusively due to its limited fiscal buffers, rising debt-
service obligations and low foreign reserves.

Monetary Policy and Financial Sector Developments

Rising food and service sector prices are causing inflation to accelerate. Average consumer
price index (CPI) inflation reached 6.3 percent in the first half of 2015, up from 5.3 percent a year
earlier (Figure 11). As food constitutes about two-thirds of the CPI basket, and over 70 percent of all
food is imported, the pass-through effect of the depreciation pushed the food prices up 8.3 percent
(y/y) in the first half of 2015. However, the potential impact of the somoni’s depreciation was
attenuated by falling demand and rising domestic food production. During the same period the cost
of services rose by 3.4 percent, compared to 2.2 percent a year earlier, due to a 25 percent increase
in water tariffs in Dushanbe, as well as higher energy tariffs nationwide.

The NBT implemented an accommodative monetary policy during the first six months of 2015.
Broad money and credit to the private sector grew by 12.7 percent and 25.7 percent y/y through June
2015 (Figure 12). The refinancing rate was increased in December 2014 and has since remained
unchanged (Figure 13). However, because the NBT’s share of funding at the refinancing rate in the
banking sector is low, monetary policy has only a limited effect on inflation. There is a considerable
gap between the refinancing rate and the interbank loan rate, and the latter stood at 20.3 percent in
June 2015.

Faced with a deteriorating macroeconomic environment the NBT loosened monetary policy
to support output growth in the real sector. Reserve requirements for credit institutions
observing prudential norms were reduced by 50 basis points in somoni and by 100 basis points in
foreign currency to 1.5 percent and 7 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, interest rates for NBT
liquidity-support were reduced by 117 basis points to 17.5 percent. These changes took effect on
October 1st, 2015.

Banking sector indicators reveal a continuing deterioration in asset quality. The reported share
of nonperforming loans (NPLs) rose from 27.2 percent in December 2014 to 29.2 in June 2015
(Figure 14). However, the real level of NPLs may be significantly higher due to the misclassification
of certain loans. The reported aggregate capital adequacy ratio for the banking system fell from 14.8
percent in December 2014 to 14.3 percent in June 2015, and banks are becoming more sensitive to
credit risks, including indirect risks from foreign-currency lending and market (exchange) risk. Many
banks also face liquidity pressures due to maturity mismatches, and some have become increasingly
dependent on the NBT for liquidity support. The financial system remains vulnerable to shocks, and
measures to support banks in distress are urgently needed.

Despite recent reforms targeting supervisory mechanisms and the enforcement of prudential
regulations, the banking sector continues to suffer from serious structural weaknesses. The
deterioration of asset quality reflects inadequate risk-management systems, poor regulatory
enforcement, an underdeveloped NBT supervisory framework, and deficiencies in financial
infrastructure that persist despite the rapid growth of credit-reporting and secured-transaction
systems. However, directed lending has declined significantly in recent years, as banking regulators
now closely monitor lenders and penalize misallocations of credit resources. The government has
taken steps to mitigate risks in problem banks, including through state purchases of bad loans, the
reorganization of senior management and attempts to collect on NPLs.

Financial intermediation in Tajikistan remains limited, and it plays only a marginal role in
supporting economic growth. Tajikistan’s credit and deposit indicators are low by regional
standards. Deposits amounted to just 16.5 percent of GDP in June 2015, up from 14.2 percent at end-
2014. Credit to the private sector increased from 20.2 percent of GDP in 2014 to 23.2 percent in June
2015, though this reflects a potentially problematic trend of aggressive credit growth (32.6 percent
in 2014 and 26.5 percent in June 2015) in a financial sector marked by weak governance and a high

NPL ratio. In the latest Doing Business in 2016 report Tajikistan ranked 109th out of 189 countries in
terms of access to credit.16 Expanding credit access, particularly for small and medium enterprises,
will require the government to enhance enforcement of regulatory norms, strengthen its credit
culture, further develop its financial infrastructure and improve risk management.

The Balance of Payments

The trade deficit narrowed during the first          Figure 15. Exports, Imports and the Trade Deficit
half of 2015. Merchandise exports declined           (% of GDP)
by 8 percent (y/y), whereas imports shrank by        80,0
25 percent (y/y). Excluding precious and
semiprecious metals17 the trade gap narrowed         60,0
to 36.3 percent of GDP in the first half of 2015
from 51 percent in the first half of 2014            40,0
(Figure 15). Weakening external and domestic
demand caused trade turnover to fall by 31           20,0

balance.

Lower prices for major export commodities caused total exports to decline. In the first half of
2015 merchandise exports amounted to 10.4 percent of GDP, down from 13.3 percent in the first half
of 2014. Primary commodities and simple manufactures led the export sector, including precious and
semi-precious stones, cotton and textiles, and mineral products. Electricity exports rose by 9.4
percent; Afghanistan received 92 percent of Tajikistan’s electricity exports, and the Kyrgyz Republic
received 8 percent.

The Tajik Aluminum Company (Talco), the country’s largest SOE, met its semiannual output
target and plans to double production within the next two years.18 During the first six months
of 2015 Tajikistan exported 61,200 tons of aluminum, up 3.6 percent (y/y). Talco is currently
planning to produce 190,000 tons of aluminum in 2015, 52 percent more than in 2014. Over the next
two years Talco will attempt to expand its annual production capacity to 270,000 tons in anticipation
of a moderate increase in global aluminum prices (Figure 16). However, the recent decline in global
commodity prices casts doubt on previous projections.

17 Most of these exports are part of an NBT program with Switzerland to convert nonmonetary gold into
monetary gold, a process known as “affinage.” When semiprecious and precious metals are included, the deficit
narrows further to 34.7 percent of GDP, down 15.4 percentage points (y/y).

Softening domestic demand caused imports to decline during the first six months of 2015.
Merchandise imports contracted from 64.2 percent of GDP to 46.7 percent of GDP (y/y), driven by a
drop in fuel and food imports, as low international prices did not pass through to the domestic
market. Although both wheat and oil prices fell dramatically in recent years (Figure 17), domestic
monopolies prevented any significant price reduction for those commodities. Nevertheless, the
depreciation of the exchange rate prompted consumers to shift from imports to domestic substitutes,
especially domestic foodstuffs. Falling household consumption also reduced demand for imported
cars and other consumer goods. During the first half of 2015 Tajikistan imported only 6,700 vehicles
valued at almost US$48 million. This represents a decline of 15,100 cars, or 60 percent in dollar
terms, compared to the first six months of 2014. The overall composition of imports by sectors
remains broadly similar to previous years, with the exception of vehicle imports (Figure 18).

After depreciating by 11.1 percent in 2014 the somoni lost 25 percent of its value against the
US dollar during the first ten months of 2015 (Figure 20). Concerned about rising inflation, the
NBT initially defended the somoni through a combination of interventions and administrative
controls. However, this policy depleted the country’s already modest reserves, which stood at about
one month of import coverage in early July (Figure 21). After about two and a half months of relative
stability, and as the currencies of Tajikistan’s major trading partners continued to depreciate against
the US dollar, the NBT allowed the somoni to adjust gradually beginning in late August. The NBT
recently ceased its interventions, allowing for a gradual unification of exchange rates at different
market segments. The NBT has also stepped up efforts to rebuild its reserves and improve their

C.        Outlook
The recession in Russia, combined with slowing growth among Tajikistan’s other major
trading partners, is negatively affecting its short-term outlook. The GDP growth rate is projected
to fall from 6.7 percent in 2014 to 4.2 percent in 2015 (Figure 22).19 An estimated 30 percent drop in
remittances, in dollar terms, is impacting growth in the services sector, which accounts for over 40
percent of the economy. Meanwhile, slowing growth among Tajikistan’s major trading partners,
including China, Kazakhstan and Turkey, will continue to depress demand for the country’s key
export commodities, especially cotton and aluminum. The depreciation of the somoni may mitigate
this effect by boosting exports, encouraging the substitution of domestic production for imports and
increasing the somoni value of remittances. Yet the current-account deficit is projected to improve
only moderately, narrowing from about 8 percent of GDP in 2014 to 6.3 percent in 2015. The
depreciation will push up inflation, though low international food and fuel prices may hold the

19 This growth forecast has improved since the previous update, which projected 3.2 percent growth in 2015, due to changes

in some key underlying assumptions, including a less severe contraction forecast for Russia (-2.7 percent compared to -3.8
percent) and more moderate decline in the dollar value of remittances (30 percent compared to 40 percent). It also takes
into account the latest statistical data from government agencies.

average inflation rate to single digits in 2015. The government is committed to keeping the fiscal
deficit below 0.5 percent of GDP over the medium term, which will require restraining and
rationalizing expenditures while protecting social programs.

GDP growth is projected to recover gradually over the medium term, but this forecast is
subject to significant downside risks. Investment will drive growth, and is projected to rise to 16
percent of GDP by 2017. Despite a modest projected recovery in exports and remittances the current-
account deficit is expected to remain at about 6 percent of GDP over the medium term, due largely to
rising capital-goods imports related to investment projects. The fiscal accounts (excluding externally
financed public investment programs) are expected to remain roughly balanced over the near term.
However, external-account volatility, dwindling foreign-exchange reserves, contingent liabilities
generated by state-owned enterprises and systemic vulnerabilities in the banking sector all pose
significant downside risks to the macroeconomic outlook.

Slowing GDP growth is expected to limit progress in poverty reduction. The poverty rate is
projected to fall to 30.7 percent in 2015 and reach 27.3 percent in 2017 (Figure 23). However, lower
remittances, a weaker labor market, and slower increases in real wages are expected to constrain the
growth of household purchasing power. The poor are likely to be negatively affected by both the
decline in remittances and higher inflation rates, though low international food and fuel prices will
help contain CPI inflation. A lack of effectively targeted social programs leaves households vulnerable
to economic shocks, underscoring the urgency of implementing the new Targeted Social Assistance
Program nationwide. This program is relatively modest in size and scope, yet it could play a pivotal
role in mitigating the impact of a worsening external environment on extremely poor households.

As external conditions continue to deteriorate, it will become increasingly difficult to sustain
progress in poverty reduction and shared prosperity. In an environment marked by lower
commodity prices and slowing growth among Tajikistan’s major trading partners, domestic factors
such as productivity and competitiveness, human capital formation, the development of a more
robust service sector, and the quality of the investment climate will be critical to Tajikistan’s medium-
and long-term growth prospects. The challenge of fostering continued growth and development
despite worsening external conditions will be compounded by the weakening of key foreign labor

                                                                                                                     |13
markets, particularly in Russia, which will not only depress remittances, but is likely to increase the
domestic labor supply by discouraging emigration. In this context, a focus on creating high-quality
jobs should serve as a cornerstone of the country’s development strategy.


D.       Special Focus Section: Growth and Jobs in Tajikistan20
Tajikistan’s economy grew at a robust average of 7.9 percent per year during the 2000-2014
period. Growth was supported by rising export revenues and strong remittance inflows as both the
global and regional economies expanded rapidly from 2000 to 2009. However, exports of aluminum
and cotton declined rapidly in the wake of the global financial crisis, and Tajikistan’s economy
became increasingly dependent on remittances, which peaked to over 50 percent of GDP in 2013.

High growth rates produced remarkable achievements in poverty reduction. Over the past 10
years Tajikistan has ranked among the top 10 performers in the world in terms of poverty
reduction.21 The country’s poverty headcount ratio (at the national poverty line) fell from 96 percent
in 1999 to an estimated 32 percent in 2014.22 Although Tajikistan became a lower-middle-income
country in 2014, with a gross national income per capita23 of US$1,080, it remains the poorest
country in the ECA region. Moreover, less progress has been observed in nonmonetary poverty
indicators, especially access to education, utilities and other service.24

Rapid economic growth has not translated into robust job creation. Years of strong economic
and income growth did not produce significant improvements in the availability and quality of jobs
in Tajikistan, further incentivizing emigration.25 Due in part to limited employment opportunities in
the domestic labor market, about 1 million Tajikistani citizens have left the country in search of better
jobs. While the official unemployment rate remains low, a large share of the workforce, including
one-third of men aged 20-39, has opted to leave the country, with most bound for the Russian
Federation.26 Over the past year, however, a deepening recession in Russia and the imposition of
more stringent migration policies by the Russian authorities have encouraged the return of
Tajikistani migrants, intensifying pressure on the domestic labor market.

Tajikistan’s dependence on remittances and limited economic diversification have left it
highly vulnerable to external shocks. Despite important gains in income growth and poverty
reduction, the country’s current economic model presents several important challenges to its long
term-development. This Special Focus Section analyzes the key role of employment creation in
sustaining the country’s recent progress in poverty reduction and supporting the development of a
more resilient growth model capable of thriving in a less favorable external environment.

Tajikistan’s population is relatively young, with a median age of about 25, and the domestic
labor market is ill equipped to absorb the influx of new workers. While the working-age
population grew by almost 3.2 percent per year between 2000 and 2014, domestic employment grew
by just 2.1 percent. During this period annual real GDP growth averaged 7.5 percent, implying an
average employment-to-growth elasticity of around 0.28. This is slightly lower than the average for
both developing countries in ECA (0.30) and lower-middle-income countries worldwide (0.32).27
Moreover, this elasticity decreased significantly following the global financial crisis, from 0.33 in
2000-2009 to just 0.13 in 2010-14, further slowing the already inadequate pace of job creation.

Tajikistan’s structural transformation has been gradual and incomplete, and the majority of
workers remain employed in agriculture. The agricultural sector employs about two-thirds of the
workforce, and this share has remained virtually unchanged since 2000 (Figure 24). Agriculture also
continues to exhibit the lowest labor productivity of any sector (Figure 25). During the same period
the share of workers employed in the more productive industrial sector decreased from 7 to 4
percent. The only subsectors that saw both increased employment and rising labor productivity were
trade, construction, transportation and communications, all of which began at very low levels.

Real wage growth in the formal sector outpaced increases in labor productivity, eroding
competitiveness and hindering job creation. Labor productivity grew by about 5 percent annually
between 2000 and 2014, substantially slower than in many comparable countries.28 Real wages in
the formal sector rose by 326 percent between 2005 and 2014, while labor productivity increased
by only 61 percent.29 Rising labor earnings play an important role in poverty reduction, but further

increases in wages without commensurate improvements in underlying labor productivity could
undermine competitiveness and inhibit job creation.

Services drove the growth of labor productivity, supported by more modest recent
contributions from agriculture and industry. Increases in labor productivity underpinned the
growth of GDP per capita in 2000-14, and rising value added per worker in the service sector
represented more than half of aggregate labor productivity growth (Figure 26), with transportation
and communications playing the most important role. However, industry and agriculture have
increased their share dramatically since 2010, with services contributing less than 10 percent to total
labor productivity growth since the crisis. Inter-sectoral labor mobility is low in Tajikistan, and the
reallocation of labor has made a slight negative contribution to the growth of value added per
worker.30 These trends highlight the extent to which the country’s current model of remittances-
driven, service-sector-led growth has ceased to provide a sound basis for its continued economic
development.

Low rates of job creation are the result of multiple interrelated factors, but an analysis of the
labor market reveals three overarching causes.31 The first is weak macroeconomic management,
which undermines the economic stability necessary to attract private investment. The second is an
inhospitable business environment marked by weak governance, erratic tax administration and
limited access to quality infrastructure, especially energy and information technology, which inhibits
diversification and erodes competitiveness. The third is a shortage of workforce skills, low
geographic and inter-sectoral labor mobility, and information asymmetries in the labor market.
These factors conspire to constrain employment and income growth and inhibit improvements in
labor productivity.

In order to sustain progress on poverty reduction and shared prosperity in a worsening
external environment Tajikistan’s development strategy should prioritize accelerated job

 The only exception to this trend was during the global financial crisis in 2008-2010.

creation. While remittances have had a highly positive impact on poverty, excessive dependence on
foreign labor markets is unsustainable and leaves Tajikistan vulnerable to external shocks. Enabling
private sector development through an improved business environment and the continued
implementation of the structural reform agenda will be critical to robust employment growth. While
an enabling environment for private investment will be vital to the creation of high-quality jobs, a
comprehensive strategy will be necessary to address specific obstacles to private-sector-led growth.

A comprehensive employment-creation strategy should be rooted in three core objectives: (i)
supporting job growth in the private sector, (ii) building the workforce skills demanded by
employers, and (iii) facilitating accessibility to jobs among vulnerable people and
communities. These objectives reflect the unique challenges faced by Tajikistan over both the short
and medium term. The first is based on the axiom that sustainable job creation requires an efficient
and competitive private sector. Policy actions designed to advance these objectives would include
macroeconomic and structural reforms, as well as improvements in the business climate that would
enable firms to invest, expand, and hire workers.

Employment growth in Tajikistan is constrained by both demand- and supply-side factors.
Therefore the second objective focuses on developing the workforce skills required by an
increasingly sophisticated and dynamic labor market. Policy actions in this area range from reforms
in primary and secondary education to the provision of specialized vocational training tailored to the
needs of employers.

Finally, promoting a healthy and inclusive labor market will require resolving information
asymmetries and encouraging labor mobility. Measures to expand the availability of information
on labor demand and ease the mobility of workers across regions and sectors would leverage the
impact of improvements in human capital. In addition, strengthening social safety nets would help to
minimize the risks faced by workers as they attempt to transition to new regions and industries,
increasing the flexibility of the labor force and enabling employers to attract workers to emerging
economic sectors.
