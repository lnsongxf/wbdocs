1. SUMMARY
After hearing of the success of Fundación Chile, the governor of the Mexican state of Jalisco
sought to recreate the foundation locally. The result is Fundación Jalisco, which seeks to
import successful business models to small farmers in Jalisco. For its first project, the
Fundación imported high-yield blueberry plants from the United States, started a nursery, and
gave the plants to local farmers who were capable of growing them successfully. The farmers
deliver their berry harvest to the foundation, which packages and sells it throughout Mexico
and overseas in the United States and the United Kingdom. The venture has been highly
profitable for all concerned, and the foundation is now seeking to diversify into value-added
products such as olive oil and cheese. The foundation relies on a combination of state funding
and private investment.




2. BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
Fundación Jalisco emerges at a time when diversification through innovation is needed to
keep Mexico competitive in international export markets, and to help its rural citizens attain a
higher standard of living. The foundation seeks to blaze a trail by transforming Mexico’s
approach to new economic opportunities.

Francisco Ramirez Acuna, governor of the Mexican state of Jalisco, visited Chile in 2005 to
determine whether the Fundación Chile agribusiness incubation model could be successful in
Jalisco. Together, the Agricultural Council in Jalisco and Fundación Chile developed an
institutional model, “Fundación Jalisco, Innovation and Development.” The foundation was
created through a constitutional act in 2006.

Fundación Jalisco started up in 2007 with the formation of an eight-member advisory board
headed by Francisco Conejo, who also spearheaded the creation of Fundación Chile. Mr.
Conejo is president of the bank Coincidir Socieded Financiera Popular. He has managed
agricultural business development and worked to improve rural productivity in Chile
throughout the past 20 years. His experience and business affiliations facilitated partnerships
and financial investments for Fundación Jalisco, including VitalBerry, Fundación Chile, the
Jalisco government, and the Foundation’s business-minded advisory board.

Fundación Jalisco struggled at first to secure long-term investment in Mexican agribusinesses,
given agriculture’s high investment and slow returns, and Mexico’s immature venture capital
industry. Mr. Conejo researched and developed successful pilot projects to build the
foundation’s reputation.

The foundation’s advisory board guarded against early failures by assessing project feasibility
and ensuring steady project development. This was critical to the organization’s current
success. Fundación Jalisco also relied on Fundación Chile’s expertise in value-chain
development and in gaining financial and technical support.

3. STRATEGIC VISION, MISSION, AND TARGETS
Fundación Jalisco is a private institution with a public interest in providing leadership in
innovation and business development. It recognizes the fundamental role the rural part of the
state has played in Jalisco’s development, and its importance to Mexico’s agricultural sector.
Fundación Jalisco focuses on helping to increase the competitiveness of agricultural
production chains, and on assisting businesses that are capable of adapting new technologies
and knowledge.

The Fundación’s three strategic pillars are:

           Innovation. The introduction of significantly better or new production processes,
           commercialization methods, organization methods, internal company practices, and
           workplace organization.

           Inclusion. Ensuring that society as a whole participates in generating wealth and that
           there is equitable wealth ownership.

           Sustainability. Helping to maintain the viability and permanence of businesses and
           their networks.



4. INCUBATOR’S DISTINCTIVE FEATURES
       •   Our primary goal is to help small producers become business entrepreneurs.
       •   We recruit, train, and provide unlimited technical assistance to producers accepted
           into the Berry Industry Development Program, our flagship program.
       •   We are involved in all aspects of value creation, dedicating time, information, and
           resources to fruit producers.
       •   We have a hands-on approach and small-scale operations that target specific
           industries. We outsource consulting, and we manage innovations rather than create
           them.


5. BRAND AND MARKET POSITION
Fundación Jalisco’s market position is secure and growing, with increased berry production
and rapidly expanding demand in the United States and the United Kingdom. Jalisco’s warm
climate makes the berry supply especially competitve with U.S. produers in the winter months.
Recognizing the benefits of a diversified portfolio, Fundación Jalisco is currently expanding
production to the olive oil and cheese industries, which will strengthen its market stake and
aid sustainability.

Fundación Jalisco has a reputation in Mexico for inspiring revenue-generating innovation as
never before seen in the country. It is respected for the way it creates mutually beneficial
associations with its producers. By contracting with Fundación Jalisco, producers have access
to barrier-free markets and valuable technical assistance, which earns them higher salaries, an
approach that over time will revolutionize rural production in Mexico. Fundación Jalisco

                                                 3	  
	  
receives a great deal of positive attention from national media sources, in addition to its own
publication, Innovar Jalisco, that advertises its new innovations and businesses. These media
outlets disseminate evidence of Fundación Jalisco’s successful work and will continue to have
a positive effect on its market position. Fundación Jalisco’s productive partnerships with
quality organizations such as Fundacion Chile and VitalBerry, a worldwide exporter of
blueberries, have granted it access to the top echelon of agribusiness entities. This will
continue to enhance the foundation’s production chains and reputation.



6. APPROACH TO INCUBATION
Fundación Jalisco helps create opportunities by facilitating collaborations with public
institutions, entrepreneurs, and society:

           1. We connect technical knowledge from businesses and world markets to the needs
           of the Jalisco agricultural sector.
           2. We bring in help from agricultural experts.
           3. We promote investment in local small businesses.
           4. We design high-value production chains that strengthen geographic clustering.
           5. We stimulate regional development, raising the quality of life for Jalisco’s residents.


The Berry Industry Development Program, created as a public-private partnership in 2008,
incorporates 800 producers and 3,500 hectares of berries under one umbrella. It aims to
attract investment and help producers develop additional business lines. The program uses a
strict qualification rubric to filter the large number of prospective producers. Farmers must be
solvent, have field experience, and own high-quality land, among other requirements.

Technical experts visit potential producers and produce a report and evaluation. Producers
who are approved sign a commercialization contract. They receive plants and technical
assistance in establishing berry gardens.

Benefits from Value Chain Interventions for Farmers

       •   Assured Commercialization—Guaranteed market access without advertising, sales
           promotion, or marketing costs.
       •   Training & Technical Advice—Instruction in land preparation techniques unique to
           berries, garden design, and harvesting methods eliminates the need for costly trial and
           error, thus increasing the chance of a successful harvest.
       •   Access to Genetically Superior Berry Plant—With a genetically superior plant,
           producers reduce the chances of weak crop yields and low profits.
       •   Financial Management Support—Aid in managing revenues and production costs
           promotes long-term sustainability for the small businesses.

           6.2.    INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK

Fundación Jalisco is a nonprofit civil association with a development agenda, created by
business professionals. It focuses on creating profit-earning businesses and high-value
production chains. Its governance structure consists of business experts who are directly
involved in its operations.

Fundación Jalisco contracts with external agents to provide technical assistance to producers.
Over time, as Fundación Jalisco diversifies its agricultural businesses and expands operations,
the advisory board may be less directly associated with the foundation’s operations. The
organization may also find it more cost-effective to hire its own technical experts.



7. BUSINESS MODEL
The relatively high profitability of berry cultivation motivated Fundación Jalisco to undertake
this as its first project. Studies show that one hectare of berries will yield profits of $102,295--is
7.8 times more than one hectare of sugar cane ($13,074 profit) and 9.8 times greater than corn
($10,383 profit ). The rapid growth of the berry market triggered by growing U.S. demand and
a climate conducive to berry cultivation made Jalisco a promising site for berry enterprises,
now and in the future. Fundación Jalisco also looked into technical considerations, including
fertilizer, adequate water Ph levels, quality of soil, and the willingness of local farmers to
cultivate a new plant and undertake hard field labor.

The berry value chain incorporates the following steps:

              §   Buy berry plants from the U.S.
              §   Produce berry plants in a nursery for distribution to producers.
              §   Provide training and technical assistance to producers.
              §   Berry plants are received and cultivated.
              §   Berry harvest is gathered and packaged.
              §   Commercialization of product, e.g., marketing, distribution and retail.
              §   Product sold on domestic and international markets.


                                                  5	  
	  
Fundación Jalisco recognized that local farmers would not purchase berry plants without
knowing their yield potential. It solicited state government funds to buy berry plants from
Oregon, knowing that the government would support this method of wealth generation if the
berry production method proved legitimate. In 2005, Fundación Jalisco contracted with
VitalBerry and Chilean consultants to develop a nursery with its own technology for the
cultivation of government plants.

The nursery contract was essential to bringing commercialization capabilities to Fundación
Jalisco through new associates, including VitalBerry and other stakeholders along the
blueberry value chain, with experience in berry cultivation, access to markets, and technical
expertise. Fundación Jalisco selected producers and provide technical assistance with the aid
of subcontracts and financial assistance from SEGARPA and the Jalisco Government.

Technical assistance in this case includes training in land evaluation and preparation, planting,
and harvesting methods. The results of each phase are recorded in a project database. The
technical assistants use this information to produce a “Technology Packet” that helps
producers strategize for subsequent plantings. The packet is also given as a record of account
to SEGARPA.

While Jalisco’s government has been crucial for the Fundación’s initiatives, the relationship
between these two entities is subject to the priorities of the state’s current governor. Governor
Francisco Ramirez’s interest in foreign technology and innovation has been a great boost for
the foundation’s goals. Subsequent governors who are less involved in Fundación Jalisco may
have a different attitude toward funding the foundation’s new initiatives.

       •   Fundación Jalisco is implementing Fundación Chile’s portfolio diversification
           approach by exploring the possibility of producing crops and livestock for olive oil and
           cheese, as well as by producing other fruits in addition to berries. With funding from
           the state, Fundación Jalisco purchased olive trees from California and is cultivating an
           orchard under a new associate. Fundación Jalisco will be able to purchase shares and
           thus receive royalties for each olive tree sold.


8. OUTCOMES AND CONCLUSIONS
Investments in berry production have enabled Fundación Jalisco to establish:

           Vivero Usmajac—Since July 2008, the nursery has cultivated berries for producers
           participating in the Berry Industry Development Program. The nursery covers more than
           600 hectares and has one million plants in development, with the capacity to produce
           three million plants annually.

           Innovar Jalisco— Fundación Jalisco’s marketing company disseminates information
           regarding its innovations and businesses through this magazine.

           Comercializadora de Moras de Jalisco—This arm helps commercialize products
           derived from the Development Program for Berries in Jalisco.



                                                  6	  
	  
          Olea Europea—Garden designated for experimenting with olive-tree varieties for the
          production of high-quality extra virgin olive oil.

          Quesos Criollos—An experimental goat farm that allows for the making of gourmet
          cheese.



9. CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS
Local Government Support, in the case of berries and olives, provided the initial funding
needed to acquire plants for distribution to producers.

Technical Assistance has enabled Fundación Jalisco to clearly articulate, coordinate, and
improve each service within the value chain. Technical assistance also helped Fundación
Jalisco create new production instruments such as the berry nursery and cold storage. In
subsidizing technical assistance, Fundación Jalisco has established a mechanism for improving
crop yields, and thus profits.

Availability is a key component of our mission. Fundación Jalisco makes its services available
to producers at all times, minimizing potential problems in the value chain.

Early Profits have been realized by 205 producers growing 1.4 million berry plants on 278
hectares of land, showing that the U.S. and U.K. markets are indeed profitable. Berry revenues
have in turn allowed Fundación Jalisco to begin exploratory production in the olive oil and
cheese industries.



10. LESSONS LEARNED AND IMPLICATIONS FOR AGRIBUSINESS
    INCUBATORS
       1.) A great idea may not generate profits; there are crucial differences between
           good ideas and good businesses.
           Lacking the economic resources for its own R&D, Fundación Jalisco strategically
           pursued market-based technologies and adapted them to meet its own needs.
           Agribusiness incubators developing or adapting technologies should verify their
           marketability to ensure revenues.
       2.) A business’ most important attribute is execution.
           A successful agribusiness must create relationships with the best producers in markets
           corresponding to each phase of the value chain. Fundación Jalisco formed productive
           collaborations with Fundación Chile for technical assistance and business model
           design, and VitalBerry for expertise in nurseries and commercialization.
       3.) Defining the client base is key to success.
           The size of an incubator’s endowment can determine the approach with which it
           pursues clustering. With short-term financing, Fundación Jalisco identifies individual
           farmers and helps them develop into profitable small businesses.

11. FUTURE GOALS
Fundación Jalisco needs to attract short-term investment in the form of a 5–10 year
endowment for its long-term agricultural projects. This will allow time for trees and other
crops to mature and be market ready. The foundation has solicited additional funds from
investors in the nursery project for its general operations.
