PPD Sustainability

This Practical Note looks at the sustainability of Public-Private Dialogue
(PPD) initiatives. PPDs are often supported by a development sponsor, such
as the government, the private sector or a development partner (DP), which
initially helps to establish or run activities but eventually ends its assistance at
some point in time. This Note guides practitioners in the development of a
PPD transition strategy—the process through which DPs move away from
direct support to a PPD and toward a way that allows the partnership to func-
tion sustainably.
••   If a PPD is government-driven, then the issues are concentrated around
     institutional alignment, political will and securing resources from the
     national budget.
••   When a PPD is private-sector driven, then sustainability is closely linked
     to the sustainability of the business membership organizations (BMOs)
     themselves. In this instance, support work needs to take place at the BMO
     level.
••   When a PPD is established with other types of sponsorship (e.g., devel-
     opment partners, foundations), at some point it will need to transition
     into a fully locally-owned and self-sustainable platform.
This Practical Note helps practitioners devise ways in which PPDs can
achieve long-term operational, financial and mandate sustainability.

Introduction
This Public-Private Dialogue (PPD) Practical Note aims to guide practition-
ers on ways to ensure the sustainability of PPD initiatives and manage their
transition when funding and technical assistance from an external party is
discontinued, and stakeholders devise on the initiative’s future. “External
party funding” may mean the financial (subsidies, grants) and technical sup-
port a PPD receives from development partners (DPs), public institutions,
foundations, a consortium of private companies or a multinational corpora-
tion. They are referred to in this text as “sponsors”.
   Whereas there are many PPD initiatives that are driven and initiated by
local organizations or public agencies (“locally-driven” PPDs), this Note spe-
cifically looks at sustainability issues and experiences from externally funded
and supported PPDs, as locally-driven initiatives have a different set of sus-
tainability concerns. For example, if a PPD is government-driven, then the
issues are concentrated around institutional alignment, political will and
securing resources from the national budget. When a PPD is private-sector
driven, then sustainability is closely linked to the sustainability of the business
membership organizations (BMOs) themselves. In this instance, support
work needs to take place at the BMO level. The subject of this Note is about
externally-funded and supported PPD initiatives, those that receive direct

sponsor support and management assistance, but will eventually transition
into a fully, locally-owned, and self-sustainable initiative.
   This Note also focuses specifically on PPD initiatives that are more struc-
tured and aimed at being institutionalized. We acknowledge that PPDs have
several shapes and objectives. They can be formal, informal, or time-bound,
be supported by a Secretariat unit or not. In the time-bound or informal ini-
tiatives, sustainability issues are often not part of the equation. Time-bound
PPDs are set up to solve a specific set of issues and once addressed, the PPDs
are disbanded. A series of informal consultations are not intended to be sus-
tainable either. Often, consultations are initiated by a government agency, a
private sector organization or a development partner with the intention of
obtaining feedback from a group of constituents on a specific topic and, once
done, the process is wound-up. If the consultations are to be sustained, how-
ever, then what follows is relevant, as the problems will be very similar: how
to finance the sessions or studies, who steers the initiative, how to garner sup-
port, and who will operate it over the long run.
   This Note seeks to guide practitioners in the development of a PPD transition
strategy—the process through which a PPD moves away from direct sponsor
support and toward a way that allows the partnership to function sustainably.


1.1  The Four Phases of the PPD Life Cycle
PPDs can be viewed in terms of a “life cycle” that consists of four phases:
(a)  Discovery and Set-Up, (b) High-Impact or Maturity, (c) Transfer, and
(d)  Transformation (Herzberg and Wright 2006 and The Cluster
Competitiveness Group S. A. 2011).
  The four phases are described as well as illustrated in Figure 1.1:
1.	 Discovery and set-up phase. The time span for this initial phase may
    stretch from a few months to several years. It focuses on establishing
    trust relationships between public and private sector actors, learning to
    interact in a collaborative manner and overcoming the first challenges
    that occur in this early stage. Stakeholders learn what works and what
    does not (e.g., reform proposals submitted and processed through the
    partnership), and how to best achieve results.
2.	 High-impact or maturity phase. This phase often lasts anywhere from
    one to three years. It is characterized by continuous learning and the
    successful implementation of agreed-upon actions. It is generally more
    productive than the first phase and achieves important results. Partners
    are motivated by early results and more experienced at designing reform
    or action proposals that are successfully processed, accepted and imple-
    mented. Adjustments are also made to the process to ensure greater effi-
    ciency or better focus on areas of most interest and available energy.
3.	 Transfer phase. PPD initiatives often come to life to fill an institutional
    gap between the public and private sectors. If confidence and dialogue
    are established or restored, and private sector concerns are now taken
    into account by government officials, what future lies ahead for the

                  consultative mechanism? Should the dialogue be maintained in the form
                  in which it came to life? Or, should a PPD’s energy and capacity built
                  during Phases 1 and 2 be transferred to where they originally belonged—
                  with government institutions and advocacy groups? This phase is often
                  referred to as the “transfer” of sponsor management and/or funding of a
                  PPD to local institutions.
              4.	 Transformation phase. The 2011 study Public-Private Dialogue for Sector
                  Competitiveness and Local Economic Development: Lessons from the
                  Mediterranean Region1 discusses this transformation phase as the time
                  in which dialogue reaches a “frontier.” This means a dialogue can evolve
                  positively into a “reinvention” phase, where strategic thinking about the
                  future of a PPD occurs, based on new market needs and business oppor-
                  tunities. Or, a PPD can take a negative turn into an “exploitation” phase,
                  where stakeholder contribution is unbalanced and can become an objec-
                  tive in and of itself, becoming self-perpetuating through the exploitation
                  of its bargaining power to capture the resources (subsidies) from the pub-
                  lic sector. In a milder scenario, a PPD can hit a “tipping point,” where it
                  continues to exist by performing the functions it was initially set up to
                  carry out, but without answering to new needs of the market.



              1.2  Definition of PPD Sustainability
              and “Transfer”
              “Transfer phase” refers to the transfer of operations, management or financing
              of a PPD by sponsors to local institutions. A 2009 study for the International
              Finance Corporation (IFC) (Herzberg and Toland 2009) indicates that local
              ownership or self-sustainability is one of the most sensitive issues facing

              Public-Private Dialogue (PPD) Practical Notes Series	                              3
PPDs today. They suggest self-sustainability deserves serious scrutiny since dia-
logue needs to be sustained, whether as an institution, a culture or a practice.
  The term “transfer phase” is often a source of anxiety among stakeholders
because it does not convey well that sponsors will accompany stakeholders
during this phase. Depending on the context, sponsors may use alternative
expressions, such as “transition” or “sustainability plan”. The transfer process
should be gradual with regard to process and financial contributions. A clear
timeline is crucial to avoid confusing the local stakeholders. Sticking to the
                                                                        ­ takeholders’
deadlines will increase the credibility of the process as well as local s
confidence in taking over ownership. “Sustainability” means that the needs of
the present are met without compromising the needs of the future.
  The sustainability of a PPD is built upon three pillars: (a) Operational
Sustainability, (b) Financial Sustainability, and (c) Sustained Mandate.
1.	 Operational sustainability: Secretariat unit relies on its internal capac-
    ities and/or services it purchases at market cost to manage the dialogue.
2.	 Financial sustainability: PPD generates sufficient financial resources
    from services it offers to cover its cost of operations.
3.	 Sustained mandate and effectiveness in delivering this mandate: i.e.,
    a PPD continues to provide a channel for meaningful dialogue between
    the private sector and the government and is an “engine” for reforms/
    activities to solve the issues identified by the partnership.



1.3  “As You Enter, Think about Transfer”
Before getting into the details of initiating a PPD transition, it is important for
sponsors to remember the principle “As you enter, think about transfer.”2
This means that a transfer strategy must be elaborated upfront in the design
stage of any PPD support project. Careful planning of a transfer strategy
needs to be carried out when designing the PPD intervention and be consis-
tent with its mandate. However, it should be noted that early transfer plan-
ning may be difficult to elaborate in a PPD launch stage, as practitioners may
be overwhelmed by the short-term challenges of setting up a PPD, such as
recruiting, getting early results, etc. Despite this, the concept document
should strive to provide for a broad transfer time frame that is communicated
to all stakeholders.
   During the design and set-up phase, three particular aspects require careful
consideration:
•	 Location—Where Should the Secretariat Unit of the PPD Be Located?
The recommended solution is to house the Secretariat unit in an existing
organization or institution, even if these have shortcomings or the infrastruc-
ture is not up to expected standards. A benefit of this approach is that capacity
building efforts will have a better chance at remaining “embedded” in the
institution since its initial weaknesses will improve over time with the support
and capacity building activities provided by sponsors. In the case of hosting
in a private sector organization or civil society organization (CSO), the local

4	                             Public-Private Dialogue (PPD) Practical Notes Series
organization will also appear to offer added services to its constituents, thus
presenting an added value that can be built-on to generate institutional bud-
get or future service fees.
   Of course, there are also plenty of reasons not to invest in an existing pri-
vate sector or CSO structure. For example: (a) an umbrella private sector
organization representing all the private sector associations does not exist, or
it is not recognized by its peers as legitimate, (b) a Chamber of Commerce
may exist but it might be organized as an autonomous public institution, thus
it is perceived as too aligned with government interests, (c) a competing and
more representative organization, like the employers’ association, may chal-
lenge the Chamber of Commerce, (d) a ministerial department might have
incentives that are misaligned with the project objectives of a PPD.
   Any potential host may also lack capacity if they do not have the staff and
resources necessary to properly carry out the roles and responsibilities of the
PPD Secretariat unit. Often, sponsors are tempted to host the Secretariat unit
of the PPD in their own office in order to quick-start the project by using
logistical support already in place. However, our recommendation is to avoid
this easy solution. Once the donor program closes, the PPD Secretariat unit
will no longer have a home and it will be at a higher risk of collapse. In terms
of perceptions, when housed in a sponsor’s office, the PPD initiative is seen
as  dependent on or driven by external parties, with little ownership by
stakeholders.
•	   Staffing—PPD Secretariat Unit and Consultant
As with location, we recommend working with the staff of existing institu-
tions to provide both capacity building and to establish operating procedures
in the newly established PPD Secretariat unit. In some instances, local private
sector organizations do not have sufficient staff to operate the PPD Secretariat
unit, as it has a limited hiring capacity due to low membership revenues.
Arrangements may be possible, however, with existing staff allocating 30–50
percent of their time to the Secretariat unit, or sponsors may choose to pro-
vide a one-off start-up grant to partially cover the cost of a salary. In the first
scenario, support might include training in how to manage the PPD. In the
latter case, both parties should agree on a cost-sharing mechanism with a
gradual increase of the contribution by local institutions—the same can be
done on the government side.
   In the case of Cambodia, the IFC who was sponsoring the PPD agreed to
provide a one-year salary for the first employee (a research assistant) of the
Cambodia Federation of Employers and Business Associations (CAMFEBA)
with clear planning on how and when the association would start covering
the salary. By the second year, CAMFEBA retained the employee who stayed
on for more than five years as Executive Director, managing more than
20 staff members.
   To get things started, especially in difficult environments, sponsors often
prefer to directly manage the initiative by coordinating efforts to bring stake-
holders to the table and running the PPD. Skilled consultants are hired to
manage the PPD initiative and play the role of Coordinator with the objective

Public-Private Dialogue (PPD) Practical Notes Series	                            5
of showing results in a short time frame. In such
cases, sustainability can become precarious. The PPD        In Cambodia, the IFC agreed
runs the risk of having no staff to manage the             to provide a one-year salary for
Secretariat unit once the external funding dries up.
To ensure continuity of the PPD Secretariat unit, we        the first employee (a research
suggest the following:                                        assistant) of the Cambodia
1.	 Reporting Line: according to their contract,               Federation of Employers
    consultants’ reporting line lies with the program         and Business Associations
    manager in the sponsor’s organization. This may,            (CAMFEBA) with clear
    however, undermine a sense of ownership of the
    PPD or a smooth management of it. If the PPD
                                                           planning on how and when the
    has a Steering Committee, it is recommended            association would start covering
    that the recruitment of consultants involve the             the salary. By the second
    members and new staff report directly to the
                                                               year, CAMFEBA retained
    Steering Committee.
2.	 Consultants’ Office: to encourage ownership              the employee who stayed on
    and  transfer of knowledge, PPD consultants              for over 5 years as Executive
    should work from the PPD Secretariat unit hosted        Director, managing more than
    in a local institution, rather than from a sponsor’s
    office. They should present themselves either as
                                                                         20 staff.
    independent consultants or as Coordinators
    of the PPD initiative. Often, consultants work-
    ing from a sponsor’s office, in particular a development partner, present
    themselves as staff of the said organization, as this may appear more pres-
    tigious. This tends to reinforce the perception that the  project is exter-
    nally-driven and may create confusion among stakeholders as to whether
    the consultant is working for the PPD or for the sponsor.
•	   Sustainability Plan—Transfer Should Begin at Entry
“Transfer” should begin at entry. This includes a solid understanding by
stakeholders of the financial and technical commitments made by the
Sponsors in terms of time and amount. No PPD should start without a plan
for moving gradually to co-financing—with 100% financing by stakeholders
being the ultimate goal.
   The sustainability plan covers three areas:
1.	 Operational sustainability: Who will operate the Secretariat unit? What
    kind of capacity building needs to be provided and by when? This includes
    a plan for a long term capacity-building program for local staff on how to
    manage the PPD.
2.	 Financial sustainability: By when will the local stakeholders start financ-
    ing the Secretariat unit? How, and what types of revenue-generating
    activities can be organized?
3.	 Sustained mandate and effectiveness in delivering this mandate: What
    support/capacity building is needed for local stakeholders to be able to
    advocate efficiently for their constituents?


6	                           Public-Private Dialogue (PPD) Practical Notes Series
The sustainability plan should have a clear timeline and be communicated
upfront to the stakeholders so that they are aware of whether the PPD is time-
bound (will be closed at a specific date), or it will be sustained after sponsor
support ends. Stakeholders have a clear choice to make: (a) agree with the
cost-sharing plan and ensure a viable PPD, or (b) end the PPD partnership
once the sponsor’s intervention is completed. During the transition period,
the sponsor should remain an “honest facilitator”, supporting capacity build-
ing for both the public and private sectors (including advocacy and organiza-
tional skills).



1.4  Sustainability: “In Their Own Words”
PPD initiatives range in type and structure as well as in maturity. A good
number of PPDs face sustainability issues when their sponsor support is
expected to end in the near-term. Others have a longer preparation time
before the transfer. What follows are a few examples of what PPD staff
members have written and presented on with regard to sustainability
­
planning and implementation challenges. These examples illustrate  how
­
challenges faced by practitioners can be clustered around three issues:
(a) advocacy effectiveness, (b) operational sustainability, and (c) financial
sustainability.

Ethiopia—A Needed Road-Map for Sustainability3
The Ethiopian Public Private Consultative Forum (EPPCF) was established in
2010 by a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Ministry of
Trade and Industry and the Ethiopian Chamber of Commerce and Sectoral
Associations (ECCSA). The creation of the EPPCF represented a major mile-
stone in the rebuilding of government and private sector relations that had
been strained for some time. EPPCF features a yearly high level National
Business Forum that is chaired by the Prime Minister.
   Institutionally, ECCSA and the Ministry of Trade continue to be the
Champions of the EPPCF. However, ECCSA now considers the EPPCF initia-
tive to be the pillar of its membership advocacy services and sees it as the
champion of its ongoing operations.
   EPPCF is scheduled to begin its transition to a sustainable and locally
owned initiative when IFC support concludes at the end of 2016. A clear
roadmap for the sustainability of EPPCF has been devised through o  ­ ngoing
discussions with stakeholders to focus on how the EPPCF Secretariat
unit’s  work should continue after the transition. Although up to this
point DP support has been necessary, the long-term goal of the EPPCF
transfer strategy is to ensure that EPPCF remains a viable and effective
sustainable advocacy platform for the Ethiopian Private Sector.
Expectations are that EPPCF will be funded largely with domestic resources
in the future.

The Kyrgyz Republic—Mandate for Sustainability4
The Investment Council under the President of the Kyrgyz Republic was
established in 2007 with the support of the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development (EBRD) and the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic as a
dialogue platform to improve the business environment and investment
climate.
   The Investment Council Secretariat unit focuses on the sustainability of its
operations by regularly holding negotiations with representatives of business
associations and international organizations to ensure the financial stability
of the Investment Council and the Secretariat unit. The Secretariat unit’s
operations extend beyond dialogue and pays a great deal of attention to work-
ing with foreign investors and capacity building.
   The Secretariat unit is also concerned with its operational sustainability
as an effective dialogue platform that is knowledgeable and capable
of  doing evidence-based advocacy. Because of this, the IC has signed a
Memorandum of Understanding and Cooperation with the Kyrgyz
Entrepreneurs’ Union, the International Business Council (IBC), the Banking
Union and the IFC Investment Climate Improvement Project. This is to sup-
port the IC’s capabilities in its areas of expertise. For instance, the Kyrgyz
Entrepreneurs’ Union provides support in the area of tourism, the IBC offers
expertise on extractive industry issues, and the Banking Union provides
advice on banking sector issues. Furthermore, for one year, the IFC commis-
sioned an expert to work on issues related to customs, tax administration and
inspections. Support is also provided by members of the Chamber of Tax
Consultants and a private law office. Currently, the USAID Reform Project
provides the services of an expert on PPD.

Tajikistan—Private Sector Options5
In 2007, the national PPD platform was established in Tajikistan with the
support of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).
­
In 2010 the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit
(GIZ)  GmbH provided technical support to establish the Consultative
Councils (CC) on Improvement of the Investment Climate and Business
Environment, under the Governor and its Secretariat unit in Tajikistan’s
Sughd Region (Northern Province). That same year, the IFC provided techni-
cal support for the establishment of a regional CC in Khatlon  Region.
Currently, a mixed arrangement exists of sponsor support of the CC. EBRD
finances this process at a national level while GIZ and IFC act as a channel to
trickle-up proposals coming from the regional CCs. This ­          supports the
Secretariat unit as well as improves coordination and communication between
regional and national CCs.
   To ensure a proper sustainability strategy, GIZ initially discouraged depen-
dency from DP grants right from the start. It proposed, rather, that the CC
Secretariat unit finance itself through its own services. The private sector,
however, assessed that the Secretariat unit would not be sustainable without

financial contribution from DPs. GIZ now finances the Secretariat unit
 private sector representatives) and subsidizes the organization of CC
(­
Sessions (analytical work by experts and the logistics of meetings).
   The CC Exit Strategy is based on the assumption that a business association
will appoint and cover the salary of a Coordinator to represent the private
sector in the CC Secretariat unit. Gradually, the Secretariat unit is to become
a private sector umbrella organization capable of providing fee-based
advocacy services. Such income is expected to cover the running costs of the
Secretariat unit and the payment for needed reinvestment in office equipment
and furniture. The Khukumat (City Council) currently pays for office space
and the basic salary of the public representative in the CC Secretariat unit.

Chapter 2

PPD Sustainability—Issues
to Consider
A number of important issues should be thought through as you devise a PPD
initiative’s transition. Some of these issues are addressed in this section and
include: (a) the change process to be undertaken, (b) lessons learned from
other PPD transitions, (c) transition challenges, and (d) how the Public and
Private Sectors’ contribute to a PPD’s sustainability.



2.1  A Change Process
Managing a PPD transition is about managing a change process. It is a process
where the PPD is being moved from its current state, with high sponsor
dependence, toward a more independent state, owned by local entities.
A  PPD  transition strategy needs to be carefully planned over an extended
period of time. If the transition has been discussed with stakeholders at the
start of the project, the change process will be smooth since it is a matter of
implementing an agreed strategic plan (it may eventually become necessary
to review or adjust the initial roadmap to current circumstances).

10	                            Public-Private Dialogue (PPD) Practical Notes Series
  Transition becomes more hectic, however, when the handover has
not been planned, as it becomes a source of uncertainty for stakeholders,
making it important to adopt techniques related to a change management
process. For example, follow some guiding principles, such as good
planning that includes key tasks, doers and information management
­
so  that stakeholders understand what to expect, how to manage their
own personal change, and how to engage the entire organization in the
process.
  Chapter 4 of this Note outlines in detailed what a Change Management
processes is and how it can be applied to a PPD.



2.2  Lessons from PPD Transition Initiatives
Even though there is a limited body of experience and no singular optimal
transition strategy to date, there are numerous good lessons and practices
that have emerged from recent and ongoing PPD transition processes. Some
useful lessons learned from PPD practitioners are below.
   Have a track record. Experience shows that a PPD’s track record of success
can greatly increase stakeholders’ willingness to own and manage the PPD
over time. Give adequate time. Adequate time is needed to move from dis-
cussion about transition to its implementation. In Cambodia, for example,
the transition stakeholder consultation period lasted 6 months, with 6 more
months required to finalize the strategy that led to its implementation. This
was followed by another year of coaching and training. In Vietnam and
Cameroon, the private sector took one year to sign an MOU that established
a consortium of associations to support the PPD.
   Build capacity. Continued capacity building for business associations
and other stakeholders over the various phases, including the transfer
period, remains central. Obviously, it takes time to build the capacity of
BMOs, ­  government officials and people, so a comprehensive program
should be developed and rolled out throughout the life of the PPD, particu-
larly during phase 1 (Discovery and Set-Up) and phase 2 (High-Impact
or Maturity). When this is delayed until phase 3 (Transfer), there is often
not enough time to coach and provide an in-depth and comprehensive
training plan.
   In the case of BMOs, capacity building should addresses two crucial
aspects: (a) the organization and sustainability of the BMO, including
­
membership recruitment, development of services, staff management,
governance, measurement and evaluation, and running a professional
­
Secretariat unit, and (b) the capacity to advocate efficiently and to commu-
nicate well.
   Listen to the private sector. The private sector needs to agree and
­
cooperate  among itself so as to define, prioritize and scope out the reform
issues. Working on solutions to acquire the necessary advocacy and analytical
capacity must remain a priority in the process.

2.3  Transition Challenges
When designing a PPD, Herzberg and Wright’s 2006 PPD Handbook advises
following the Charter of Good Practices’ Principles as a useful framework to
help design, operationalize, and ensure the sustainability of a PPD (Box 2.1).2
Furthermore, at the 2015 Global PPD Workshop, a 13th Principle on
Sustainability was incorporated into a revised Charter that stipulates
“Achieving sustainability is a challenge for a PPD and requires the commitment
of all PPD actors.” Although a mature PPD will have addressed many of the
Charter’s principles by the time of sponsor transfer, design teams should refer
back to the Charter when elaborating options for the sustainability plan. This
is important because a transfer strategy may change the environment and
­
stability of the PPD (Box 2.2).




  Box 2.1  Questions to Consider—Sustainability and the Principles
  of Good Practice
   1.	 What is the mandate of the body/PPD mechanism, and its anchorage in and relationship to
       existing institutions?
   2.	 How is participation organized and under what structure?
   3.	 Who are the individual Champions that help the body/PPD mechanism push for reforms?
   4.	 How is the body/PPD mechanism coordinated (e.g., by a Secretariat unit), who is/are the
       facilitator(s) and is facilitation well organized?
   5.	 What type of outputs does the body/PPD mechanism produce, which have they produced
       over time, and is there a reform tracking mechanism that enables monitoring of progress on
       these issues?
   6.	 What has been the communication and outreach strategy of the body/PPD mechanism?
   7.	 Does the body/PPD mechanism use a monitoring and evaluation framework and, if so,
       which one, and how successful is it at achieving its intended purpose?
   8.	 Does the body/PPD mechanism support dialogue processes at the sub-national level?
   9.	 What specific arrangements for sector-specific dialogue exist through this body/PPD
       mechanism and in which particular sector? How does it interact with other sector develop-
       ­
       ment programs such as cluster work, value chain work, and what have been the sector-level
       results so far?
  10.	 What is the relationship of the body/PPD mechanism to issues pertaining to foreign invest-
       ment; do foreign investors use the body/PPD mechanism as an aftercare mechanism for
       FDI-related policy issues and does the body/PPD mechanism play a role in either represen-
       tation or advocacy at the international level?
  11.	 Has the body/PPD mechanism been designed to address the specificity of post-conflict and
       crisis environments, and did it have peace-building implications in helping to re-bridge the
       trust and confidence gap?
  12.	 Have DPs interacted with the body/PPD mechanism, and if so, what degree of independence
       has the body/PPD mechanism had in term of agenda setting? If the body/PPD mechanism has
       been donor-supported, how prone is it to become sustainable when exit donor support ends?

Box 2.2  Charter of Good Practice Principles: New Article No.13
on Sustainability
The sustainability of a PPD is built on three pillars:
•	 Operational sustainability: i.e., the Secretariat unit relies on its internal capacities and/or
   ­
   services it purchases at market costs to manage the dialogue;
•	 Financial sustainability, i.e., the PPD generates sufficient cash from services it offers to cover
   its cost of operations;
•	 Sustained mandate and effectiveness in delivering this mandate, i.e., the PPD continues to
   ­provide a channel for meaningful dialogue between the private sector and the government and
    is an engine for reforms/activities to solve the issues identified by the partnership.




                   In theory, as previously mentioned, the sustainability of the PPD is built
                during phase 1 and phase 2 of the PPD life cycle. When the PPD is anchored
                in the right institution, there is an inclusive and balanced range of partici-
                pants, champions are leading the reforms, there is a well-functioning and
                efficient Secretariat unit and the reforms are enacted and impactful, etc.
                   In reality, as a PPD is still a work-in-progress when sponsors are
                ­
                transitioning out, some of these challenges may become more apparent. For
                example, the lack of champions will imply a continuing challenge or a full
                disengagement. Some arrangements already agreed on may be called into
                question. A PPD, for instance, may be chaired by the Prime Minister and
                hosted at the Prime Minister’s office, but after transition the government may
                decide that the PPD will be chaired by a line minister.
                   A good transition strategy will develop activities to address these challenges
                during phases 1 and 2. When the transition strategy is elaborated only during
                phase 3, time is often lacking to implement the support activities that include,
                identifying new champions, developing a new mandate and providing capac-
                ity building to a weak Secretariat unit.

                  Challenges that may impede a successful transition can be categorized
                in terms of operations, effectiveness and transition.
                •	   PPD Operations
                   Common operational challenges include the maintenance of participation
                and commitment from stakeholders, such as: (a) balancing different interests
                and achieving consensus within the private sector and several government
                agencies, (b) strengthening trust and respect in the PPD process from all
                stakeholders and parties, (c) building sustainability when sponsor support
                ends, and (d) generating long-term financial support, which is likely the
                ­
                biggest challenge faced during a PPD transitioning from sponsor-driven to a
                locally-sustained initiative.

•	    PPD Effectiveness
   As with operations, issues of capacity affect a PPD’s effectiveness during
the  transition phase. Issues range from a limited private sector capacity in
developing a reform agenda, advocating to the government, carrying out
research and analysis, and communicating capabilities.
   An additional challenge can be the Government’s capacity and willingness
to engage with and respond to the private sector on the substance of proposals
and implementation of the recommended reforms.
•	    PPD Transition
  When a transition strategy is not built into the PPD project design, the
discussion about transition can be slow before gathering momentum.
  Additionally, the capacity of the new Secretariat team (formed by the
business associations/chambers), combined with the lack of capacity to
­
carry  out important reforms (identification, research, and advocacy) can
vary considerably and undermine the transfer process and its success.
  Maintaining the credibility and effectiveness of the dialogue process under
the transition phase requires a lot of effort from the Secretariat team and
champions. Lacking champions to support the process of change could
derail it.
  An example of the risk evaluation faced by the Cambodia Government
Private Sector Forum (G-PSF) is provided in Figure 2.1:




Figure 2.1  Risks Evaluation of the Cambodia G-PSF Sustainability
Strategy


      Risk evaluation




        Sustainability Model relies on Business Membership organizations (BMOs) and
      their capacity to engage in a dialogue.

        Operational sustainability of the G-PSF will partially be achieved–the four WGs
      managed by high capacity BMOs (IBC, GMAC, CAMFEBA, ABC) will operate
      sustainably but the process may collapse in the four other WGs.

         Financial sustainability of the G-PSF is achievable by adopting a cost-effective
      structure for the G-PSF Secretariat (i.e. a single-person entity with purely
      administrative functions hosted by each business association). Financial
      resources will include BMOs’ membership

        The G-PSF’s effectiveness in promoting reforms may be negatively impacted by
      the sustainability strategy through strong BMOs.

                  2.4  Public and Private Sectors’ Contributions
                  to PPD Sustainability
                  At entry, PPD design must be country specific and take into account the capac-
                  ity and willingness of the public and private sector to participate (both at
                  national or sub-national levels). The presence of political will is paramount to
                  starting a dialogue process. The funding mechanism for a PPD must be flexible
                  and should include cost-sharing by both public and private actors. Sustainability
                  of the PPD initiative should be a critical part of a broader PPD strategy with
                  genuine and broad-based DP coordination that represents both the public and
                  private sectors’ capacity and interest. This mean taking into account the unique
                  attributes of both sectors as illustrated in Figure 2.2: The private sector’s most

important contribution to PPD is its ability to scope, analyze, prioritize and
present issues to government, and so it needs to have solid technical, analytical
and communications skills. On the other hand, the public sector’s most
important contribution to PPD is its capacity and willingness to respond to its
private sector counterparts, which is in addition to its analytic and policy
expertise.

Getting Started—Critical
Reflections
Once a clear mandate for transition has been gained, a strategic plan needs to
be elaborated based on data and evidence gathered from stakeholders with
regard to the strengths and weaknesses of the PPD. By identifying constraints
and opportunities, it is possible to elaborate key recommendations and pro-
pose a few initial transition strategies. The next step should be to expand con-
sultations to all stakeholders and collect their feed-back on the initial
transition strategy proposed (consensus around one of the proposals should
be built by this stage). Finally, a more detailed work-plan, including budget-
ing, should be produced and all commitments formalized. This lays the foun-
dation to a smooth transfer of ownership.
   Before a transition strategy is put in place, however, it is important to reflect
on certain critical building blocks to ensure its success. These considerations
form the basic cornerstone of a successful transition strategy that allows for
full local ownership.
1.	 Consensus building: wide consultations inclusive of all stakeholders
    should be carried out and centered on the proposed approach. The level
    of consensus built will likely be the primary determinant of success.

Public-Private Dialogue (PPD) Practical Notes Series	                            17
2.	 Practicality: stakeholder mapping and analytical work is critical and
    should be carried out to identify the institution that has the best technical
    and financial resources to sustain the PPD once DP support is ended.
3.	 Staff dedication: dedicated staff should be assigned to the PPD to orga-
    nize meetings, publicity, and events in order to provide support essential
    to a good transition plan and the coordinating institution.
4.	 Clear timeline: a clear timeline of events with specific deadlines should
    be put in place and communicated to all stakeholders.



3.1  The Change Process
  What follows is an in-depth description of a formal change management
process. Change management processes and principles are highly applicable
to a PPD’s transition planning and processes.
  Business Edge™1 is a world-class training system that provides practical
solutions for Small & Medium Enterprises (SMEs). It is developed by the
IFC to improve ­management capacity and business performance by ­providing
a framework  for change management (Figures 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3). Part I of
     diagram, “Planning,” helps managers initiate the necessary changes
the  ­
within  the organization. Part II, “Implementation,” helps managers imple-
ment the changes.
  Components of the Change Management Process and its applicability to
a PPD Transition:
•	     Create need by creating ownership. Ownership of the PPD sustainabil-
       ity strategy is often best created by involving the sponsors/DPs, Secretariat

                    identifying problems and crafting solutions. They should feel the urgency
                    of change—“change or die!” It is also critical to address the “human side”
                    systematically. When implementing change as illustrated in the preceding
                    figures—people, staff, colleagues, stakeholders, are much more difficult to
                    manage than a process involving inanimate components, such as technol-
                    ogy, or money. But, by understanding this nature, managers can predict
                    reactions and find suitable strategies to soothe anxieties and foster the
                    acceptance and implementation of change. Engaging stakeholders, send-
                    ing clear messages and planning strategically are key aspects of a success-
                    ful PPD.

•	 Communicate benefits. Together with creating the need for change,
   Secretariat units should also strive to show how the benefits of change
   relate to every stakeholder. The best change programs reinforce core mes-
   sages through regular, timely advice that is both inspirational, and practi-
   cable. Communications should flow from the bottom and out from the
   top, and are targeted to provide stakeholders with the right information
   at the right time, and to solicit input and feedback. Often this will require
   over-communication through multiple, redundant channels. PPD
   Working Group meetings that convene regularly provide good avenues
   for this.
•	 Start. After considering all factors, a Secretariat unit should start
   ­
   implementing change. Even if small, a starting point is needed, other-
   wise the change will never happen. Start at the top with the PPD
   Working Group Co-chairs, Chairs, heads of associations, and govern-
   ment representatives.
•	 Lead. The PPD initiative leadership must embrace the new approaches
   as both change leaders and as change managers. They must speak with
   one voice, and they must model desired behaviors by breaking with the
   status quo to allow for a transition period, and to implement the
   changes. They perform a dual role, as change leaders who are aware of
   what must be changed, and as change managers who implement
   change. The leader observes and stays informed of external circum-
   stances and internal organizational issues while the manager imple-
   ments tasks related to the people and limits failure by: (a) gaining
   commitment from the staff, (b) overcoming resistance through motiva-
   tion and persuasion and (c) helping participants adapt to change.
•	 Reinforce. PPD Secretariat units should have policies and plans in place
   to reinforce new factors in the transition step that enables people to grad-
   ually implement the changes.
•	 Monitor and Evaluate. Keep track of where you are in your plan by
   monitoring the change process. Keep in mind that no change program
   will go fully according to plan—people react in unexpected ways, areas
   of anticipated resistance fall away, and the external environment shifts.
   Effective change management requires continual reassessment of its
   impact and the willingness and ability to adopt the next wave of
   transformation.
•	 Speak to the individual. Change is both an institutional journey and a
   very personal one. Staff and participants to the PPD spend many hours
   each week on the initiative. Staff members need to know how their work
   will change, what is expected of them during and after the transition, how
   they will be measured, and what success or failure will mean for them and
   those around them. DPs and the governing board of the PPD should be
   as honest and explicit as possible.

Developing a Sustainability
Plan
A sustainability plan is generally comprised of the following sections:
Section 1: Background of a PPD initiative
Section 2: Assessment of stakeholders’ capacity
Section 3: Operational sustainability, financial sustainability and mandate
Section 4: Options for a PPD’s sustainability
Section 5: Communication strategy
Section 6: Monitoring and post-evaluation
Section 7: Post-transition support plan
Section 8: Detailed work plan and timeline
   Keep in mind that these elements will vary in scope and timing. This
depends on whether you are designing the Sustainability Plan during the
start-up phase of a PPD, or during the transfer phase when sponsor support
is ending. Box 4.1 provides some questions to consider when devising PPD
ownership before and after transition. Figure 4.1 provides a Step-by-Step Path
to Sustainability with recommendations for each step.

     STEP 1. Assessment—collect data from stakeholders on
     PPD strengths and weaknesses
     • Stakeholders
     • International PPD experts
     • Past evaluations




         STEP 2: Developing options—evaluate and analyze the data
         •   Detect key issues
         •   Identify constraints and opportunities
         •   Prepare early recommendations
         •   Propose a limited number of initial transition strategy options




                    STEP 3. Communication—prepare and review PPD
                    transition strategy with all stakehoders
                    •   Begin with informal reviews with key stakeholders
                    •   Collect formal feedback through public consultation
                    •   Reﬁne and select a maximum of two proposals
                    •   Build consensus around one of the proposals
                    •   Present plans

4.1  STEP 1—Assessment
Analyzing the Reform Process Pre-Conditions
There are three main areas where focus is needed in order to address issues
that might stall the reform process:
•	    Capacity to move the reform to the next step. This capacity could be
      technical or financial in nature and is meant to transform the role of
      sponsors from implementer to enabler. It includes such things as, DP/
      BMO/government capacity building, a rotating Secretariat unit function,
      among others. Financial capacity deals with resource mobilization plans,
      contributions by sponsors as clients of the PPD, or contribution to a
      research fund with clear and transparent access guidelines.

     Box 4.1  Questions to Consider—Who Owns the PPD Initiative?
     	 1.	Which stakeholders should be consulted about the transition? What is the best way to
           engage them?
     	 2.	Which local ownership option should be pursued? Which entity(ies) will own and run the
           PPD? Can different PPD functions be allocated to different organizations (e.g., the facilita-
           tion function vs. the running of the Working Groups)?
     	 3.	Can stakeholders, in particular the private sector, be more closely engaged in the activities of
           the PPD in the near-term, before a formal agreement is made about its transition?
     	 4.	Where will the new PPD be hosted (Secretariat unit)? Can it be placed with the government?
     	 5.	Will staff of the Secretariat unit originate from a single organization or several?
     	 6.	Where will financial support come from? Can the private sector unite to financially support
           the PPD? Should other development partners support the PPD, for example, as an interim
           arrangement? What kind of things can DPs support, and can this include a research fund
           that PPD Working Groups could access?
     	 7.	What kind of post-closure support can the sponsor provide?
     	 8.	What should capacity building and training focus on? How should this training be delivered?
           Over what time period, and when should it begin?
     	 9.	Can the emphasis on the PPD transition be an opportunity to add new dimensions to the
           PPD’s work (e.g., sector-specific and sub-national reform proposals)?
     	 10.	To what degree should the next PPD Coordinator focus on transition issues as part of the
           Terms of Reference?


•	    Private sector confidence to move reforms to the next step. If the
      private  sector is lacking in confidence, sponsors may want to consider
      ­
      extending their “umbrella” beyond the transfer phase, sponsoring the
      main plenary event, vetting research and position papers, and raising the
      PPD profile with the government.
•	    Private sector and government opportunity. The private sector
      has  “closer and more meaningful” access to the government through
      adequate structures and organizations.
      ­
   These three conditions must be met before the transition happens.
If stakeholders do not have the capacity or the will to move the reforms for-
ward, the PPD has a higher chance of collapse after sponsor transfer, as the
role of honest broker and the provision of technical assistance will no longer
be available.

Analyzing the Political Economy Context
It is of utmost importance to understand the political economy (PE) of the
PPD. Because the risk of collusion between high-ranking officials and large
businesses is very high, a sponsor’s past efforts to ensure inclusion and reforms
to benefit the larger section of society are at risk. We recommend undertaking
an analysis of who will win and who will lose as a consequence of the change
process, and to pursue measures that can mitigate the risks.

  In Cambodia, the greatest risk to the sustainability plan of the Cambodia
Government Private Sector Forum (G-PSF) was the Chamber of Commerce’s
ability to be a neutral Secretariat unit for the PPD initiative.
  Although in theory, a G-PSF Secretariat unit coordinating all eight
Private Sector Working Groups (PSWGs) could have been provided by the
Cambodia Chamber of Commerce (CCC), assessments made by develop-
ment agencies (e.g., AusAID 2006, USAID 2008) indicated that the CCC
lacked authority, representativeness, resources and capacity to perform this
coordinating role.
  Two other factors were also of concern: (a) lack of independence of the
CCC due to all chambers of commerce nationwide being supervised (by law)
by the Ministry of Commerce, and (b) the fact that the CCC does not rep-
resent all businesses, but rather a more limited group of CCC board members
(about 50 companies) and that tend to be larger businesses.
  In consideration of these facts, the transition plan provisioned that each of
the eight Working Groups under the G-PSF would have their own Secretariat
unit, with an overall Secretariat unit housed in the Chamber of Commerce to
coordinate the work of the various Secretariat units. De facto, the umbrella
Secretariat unit was the face of the private sector, serving as its coordinator for
the PPD initiative.
  In the absence of a strong coordination center (lack of capacity of the CCC),
Working Groups could continue to function in an insular manner, with dia-
logue happening at the ministerial level prior to the national forums. The risk
was that cross-sectoral issues lacked the unified support of multiple working
groups, causing a potential lack of representation of the private sector or a
duplication of efforts.


Analyzing the Capacity of Private Sector Organizations
A thorough and impartial assessment of the capacity of each private sector
organization or public agency should be conducted to ensure that the PPD
Secretariat unit is transferred to the organization presenting the highest
capacity to carry on the work of the Secretariat unit. This may have been
conducted during the PPD’s start-up phase, but will need to be reviewed
again at the transfer phase.
   The handbook Building the Capacity of Business Membership Organizations,
Guiding Principles for Project Managers (Mikhnev 2006), as well as Business
Associations for the 21st Century (Milner et al. 2001), provide excellent frame-
works on how to assess the capacity of BMOs. Works from SEQUA (www​
.sequa.de) in building BMOs are also good references. A survey questionnaire
developed by SEQUA is also a useful framework and can be downloaded
from this link: http://www.sequa.de/uploads/files/BMO_PerformanceSurvey​
_bfz.pdf.
   Although most operational issues can be solved effectively by business
associations, issues raised by the private sector within the PPD tend to be
more complex and require research and data to support their advocacy efforts.
Many associations, however, do not have the capacity to provide research and

Public-Private Dialogue (PPD) Practical Notes Series	                           25
report writing expertise, both of which are now necessary when working with
government counterparts.
  There are also concerns that reforms proposed will not be representative
of the whole industry—some associations may have too few members,
whereas those that are too strong may only raise issues specific to their
membership. Thus, issues presented may not be representative of the private
sector at large.

Government Capacity
As mentioned at the beginning of this PPD Note, the sustainability plan
concerns itself more with the coordination of the private sector than the
­
government. (The government has its own internal coordination system
­
and can ensure both the operational and financial sustainability of its
coordination.) However, a main area of concern is for government’s capac-
­
ity and its ability to maintain an efficient dialogue (technical capacity to
undertake reform), and its will to  see reforms through. The assessment
involves understanding who will ­   continue to champion the dialogue, con-
firming the focal points for the private sector and ensuring that the rules of
engagement stay the same.
   PPDs may face difficulties integrating into the political process. If this has
not been dealt with at the design stage, the PPD institutional alignment will
need to be carefully considered during the transfer phase. For example,
although the Bangladesh Better Business Forum is an advanced PPD, its sus-
tainability is very dependent on the political will of the ruling party. In this
scenario, careful strategic maneuvering is called for since the Forum should
refrain from being perceived as aligned with any given ruling power. This is to
ensure independence and continuity beyond election periods.
   Other examples to consider are the Tajikistan Presidential Investor Council
and the Sierra Leone Business Forum. In Tajikistan, for instance, the Investor
Council has seen a gradual increase in recognition from state bodies and a
gradual increase in political willingness to trust the PPD to engage in reform,
however, the PPD Secretariat unit has been struggling to garner commitment
from all stakeholders in order to implement its decisions. Similarly, In Sierra
Leone, the Sierra Leone Business Forum has been hampered by poor commu-
nication and misaligned stakeholder expectations, despite the government’s
genuine willingness to engage in economic reform dialogue among public
and private sector stakeholders.



4.2  STEP 2—Developing the Strategy
Evaluate and Analyze the Data, Develop Options for
Sustainability Strategies
Based on the stakeholder assessment, the project team will elaborate a few
options for the sustainability strategy (usually three proposals).


26	                           Public-Private Dialogue (PPD) Practical Notes Series
  Ultimately, it is the local political and economic environments (and dynamic
between local stakeholders) that will dictate the best transformation strategy.
Generally, transformation options for the PPD included the following:
  Strategy 1: Integrating the PPD into existing institutions
  Strategy 2: Setting up the PPD as a new and independent institution run by
  a consortium of associations
  Strategy 3: Decentralizing the PPD functions, with the Working Groups
  taking on lives of their own
  Strategy 4: Internalizing the stakeholder dialogue concept, but the PPD
  ends in itself
  Strategy 5: Ending the partnership initiative without follow-up.

Strategy 1—Integrating the PPD into Existing Institutions
The PPD is housed within an existing institution, such as a government
body (e.g., Investment Board, Ministry of Planning) or business membership
organization (e.g., Chamber of Commerce or business association), which
also becomes the new home of the PPD Secretariat unit.
   Integrating the PPD Secretariat unit into an institution already active
in the dialogue may have several advantages. It (a) builds upon experience
and  expertise of the PPD actors, (b) diminishes uncertainties around the
transition and helps to obtain stakeholder consensus (the institution has
a  convincing track-record), (c) prioritizes reforms over a resource-intense
institutionalization process (building a new institution is a cumbersome pro-
cess, drawing enormous amounts of time, resources and political capital).
   This may mean that the organization’s mandate, charter, by-laws, and pos-
sibly other documents may need to be altered to allow for this PPD function
to be delivered.
   This strategy was adopted by the G-PSF (mix of strategy 1 and 3) and the
Lao Business Forum (LBF)1 and the Philippines Agri-Business PPD.

Strategy 2—Setting Up the PPD as a New and Independent Institution
When none of the current PPD partners are in a position to develop adequate
capabilities, or when no stakeholder consensus can be reached on an existing
institution, the partnership may need to be moved under the umbrella of a
new and independent institution so that it retains its neutral, permanent
business representative and advocate role.
­
   In this case, the PPD could run jointly by several Business Associations
(which contribute staff and financial resources) located in a single office and
where the PPD’s physical “home” may change over time. This joint manage-
ment can be formalized in the setup of a consortium of associations. This is
the case of the Vietnam Business Forum (VBF) that created a consortium
of  14 business associations to support the Secretariat unit of the PPD,2 the
Cameroon Business Forum under the framework of an MOU or the Timor-
Leste Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCI-TL) that initially was formed
with a membership of 17 different Business Associations.


Public-Private Dialogue (PPD) Practical Notes Series	                       27
   Common challenges in establishing a new institution include:
   Constrained time and resources to build a new institution. A new insti-
tution will face immediate challenges with regard to its operational and finan-
cial sustainability. If the option is to create a new government unit/agency,
stakeholders must ensure the new institution has the proper mandate and
authority to decide on issues raised as well as alignment with existing govern-
ment institutions. If it is a private sector organization, there needs to be clarity
on the mandate and care that its role is not overlapping with other BMOs.
   Retaining confidence in the partnership as a transparent and neutral
process. Chief among the confidence factors is the setup of an inclusive
governance structure that receives stakeholders’ approval.
­
   Establishing a new organization that is resource-efficient. Efficiency
means ensuring that the new PPD institution takes advantage of available infra-
structure and that the PPD team is fully transferred to the new institution.

Strategy 3—Decentralization of the PPD Functions
There are instances where the dialogue between Working Groups and
­counterpart public institutions may be sustained without the need for facilita-
 tion by a central PPD Secretariat unit. The functions of the PPD are thus
 decentralized so that issue-specific Working Groups and the PPD
 Governing Board can take on a life of their own, within existing institu-
 tions. These can be line ministries and business associations that carry on
 their own separate advocacy.
    It is to be noted that in some countries, consultation is embedded in the
 way  government operates (OECD countries, industrialized countries), and
 where business associations advocate directly with their counterparts without
 having an umbrella PPD.
    The conditions for Working Group-level PPDs occur over a sustained
 period of time, when several Working Groups have implemented reforms
 independently of the central PPD structure. In Cambodia for instance, after
 several years of G-PSF existence, the Finance and Banking Working Group
 and the Central Bank had built sufficient trust to use direct communication
 channels and no longer necessitated facilitation by a central Secretariat unit.
 A decentralized PPD may be more resilient to political changes because the
 dialogue is less dependent on prominent political figures, such as the PPD
 Chairman. Transitioning a PPD to Working Group-level dialogues also allows
 for greater risk diversification, i.e., ensuring that at least some Working Group
 dialogues will become sustainable.
    At the same time, some challenges are to be expected. Decentralized
 PPDs  are likely to have lesser capacity to attract non-core Working Group
 constituents, such as agencies that have a role in reform implementation
 but  no institutional link to the Working Group subject. Finally, a Working
 Group-level PPD loses the opportunity to create virtuous spillovers from
 one Working Group to the next in terms of capabilities and results. The con-
 sequence being the sustainabilty of a PPD process for the most powerful eco-
 nomic stakeholders and interests.

28	                            Public-Private Dialogue (PPD) Practical Notes Series
  This is in part, what the Cambodia Government-Private Sector Forum has
adopted with a Secretariat unit in each of the Working Groups.

Strategy 4—Internalization of the Stakeholder Dialogue Concept
 In this case, the PPD mechanism itself ends, but the concept of stakeholder
 dialogue is internalized and integrated into the political culture and
­practice, i.e., business association advocacy capacity is improved, govern-
 ment Regulatory Impact Assessments are adopted as well as formal require-
 ments for consultation. This is the case of the Bangladesh Better Business
 Forum.
   During the assessment and development of the transition strategy, spon-
 sors may have assessed that sustainability conditions are met and the PPD is
 wound down:
•	   The culture of dialogue exists with the government and there is a clear
     channel of communication between the government and the private
     sector
•	   The private sector and government have the capacity to engage in
     ­evidence-based advocacy
•	   BMOs are meeting standards in terms of operational and financial
     sustainability
  In many aspects this is a successful intervention, as stakeholders continue
to dialogue as a culture and do not need external support to achieve their
common objectives.

Strategy 5—Ending the Partnership Initiative
In this strategy, the PPD is shut down with no follow-on because the
­objectives were achieved and there is no rationale to continue the process—or
 stakeholders failed to reach an agreement on a way forward.
    As indicated above, some partnerships have time-bound mandates and
 objectives and are not expected to transition to sustainable initiatives. It may
 also be possible for an open-ended PPD to end because stakeholders failed to
 agree on a sustainability plan, or the political culture and context no longer
 call for a highly structured and formal PPD format.

Conclusion on Options
Each alternative has its pros and cons. For example, transferring the Secretariat
unit to a local business association may work if that association possesses
significant capacity and has a nationwide network. But, the organization will
encounter problems if the government does not see it as credible. A joint
business association initiative on the other hand may more easily win the
approval of PPD members and facilitate good operations because of its famil-
iarity with the PPD’s approach. However, obtaining shared financial support,
ensuring effective coordination, and achieving sustainability may pose major
challenges.

   The PPD dialogue continuum (Figure 4.2) illustrates that all dialogues
between the public and the private sectors belong somewhere along a contin-
uum, ranging between structured, formal partnerships on the one hand and
organic, cultural dialogue mechanisms on the other hand. A transition strategy
is a change process that requires development partners “to start early,” as early
as during the design phase of the PPD project, and nurture regular communi-
cation with stakeholders to avoid the collapse of the initiative after DP support
ends. Our recommendation is consequently to PLAN, PLAN, and PLAN.

Clear Description of Tasks and Roles
The transition plan will provide clear terms of reference for each of the enti-
ties involved in the PPD (Figures 4.3 and 4.4). The transition plans of the
Cambodia G-PSF or the MOU establishing a consortium to support the VBF
provide clear terms of reference for each of the entities involved in the PPD by
clearly laying out the roles and responsibilities of each of the constituents and
components.
   Whether described in a legal mandate, internal rules, or an MOU, each
clearly spells out the roles and responsibilities of the Chair, Working Groups,
and/or individual associations.



4.3  STEP 3—Communication and
Sustainability
A PPD should plan for its sustainability by designing a comprehensive
stakeholder engagement strategy and executing it through targeted commu-
­

complement its regular communication to stakeholders on processes and
issues with well-timed, targeted campaigns, addressed to strategic stakeholder
groups in order to address detractors’ messages and gain widespread buy-in
and support for the issues at stake.
   Once stakeholders are engaged, PPDs should address their capacity
building needs and strengthen their advocacy ability by providing access to
­
research that supports reform recommendations. National PPDs should

                      remember that supporting stakeholders are also be found among business
                      networks at the sub-national level. PPDs should communicate externally
                      with other PPDs, including carrying out study tours to exchange informa-
                      tion and lessons about best practices, as well as expanding the stakeholder
                      network.
                         If budget allows, we recommend organizing south-south knowledge
                      exchange events. Members can learn from other initiatives (countries) where
                      DPs have transferred ownership and have been successful at independently
                      managing the PPD initiative.


                      4.4  STEP 4—Implementing the Strategy
                      Congratulations! You have convinced all stakeholders on the way forward; it
                      is now time to implement. During the implementation, it is necessary to con-
                      tinue to communicate with stakeholders on the progress. Remember to stay
                      flexible and adapt the plan according to realities in the field, and recognize
                      that not all work will go according to the plan and earlier discussions.
                         It is important to maintain the date of the transition as non-negotiable, as
                      moving the target will create confusion among stakeholders as to whether
                      sponsors will continue to fund the partnership (Figure 4.7). This does not
                      preclude sponsors from having a post-closure plan that continues to coach
                      staff in BMOs or government agencies, or identify areas where other sponsors
                      can come in to support the PPD.

      universities or staff hired as well as securing continued support by DPs in
      terms of technical assistance (research, expertise).



4.5  Post-Transition Plan
It is also important for sponsors to make an evaluation of the PPD when
they transition out. This is done to take stock of what has been invested, what
has been achieved (in terms of impact), and to prepare for a follow up post-­
closure evaluation 3–5 years later. This final evaluation provides a clear
measure of success or failure of the transition strategy.
­
   The role of sponsors in establishing or supporting a PPD goes beyond the
day it transfers the PPD to local stakeholders. Sponsors have a larger or
“moral” responsibility to ensure that the dialogue continues with effective-
ness, so that it benefits both public and private stakeholders. If the dialogue
fails after the sponsored coordination ends, this could indicate that either the
sustainability strategy was inadequate or sponsor transfer was too soon
(because stakeholders were not ready). Even worse, failure of the PPD could
be seen as a lack of demand for PPD—the PPD was only a sponsor-­     supported
project that had no relevance after DP support ceased.
   Sponsors should develop a post-transistion support plan for a PPD to
ensure that the PPD remains sustainable. Areas of potential sponsor support
include the following:

Financial Sustainability (Grants to Secretariat Unit)
As part of the transition strategy, sponsors may decide to provide a grant to
the “new” Secretariat unit of the PPD, so that it can be operational for the first
year or two. In this case, sponsors and the PPD Secretariat unit need to under-
stand clearly what their role is and responsibilities are, and what outputs are
expected from this grant.
   In the Laotian and Cambodian PPDs, IFC provided a grant of variable size
to sustain the Secretariat unit. This grant mainly focuses on the “infrastruc-
ture” of the PPD Secretariat unit and allows for the coverage of the salary of
one key staff person. In Cambodia, the grant was of (US$) 10 thousand for
each association, thus enabling them to invest in equipment necessary for
the functioning of the Secretariat unit (computer, translation sets, recorder,
etc.). For the Laos Business Fourm (LBF), the IFC provided the salary for
the office coordinator for three years. Appendices F and G provide an exam-
ple of what a grant agreement covers, and the expected outputs.
   Sponsors can help the private sector mobilize funds (securing Secretariat
unit sponsorship by large firms) or secure co-financing of the Secretariat unit
by several associations or the Development Partners (for DPs working in
private sector development).
­


Sustained Mandate
1.	 Mainstream PPD work in existing sponsors’ programs. Under this
    framework, sponsors would continue to provide some support for the
    Working Groups. This could include undertaking studies and staging
    workshops to advocate the issues raised by the private sector. Expenses
    and sponsors’ staff time for these initiatives would be charged to existing
    sponsors’ projects, which are covering related topics. As support would be
    limited to issues that are related to existing projects in the country portfo-
    lios, it could be too narrow to meet the demands of the Working Groups,
    which cover all sectors of the economy and a broader range of issues.
2.	 Create a research and support fund for PPD Working Groups. To deal
    with the inability of the sponsors’ projects to support a wide-enough
    range of topics to meet the demand of the Working Groups, this approach
    would enable the PPD to create a research fund (with funds from one
    or more sponsors). BMOs could apply for these funds to help research
    and develop high quality, actionable reform proposals. Such an approach
    would create partnerships between BMOs and research organizations,
    “think tanks” or consulting firms that would help to prioritize, analyze
    and promote trade and other private sector reforms.
  One of the proposed outputs is facilitation of partnerships/contracts to pre-
pare a number of position papers that would provide the evidence required
for successful reform proposals and their advocacy. An ancillary outcome
would be strengthening the capacity of local think-tanks and consultants to
engage in policy research and advocacy.


Public-Private Dialogue (PPD) Practical Notes Series	                          35
   Because most BMOs lack the capacity to manage the research fund, it could
be managed by a research organization or “think tank” committed to building
BMO capacity. This organization could have two key roles: (a) contracting
appropriate consultants to undertake requested research and (b) providing
training for BMOs in how to plan and conduct research.

Monitoring Post-Transition by the Development
Partner Community
The DP community or sponsors should continue to monitor the impact of the
PPD after the transition by:
1.	 Overseeing M&E for several years to ensure that the tracking of M&E
    data by BMOs and government is well established and impacts are well
    recognized. This would include maintaining contact with stakeholders,
    collecting annual M&E data, and/or conducting surveys;
2.	 Maintaining relationships with PPD practitioners so as to continue
    to have opportunities to gain information, acquire new skills, and reflect
    on their practice through accessing the global PPD website (www​
    .publicprivatedialogue.org) and attending regional or worldwide PPD
    meetings and conferences. Information and experiences could also be
    exchanged through PPD social media, such as Facebook;
3.	 Providing ad-hoc advisory services or conducting research in the region
    on issues of importance to PPD success. The DP community could mobi-
    lize funds for a global project.
  The monitoring of the post-transition process will include key indicators
from the existing PPD M&E framework (Table 4.1) (the dimensions of the
evaluation wheel in terms of organizational effectiveness, the impact on the
reform process and economic impact of the partnership) to assess the conti-
nuity and impact of the forum, such as:
•	    working groups and the plenary forum takes place regularly
•	    committed champions are identified
•	    process is inclusive and transparent
•	    continues to have impact over time


Conclusion
A successful transition involves engaging with stakeholders up-stream in
the platform design process, and once the sponsors or DPs phase out their
intervention. Private sector and government representatives are bound to
work together and will design a solution that works for them that considers
the personalities, interests and power play in place. It would be a mistake to
ignore the political economy of multi-stakeholder dialogues. Communication
and transparency in the process helps to create a smooth transfer of
ownership.

Case Studies
The following case studies illustrate some of the sustainability strategies that
PPDs could implement upon during sponsor transition (discussed in full
detail in Chapter 4).


5.1  STRATEGY 1: Transition to Existing
Institutions
Cambodian Government—G-PSF, Political Economy of
the Transition
In 2002, The IFC began its support of the Cambodia Government–Private
Sector Forum’s (G-PSF) Coordinating Bureau to help the private sector advo-
cate for itself more successfully. Over the years, the G-PSF has become a rec-
ognized leader in PPD. In 2009, the World Bank Group named the G-PSF one
of the most successful public/private dialogues in emerging economies. In an
extensive independent evaluation conducted in 2007, the G-PSF also scored
very well. Seeing that the dialogue had matured, in 2009, IFC began transfer-
ring coordination of the G-PSF Private Sector Working Groups (PSWG) to
the private sector. This was completed on December 31, 2010.

                           The Royal Government of Cambodia has acknowledged this transfer
                        by issuing a notification dated November 12, 2010. This institutionalized
                        private sector participation in the Government-Private Sector Forum
                        (G-PSF), officially acknowledged the existing private sector Co-chairs, and
                        established the CCC as the umbrella organization representing the private
                        sector. It also established a consultative process between the CCC and the
                        Private Sector Co-chairs, regarding who is eligible to become a PSWG
                        member, how the G-PSF operates and the process for electing a Co-chair
                        for each PSWG.
                           In 2009, the IFC began the transition of its Secretariat unit role to private
                        sector BMOs. By-laws were developed to mandate private ­      sector organiza-
                        tions. These by-laws described its processes and how the private sector
                        engages in dialogue with the Royal Government of Cambodia and established
                        a Secretariat unit under the umbrella of the CCC. Under this framework, it is
                        provisioned that eight leading industry business associations each support a
                        Secretariat team for one of the eight PSWGs, with the CCC coordinating all
                        the Secretariat units (Figures 5.1 and 5.2).
                           The Secretariat unit role is therefore shared between:
                        •	     Business associations: each designated association acts as a Secretariat
                               unit for its respective PSWG. These BMOs are responsible for day-to-day
                               facilitation of the PSWGs (organizing and facilitating meetings, prepar-
                               ing minutes, preparing research to support issues, etc.)
                        •	     The Cambodia Chamber of Commerce: a support unit within the
                               CCC liaises with the eight association Secretariat units. It also centralizes
                               information from the PSWGs; liaises with government in organizing the
                               biannual forums; and, monitors progress and impact.
                           At the time of transfer, only six leading business associations were provid-
                        ing Secretariat unit support to their respective Working Groups (WGs).
                        Two PSWGs out of eight did not have a dedicated Secretariat unit, but the
                        CCC stepped in to support these. The CCC has also established a
                        Coordination unit staffed with three employees. Anticipating G-PSF loss of
                        effectiveness in advocacy efforts, the World Bank provided funding for two

years after IFC  in order to undertake research through a trade facilitation
Multi-Donor Trust Fund.
  Until today, the G-PSF continues to have high-level forum meetings chaired
by the Prime Minister. Unfortunately, the agenda is now captured either by
the government or by the powerful actors in the Chamber of Commerce. The
discussions do not represent SMEs, and there is a lack of inclusiveness and
representativeness. It can be considered that in the “transformation phase”
(Phase 4), the G-PSF is “exploited” as it continues to exist as a façade without
answering to the new needs of stakeholders. Sectoral business associations
have thus developed their own channels for advocacy.

Lao Business Forum—LBF, Managing Stakeholders
In March 2005, the LBF was established through an MOU between the
                                                              partnership
Government and IFC. The IFC served as the Secretariat unit in ­
with the Ministry for Planning and Investment (MPI), which coordinates the

40	                           Public-Private Dialogue (PPD) Practical Notes Series
government’s side of the LBF, the Lao National Chamber of Commerce
and Industry (LNCCI) and various associations that represent the business
community.
   After five years of IFC support, the LBF reached a phase of maturity. This
signaled the time to transfer the LBF to local ownership, however, the transi-
tion initially faced strong resistance from stakeholders who felt the PPD was
not ready to be independent. IFC hired a consultant to manage the change
process (Figure 5.4) and a wide consultation with stakeholders ensued in an
effort to reach an agreement on the transition strategy. A “transition commit-
tee” was established to help defuse the conflict.
   Ending the PPD partnership was not a consideration, so, two options were
put forward: (a) transfer to a government institution, or (b) transfer to the
LNCCI. The transition committee and stakeholders agreed that the LBF
Secretariat unit would be transferred to the private sector, and in 2010, IFC
transferred its Secretariat unit functions to LNCCI (Figure 5.3).
   Some of the main points agreed to during the consultation series were:
•	   Consensus that LBF is a worthwhile body—not perfect, but has made
     significant progress over the past 3 years
•	   Strong consensus that LBF should continue (the future sustainability of
     LBF is a present concern)
•	   Role the IFC-managed neutral Secretariat unit has played to date is
     acknowledged as valuable
•	   18 months is a good handover period
•	   A clear plan for LBF6 and a “road map” has been developed
  The LNCCI, as a public institution, had been participating in the monthly
government interministerial meetings well before the LBF was created, and

accordingly was able to raise private sector concerns. When the PPD was
established, however, a parallel channel was created instead of building on the
access already existing between the LNCCI and decision-makers. When IFC
transitioned from the LBF, and budget was no longer available for organizing
the Forum plenary sessions, the LNCCI contented itself with its participation
in the inter-ministerial meetings and ceased its consultation with other
BMOs. Consequently, although LNCCI was designated successor to the LBF,
it does not represent the larger private sector constituency.
   A mandate does exists within the LNCCI to continue the activities of
the  LBF, however, IFC did not succeed in integrating the PPD into the
political process of the government. Even though the IFC continued to
finance the position of coordinator based in the LNCCI for a period of
3 years, little has been done since the handover.

Liberia Better Business Forum—LBBF, Getting the
Plan Implemented
The Liberia Better Business Forum (LBBF) was launched in July 2007 and was
officially endorsed by the Liberian government and private sector as a new
mechanism to facilitate dialogue on investment climate issues. The LBBF is a
structured PPD that brings together the government of Liberia and the pri-
vate sector to engage in constructive dialogue on identifying, prioritizing, and
resolving key constraints to private sector development. The IFC played the
role of the Secretariat unit of the LBBF until its transfer in 2014.
   One key decision that constituents had to make was to define exactly
what was to be transitioned. Was this to be LBBF as a complete entity?

42	                               Public-Private Dialogue (PPD) Practical Notes Series
Or should it be based on a more evidence-based, rigorous and transparent
approach to identifying and addressing barriers to doing business in
Liberia.
   In 2010, a PPD expert developed the LBBF Plan to transfer ownership to
local stakeholders. However, at the time of this report the plan’s implementa-
tion has not yet been executed. The transition plan proposed a focus on the
new members of the Secretariat unit, Governing Board and Working Groups.
Operationally, the plan proposed the signing of an MOU between the LBBF
and IFC that would allow the LBBF to act as dialogue anchor in support of the
continuing IFC Investment Climate reform initiatives.
   The independent LBBF was officially scheduled to begin operations on July
1, 2014, and was to be housed within the Ministry of State (MOS). The MOS’s
comparative advantage as host institution for an independent LBBF lies
mainly in its proximity to the Presidency. This proximity was meant to signal
to all stakeholders (both public and private) that the President’s Office was
placing a high-priority on the LBBF as a mechanism for private sector devel-
opment. The MOS’s reputation for being a neutral broker and a facilitator of
other institutions and programs was a further advantage. But, by 2014, the
Government had changed its position and decided that the Ministry
of  Commerce and Industry, which Chairs the LBBF, should host the PPD
Secretariat unit rather than the MOS.
   The proposed funding mechanism for supporting the LBBF included the
following sources:
•	   Financial and in-kind contributions by each of the LBBF’s public sector
     partners
•	   Financial and in-kind contributions by each of the LBBF’s private sector
     partners
•	   Financial and in-kind contributions by Development Partners
•	   LBBF revenue generation/grant funding
   Ownership transition of the LBBF was to be a key component of the
LBBF’s Three Year plan for 2011–2013 and for its annual work plans. A num-
ber of outputs centered solely on the issue of the LBBF’s transition had been
factored into each of these planning documents. Resources were required for
the achievement of several of these outputs beyond the contributions of the
LBBF Secretariat unit and the PPD Global Team.
   The primary challenge for the LBBF was that over a fairly limited time
frame it needed to simultaneously generate a much greater number of reform
outputs as well as to develop and execute a plan for its ownership transition.
When the transition plan was elaborated, there was little track record else-
where for PPDs attempting this tricky balancing act in so short a time frame.
•	   Required Resources
Activities that required the most resources were: (a) oversight of transition
process, (b) Institutional options and capacity assessments, (c) stakeholder
workshops, (d) materials development and report writing, and (e) capacity
building of the private sector including (possibly) acquisition of equipment.

Public-Private Dialogue (PPD) Practical Notes Series	                      43
•	    Points considered in the LBBF transition strategy
1.	 The LBBF’s dual challenge of generating significantly more reform outputs
    alongside buy-in and commitment to a transition plan was rare, so creative
    solutions and out-of-the-box thinking was needed for both to succeed.
2.	 A reasonable amount of time was to be allocated for the LBBF to focus on
    moving reform proposals through its Working Groups to its Governing
    Board and then to Government.
3.	 Communication about the need for a transition as well as its main ele-
    ments was to begin well ahead of actual deliberations with several LBBF
    communication tools available for this purpose.
4.	 Once formal discussions started, stakeholders (and potential future LBBF
    investors) were to grasp as quickly as possible the full extent of the transi-
    tion’s requirements and main elements as well as the key decisions which
    needed to be made.
5.	 Relationship building with other DPs was also to begin well ahead of
    transition discussions, the main purpose being to gauge potential DP
    support for the LBBF once the IFC has transitioned.
6.	 The private sector was to play a particularly important role in the design
    of the future LBBF, so every effort was to be made to engage them in tran-
    sition discussions. It would not have been possible for example: to agree
    on the future LBBF host unless and until the private sector signed a for-
    mal agreement among itself to support the LBBF as a locally owned entity.
7.	 The private sector ideally was to be brought into the work of the Secretariat
    unit parallel to formal transition discussions being undertaken, if not
    sooner.
8.	 The to-be-hired LBBF Coordinator was to focus on transition issues in
    parallel to the day-to-day LBBF management, with an increasing focus on
    the LBBF’s transition needed over time.
9.	 Capacity building and training for LBBF actors were to largely focus on
    the private sector and address the following: (a) how to run a Secretariat
    unit, (b) advocacy, (c) research and analysis, and (d) communications.
  During the consultation on the LBBF’s transition, it was recommended
to carefully manage the expansion of the LBBF’s mandate to address sector
and/or sub-national issues. It was quite challenging just to maintain LBBF
productivity once the work on its transition intensified. Despite efforts, the
2010 draft plan was never fully implemented even though IFC support was
extended until June 2014 then 2016.

Sustainability Issues
The Timor-Leste Better Business Initiative (BBI) was established in January
2008 by the IFC and the Ministry of Economy and Development (Figure 5.5).
It was created to improve the business enabling environment by providing

a  platform for effective and constructive dialogue between the business
­
community and the government of Timor-Leste, and to facilitate informa-
tion-sharing with potential investors.
   Serving as the Secretariat unit for the dialogue, IFC collaborated with key
stakeholders that included the Office of the Prime Minister, the Ministry of
Economy and Development, Ministry of Tourism, Commerce and Industry
and the Ministry of Finance, as well as a broad representation of the private
sector and financial institutions. But, because the BBI was 100% reliant on
IFC staff, the PPD was not sustainable. Two key elements of the challenge
were: (a) a weak coordinating system, and (b) difficulty accessing information
by both the public and private sector.
   After the Prime Minister’s meeting with the private sector in March 2009
(organized by BBI at the Prime Minister’s request), a “Commisao Instaladora”
was formed to organize the private sector and agree on a governance struc-
ture for the to-be-created Chamber of Commerce.
   When IFC decided to transition from the BBI, the option adopted was to
end the BBI initiative and put effort in to building the Chamber of Commerce
and Industry (CCI) to continue the advocacy efforts on behalf of the private
sector. The IFC worked with the “Commisao Instaladora,” and the DP com-
munity to establish Timor-Leste’s CCI. Although CCI was in its infancy, it
received support from several international partners.
   Aspects of the BBI that IFC has transferred to the CCI:
•	   Notion of working groups, which meet regularly to work on a particular
     issue or related set of issues

Public-Private Dialogue (PPD) Practical Notes Series	                              45
•	    Inclusion of a variety of private sector perspectives in the discussion, as
      well as involvement of government officials
•	    Follow-up on agreed actions and recommendations, both with working
      group participants and with relevant policymakers
•	    Importance of developing analytical work to recommend specific actions
      by government, rather than raising more general complaints
•	    Communication about reform processes and outcomes

•	    Sustainability Issues
The creation of the Chamber of Commerce provided an opportunity for
IFC to transfer its experience and to engage on a few key reform topics. For
example, the Chamber required continued IFC support for large scale
reforms—in advocating with the government for major changes as well as
providing capacity building assistance to members of the Chamber.
   However, the sustainability of the Chamber was and remains largely
dependent on government and DP funding. The government has provided
the CCI with (US$) 200,000 in initial funding while German-funded BFZ has
pledged (US$) 2 million in funding, which is largely focused on program
costs rather than operational funding. While some members of the Chamber
pay fees and the Presidential Council members pay (US$) 6,000 each per
annum, the CCI still has a long way to go before membership contribution is
sufficiently strong and can support the Chamber.
   A special point on the progress of CCI is how several international partners
are supporting CCI, each with its own occasionally conflicting visions of what
the Chamber should become. For three years, a full-time international expert
from Brazil has worked in the CCI office on behalf of BFZ’s efforts. However,
that IFC support remains a critical element, particularly for the Chamber’s
engagement with government on policy or advocacy issues.
   At the time of IFC transfer, the Ministry had yet to establish a coordinat-
ing unit for the dialogue. Given that the CCI had just been established, and
there was strong competition and low cooperation between ministries, a high
level coordinating unit would be crucial for the CCI to efficiently advocate
with the government. Thus, it seems that the creation of a new institution, as
in the case of CCITL, is a high-risk endeavor, and as one CCI member noted,
“If the DPs stop now, CCI will collapse.”

Participants: Stakeholders of the PPD, media, Civil Society Organizations.
   Learning Objectives: The objective of the orientation workshop is to
present the new structure of the PPD, explain to stakeholders how they
will engage in the future and who their focal points are. Members of pri-
vate sector representatives as well as public sector should be informed
how the dialogue will be carried out and how they can continue to discuss
issues that matter to them. This is usually a 2–3 hour orientation work-
shop with different groups of stakeholders. Presenters include the chair of
the Steering Committee, champions, co-chairs and Secretariat unit staff/
coordinators of the PPD. Stakeholders also include the members of the
legislative bodies, opposition parties, the media, civil society organiza-
tions and other stakeholders. [Workshop materials to be developed by
