INTRODUCTION


The women’s banking market has tremendous economic potential in Egypt, with an
estimated credit demand of $283 million among women-owned SMEs.1 However,
financial institutions in the country have yet to develop strategies to address this market
gap, which represents a missed opportunity and constrains private sector development.
To explore this business opportunity, IFC hosted the first in a series of roundtables on the
potential of the women’s banking market in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) in
Cairo on October 29, 2015.



This report summarizes the discussions, which focused on the                               Key trends at the global, regional and national level indicating

RISING EDUCATION LEVELS OF WOMEN

Globally, women are better educated than ever before, with women’s
participation in tertiary education surpassing male participation in almost
all developed countries and half of developing countries.7 Notably, in Egypt,
while levels of female and male enrollment in tertiary education are similar,
there is a higher percentage of female students enrolled in Science, Technology,
Engineering and Maths (STEM) studies compared to men, according to the
World Economic Forum.8


WOMEN’S DECISION MAKING AND SPENDING POTENTIAL

An estimated 85 percent of households identify women as the main decision
makers and globally, women control about $20 trillion of global consumer
spending.9 As women’s economic participation grows, so too will their
consumer power.


UNMET DEMAND FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES

Banking women can satisfy unmet demand for financial services and help
banks in diversifying and growing their portfolios. At a global level, women
have an unmet financing need of $4.2 billion credit per year and a deposit
potential of nearly $2.9 billion. In emerging markets alone, there is an
estimated credit demand per year by women-owned SMEs of $260-320
billion.10 Within MENA, 55 percent of women-owned SMEs do not have
access to credit. The credit demand for women-owned SMEs is $50 billion per
year, or $72 billion per year including micro enterprises.11


Similarly, there is an unmet demand in the insurance market segment. A study
by AXA, Accenture and IFC found the annual premium value from women                                           KEY FACTS:

INFORMAL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
There are persistent levels of informality within businesses in Egypt. Tax
revenues from these businesses are needed to boost the economy and bring
savings into the formal financial system, which can help enhance financial
stability and contribute to a more prosperous society.


LEGAL AND CULTURAL BARRIERS
Interwoven legal and cultural constraints currently limit women’s
entrepreneurship prospects and access to finance, such as access to national
identity documents without the consent of a husband. Furthermore, the
current criminalization of bankruptcy impedes entrepreneurship and
innovation among both women and men. Regulatory reforms to stimulate
the SME ecosystem and address access to finance barriers for women, both as
individuals and SME owners, will help unlock this potential.




RECOMMENDATIONS
FOR ACTION
While the commercial case for targeting the women’s market may be
clear, various obstacles need to be overcome for banks and the country
to profit from this significant untapped opportunity. To address these
challenges, create an enabling environment, and get the buy-in to establish
and operate a successful women’s market program, participants at this
discussion suggested a series of recommendations. By embracing these
actions at the financial ecosystem and bank level, through national and
global collaborative partnerships, Egyptian financial institutions can help
stimulate the women’s market to boost bank profitability, women, and
ultimately the Egyptian economy.
