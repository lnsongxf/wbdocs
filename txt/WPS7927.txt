1         Introduction

        Latin American countries achieved important social progress in the 2000s. Poverty
fell by over 16 percentage points, from 39.5 to 23.3 percent of the population between
2004-14; while extreme poverty was more than halved (declining from 24.5 to 10.8
percent) over the same period1 . The middle class in the region expanded2 . And in-
come inequality, a persistent malady in Latin America, fell substantially during the
2000s (the regional Gini coeﬃcient for per capita income declined from 0.57 to 0.51
in 2000-14) (World Bank, 2016). The role of rising labor income stands out, among
other factors contributing to these achievements, as a key channel of transmission
between growth and social gains. Indeed, income from labor has been a central el-
ement in the reduction of poverty. For instance, Rodriguez-Castelan et al. (2016)
establish labor income as the leading driver behind the reduction in poverty between
2003 and 2013 in the region. What happens in terms of labor market dynamics is
thus fundamental to understanding wellbeing in Latin America and the Caribbean,
particularly if the interest is on the poorest segment of the population. As docu-
mented by Cord et al. (2014), data from household surveys across the region show
that incomes from labor make up 60 to 80 percent of total household income.
        The study of job quality – including characteristics such as whether jobs are
stable and pay, at the very least, a living wage – is useful to shed further light on

(World Bank, 2016).

     Growing from 23 percent of the population in 2003 to 35 percent of the population in 2014
(World Bank, 2016). Following Lopez-Calva and Ortiz-Juarez (2011), and Ferreira et al. (2013),
the middle class is deﬁned as the population with a consumption per capita of US$10-US$50 per
day in PPP 2005 (which distinguishes this group from the vulnerable, i.e. those with a consumption
per capita between $4 and $10 per day).
labor market dynamics, and the sustainability of these achievements. For more than
a decade, job growth within Latin America and the Caribbean was overall strong,
reﬂecting substantial economic growth and being relatively unaﬀected by the 2008-09
ﬁnancial crisis – with the exception of Mexico and countries in Central America with
signiﬁcant levels of trade with the United States. Informality rates, however, remain
high, suggesting that new jobs may not be ‘high’ quality. High quality jobs can
constitute a pathway out of poverty – contributing to the sustainability of the gains
in welfare (while individuals with low quality jobs could be at risk of falling back into
poverty). This paper thus looks at job quality across Latin America, investigating
the relationship between job quality and poverty.
       This topic is particularly relevant, considering the lower-growth juncture that
the Latin America region is traversing. After a decade or so of a robust economic
performance – fueled by the windfall from the global commodity boom – growth in
the region began to slow down in 2011, reaching full-on stagnation in 20153 . The
regional deceleration is framed within the economic slowdown taking place world-
wide, particularly in China (led by a decline in investment), and the falling prices of
commodities.
       While the region as a whole is slowing down, there is heterogeneity within. De
la Torre et al.(2015) look at how countries in South America, which did well dur-
ing the period of economic expansion of the 2000s, have been more aﬀected by
the deceleration in China, facing worsening terms of trade than Mexico and those
   3
    Gross Domestic Product in the region contracted by 0.7 percent in 2015 and is expected to
contract 1.3 percent in 2016, establishing the ﬁrst consecutive years of recession in more than 30
years.

in Central America and the Caribbean, which are more inﬂuenced by the United
States’ economic cycle (and which fared less positively in the 2000s). In the group
of South American countries experiencing high growth during the boom (and to a
lesser extent, in those experiencing low growth), employment grew, attracting pre-
viously inactive workers into the market, both low- and high-skilled, accompanied
by wage increases between 2005 and 2011 (while in Mexico, employment and wages
declined). Overall, during the expansion, the composition of employment shifted
away from self-employment into salaried work, and from small ﬁrms to employment
in medium and larger ﬁrms – i.e., on average, there was a shift towards more formal,
higher productivity, better paid work. With the economic slowdown, however, this
trend appears to be undergoing a reversal for some countries. The analysis suggests
that the contraction in domestic demand, as a result of the adverse terms of trade,
is leading, among others, to adjustments in quantity in the labor market that have
particularly aﬀected young and less educated workers. Moreover, the rate of progress
in inequality reduction is also slowing down. After a solid decade of performance,
recent research suggests signs of stagnation in the decline in income inequality in the
region between 2010 and 2013 (Cord et al., 2014). As in the case of growth, there is
much heterogeneity within: many countries still display substantial declines, while
the pace of reduction has become negligible in some, and even increased in others.
   The rise of labor market income and poverty reduction has not progressed in the
same way across countries. Overall, labor income explained 58 percent of poverty
reduction in Latin America and the Caribbean during 2003-08, and 49 percent over
2008-13 (World Bank, 2014). Yet, this trend was not uniform: income from labor


                                          3
rose in the Andean region, Brazil, and others in the Southern Cone, while it in fact
fell in Mexico and Central America – the countries hardest hit by the 2008-09 global
crisis; leading to an increase in poverty. World Bank (2014) reports additional trends
obtained from the Labor Income Poverty Index (LIPI), which examines whether the
per capita labor income of households is lower than the regional poverty line, i.e. the
share of households who are incapable of satisfying basic needs based only on their
income from labor. Based on quarterly and monthly labor surveys, these indices
have the advantage of constituting very regular sources of information. As measured
by the LIPI coeﬃcient, poverty has declined in nearly all countries considered in the
study since 2010 (except for Mexico, where it has increased since 2013). The rate
of reduction, however, has ﬂattened recently and the most up-to-date data suggest
signs of a reversal, with increasing labor income poverty in Argentina, Brazil and
Peru.
   Despite the value of labor income indices, a multidimensional approach can add
valuable information to assess job growth, and the sustainability of labor market
trends. Multidimensional measures provide a new depth of information about the
variable of interest. Notably, in terms of poverty, these estimations consider how
individuals are deprived, not only by their absence of income, but by their lacking
in other dimensions related to wellbeing, such as in terms of living standards, access
to services, or housing. Indeed, poverty measurement eﬀorts in Latin America are
moving in the direction of complementary measurements of welfare as part of the
shift worldwide towards a multiple dimension perspective over the past two decades.
Within the region, Chile (2015), Colombia (2013), and Mexico (2010) have been


                                          4
pioneers in establishing oﬃcial national multidimensional poverty measures. At the
regional level, World Bank (2012) and later Santos et al (2015) have recently pro-
posed a new multidimensional poverty index for Latin America, estimating it for 17
countries. These studies document signiﬁcant progress on non-monetary dimensions
of poverty across the region.
   Analogous to these recent eﬀorts to measure recent progress on non-monetary
dimensions of poverty across Latin America, this paper looks to analyze the recent
progress in the quality of labor markets in the region in terms of both monetary and
non-monetary dimensions of jobs. That is, while income from labor is unquestionably
important, we want to explore other aspects of jobs that are important components
of job quality. The underlying notion is that the quality of jobs is related to the
sustainability of the social gains achieved so far in the region. Job quality can be
viewed as a proxy for social progress – it has improved but it is heterogeneous across
countries and there are concerns about how sustainable the gains are, particularly
in the context of the global economic slowdown. This paper thus proposes multiple
dimensions to measure quality of employment in the region.
   What exactly is meant by job quality? The literature on job quality is very
thin, and the deﬁnition of a “good job” varies considerably across articles (Huneeus,
Landerretche and Puentes, 2012). A high quality job must pay at least the living
wage, but other considerations are important as well. Four other dimensions of
job quality can be consistently identiﬁed in the literature: stability and security
(Stewart, 2007; Dewan and Peek, 2007; Perry et al., 2007; Gunther and Launov,
2012; Clarke and Borisov, 1999; Ruiz-Tagle and Sehnbruch, 2011; Wagner, 1997),


                                          5
job satisfaction and psychological health (Freeman, 1978; Clark, 2005; Jones et al.,
2009), job beneﬁts (Farber, 1997; Kalleberg, Reskin and Hudson, 2000), and human
capital accumulation (Huneeus, Landerretche and Puentes, 2012). A worker who
receives a large income but faces a high probability of becoming unemployed can
hardly be said to have a good job. Likewise, a middle income worker who receives
health insurance and retirement beneﬁts may have a better job than a high income
worker who hates what he does.
   Perhaps the most important job characteristic to many workers across the LAC
region is stability. Without job security, many individuals who are newly out of
poverty may become impoverished in the near future. Furthermore, job security
improves the psychological condition of the worker and aﬀects his or her consumption
choices and welfare. Likewise, a job that places intense psychological pressure on the
worker or generates an unpleasant environment or fails to fulﬁll the needs of the
worker is not high quality. These conditions reduce the productivity of the worker.
One way to potentially increase job satisfaction and improve welfare is through job
beneﬁts. Job beneﬁts provide an extra-pecuniary form of income and include, but
are not limited to, health insurance and social security.
   Human capital accumulation is important for improving the income security of
the worker, which is usually measured by on-the-job training. However, it is also
important for the development of the country. The World Bank World Development
Report (2012) argues that a good job must be good for the worker and good for
society. While this is an unquestionably crucial aspect of job quality, our primary
focus in this report is on individual job quality and its relationship with poverty.


                                          6
    The multidimensional nature of job quality makes it diﬃcult to measure and
standardize across countries. We use the ordinal framework developed by Sen (1976)
and Alkire and Foster (2011) for measuring poverty to estimate job quality within
Latin America. We ﬁnd that job quality began to signiﬁcantly increase around
2004. We all ﬁnd that the best predictors of job quality are age, gender, education,
formal employment, and union membership; while job beneﬁts are the job quality
dimensions that are best correlated with living “out” of poverty.
    The paper is organized as follows. The next two sections discuss the data used in
the study and the measurement of job quality across countries, employment sectors,
and time. Section 4 investigates which job and personal characteristics are associated
with higher job quality. Section 5 looks at the relationship between job quality and
family poverty. Finally, sections 6 and 7 oﬀer robustness checks and concludes the
discussion.

    All observations in this study represent an individual who is in the labor force,
i.e. either employed or looking for employment. If an individual is not in the labor
force, then we cannot make an inference about their welfare as that may be their
preferred state. If a worker is in the labor force, but unemployed, then we can infer
that a job would positively inﬂuence their welfare. Therefore, we keep unemployed
individuals in the sample when we are looking at job quality. Brazil dominates the
sample with just under 35% of the observations, whereas Nicaragua represents less
than 0.25% of the sample.
    The summary statistics are shown in Table 2. Unless otherwise noted, the vari-

     As discussed later, only years that reported at least 5 dimensions of job quality were used in
this study. This resulted in 9.88% of the observations being trimmed from the sample, equal to 34
country-years and 930,591 observations.

ables listed in the summary statistics are used as controls in the later regressions.
It is also important to mention that 75% of the sample is located within urban ar-
eas. This is particularly the case since data for Argentina and most of the data for
Uruguay are taken from surveys representative only for urban areas. Over a third of
the workers have formal jobs, but over two-thirds of the workers are in small ﬁrms.
The SEDLAC data deﬁnes a small ﬁrm as having less than ﬁve employees for most
countries. For Bolivia (2001-2002), Chile (1996), the Dominican Republic, Panama,
and Uruguay, the cutoﬀ for a small ﬁrm is less than four employees. Note that
formal jobs are highly correlated with large or public ﬁrms. While many workers
with a formal job also have a job contract, and vice versa, the two concepts are not
perfectly correlated. Also, Edu − High, the indicator for completing high school,
includes individuals that have completed college as well.

   Our analysis proposes the use of seven diﬀerent dimensions for measuring job
quality, though other dimensions are considered in the robustness section. The seven
variables were chosen in accordance with the previously discussed literature. The ﬁrst
dimension of job quality is income (P ov ). A high quality job pays a large enough
wage to keep the worker above the poverty line. In our measure of job quality, this
is a necessary condition to have a quality job. The other six dimensions capture
whether or not the job provides beneﬁts, security, satisfaction, or opportunities to
build human capital.
   We include in the analysis two dimensions to capture job beneﬁts: health in-
surance (Ins), and retirement beneﬁts (Ret). Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia,
Mexico, and Peru provide some level of universal health care coverage for their citi-
zens. However, coverage may be inadequate and many jobs in these countries provide
additional insurance on top of that provided by the government. We control for these
countries in the relevant speciﬁcations.
   Another dimension of job quality that we analyze is tenure (T en). This vari-
able has also been used in similar studies by Ruiz-Tagle and Sehnbruch (2011) and
Huneeus, Landerretche and Puentes (2012). Tenure denotes that the employee has
a relatively stable job. Also, an individual that has worked for a signiﬁcant period
of time has developed the experience and skills necessary to ensure a better future.
While tenure is important, we also include whether or not an individual has signed
a job contract (Cont), and whether or not the job is permanent instead of tempo-
rary (P erm), as complementary proxies for job security. It is important to include
multiple dimensions that capture the same eﬀect since many countries do not report


                                           10
one or more of the job quality dimensions.
   The ﬁnal dimension of job quality that we utilize is the psychological beneﬁts from
job satisfaction and leisure. While job satisfaction is inherently diﬃcult to measure,
we proxy this aspect of job quality with an indicator for whether or not the individual
works at only one job (Sing ). Workers who have multiple jobs are revealing that
their primary job is not meeting all of their needs, and thus their primary job can be
considered to be not of high quality. They also reduce their leisure time and ability
to improve the interpersonal relationships with their colleagues, a key aspect of job
quality identiﬁed by Clark (2005).
   The Alkire and Foster (2011) framework (AF) for creating a multi-dimensional
index requires that each dimension for every observation is treated as either a success
or a failure. Failures are treated as a 0, while successes are given a 1. For the health
insurance, retirement beneﬁts, having a job contract, and having a permanent job
dimensions, success is achieved whenever the job provides the beneﬁt or is associated
with the particular quality. The other variables are continuous and must be given a
cutoﬀ point that deﬁnes success. For poverty, we use the $2.50/day extreme poverty
line, the common measure of poverty for Latin American countries. In the robustness
section, we show that the principal ﬁndings in this paper hold for the $1.25/day and
$4.00/day poverty lines, though the magnitudes of the eﬀects diﬀer slightly. To
determine whether or not the worker was paid above the poverty line, individual
income from the principal job was adjusted to 2005 dollars by PPP.
   The cutoﬀ point for tenure was chosen to be 3 years. If the worker has been
employed in the principal job for at least three consecutive years, then a success is

 Variable     Description
 P ov         The job pays above the poverty line ($2.50/day PPP)
 Ins          The job provides health insurance
 Ret          The job provides retirement beneﬁts
 T en         The worker has tenure, deﬁned here as working more than 3 years at the job
 Cont         A job contract was signed
 P erm        The job is not temporary
 Sing         This is only job the worker has



reported in this dimension. To determine whether or not a worker only has one job,
we looked at the total number of labor hours per month. If the total number of
labor hours were greater than the number of labor hours in the principal job, then
the dimension was recorded as a failure.
       A summary of the job quality dimensions is found in Table 3. Whenever a variable
is missing for an observation, it is treated as a failure and given a zero.5 For example,
if a person in Mexico has a missing value for whether or not their job is permanent,
we are assuming their job is not permanent.
       Table 4 lists the percentage of the job observations for each country that report
a success in each of the job quality dimensions. The percentage of workers who earn
less than the poverty line is lower than the percentage of people living in poverty
for each country. This is due to two reasons. The ﬁrst reason is that all individuals
within the sample are in the labor force, thus we are not including people who are
likely living below the poverty line. Also, we are not taking into consideration total
family income and the number of household members. Household poverty will be

    We have also performed the analysis in this report by dropping all observations where at least
one dimension was missing, but the results are largely the same.

taken into consideration in a later section.
   Most individuals who work only have one job and receive income above the
poverty line. However, many countries, particularly those least developed and with
higher incidence of extreme poverty, tend to be deﬁcient in many of the other dimen-
sions of job quality. Though, some of the numbers may be downwardly biased since
the dimension may only be reported in a few of the years. This is most obviously
seen in the number of workers with tenure for Mexico. Only one of the seven years
of data for Mexico includes tenure estimates. We correct for this bias in the next

health care. We control for these countries when necessary.



3     Measuring Job Quality

    The aim of this report is to determine what factors are correlated with job quality
and how job quality is linked to poverty. Job quality must be aggregated into a single
dimension to compare it across countries and time. We do this by adapting the AF
framework mentioned previously. An index is created that indicates the number
of dimensions in which the worker is successful. If a worker is unemployed, all
dimensions are censored and the worker has a job quality rating of 0. Likewise, we
make it a necessary condition that the worker receives a living wage, otherwise job
quality is 0. For example, we do not consider a contract to be meaningful if the job
does not provide enough income to meet the basic needs of the worker. We use two
diﬀerent measures given by

for the particular country-year combination. Job quality sum will be referred to as
JQS while job quality ratio will be referred to as JQR . Job quality sum is found
by adding all of the job quality successes for an observation, where each success is
counted as 1 and each failure is 0. Therefore, it is a number between 0 and 7 for
each observation where a higher number denotes a higher level of job quality. The
job quality ratio normalizes job quality to take into account that some countries do
not report some quality dimensions. The ratio is found by dividing JQS by the total
number of quality dimensions available for each country and year. Thus, job quality
ratio is a number between 0 and 1 and is our preferred method of measuring job
quality.
   The average job quality ratio in each country is shown in Figure 1. The standout

countries are Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, and Uruguay with over 40% of the
quality dimensions satisﬁed on average. One way in which these countries stand out
is that they employ a much smaller share of their labor force in the agricultural sector.
For instance, only 4.7% of the workers in our sample of Uruguay are employed in the
agricultural sector (which is partly due to the urban bias of the survey), compared to
the over 40% employed in Guatemala. Agricultural jobs tend to have much lower job
quality than other sectors of employment. This can be seen more clearly in Figure
2.
     Figure 2 also shows that better quality jobs tend to be located in the public,
utility, and ﬁnance sectors. Also, jobs in education and health services have high
levels of job quality. Though we do not show how all dimensions of job quality


                                                                           16
are distributed across sectors of economic activity, these jobs have relatively more
successes across all job quality dimensions, except for having tenure and having only
a single job. Workers in the relatively low quality sectors of agriculture and ﬁshing
are much more likely to have tenure and stay on the job for many years. Also, most
workers report having only one job regardless of what sector they are employed in.
The highest quality sectors, i.e. utilities, public administration, and education, are
primarily separated from the next highest group by only one variable. These workers
are much more likely to receive retirement beneﬁts from employment.
   The average job quality ratio shown in Figure 1 can possibly mask how job quality
is distributed throughout the countries. Some countries could have a lot of workers
with all quality dimensions ﬁlled and many workers with extremely low job quality,
yet have a very large average. We analyze the distribution of job quality by looking at
the number of individuals with a “good” job. A good job is a job that has successes
in k quality dimensions. For the job quality ratio, k is between 0 and 1 and represents
the percentage of quality dimensions that must be ﬁlled before the worker can be
considered to have a good job. Two examples are shown in Figures 3 and 4.
   In Figure 3, the cutoﬀ of k ≥ 1/2 is used, meaning that at least half of the possible
quality dimensions are satisﬁed, with income above the poverty line being the ﬁrst
dimension. We see that more than 60% of workers in Brazil and Uruguay would be
considered to have a good job, while Bolivia, Guatemala, and Honduras have very
few workers with good jobs. Similar results show up in Figure 4 where all quality
dimensions must be satisﬁed to have a good job. Using this deﬁnition, Argentina
is one of the best places to work in Latin America with almost 25% of the workers

receiving successes in all dimensions of job quality. This implies that the distribution
of job quality in Argentina is split between workers with very high levels of job quality
and those with moderately low levels. A similar observation holds for Mexico as well.
   To detect the presence of bimodality, Figure 5 shows the percentage of workers
in each country with a “low quality job”. A low quality job is deﬁned here as having
less than 20% of the quality dimensions satisﬁed. If countries have a large number of
low quality jobs and a large number of good jobs as shown in Figures 3 and 4, then
there is a large disparity of job quality throughout the country. Low quality jobs
are distributed as expected, but there is evidence of bimodality, and thus inequality,
in job quality in Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, and Mexico. Bolivia, Guatemala,

Honduras, and Peru have a high concentration of workers with “low quality” jobs,
but that do not have “good” jobs either.
   We next look at the change in job quality over time and ﬁnd the average level
of job quality in Latin America rose over the sample period. The graph is shown
in Figure 6. This graph was constructed by controlling for country speciﬁc ﬁxed
eﬀects. After a period of stagnation observed during the decade of 1995-2004, job
quality steadily rose increasing by roughly 25% between 2004 and 2012. The growth
might have a number of explanations. The ﬁrst is that unemployment rates fell for
many countries in Latin America, resulting in more workers with a non-zero level of
job quality. In addition, the number of successes in each of the job quality dimen-
sions also grew. The largest growth came from having both retirement and health
insurance beneﬁts, and receiving an income above the poverty line. Though we do

not show the change in average job quality across time for the diﬀerent employment
sectors, the change in job quality does not seem to be associated with a substantial
structural change in the type of work. With the exception of the mining industry
which witnessed a small decline in job quality in all years, the rise in job quality was
uniformly distributed across the diﬀerent job sectors.
   The growth of good jobs across the diﬀerent countries reveals similar patterns.
Figure 7 displays the job quality trends across each of the Latin American countries
in the sample. Nicaragua is omitted since there is only one year of data. For most of
these countries, the overall trend is unambiguously positive. There is a slight decline

around 2010-2012 for a few of the countries; possibly due to the Great Recession.
The Dominican Republic and Guatemala are the only countries that have seen a
decline in job quality. Though for the Dominican Republic, this is partially due to
the change in the number of job quality dimensions, with new dimensions available
in the data, but with lower likelihood of success. To understand why job quality is
changing in these countries, we look at which factors are correlated with quality.



4     Determinants of Job Quality

    While it is useful to note the level of job quality in each country, it is more impor-
tant to understand what factors may be inﬂuencing quality. Some of the variation
in job quality might be associated with the institutional arrangements within each
country and their level of development. Likewise, many employment sectors, such
as education, tend to provide more beneﬁts compared to other sectors. However,
personal characteristics such as gender or education can inﬂuence quality as well. In
order to enact useful policies to improve job quality, we need to know which attributes
have the strongest relationship with job quality. A ﬁrst glance of the relationships
between job quality and personal characteristics are shown in Figure 8.
    In the chart, a job is “good” if over half of the dimensions are satisﬁed. Gender
appears to not inﬂuence job quality that much, though men do have higher quality
jobs on average. The biggest diﬀerences arise from the size of the ﬁrm, the formality of
the job, and the education level of the worker. While less than 22% of the individuals
who work in a small ﬁrm have a good job, a vast majority of the workers in a large or

public ﬁrm have a good job. Similar results arise when comparing workers without a
high school diploma with those that do have one. Note that workers with a high level
of education are far more likely to work in a formal job for a large ﬁrm. However,
less educated individuals are just as likely to be aﬃliated with a union, which also
results in a large increase in the probability of having a good job. However, only a
small percentage of workers in general are unionized.
   While the chart provides a good visual interpretation of the correlation between
job quality and the diﬀerent personal and job characteristics, we run the following
regression to determine the eﬀect that each variable has on quality of employment.


              JQj = α + βXj + γ1 T imej + γ2 Countryj + γ3 Sectorj +    j         (3)

   In the equation above, JQj is the level of job quality for observation j using
diﬀerent measures of job quality and X is a vector of variables that include those
shown in Figure 8. We include dummy variables for each year, country, and sector
of employment. We also control for being self-employed or an employer. Those
characteristics often result in much lower levels of job quality as workers are much
less likely to provide themselves with beneﬁts. This regression is performed using
four diﬀerent methods to test the robustness of the results. The results are shown
in Table 5.
   The ﬁrst column in the table uses job quality sum (JQS ) as the dependent variable
and is performed with an ordered logit regression. The coeﬃcients represent the
change in the log-odds ratio of satisfying an additional dimension of job quality that
results from a marginal increase in the variable. Working for a public ﬁrm results

                                         25
in the largest per-unit change to the log-odds ratio. Working for a large ﬁrm and
having a formal job provide a similarly large increase in the probability of having
success in another job quality dimension. Being a migrant worker or living in an
urban area does not greatly impact the odds, but being in a union or being educated
does. An interesting result is that the marginal impact of a college education on job
quality is small compared to a high school education. Education is one of the best
predictors of job quality and varies greatly across Latin America.
   The job quality ratio (JQR ) is used as the dependent variable in column (2), which
is performed with a standard linear regression. Columns (3) and (4) oﬀer further
robustness checks by performing logit regressions where the dependent variable is
equal to 1 when the worker has a good job, deﬁned as k ≥ 1/2 and k = 1 respectively.
All four speciﬁcations provide similar results, though our preferred model is column
(2) because JQR normalizes job quality across the countries and the regression results
are easy to interpret. Furthermore, the variables explain a larger percentage of the
variation of job quality. A high school education is expected to result in 7% more
job quality successes. Similar to the ﬁrst model, a college degree also improves job
quality, though not by as much. Likewise, working in a large ﬁrm is expected to
lead to 12.5% more job quality dimensions being satisﬁed compared to working for
a small ﬁrm.
   The variable associated with the largest impact on job quality can be found
by looking at the squared semi-partial correlation coeﬃcients listed in Table 6. The
squared semi-partial correlation coeﬃcient measures how much variation in job qual-
ity is explained by each control variable. This is found by measuring the correlation

between job quality and each control variable, after removing the eﬀects of the other
control variables. Age and gender have the largest impact on job quality. This is to
be expected since older workers are more likely to have tenure than younger workers
and have accumulated more human capital. Also, men are likely to be paid more,
and thus more likely to have a higher quality job.
     These characteristics may have diﬀerent eﬀects across the job quality dimensions.
Therefore, we run the same regression as above, except we replace job quality with an
indicator for each particular dimension of job quality. Since the dependent variables
take on values of 0 or 1, we run logit regressions. These results are shown in Table
7.

variable was included to control for whether or not the worker is in a country that
provides some form of universal health insurance. We can see that the probability
that the job provides health insurance is much lower in these countries. The regres-
sions on having health insurance (Ins), retirement beneﬁts (Ret), and a permanent
job (P erm) are all similar to the previous results. However, the coeﬃcient on being
male is considerably higher for receiving an income above the poverty line than for
all of the other regressions, indicating that being male primarily improves job quality
through its impact on income.
   The eﬀect of going to college on the log-odds ratio of obtaining tenure is actu-
ally greater than the eﬀect of graduating high school. Recall that the variable for
completing high school (Edu − High) includes those individuals that go to college
as well. The having tenure dimension also stands out because it is the only variable
negatively correlated with job formality. This is due to the agriculture sector, where
many workers have long tenures but low levels of formality. Also, while living in
an urban area is correlated with higher job quality across almost all dimensions, it
lowers the probability of obtaining tenure. This could indicate that those living in
urban locations have better labor mobility.
   Many of the variables aﬀect the dimension of having a single job in a way that
is opposite to how the other dimensions are aﬀected. Higher education or working
in a public ﬁrm tends to increase the probability of earning extra income outside of
the main job. This result could make sense if these variables signify that the worker
has a larger degree of human capital they can utilize in other occupations.

5     Relationship between Job Quality and Poverty

    Which dimensions of job quality are associated with less poverty? This question
is essential to understanding how poverty in Latin America has been and has the
potential to be reduced. In this section, the variable of interest is whether or not
the worker and his or her family is not living in poverty, P ovF am. This is found by
adjusting the total family income using 2005 PPPs and dividing by the total number
of family members in the household.
    The bar chart in Figure 9 displays the proportion of the population with access to
certain job quality dimensions that are not living in poverty. For example, over 97%
of workers that have signed an employment contract belong to non-poor families,
compared to less than 82% of workers with no contract that belong to non-poor

                                                       31
families. While success in all the dimensions results in more people living out of
poverty, the largest diﬀerence is in those workers who receive retirement beneﬁts.
Over 22% of workers who do not receive retirement live in families which are poor,
compared to approximately 3% of workers who do receive retirement beneﬁts from
their job.
   To better understand these correlations, we run a logit regression where the de-
pendent variable is an indicator that the worker’s family is not living in poverty.
The independent variables of interest are the six non-income job quality variables
deﬁned above: health insurance, retirement beneﬁts, tenure, having a contract, hav-
ing a permanent job, and having a single job. The variable for receiving an income
above the poverty line (P ov ) is dropped due to endogeneity; both P ov and P ovF am
(whether the family is living above the poverty line) are calculated from the indi-
viduals’ monthly income. The independent control variables are the same variables
that are shown in Table 5 and include age, gender, education, ﬁrm size, union and
migration status, location, time, and employment sector. The results are listed in
Table 8.
   The ﬁrst column in the table lists the results from the regression with no control
variables other than the quality dimensions, while the second column adds in all
of the other control variables. The coeﬃcients on the other control variables are
consistent with the earlier results and therefore not shown. Almost all dimensions of
job quality are positively correlated with living out of poverty. Health insurance has
the largest coeﬃcient in all of the regressions. The coeﬃcient for retirement beneﬁts
is almost as large, but it also has the largest impact on poverty of all the dimensions,

as shown by the partial correlation coeﬃcients in Table 9. Having a contract or a
permanent job are also large and signiﬁcant predictors of living above the poverty
line. Tenure and having only one job appear to have very little impact on poverty.
   As a robustness check, column 3 lists the results from the regression where missing
values are dropped from the sample instead of being coded as zeroes. All of the
coeﬃcients on the job quality dimensions are similar to the main results in column
2 except for having a single job, which is no longer negatively correlated with not
being poor.
   The relationship between job quality and poverty is explored on a country-by-
country basis in Table 10. Both tenure and having a single job are the weakest
predictors of poverty in many of the countries. The coeﬃcient on having only one
job is actually negative for most countries. The two variables with the strongest and
most consistently positive coeﬃcients are having health insurance and retirement
beneﬁts, which is what we would expect from previously reported results. It is a
toss-up as to which is a stronger predictor as it varies across the countries. Similarly,

having a contract and having a permanent job are strong predictors for almost all
countries, though weaker than either health insurance or retirement beneﬁts. Overall,
job beneﬁts are the strongest job quality predictors that a family is not living in
poverty in Latin America.



6     Robustness

    In this section we show that our results are not sensitive to changes in model
speciﬁcation or estimation strategies. Table 11 shows variations of column 2 from
Table 5, using JQR as the dependent variable. Table 12 shows variations of column 2
from Table 8, regressing the likelihood of a family being in poverty on the dimensions
of job quality along with individual controls. Each of the ﬁve columns in Tables
11 and 12 represent a diﬀerent test of robustness. The regression in column 1 of
the tables weights the observations using the speciﬁc weights for each household
from SEDLAC. Columns 2 and 3 use a diﬀerent income cutoﬀ point for determining
whether or not the individual either earns a wage or lives above the poverty line.
The $1.25/day poverty line is used in column 2, while the $4.00/day poverty line is
used in column 3, both in 2005 PPPs.
    Columns 4 and 5 use alternative job quality dimensions. The variable F tim
measures whether or not the worker is employed full time at his principal job. That
is, this variable measures underemployment, a relatively recent concept in the job
quality literature (Bescond, Chataignier and Mheran, 2003). A success in the F tim
dimension is recorded if the observation works at least 30 hours a week on average

with an alternative measure of satisfaction, (Sat). A success is recorded under this
satisfaction variable if the worker responded that they did not want to work more
hours or ﬁnd another job. In addition to the regressions shown in the tables, other
combinations of the nine possible job quality dimensions were investigated and were
found to have similar results.



                                                  37
    The results in Table 11 are consistent with the earlier results. Even though the
magnitudes of the eﬀects may diﬀer slightly, the ordering stays the same. Interest-
ing results arise from Table 12. A success in either health insurance or retirement
beneﬁts still leads to the highest probability that the worker is not living in poverty.
However, the gap between the coeﬃcients closes and retirement beneﬁts actually
surpasses health insurance in all columns. The coeﬃcient on having a single job is
still negatively correlated with not being poor. The underemployment and satisfac-
tion dimensions appear to be strongly correlated with living above the poverty line,
though less so than having health insurance and retirement beneﬁts. This is unsur-
prising since working more hours leads to higher income and a lower probability that
an individual is impoverished. Likewise, if one is impoverished it is unlikely that one
would be satisﬁed with one’s job.



7     Conclusion

    Notwithstanding the substantial social gains observed across Latin America over
the past decade, progress has been uneven and the recent economic slowdown poses
a question mark on the sustainability of these achievements. Given the importance
of labor income dynamics on lifting people above a minimum standard of living in
a sustainable way, this paper has focused on understanding the dynamics of the
quality of jobs across the region over the recent past. It proposes to look beyond
labor incomes, considering several dimensions that may constitute job quality.
    After developing a multi-dimensional measure of job quality, following the Alkire-

Foster methodology, this paper has oﬀered a benchmark analysis of quality of jobs
across Latin American and over time (1995-2012) by taking advantage of harmonized
microdata for 17 countries. In addition to labor income – approximated with labor
earnings that are high enough to keep a worker above the poverty line – the measure
considers six dimensions that denote whether the job provides beneﬁts, security,
satisfaction, and opportunities to build human capital. Overall, we ﬁnd that job
quality has been growing in Latin America since 2004. This is primarily due to
increasing wages. To better understand what factors may be inﬂuencing quality we
investigate some of the correlates of job quality. The results suggest that the best
predictors of job quality are age, gender, education, and whether the job is formal.
We also examine the relationship between job quality and poverty, and we conclude



                                                 39
that health and retirement beneﬁts are the dimensions of job quality that are best
correlated with not living in poverty, as suggested by the results. All these ﬁndings
are robust to changes in model speciﬁcation, poverty lines and estimation strategies.
   The results from this study can help shed some light on the policy areas regarding
job quality that have more potential for helping individuals work their way out
of poverty. In assessing labor policies it is useful to diﬀerentiate between those
categories of actions pertaining to ‘easy ﬁxes’ and those related to a long-run agenda
geared toward higher productivity; as it is distinguishing between policy areas related
to labor supply and labor demand factors.
   Social investments in human capital, as notably experienced in the region in
terms of education, play a critical role in terms of labor supply. The amply docu-
mented fall in labor inequality in Latin America over the last two decades has been
associated with an expansion of education in the region, which lowered the skill pre-
mium (and to a lesser degree, by more progressive government transfers) (Basu and
Stiglitz, 2015). Rodriguez-Castelan et al. (2016) oﬀer a long-term perspective of
how education levels have improved throughout countries in the region, increasing
the relative supply of labor but reducing wage dispersion driven by a fall in the col-
lege/elementary education premium coupled with an acceleration in the decline of
the high school/elementary education premium.
   Despite the recent process of education upgrading across the region, improved
labor outcomes are the result from the interaction of demand, supply and institu-
tional factors in each country. Market distortions may by preventing the creation of
productive investment leading to quality jobs. For instance, Levy and Lopez-Calva


                                          40
(2016) indicate that substantial and persistent distortions in Mexico have led to a
suboptimal allocation of resources toward less productive ﬁrms employing low-skill
workers – even as the relative supply of higher skilled workers has increased. This has
resulted in a mismatch between the demand and supply of more educated workers,
and constrained the opportunity to fully leverage the country’s investment in human
capital. Nevertheless, although access to markets is critical – allowing individuals to
realize the returns of social investments – in order to attract certain types of invest-
ment, not only are the characteristics of individuals important, but also the business
environment. A business environment that promotes technical improvements and
spurs innovation is likely to lead to a more sustainable source of high productivity
jobs.
   Previous studies have already noted key policy areas that can facilitate the role
of labor markets in allocating resources across workers and ﬁrms (see IDB, 2004).
In addition to fostering a macroeconomic environment favorable to growth, these
include improving the incentives for training to increase the skills of workers, which
in turn can enhance their opportunities. Improving the eﬃciency of the matching
process between workers and ﬁrms can help close gaps and lags between the supply
of labor and the demand from employers. Adequately insuring workers against risks
involved in job churning could help prevent vulnerable households from falling into
poverty – though as the report is quick to point out, the design of insurance (or
any other labor policy) should minimize distortions in the labor market. Finally,
enforcing regulations is assessed as critical to ensure compliance, while monitoring
labor policies can help to assess the beneﬁts and costs of labor policies.

       A central aspect in the functioning of these policies refers to their ability to elicit
voluntary compliance (World Bank, 2017). This is illustrated, for instance, regard-
ing individuals’ willingness to cooperate ﬁscally, towards insurance schemes and the
provision of public goods. Individuals may choose to ‘exit’ the social contract if
the quality of public goods and services received is poor or if coverage is too low
(choosing instead to pay for private services or network-based protection). Under
this scenario, workers could view informality more favorably, obtaining ﬂexibility –
and perhaps higher earnings – without the burden of paying for social insurance
that they will not take advantage of. Perry et al. (2007) discuss evidence of in-
formality driven by a voluntary decision to ‘opt out’ of formal work, as a result of
a cost-beneﬁt analysis evaluating non-contributory protection programs or informal
               a-vis formal – often costly – security beneﬁts6 . Universal coverage
mechanisms vis-`
schemes based on consumption taxes have been proposed to address high informality,
low productivity scenarios, where individuals work without any formal protection.
Levy (2008), for instance, suggests converting Mexico’s social security system into
one of universal social entitlements, eliminating social security contributions based
on wage, and raising value added taxes.
       Finally, an important issue to keep in mind as the region moves forward would be
to start thinking on how to mitigate the potential eﬀects on job quality of skill-biased
technical change. Such a phenomenon of quick technological upgrading (including
robotization, digital technologies, etc.) has been impacting parameters of traditional
production functions for sectors comprising occupations with high degree of routine
   6
    The other line discussed by these authors refers to the case of exclusion, whereby workers are
not opting out of formal contracts and would in fact prefer a job in the formal sector.

tasks, such as middle-skilled manufacturing, and clerical occupations (Autor, Levy
and Murnane, 2003). This process of skill-biased technical change may pose another
question mark on the sustainability of the recent progress towards enhanced quality
of jobs across the region.
