This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW

environment in other economies. Doing Business provides

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2016 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business

      the standard registration fee.

      In case the company chooses to retain incorporation agents to file for
      registration, in addition to the above documents, the application file
      must include the agents’ name and address. Note that in case the
      company wants to amend model articles of association or company

      professionals to compose incorporation documents and submit them
      via specialized software to Companies House.

      Registration is typically completed within a few hours.

      £83,000 threshold.

        The Employers’ Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act of 1969 requires all

        insurance from an approved insurance company. The minimum legal
        requirement for employers’ liability insurance is a limit of indemnity of
        GBP 5,000,000. In addition, a fine of GBP 2,500 per day can be imposed
        if employer's liability insurance is not taken out.

        that proof of insurance be posted at the workplace. Since October 1,
        2008, it is possible to display this information electronically, although a
        company that wishes to do this will need to ensure that its employees
        know how and where to find the certificate and have reasonable access
        to it.

        Obtain planning permission

        BuildCo must obtain planning permission from the local planning
        authority. In London, the decision-maker is the relevant London
        borough where the site is located. There are 33 boroughs in
        Greater London.

        The planning application must be accompanied by a plan of the
        site, drawings showing the proposed development, and any
        other information the local authority considers necessary. The
        local authority publishes a list with the information it considers
        necessary on its website, so that applicants know what is
        required of them. The relevant legislative framework is the
        Development Management Procedure Order (2010). If BuildCo is
        submitting a paper application, it must also provide at least 3
        copies of the accompanying documents. Alternatively, BuildCo
        can apply online via the Planning Portal, which accepts electronic
        planning applications on behalf of all London boroughs, using a            56 days               GBP 6,676
   1
        standard application form that was introduced across England in
        2008. If it applies electronically, no further copies are required. A
        fee is charged for the planning application, based on the amount
        of floor space that would be created by the scheme.

        The size of BuildCo's proposed development falls below the
        threshold for a “major application”, which means that the time
        frame for a decision is 8 weeks rather than 13. During this period,
        the local planning authority will publicize the application in the
        surrounding area and consult a number of statutory consultees -
        - bodies with a specialist responsibility such as nature
        conservation, heritage protection, highways -- who may wish to
        comment on the acceptability of the proposal from their
        perspective. The local authority accepts these comments and the
        comments of any local people who wish to comment on the
        application. They will be taken into account in the decision to
        grant or refuse permission. If no decision is made within 8 weeks,
        or if the authority decides to refuse permission, the applicant is

      Additionally, in April 2010, the Government introduced new
      'permitted development' rights for businesses who seek to
      extend their existing premises. This means that minor extensions,
      which would previously have required planning permission, may
      proceed without it, thereby saving time for the business owners
      and enabling the local planning authority staff to concentrate on
      larger and more important projects. In May 2013, the
      Government further extended these rights to allow for larger
      extensions of pre-existing agricultural buildings and warehouses.

      Hire an Approved Inspector

      BuildCo signs a contract with an Approved Inspector. Approved
      Inspectors (AI) are companies or individuals authorized under the
      Building Act 1984 to carry out building control work in England
      and Wales.

      An Approved Inspector will:
      • Advise BuildCo on how the building regulations apply to its
      work (to a degree)
      • Check plans for compliance with building regulations
      • Issue a planning certificate (if requested)
      • Inspect the work as it progresses
      • Issue a final completion certificate (if requested)

      The building control process was extended under the Building
      Act 1984 to include AIs as well as Local Authorities. Currently,
      there are 91 AIs on CICAIR Limited's register covering England
      and Wales, accounting for about 60% of all building control
      work. AIs are licensed by CICAIR Limited for every 5 years. A list
*2    of AIs is available from the Construction Industry Council            1 day        GBP 2,964
      website.

      Local Authorities have statutory time limits of 6 to 8 weeks for
      approving plans while AIs do not have any time limits so may
      provide a faster turnaround. By hiring AIs it eliminates need for
      companies to deal with the Building Control Department at the
      Local Authority. However, the Local Authority is still responsible
      for the enforcement of the regulations. AIs usually operate
      nationally and bring consistency of interpretation of the Building
      Regulations.
      While the planning permission (consent) is being obtained from

      Notice to the Building Control Departement of Local Authority to
      inform them that it will take responsbilty over the building
      control process. The Local Authority Building Control
      Departement has 5 days in which to reject the notice.

      If the Initial Notice is not rejected within 5 days construction
      work may begin. AI, for BuildCo's case, would conduct
      approximately 8-9 inspections at various stages of construction

      AIs are in competition with local authority building control and
      have no restrictions on how much they can charge. AI fees are
      usually lower than local authority building control who are
      covered by the Building (Local Authority Charges) Regulations
      2010 which requires local authorities to fix their charges by
      means of a scheme, full cost recovery and the fact that the user
      should pay for the actual service they receive. The cost for the
      services of AI is comprised of several elements and is mostly
      charged on a hourly rate. The below estimate is a sample of what
      an average cost breakdown by an AI looks like:

      • Plan checking: (16 hours x GDP 60) = GBP 960.00
      • Inspections: (9 sessions x 2h x GBP 60.00) = GBP 1,080.00
      • Structural checking: (2 hrs x GBP 60.00) = GBP 120.00
      • Consultations: (0.5 hrs x GBP 60) = GBP 30.00
      • Electronic/Internet drawings GBP 75.00
      • Meetings: (3.75 hrs x GBP 60.00) = GBP 225.00
      • Administrative: (0.5 hrs x GBP 60.00) = GBP 30.00
      • Inspections petrol fee: (40 miles x GBP 3.60) = GBP 144.00
      • Contingency: (5 hrs x GBP 60.00) = GBP 300.00

      Total: GBP 2,964

      Agency: Approved Inspector



      Approved Inspector files the initial notice to the Local
      Authority

      Once the contract is signed and the terms of reference are
      outlined, the builder and the AI jointly notify the local authority
      of their intention to build -- also called an initial notice. This
      initial notice will inform the Local Council that the AI has been
      retained. Once this notice has been accepted by the local
      authority, the responsibility for plan checking and site inspection
      will be formally placed on the AI.

3     The local council has 5 days to accept or reject the initial notice     5 days       no charge
      in writing (via email, fax or post). Acceptance is given by default
      if the local authority does not respond within the 5-day period.
      During that period of time, no work can be done.

      Once construction work commences, the AI would conduct at
      least 8 -- 9 inspections at various stages of construction and risk-
      based factors (for BuildCo’s case).

      to assess the physical work involved to make the connection.
      This includes a site survey, size of site gang/workforce,
      equipment and materials needed, plus any involvement with the
      local highway department as to whether there is any significant
      impact on the public road network. This element takes
      approximately 2-3 weeks.

      The contractor will then send their report to the engineer with
      the scope of work, survey and technical proposal. The engineer
      will prepare and authorize the quote and send it out to BuildCo
      within 5 days of receipt of the contractor’s report.

      Submit application to local Fire and Rescue Authority and
      obtain approval

      Approved Inspector submits (via mail) the respective elements of
      the drawing and plans pertinent to fire safety to a local Fire
      Safety Office to ensure that the building is compliant with the
      latest fire safety legislation and that the appropriate fire and life
      safety systems are in place. By law, the Fire Safety Office must
      respond within 15 business days (21 calendar days) and send its
      comments and approval. This is done as part of plan approval
      process and is recorded as an independent procedure since AI
      interacts with a Fire Officer.

      Upon the completion of the building, BuildCo used to obtain a
      Fire Certificate from Fire Safety Office. However, the Fire
      Certificate is no longer required following the reforms in the          21 days       no charge
6
      Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 (FSO 2005) which
      came into effect in October 2006, and replaced over 70 pieces of
      fire safety laws.

      The FSO applies to all non-domestic premises in England and
      Wales, including the common parts of blocks of flats and houses
      in multiple occupations (HMOs). The FSO 2005 is a tool for self-
      regulation of businesses for the fire risk of the premises.

      Under the FSO, the responsible person must carry out a fire
      safety risk assessment and implement and maintain a fire
      management plan. The companies have to carry out a risk
      assessment by completing a 5-step fire risk assessment survey
      online:

      According to this survey -- FSO 2005 the warehouse of BuildCo
      would be classified as medium risk object. Since there will be
      more than 5 people occupying/working in the building, BuildCo
      would need to file the copy of completed FSO 2005 to the local
      Fire Safety Office. BuildCo does not need to wait for the approval
      or any other consent before using the premises. This risk is with
      the building operators, as they are deemed liable for any
      problems.

      The Fire Safety Office may conduct an inspection under a risk-
      based scheme: whether there was a similar track record of
      companies with fire, or neighbors complain, etc. Small scale and
      standard objects would be seldom inspected. Also, given that
      this would be a new building it would be assumed by the Fire
      Safety Office that the latest techniques of fire safety prevention
      would have been considered during the planning process.

      Request and receive energy performance certificate from

      Following the nationwide implementation of the "Energy
      Performance of Buildings Directive" adopted, on December 16,
      2002, as of October 1, 2008 all commercial buildings whenever
      built, rented or sold require an Energy Performance Certificate.
      The certificate records how energy effcient a property is as a
      building and provides A+ to G ratings. It is the responsibilty of
      the builder/constructor to give the Energy Performance
      Certificate to the Purchaser on physical completion of the
      building and notify the local authority Building Control officers
      or approved inspectors, who will not issue a Certificate of
      Completion until the issue of an EPC has occurred.                    1 day         GBP 78

      They are produced using standard methods and assumptions
      about energy usage so that the energy effciency of one building
      can easily be compared with another building of the same type.
      This allows prospective buyers, tenants, owners, occupiers and
      purchases to see information on the energy effciency and carbon
      emissions from their building so they can consider energy
      effciency and fuel costs as part of their investment.

      An EPC always includes a recommendation report that lists cost
      effective and other measures (such as low and zero carbon
      generating systems) to improve the energy rating. A rating is
      also given showing what could be achieved if all the
      recommendations were implemented.

        The application can be submitted online, in person or by mail. The
        connection requestor has to attach with the application: completed
        application form and site drawings.

        At this stage the applicant can choose either UK Power Networks or an

      The metering industry in the UK is an open competitive market, and the
      applicant can choose their own Meter Operator or can choose to use the
      Meter Operator services provided by the electricity supplier. The
      electricity supplier normally appoints the meter operator. Requirements
      regarding the conclusion of the meter operation contract vary. The
      applicant can sign a separate contract with the chosen meter operator or
      cost can be passed on through the supply contract .
      The internal wiring must be completed by the electrician to BS7671
      standards. The electrician must carry out a full inspection and testing of
      the internal wiring and then provide a BS7671 certificate to both the
      meter operator and to the electricity distributor before the connection

      meter is installed. Inspection of internal wiring is done through a visual
      inspection by a meter operator. It is a good practice that somebody is
      present during the installation of the meter/internal wiring inspection.

      The metering must be installed before a supply of electricity can be
      provided. The electricity can start flowing on the same day the external
      connection works are finished providing the supplier and the metering

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

       Commercial Property Standard Enquiries (CPSE) are used by solicitors to
       find out details that cannot be inferred from the searches, eg. who is in
       actual occupation, how long the property has been used for its present
       use. Most solicitors use the commercial property standard enquiries
       prepared by members of the London Property Support Lawyers Group
       and endorsed by the British Property Federation. Depending on the               1-4 weeks

       would be completed in around 1 week after the results of all the

      2. Conveyancing searches, which would include:
      • Local Authority Search
      • Planning history (eg. permissions)
      • Desktop environmental search (to determine any environmental issues,
      such as flooding or contamination)
      • Public highway search
      • Chancel repair liability search (in this case the solicitor does not search
      the property itself, but the area in which the property is. If the area turns
      out to be affected by the liability to contribute to chancel repairs, then
      the property has to be insured against any future chancel repair claims.
      The amount of the insurance depends on the value of the property)
      • Other searches depending on the area, eg. coal mine shaft search or
      underground search (these issues affect the value of the property)
      3. Seller company search: to see the articles of association and what
      powers the representatives have

      For a property in London, solicitors usually request most of these
      searches through a search portal. These search portals are the one stop
      shop for most searches, and solicitors need a user name to access them.
      The search portals will pass on to the solicitor the information that they
      acquire from the relevant authorities.

      In total, these searches are usually 300 to 1000 pounds, depending on
      the number of searches requested, the amount that each local authority
      charges, and whether the solicitor requests the standard searches or is
      adding additional questions, which increase the cost. The results of the
      searches take from one day to 2-3 weeks to come back, depending on
      the search. The local authority search is the lengthiest one.

      Once satisfied with the results of the searches, the information provided
      in the standard enquiries and the title pack, the buyer's solicitor will
      prepare a report for the buyer on the title and other matters affecting
      the property.

      Drafting of contracts and exchange of contracts once agreed

      Property transactions are conducted by licensed conveyancers or
      solicitors. However, in the case of commercial properties, these
      transactions are usually conducted by solicitors. The seller's solicitor will       1 day
      prepare a draft of the contract and submit it to the purchaser's solicitor                          included in

      draft and suggest any suitable amendments. Once the two parties
      agree on the contract, contracts are exchanged. The solicitors acting for
      the buyer and seller can meet to exchange contracts, but that is rare. The
      exchange is usually done over the telephone in accordance with a
      specific formula for exchanging contracts over the phone. The most

      contract (e.g., the amount of the deposit, completion date, etc.) and
      record the time of exchange and other details. Each solicitor sends their
      client's part contract to the other solicitor in the post that day. The
      buyer's solicitor will also send a check for the deposit (usually 10% of the
      purchase price).

      Complete and lodge a Land Transaction Return and pay the Stamp
      Duty Land Tax (SDLT) (available on-line)

      The buyer's solicitor would usually prepare the Land Transaction Return
      for the approval of the buyer (as SDLT is a self-assessment tax) prior to
      completion. For every land transaction the purchaser must complete,
      sign and send the land transaction return to be received by HM Revenue
      & Customs before the end of 30 days following the effective date of the
      transaction. The return includes a self-assessment of the stamp duty land
      tax chargeable on the transaction returned. The completed Land
      Transaction Return must be sent by post to the Revenue's Rapid Data
      Capture center in Netherton (near Liverpool) or submitted electronically.
      When the Return is submitted, the correct amount of SDLT must also be                               Up to GBP
      paid either by cheque, through the CHAPS automated payment system                                  150,000: 0%

      the Certificate is typically received within one month. The issue of a Land
      Transaction Return Certificate merely evidences that a Return has been
      filed at the Revenue; issuance of a Certificate does not necessarily mean
      that the information contained within the Return and/or amount of SDLT
      paid is correct. The Certificate must be sent to the Land Registry when
      an application for registration of the transfer is made. If the buyer
      acquires the property with financing, any legal charge created by it (if it
      is a company) must be registered at Companies House within 21 days of
      its creation, failing which the charge is void against a liquidator or
      another creditor of the company.

        The buyer's solicitor drafts a Transfer Deed and sends it to the seller's
        solicitor for approval. Once approved, it is signed by the parties. The
        Transfer deed makes the transfer of the property to the buyer effective
        on completion.

        Parties register the transfer deed (and any legal charges) at the Land
        Registry by submitting the appropriate documents and paying the Land
        Registry's fees. A cheque made payable to "Land Registry" must
        accompany the application for registration to the correct office of the
        Land Registry (unless there was a prior authorized agreement with the
        Registry to pay by direct debit)
        On completion of the registration the Land Registry will send to the
        buyer's solicitor a title information document.

        The documentation shall include:
        - Completed Land Registry form AP1
        - Original and certified copy of transfer deed                                  Less than a day

        - Original and certified copy mortgage if the buyer acquires the property        (paper-based)
        with financing

        The law requires conveyancers, from 10 November 2008, when they
        submit an application to register the interest of their client in a property,
        to provide details of the conveyancers who acted for all other parties
        involved in the transaction. If any involved person (including a company)
        is not represented by a conveyancer, the person lodging the application
        must either confirm that they are satisfied that sufficient steps have been
        taken to verify the identity of the unrepresented person or otherwise
        lodge evidence of the unrepresented person's identity. If confirmation
        of identity is required for an application, but is not provided, the Land
        Registry will reject the application. Identification requirements extend to
        buyers, sellers, landlords, tenants, borrowers and lenders.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

                              BizBank will most likely apply for the administration procedure. The directors
                                  could file for administration or else BizBank could put the company into
                             administration since it has a floating charge over substantially the whole of the
                             company's property. Administration would be the most likely procedure to be
                                  chosen since it is a rescue procedure, designed to save all or part of the
                                 business. It would be more likely to preserve value for the creditors than a
Proceeding    reorganization
                              liquidation, where fire sales can depress the value of the company's property.
                             An administrator's first objective is to rescue the company as a going concern,
                               if possible. If this is not possible, his objective is to achieve a better result for
                              the company's creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company were
                                wound up, or failing that he must realize property to make a distribution to
                                                         secured or preferential creditors.

                                  The administrator will be focused on achieving the best outcome for the
                             creditors as a whole and in this case, this would be achieved by the sale of the
                                   business as a going concern. The administration moratorium provides
                                  protection for the company from various creditor enforcement actions: -
                               enforcement of security- repossession of hire-purchase goods- forfeiture by
                                landlords- commencement of legal proceedings against the company. This
                                moratorium gives the company a breathing space in which to implement a
Outcome       going concern       solution to its financial difficulties. The administrator takes over from the
                              directors in the management of the company and has broad powers to carry
                              on the business of the company so that it can continue to operate as a going
                               concern. He can enter into new contracts on behalf of the company and pay
                             the expenses of the administration in priority to all other creditors (apart from
                            fixed charge holders) so that the business can continue to operate. The hotel is
                              likely to be sold as a going concern. The administrator may continue to trade
                                         the business from administration while seeking a purchaser.

                                 The administration procedure will take approximately one year. BizBank, the
                                   company's directors (probably with BizBank's approval), or (less likely in
                               practice) the company acting on a majority resolution of its shareholders could
                                  apply for the company's administration. If BizBank puts the company into
                                administration, it would give notice of intention to appoint administrators to
                               any prior ranking qualifying floating charge holder (N.B. this can be dispensed
                                 with if BizBank is certain there are no such charge holders). 2 business days
                               later, BizBank would file a notice of appointment of administrator (and various

years)                          takes effect from the moment of this filing. If the directors/company were to
                                 appoint the administrator, they would give notice of intention to appoint to
                                  BizBank. BizBank could either consent to the director/company's choice of
                               administrator (probable since in practice the directors would probably consult
                                     BizBank on the choice of administrator) or appoint its own choice of
                                   administrator following the procedure above. Upon receiving Bizbank's
                                 consent, or after 5 business days if BizBank is silent and takes no action, the
                                  directors/company would file a notice of appointment and accompanying

                                        moment of this filing. The administrator is obliged to advertise his
                                appointment, to send notice of his appointment to all creditors of whom he is
                                aware and to give his name and the fact of the administration on all business
                                    documents issued by the company or administrator and on any company
                                                                      website.
                               The administrator would take control of the management of the company and
                                      continue to run the hotel whilst seeking a buyer for the business. The
                                 administrator's duty on any sale is to achieve fair market value at the time of
                                    the sale, although he is not obliged to wait to sell in case more favorable
                                   market conditions materialize. The administrator is not obliged to seek the
                                   creditors' consent before concluding a sale but he would likely discuss any
                                  potential sale with BizBank as the secured creditor who stands to recover its
                                 loan from the sale proceeds. Within the first 8 weeks, the administrator must
                                 send a statement of his proposals to all creditors and shareholders detailing,
                                   amongst other things, (a) how he envisages the purpose of administration
                                      will/has been achieved (in this case, sale of the business) and how the
                                  administration will be brought to an end; (b) a statement of the company's
                                     affairs; and (c) the basis upon which his remuneration will be fixed. The
                                    administrator must hold a creditors' meeting within the first 10 weeks to
                                approve his proposals. This creditors' meeting is not required if the company
                                has insufficient property to make a distribution to unsecured creditors (which
                                may be the case here), although in this situation creditors with at least 10% of
                                the total debts can order the administrator to summon a creditors' meeting if
                               they wish. The administrator would also investigate the affairs of the company,
                                in particular (a) directors' conduct to establish whether there are any grounds
                               for a potential disqualification action; and (b) recent transactions to determine
                                     whether he should apply to court to challenge any as transactions at an
                               undervalue, preferences or transactions defrauding creditors. The administrator
                                  would pay out BizBank after receiving the sale proceeds and deducting the
                                                           expenses of the administration.


                                   Major expenses include remuneration of the administrator (around 3%),

To make the data comparable across economies, several
assumptions about the worker and the business are
used.

The worker:
       Is a cashier in a supermarket or grocery store,
        age 19, with one year of work experience.
       Is a full-time employee.
       Is not a member of the labor union, unless
        membership is mandatory.
The business:
       Is a limited liability company (or the equivalent
        in the economy).
       Operates a supermarket or grocery store in the
        economy’s largest business city. For 11
        economies the data are also collected for the
        second largest business city.

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
