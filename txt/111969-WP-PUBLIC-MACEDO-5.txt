         Expenditures increased steeply in the first two months of 2014.
         The Government successfully placed two ten year bonds in January 2014.
         Credit growth continued to accelerate in January 2014 but remains subdued.


Expenditure increased steeply in the first two months of 2014. The pre-election financial report of the Ministry
Finance, published in February, revealed significant expenditure increases in key items, such as wages, pensions,
goods and services as well as subsidies. Subsidies spent in January and the first half of February amount to 56
percent of subsidies budgeted for 2014, which is in line with historical data as subsidies tend to peak prior to
elections in Macedonia. Contrary to previous elections, expenditures on wages, goods and services, and pensions
have also increased significantly. Wages have
increased by 23.4 percent relative to the same time
period last year and by 20.7 percent since
December 2014. Expenditures on pensions have
climbed by 36.9 percent (y-o-y) and 30.6 percent
since December. Pension were expected to
increase by 5 percent from March 2014 onwards.
Average monthly expenditures in Jan./Feb. 2014
have increased by 24.3 percent (y-o-y) and 19.3
percent relative to the average monthly
expenditure in 2013. In 2013, the government had
to revise the fiscal target from 3.5 percent to 3.9
percent. The fiscal target for 2014 is 3.5 percent of
GDP but given the high spending in the first two
months of 2014 this target will be difficult to
achieve.


The government successfully lengthened the
maturity of its domestic debt. At the beginning       Maturity structure of T-bills and T-bonds
                                                      as % of total
of 2013, more than two-third of domestic debt
                                                      100%
had a maturity of less or equal to 6 months. As of
                                                      90%
end 2013, only one-third of the debt was due
                                                      80%
within 6 months. In addition, more than one third
                                                      70%
of domestic debt had a maturity of two years or
                                                      60%

and pension funds. The extension of the maturity
profile was achieved as the average interest rate     40%

on domestic debt declined by 1 percentage point       30%

due to the high liquidity in the bank system. Total   20%

domestic debt issuance in 2013 amounted to EUR        10%
