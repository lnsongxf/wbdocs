THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practic e or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.

        An application can be submitted online. The following documents are
        needed with the application: Siteplan of the warehouse in scale 1:500 -
        to see how it is located to the existing electricity system, location of
        electrical fuse/switch board - to see where the cable is coming into the
        warehouse and single line diagram of the electrical fuse/switch board.
        There is no notarization needed of the documents. There is no internal
        inspection. However, the electrician who is in charge for the internal
        wiring must be qualified (having the right examination) and be approved
        by the Icelandic Construction Authority (a governmental agency
        responsible for the safety of electrical housing installation) and

        responsible for administration of law and regulations regarding Electrical
        Safety and took over these responsibilities from the Consumer Agency.
        The utility has this list and the list is renewed monthly. If the electrician
        applying for the 200A connection is not on the list, the utility refuses the
        application for connection. When a new customer applies for a new
        connection to OR's distribution system, he/she can apply for a supply
        contract with the sales department (OR) or the customer can inform the
        sales department that he/she wants to make a supply contract with
        another electricity company/supplier.

      done. If the site inspection is according to given documents, then there
      should be no waiting time until external works can start. The external
