Executive Summary

The present study was undertaken by the World Bank following a request
by the Government1 of Paraguay and has an objective to identify, quan-
tify, and prioritize agriculture risks, proposing solutions for reducing the
volatility of agriculture output and incomes of family farmers. The meth-
odology includes a two-phase process. In the first phase, risks are identified, quantified,
and prioritized from the point of view of the supply chains and from an analysis of the
public and private sector capacity to manage those risks. The second phase objective
is to define the details of the solutions to reduce the exposure to the prioritized risks,
proposing a strategy and action plan.

Given that agriculture is a key sector of the Paraguayan economy
(30 ­ percent of gross domestic product [GDP] and 40 percent of exports),
it is evident that agriculture risks have repercussions on economic
growth (and its exports), public finances, and the development of agri-
culture supply chains and rural poverty. In particular, risks related to soy and
livestock production have great importance in terms of growth and economic stability
of the country. A significant drop in production and soy exports, as happened in 2011,
has a significant impact in global economic activity, which has translated, during the
first quarter of 2012, into a drop in agriculture GDP of 28 percent and in total GDP
of 3 percent. But the study was not limited to the commodities of macroeconomic
importance; it also analyzed the supply chains and agriculture commodities that are
key from a social point of view in Paraguay, given that they involve a great number of
family farms. A particular focus was placed in risks and crops that provide employment
to the great majority of the rural population and that, to a great extent, ensure the
national food security. Therefore, in addition to soy, maize, wheat, livestock, and rice,
the following crops were included: sesame, cotton, sugar cane, cassava, and vegetables.

Paraguay losses approximately $237 million on average every year, or
5.4 percent of agriculture GDP, due to production risks that could be
managed along the main agriculture supply chains. In the years in which

Introduction
This report is the result of a World Bank mission that visited Paraguay in June 2013
at the request of the Government of Paraguay. The mission’s objective was to identify,
quantify, and prioritize agriculture risks that determine the volatility of agriculture
gross domestic product (GDP), based on a methodology to assess sector risks devel-
oped by the World Bank (see figure 1.1).

The methodology stipulates a two-phase process. The first phase (risk evaluation),
which is in volume 1 of this report, was reviewed by the government and evaluates the
current situation and perspective of agriculture sector risks, starting from the stand-
point of supply chains. From here, and based on the identification of the most impor-
tant risks, given their frequency and severity, a list of possible solutions was produced
in addition to the existing public and private programs and policies.

This process is completed with a second phase, where an action plan was prepared
(volume 2 of the current report) that could be executed in the medium term to reduce
sector risks and to contribute to the sustainability of agriculture investments. This
second phase includes the assessment of solutions, the design of a risk management
strategy, and the planning of its implementation (action plan).

During the entire process, continued consultations with public and private sector
stakeholders were held, especially with the selected supply chain actors. In order to
capture the different implications of risks to the various participants, the different
realities of the commercial and family farming were considered, taking into account
the most important commodities relevant for the different regional realities. The sig-
nificant efforts undertaken by the government to maintain support programs in critical
production and trade areas of the sector are recognized, as well as the institutional
development to strengthen the response capacity to agriculture risks.

In chapter 2 of this report, information about the agriculture sector and its recent
performance is included, allowing to determine the most important supply chains for

The Agriculture System
of Paraguay

Demographic, Geographic, and
Climatic Characteristics
Paraguay has an area of 406,752 km2 and is administratively divided in
17 ­departments, which are at the same time divided into 218 districts. Popula-
tion is 6,672,633 as of 2012,2 with an annual growth rate of 2.2 percent and
with 43 percent of the population living in rural areas. It is a country with a
high poverty rate—32.4 percent of the population in 2011, although falling since
2007, when it was 41.2 percent. Paraguay has a high level of income inequal-
ity and land tenure inequality. The richest 10 percent of the population earns
40 percent of total income, and the bottom 40 percent only 10 percent.3 Further-
more, 1.1 ­percent of the rural establishments own 80 percent of the land, and
82 ­percent of farmers (255,578), who have less than 20 hectares each, occupy
only 6 percent of the total area.

The country has a landscape that combines plains with slight hills, with the highest
elevation not reaching the 780 meters over sea level. The country is comprised of
very well differentiated regions, Eastern and Western. The Eastern Region occupies
39 percent of the land, hosts 97 percent of the population, and comprises the larg-
est part of agriculture and economic activity of the country. The Western Region
(Chaco) has the largest reserve of ecological resources of Paraguay, and the domi-
nant activity is livestock. The Paraguay River divides both natural regions, where
two types of different climates exist: the template in the east and southeast of the

Agriculture Sector Risks
The assessment of agriculture risks focused on those supply chains that are most
important from the economic and social points of view in Paraguay. For that, the mac-
roeconomic importance of the supply chains was considered, in particular in relation
with exports, and here the importance of the soy cluster (soy, maize, and wheat) and
livestock was evident (see chapter 2).

Furthermore, the supply chains that are predominantly for family farmers have great
importance given their contribution to employment and revenues for farming house-
holds that make up the majority of the rural population. The supply chains of the
most important cash products of family farming are sesame, cotton, soy, sugar cane,
cassava, and vegetables. The crops for autoconsumption such as beans occupy a rela-
tively smaller portion of their land and are exposed to similar risks as those cash crops.

In summary, the supply chains selected for this assessment were soy, maize, wheat,
rice, cassava, sesame, cotton, sugar cane, and vegetables, in addition to livestock. As a
group, these products represent 98 percent of the gross value of agriculture produc-
tion, and they occupy more than 90 percent of the cultivated area each year, as well
as with the great majority of farmers. It is assumed that the identified risks for these
supply chains are representative of the agriculture sector as a whole (see table 3.1
on commercial farming risks). The statistical appendix presents detailed information
about cultivated area and gross value of production.

Soy Cluster (Soy, Maize, Wheat,
and Sunflower)
According to the Agriculture Census of 2008, 88 percent of the cultivated area with
soy corresponded to business above 100 hectares and 62 percent was concentrated
in those above 500 hectares. Therefore, the commercial grain production in Para-
guay belongs to businesses that for international standards are relatively big, with

(*) Drought reduces yields and produces significant losses in terms of production and farmer income. Cooperatives face supply problems, which results in the increase
in per unit cost of each transaction, making it difficult to repay credit and default risk. Absorption of risks.
(+) normally applies for producers with a certain level of indebtedness, sale of animals, off-farm work, selling of land, and emigration. Faced with requests from farmers,
the government transfers resources to compensate for losses incurred.

   It is to be noted the extraordinary low yield under the last campaign (2011–
12), 9,800 kg/ha, given that in the entire historical series of cassava since 1980,      yield has been an estimation error (possible to be fixed by this year’s season
yields have never been below 12,000 kg/ha. It is likely that that unusually low          results) and not only the impact of drought, even as severe as it was.

Chapter Four
Production Loss Quantification
Agriculture risks are inherent to the nature of Paraguay, and, as seen in chapter 3,
Paraguay is exposed in an important way to production, market, and enabling envi-
ronment risks. If one also takes into account that agriculture is a key sector for the
Paraguayan economy (chapter 2), it is evident that the occurrence of risk events have
important impacts on economic growth, public financing, supply chains, domestic
markets, and food security of the vulnerable households. In particular, agriculture sec-
tor risks in Paraguay are susceptible to have an impact:
       i.  At the macroeconomic level, reducing exports and reducing economic growth
           in the short run.
      ii.  At the government level, reducing tax collection and increasing public expen-
           ditures to ­respond to compensatory measures for impacted population from
           drought and other disasters.
     iii.  In relation to the actors in the supply chain (intermediaries, exporters, co-
           operatives, producers, and so forth). it increases production costs (market
           risks), reducing profitability and producing losses, increasing indebtedness and
           reducing investments, even identifying market access.
           ­
      iv.  In relation to the domestic market, food supply disruptions.
       v.  In relation to the rural poor households affected by the domestic economy
           and putting at risk food security. All of these impacts are susceptible of being
           estimated.

Macroeconomic impacts
Changes in gross aggregate value (VAB) of the agriculture sector have not been homo-
geneous during the past years due to the incidence of weather, sanitary, and other
hazards. The agriculture and livestock behavior has been quite different reflecting the
different type of risks faced by one and the other (see graph 4.1).

At any rate, the agriculture sector is key for the performance of the overall economy. In
the country report from the IMF (2011) it reads: “. . . although Paraguay has registered
important economic swings in the past 50 years, strong and persistent contractions of
the total product have been relatively rare. In fact, the largest drop in GDP in half a

Chapter Five
Impact of Risks Along
the Supply Chains
Risks have differentiated impacts on supply chain actors, depending on the severity of
the event due to the risk exposure of each one of them and due to their initial capacity
to manage risks with mitigation, transfer, and absorption strategies. Throughout this
chapter findings are presented about how impact of the different risks are distributed
to farmers and other supply chain actors and what are the management strategies
that are used for the most common risks. Finally, relationships are established between
vulnerability and exposure/risk management.

Production Risk Management
and Impact According to the Actors
of the Supply Chain
Soy. As was seen in chapter 3, the most important risk for commercial farmers in
Paraguay are the drops in yields due to summer droughts with high temperatures. The
impacts vary according to actors. The supply chain participants that are more affected
are the farmers given that as production and income decrease significantly, their
indebtedness increases and their capacity to invest is reduced. These circumstances
can be catastrophic if two consecutive years of drought are recorded. In general, in
a drought farmers can refinance their loans with suppliers or with the banks; usually
that involves increases of 2 to 3 interest rate percentage points in dollars, although in
some cases where farmers are integrated to cooperatives, the latter finance them at the
same rates. The rest of the actors in the supply chain are affected by a reduction in
their activities (less transport, intermediation volume and services, less industrial pro-
cessing and exports), which translates in higher unit costs and a higher indebtedness
level, with the exception of some firms that have international financing. All of this
limits investments when the growth in grain production is facing bottlenecks linked to
services and infrastructure.

Maize. The impacts of early frosts and summer droughts in the various supply chain
actors are similar to soy, but in a smaller order of magnitude in percentage terms

Risk Prioritization
In tables 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 the commercial agriculture, livestock, and family farm-
ing risks of major importance are summarized respectively, identified based on their
potential to causing damage, their frequency, and the capacity of the actors to manage
them.

Appendix A
Yield and Rainfall Data Correlation
This appendix describes the process implemented for: (i) estimating meteorological
drought events through a standardized precipitation index (SPI), and (ii) calculating
the correlation between the yield variables recorded by MAG authorities and accumu-
lated rainfall data measured by meteorological stations.

Yield Data
The work included data for annual production, planted area, and yields for 39 crops at
department level: 28 of them were seasonal crops and 11 permanent crops. The database
was provided by MAG and is made up of a time series with discontinuities and with gaps
in the data. The longest time series is the one for the database of 1980–11, while the most
recent one is between 2007–11. Due to the larger concentration of data for seasonal crops
at the beginning of 1990, it was decided to exclude the data for the 1980s from the analy-
sis. Table A.1 shows the initial and final years of data considered for each crop.

Rainfall data
Monthly data was provided for 24 meteorological stations, with data from January
1960 to December 2010. Due to the fact that there was no clear reference to the begin-
ning of the operation of each of the station, it was assumed that all stations started
operating in January 1980. The range of missing data for these stations is from a mini-
mum of 0 percent to a maximum of 78.57 percent. Due to the high level of missing
data, only the stations with series with less than 75 percent of missing data was used
(1980–2010). This criteria led to the selection of 11 meteorological stations. Table A.2
shows the meteorological stations selected according to the above criteria.

Rainfall patterns
Rainfall in Paraguay shows a bimodal behavior of high values between the months of
October and March, and of low values between April and September. In spatial terms,
there is a clear variation between the regions of the country: average annual values tend
to decrease from southeast to northwest, going through an average of 1,900 mm to over
600 mm per year (DMH, ND). On the other hand, the data analysis of selected meteoro-
logical stations show standard deviations from a minimum of 34 percent to a maximum of

Note: In the case of tomato, this has a duration of approximately four months and is planted throughout the year by complementary irrigation. With the objective of
    undertaking this analysis, annual yield data were correlated with the accumulated rainfall during the agriculture year (July year 1 to July year 2).

Maize Price Volatility
Paraguay produces white maize mainly for human consumption, produced mostly by fam-
ily farmers, and red maize (yellow) mainly for export for animal consumption and industrial
use, produced by commercial farmers of different size. Family farmers produce white maize
for autoconsumption and for selling to obtain cash income. They also produce some red
maize for animal feed, although no information was found about the proportion of produc-
tion with respect to white maize. Usually the sale is local, so the price that makes it to the
family farmers is much lower than the wholesale price at the Mercado de Asunción, which
was used for this analysis. Today, yellow maize is part of the set of products that make up
the soy cluster, which, according to geographic location, includes maize, soy, wheat, and
sunflower, all cultivated in rotation and with modern technologies and capital injections.

The purpose of this analysis is to look at the variability of domestic maize prices in
Paraguay, using data from SIMA/MAG for the Mercado de Asunción—DAMA for
the period of 1993–2012. All the graphs and statistical indicators were prepared based
on data from SIMA/MAG.

Although price volatility is not foreign to the functioning of agriculture markets, it is
not free of consequences. In fact, it has a negative impact on the economy of family
farmers and on the production decision of commercial farmers. The problem can be
felt to a lesser degree now when there has been a sustained increase in international
agriculture commodity prices, but the reversal of this trend or the increase in input
prices or the appreciation of the exchange rate or other factor would make the situa-
tion unsustainable in the medium term.

The domestic maize price, both white and yellow, taking the Mercado de Asunción—
DAMA as reference, shows great variability in the past fifteen years around an increas-
ing trend in current guaranis (see graph B.1).

In white maize part of this variation can be explained by seasonal variations measured
through the stationary price index (graph B.2). The average correlation index between
the values of each month and the seasonal values is less than 50 percent. The largest
increase is observed at the beginning of the harvest in December and the lowest level

Appendix C
Market Risks and Risk Transfer:
The Case of Soy
As mentioned in chapter 3, the advantages of soy are realized from the differentials
(discounts) in relation to several future contracts in Chicago. From the information
on differentials to the FAS prices in ports in the Parana River,26 the months for the
Chicago contracts were identified in order to define the prices paid for export in FAS
conditions (May, July, August, September, November, and January).

In table C.1, the May and July contracts are presented as examples where the magni-
tude of the price27 changes can be appreciated in a single contract.

Therefore, as an example, in 2012, the one who fixed the May contract price at the soy
planting date (October 2011) defined a base price of 455 US$/ton, while the one who
fixed the month previous to the closing (April 2012) had a base price of 529 US$/ton.
The comparison of the Chicago prices for several years also shows significant variation.
For example, in the case of the May contracts, the April sales (the ones that approach
the spot prices) were done with the following values between 2008 and 2012: 483, 374,
358, 501, and 529. This compares with the lower variability of those who obtained
future price coverage at the moment of planting in October (371, 351, 355, 435,
and 455).

All these variations show that those who have the capacity to buy price hedges and for
selecting sales period, have significant advantages to limit the impact of price varia-
tions, especially in terms of the input-output price relation for each agriculture sea-
son. Without a doubt, small farmers are the ones with less capacity to transfer risks
through futures. Large cooperatives, exporters, and so forth can hedge themselves
against international price volatility. See the soy futures price comparison in graph C.1

  In Chicago, these contracts are negotiated with several years’ anticipation, but here we only take some months pre-
vious to the commercial cycle given that it is expected that producers and buyers fix the majority of their operations
during the months near but previous to the dates in those contracts.

Introduction
The World Bank, at the request of the Ministry of Agriculture and Live-
stock (MAG), has been undertaking an assessment of agriculture sector
risks in Paraguay. The methodology used includes a two stage process. the first
stage, risk evaluation, involved one mission in June 2013, when the most important
agriculture risks were identified, quantified, and prioritized in terms of their impact
on sector product volatility. As a result, and considering the most important risks given
their frequency and severity, a series of possible additional solutions to the ones already
undertaken by the various public policies and programs were identified. This is con-
tained in volume 1 of the current report.

This volume (2) presents the results of the second phase of the sector
risk assessment, which addresses the proposal for solutions. In November
2013, the results in volume 1 were presented to the MAG, remembering the need to
continue the process to arrive at a strategy and action plan. Therefore, the team pro-
ceeded to the second phase to evaluate some of the proposed solutions and prepared
an agriculture risk management strategy and action plan. With this objective, at the
request of the Government of Paraguay (GOP), a second mission visited Paraguay
in March–April 2014. This volume 2 is the result of said mission. In figure 1.1 the
process is detailed.

Agriculture Risk Management
Framework for Paraguay

Priority Risks28
Agriculture gross domestic product (GDP) in Paraguay is much more
volatile than total GDP or than other non-agriculture sectors according
to a study by the World Bank.29 Agriculture GDP has varied 12 percentage points
since the first quarter of 1994, which compares to 4.7 percentage points of variation
of total GDP. The differences in volatility between the agriculture sector and the rest
of the economy have increased in the past years due to very severe risk events on crops
and livestock. Furthermore, shocks to the agriculture sector also impact other sectors
of the economy and cause them to also be volatile in part. The most affected activi-
ties are input provision such as machinery, storage, and transport, but also sectors like
construction and financial services who suffer from agriculture shocks.

Production risks are the most frequent and with greater impact on the agriculture sector of
Paraguay, in particular drought. It is estimated that Paraguay losses on average $237 mil-
lion every year in production losses or 5 percent of agriculture GDP (1990–2001). The
most notable risk given its global magnitude of losses reported in the past is drought.
In 2011, the last year when an important drought was recorded, $920 million were lost
only in soy. Family farming crops also suffered significant losses: cassava, $94 million or
38 ­percent of VBP; sesame, $13 million or 46 percent of VBP; cotton, $3 million or
26 ­percent of VBP. A significant decline in production and exports of soy produces a
notable impact on global economic activity and aggregate demand, as it occurred in
recent years, but a reduction in food availability among family farmers has a direct impact
on food security, leading to requests for assistance and could lead to social instability.

Pests and diseases also present important risks to production, although
they are generally controlled with chemicals and resistant varieties. But the main

Agriculture Risk Management
Strategy

Full Proposal
The proposed strategy intends to tackle in an integrated way the causes of
agriculture and livestock risk. the risks that have been realized have important
impacts in economic growth, public finances, the economy of supply chain actors and
food security of the most vulnerable sectors. With respect to weather risks, mainly drought,
actions are proposed in various dimensions, and other risks have their own actions. Proposed
actions for family farming have an impact for all production and market risks they face.

Therefore, risk mitigation at the level of the most vulnerable sectors
(family farming), is proposed to be addressed through the development
of a more efficient and coordinated Agriculture Innovation System, in
order to address the technology and market problems that places family farming in an
extremely vulnerable situation with respect to production risks.

It is expected that the optimization of agriculture insurance will have
positive effects for family farming and other agriculture segments. The
improvement of the information and monitoring systems, as well as the development
of risk transfer and absorption mechanisms for family farming (contingency fund and
index insurance) are especially considered.

With respect to animal health risks, the strategy includes measures to
protect export markets but also improve local sanitary conditions and
food safety. For livestock, risks that have become a great threat for producers of all
sizes and for the economy as a whole, a series of measures are proposed with SEN-
ACSA at its center, addressing FMD and other important diseases for meat exports
and national production. The strategy, however, does not end at the requirement of
the external sector, but also at the consequences of a deficient food safety situation for
the health of Paraguayans (slaughterhouses for internal consumption with no sanitary
regulations for example), proposing a series of actions throughout the livestock supply
chains and involving several levels of government.
