Summary

u	Economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa is projected to recover to 2.6 percent in 2017, following a
   marked deceleration in 2016. The upturn in economic activity is expected to continue in 2018-19,
   reflecting improvements in commodity prices, a pickup in global growth, and more supportive
   domestic conditions.
u	The pace of the recovery is weak, however, as the region’s three largest economies—Angola,
   Nigeria, and South Africa—are projected to post only a modest rebound in growth following a sharp
   slowdown in 2016. Investment growth will recover only gradually, amid tight foreign exchange
   liquidity conditions in major oil exporters and low investor confidence in South Africa. Growth will
   be limited in several metals exporters, as well as in oil exporters in the Central African Economic and
   Monetary Community, as these countries embark on fiscal adjustment to stabilize their economies.
   Among non-resource intensive countries, such as Ethiopia, Senegal, and Tanzania, growth is expected
   to remain generally solid, supported by domestic demand.
u	Regional growth remains insufficient to raise per capita incomes. Per capita gross domestic product
   (GDP) is projected to contract by 0.1 percent in 2017, before rising moderately (by less than 1.0
   percent a year) in 2018-19.
u	With still high poverty rates, the region is faced with the urgent need to regain the momentum
   in growth and make it more inclusive. This will require deep reforms to improve institutions for
   private sector growth, develop local capital markets, improve the quantity and quality of public
   infrastructure, enhance the efficiency of utilities, and strengthen domestic resource mobilization.
u	Public debt levels are rising in the region. In an environment of gradual normalization of monetary
   policies in advanced economies, many African countries face the challenge of undertaking much-
   needed development spending without jeopardizing hard-won debt sustainability.
u	 Downside    risks to the regional outlook include, externally, stronger than expected tightening
   of global financing conditions, weaker improvements in commodity prices, and the threat of
   protectionism rising from populist sentiment, and, domestically, slippage on reforms, increasing
   security threats, and political uncertainty ahead of elections in some countries.
u	 The  special topic of this report is infrastructure. Sub-Saharan Africa lags other developing regions
   in virtually all dimensions of infrastructure performance, although trends vary across key sectors.
   Progress has been inadequate in the power sector, where electricity-generating capacity per capita
   has changed little over 20 years, and although access to electricity more than doubled during
   1990–2014, only 35 percent of the population has access. Sub-Saharan Africa also has the lowest
   road and railroad densities among developing regions, and road density declined during 1990–2011.
   By contrast, telecommunications infrastructure has improved dramatically: the number of fixed and
   mobile phone lines per 1,000 people increased from three in 1990 to 736 in 2014, and the number of
   Internet users per 100 people increased from 1.3 in 2005 to 16.7 in 2015. Access to safe water has also
   risen, from 51 percent of the population in 1990 to 77 percent in 2015.

               u	 The  growth benefits of closing Sub-Saharan Africa’s infrastructure quantity and quality gaps are
                   potentially large. Catching up to the median of the rest of the developing world would increase
                   growth in GDP per capita by 1.7 percentage points per year, and closing the gap relative to the
                   best performers would lift this growth by 2.6 percentage points per year. Closing the gap in
                   electricity–generating capacity yields the largest potential benefit, and substantial gains also arise
                   from narrowing the gap in the length of the road network.
               u	 Public  capital spending levels are too low to address the region’s infrastructure needs. According
                   to data collected by the BOOST initiative for 24 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, annual public
                   spending on infrastructure was 2 percent of GDP in 2009–15. Two-thirds of total capital spending
                   was on roads and about one-sixth each on electricity and water supply and sanitation. Interest
                   is growing in crowding-in private investment in infrastructure, but public-private partnerships
                   remain a small market in Sub-Saharan Africa. Four countries (South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, and
                   Uganda) account for 48 percent of the public-private partnership infrastructure projects in the
                   region in the past 25 years. The energy sector, especially renewables, is attracting an increasing
                   share of these projects.
               u	 A  robust institutional and regulatory framework is critical in attracting private investment for
                   infrastructure projects. Evidence shows that Sub-Saharan Africa performs below the global
                   average in the regulatory frameworks for procurement in public-private partnerships, especially in
                   project preparation.
               u	 The   impact of public investment on growth can be enhanced by implementing policies that
                   foster the efficiency of public investment. For instance, improving the institutions and procedures
                   governing project appraisal, selection, and monitoring can render considerable economic
                   dividends. Evidence suggests that countries with sound public investment management
                   systems tend to have lower but more efficient levels of public investment, crowd in more private
                   investment, and exhibit higher growth rates.

Section 1: Recent Developments and Trends
GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS
Global economic conditions are improving, following a year of depressed economic activity. The
global economic recovery is strengthening, supported by a continued upturn in manufacturing
activity. In January, global industrial production increased at an annualized rate of nearly 6 percent,
the strongest pace in five years. Activity accelerated in the Euro Area, Japan, China, and India, while
moderating somewhat in the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Russian Federation. The global
manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) improved further in February, while the services PMI
remained high. Following four consecutive months of small gains, global (median) inflation rose sharply
in January, to about 2.3 percent year-over-year—the highest level since end-2014. The uptick reflected
the delayed impact of rising energy prices in 2016. Global goods trade rebounded strongly in the fourth
quarter of 2016. This improvement coincided with signs of a bottoming out in global investment growth,
which tends to be more trade intensive than other components of aggregate demand. Global export
orders point to further improvements in the coming quarters.

Global financing conditions have been favorable since the start of 2017. Financial markets have
continued to focus on the prospects of strengthening global growth, while discounting elevated levels
of policy uncertainty. Implied volatility in the equity and bond markets remains well below historical
averages. The decision by the Federal Reserve to raise rates was expected, and markets reacted positively,
with bond yields and the U.S. dollar declining somewhat, and global equity markets remaining buoyant.
The European Central Bank kept its stance unchanged, but confirmed that it would begin scaling back
its asset purchases in April. Supported by continued monetary policy accommodation, Euro Area bond
yields remain exceptionally low.

Financial markets in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) have continued to rebound,
supported by the increased risk appetite of international investors, some improvement in growth
prospects, and more stable credit ratings among commodity exporters. Accordingly, capital inflows
to EMDE bond and equity mutual funds remained firm in March, while international debt issuance
increased strongly from January to March. Recent bond issuances by the Arab Republic of Egypt, Nigeria,
Oman, and Kuwait attracted strong demand. Bond spreads are currently around 300 basis points, which
is lower than the pre-U.S. election levels. Excluding the República Bolivariana de Venezuela, Emerging
Market Bond Index spreads are now back to mid-2014 levels.

Commodity prices have firmed. Crude oil price jumped 8 percent in the first quarter of 2017 averaging
nearly $53/bbl. Prices dropped below $50/bbl in the second week of March due to concerns over
compliance of the OPEC/non-OPEC cuts, larger-than-expected U.S. crude oil inventories, and robust
recovery in U.S. shale oil activity. But, they recovered to $54/bbl in early April, on renewed expectations
of tightening supply. However, rebalancing is under way as the global oil market is expected to tighten
in the second half of the year. Meanwhile, metal prices, which made some further gains in 2017Q1 on
stronger demand from China and some supply tightness are now 35 percent higher than their 2015Q4
lows. Agricultural prices have been broadly stable on favorable growing conditions in most regions.

                      Modestly rising commodity prices, a cyclical rebound in investment, and export growth are supporting
                      a gradual recovery in commodity-exporting EMDEs. Among commodity-importing EMDEs, growth
                      continues to be robust, as a gradual deceleration in China is offset by the rest of the group.

                      Economic Growth

                      Economic activity decelerated sharply in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2016 to an estimated 1.3 percent growth,
                      its worst outcome in more than two decades. This low growth rate was driven mainly by unfavorable
                      external developments, with commodity prices remaining low, and difficult domestic conditions.
                      Angola, Nigeria, and South Africa experienced a marked slowdown in economic activity. A decline in
                      oil production halted economic growth in Angola. In Nigeria, gross domestic product (GDP) contracted
                      by 1.5 percent amid tight liquidity conditions, budget implementation delays, and militant attacks on
                      oil pipelines. Growth in South Africa weakened to 0.3 percent, reflecting contractions in the mining and
                      manufacturing sectors and the effects of the drought on agriculture. Excluding these three countries,
                      growth in the region was estimated to be 4.1 percent in 2016.

                      Other oil exporters struggled to cope with a large terms-of-trade shock, as activity contracted sharply.
                      Metals exporters fared relatively better, as they benefitted from the large drop in oil prices. Nonetheless,
                      output levels and investments in the mining sector were also hit hard and budgetary revenues fell. Average

growth among the non-resource-intensive countries remained high in 2016, reflecting their more diversified
economies. Growth in these countries was partly supported by scaled-up public infrastructure investment.

Sub-Saharan Africa is seeing a recovery of growth in 2017. Rising commodity prices, strengthening
external demand, and the end of the drought in several countries are among the factors contributing
to the rebound. Prices of most commodities continued to rise in early 2017, from their lows in early
2016 (figure 1.2). The oil price increase in 2017Q1 reflects steady demand growth and the agreement
between some OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers to limit output. However, persistently high global
oil inventories along with an improved supply outlook by the in the U.S. shale oil sector, impose
constraints in the longer term price outlook of oil prices. Metals prices are strengthening, partly
reflecting increased demand from China. Meanwhile, above-average rainfalls are boosting agricultural
production in countries that were hit by the El Niño–related drought in 2016 (South Africa, Malawi).
Security threats subsided in
several countries. In Nigeria,

Several factors are preventing a more rigorous recovery in the region. In Angola and Nigeria, restrictions
on access to foreign exchange continue. Although the Central Bank of Nigeria and the National Bank of
Angola have recently increased the sales of foreign exchange in the interbank markets, foreign exchange
liquidity conditions remain tight, and are holding back activity in the non-oil sectors. The manufacturing
and services sectors remain particularly weak in both countries. In South Africa, policy uncertainty and
low business confidence continue to constrain investment. Unemployment remains very high. The
recent (April 2017) downgrade of the country’s credit rating to sub-investment level by Standard and
Poor’s and Fitch is likely to weigh on the country’s economic prospects (box 1.1).

Elsewhere in the region, several oil exporters in the Central African Economic and Monetary Community
(CEMAC) are facing difficult economic conditions. The contraction of activity that began in the oil
sector in Chad, Equatorial Guinea, and the Republic of Congo has spread to the rest of the economy.
Although the economies of Cameroon and Gabon have not contracted—due in part to their relatively
more diversified exports—activity has slowed notably and oil production continues to decline. Having
delayed the adjustment to lower oil revenues, CEMAC countries are now embarking on fiscal tightening
to stabilize their economies. In Chad, the ongoing fiscal adjustment has entailed significant reductions in
recurrent and capital expenditures, which weakened domestic demand. Elsewhere, in Mozambique, the
recent government default and debt burden are deterring investment. The drought in East Africa, which
reduced agricultural production at the end of 2016, has continued into 2017, adversely affecting activity
in some countries (for example, Kenya) and contributing to food insecurity in others (Somalia, South
Sudan) (box 1.2).

   unusually large number of countries announcing significant drops in the levels of crop production,                    Famine
   especially of staples, at the same time. For example, maize production in 2015/16 in the 15 member
   countries of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) fell by an average of 19 percent
   compared with the 2014/15 maize season. Similarly, in Eastern Africa, severe crop and livestock
   production losses were reported, especially in the Horn of Africa. The drought also led to power
   disruption, depressed economic activity, and increased poverty. Drought-induced declines in maize were
   estimated to reduce gross domestic product in the SADC area by 0.1 percentage point, and increase
   poverty by 1.4 million people. This particular drought is blamed on one of the strongest El Niño (and
   sister phase La Niña) effects in memory.

   That said, droughts need not lead to famines. Rather, famines occur when households with depleted
   own resources are unable to access food because of public (government or community) inaction or
   willful neglect. Public inaction may be due to lack of financial resources or bureaucratic capacity to
   deliver needed food to the affected population. However, it could also be due to toxic politics that trigger
   conflicts or neglect the suffering of supporters of political opponents. In short, famines are almost always
   due to government failure. In early 2017, a famine was declared in South Sudan by the United Nations,
   and a pre-famine alert was issued for Somalia; there is a food crisis in northeast Nigeria (map B1.2.1).

   Whatever the cause of famine may be, it leaves scars in the short and long terms. The most painful short-
   term consequence of famine is increased mortality, which results from a sustained period of increased food
   insecurity, a time when affected populations, especially children, are deprived of basic nutrition for months.

BOX 1.2         MAP: B1.2.1: Conflict Leads to Food Insecurity and Complicates Response
Continued




                An estimated 260,000 people died from the 2010/11 famine in the Horn of Africa. In 2016, an estimated
                250,000 South Sudanese children under the age of 5 were estimated to suffer from severe acute malnutrition.

                An equally visible consequence of famine is forced displacement. Displacement may be a natural response
                by affected populations to move to “security” (where food and physical protection are available) or flee
                the environment that is threatening their lives. For instance, it is not uncommon that, during severe
                droughts, one group of herders competes for pasture and water with another, during which conflict and
                displacement ensue. Prices are also likely to spike, make food unaffordable, and exacerbate malnutrition.
                Although not immediately obvious, the long-term consequences of famines, especially on human capital,
                have been shown to be serious. Epidemiological studies of famine-affected populations have shown that
                famines cause psychological disorders, obesity, glucose intolerance, and blindness due to deprivation
                of vitamin A. Other studies that look at the impact of in-utero exposure to famines show that they lead
                to lower height, which has been shown to be a good indicator of long-term health and educational
                outcomes. These disadvantages in human capital, in turn, have led to lower prospects in the labor
                market—lower productivity, lower wages and earnings, and higher poverty.

                As past and recent outbreaks of famine have shown, a reduction in conflict will almost certainly lead to
                fewer future famines. In addition, automatic stabilizers, such as safety net programs, which could be scaled
                up in the event of severe droughts, are necessary even for poor countries. Functioning markets are just as
                necessary, to provide price stability and affordability and accessibility to food.

                Finally, even under conditions where conflict is absent, markets work, and safety net programs exist, the ability
                and efficiency with which to prevent famine for many countries is hamstrung by nonexistent or unreliable
                data. Therefore, building a credible early warning system is crucial to prevent future famines. Such a system
                would include data on living conditions, vulnerability, and livelihoods that are collected by national statistical
                offices and geospatial and satellite-based remote sensing data, and capacity to analyze and forecast. Cheap
                early warning systems in this age of the digital revolution are affordable and transformational for many poor
                countries. However, to take full advantage of these technologies to prevent famine, most poor countries are
                better served by investing in centers that receive satellite imagery from the multiple satellites that circle the
                African skies, and building the capacity to analyze such images to forecast crop failures and droughts.

Annex 1A examines the behavior of growth, capital accumulation, and productivity after a commodity
price plunge. Overall, the analysis finds that vulnerability to shocks represents a substantial cost in output
and productivity for countries in the region. The challenge for resource-abundant countries is to go
beyond capital accumulation, to formulating policies to boost productivity and the efficient allocation of
resources within and across industries.

Current Account Deficits and Financing

The current account balances of oil exporters are improving, helped by the pickup in commodity prices
(figure 1.3). Oil exports are rebounding in Nigeria on the back of an uptick in oil production. In metal
exporters, the positive impact of an improvement in metals prices is being offset by a rise in investment-
related imports. Current account deficits remain high in several non-resource-rich countries (including
Rwanda and Uganda). In these countries, capital goods imports have also been strong, reflecting
ambitious public investment
agendas. Capital inflows in the
region are rebounding from their           FIGURE 1.3: Current Account Balance                                                                                                                          The current

                      The rebound in commodity prices and improved growth prospects in some countries have helped stabilize
                      commodity exporter currencies (figure 1.5, panel a). However, with the Nigerian naira and Angolan kwanza
                      remaining fixed against the U.S. dollar, the imbalance in the foreign exchange market remains substantial
                      in both countries. Among metals exporters, the Congolese franc depreciated sharply against the U.S. dollar
                      in the second half of 2016, with weakness continuing in 2017, reflecting heightened political uncertainty as
                      well as loss of foreign reserves in the Democratic Republic of Congo. A debt crisis in Mozambique sharply
                      lowered the value of the metical against the U.S. dollar in the second half of 2016, and the currency remains
                      weak. Annex 1B explores foreign exchange market pressures in Sub-Saharan Africa.

                      metals exporters, because of greater currency stability and lower food prices due to improved weather
                      conditions (Namibia, Zambia). In Mozambique, inflation was in high double digits in February. In non-
                      resource-intensive countries, inflationary pressures have picked up in East Africa, as the drought led to an
                      increase in food prices—notably in Kenya. However, in countries where the drought has been less severe,
                      inflation has remained within the central banks’ targets. Inflation continues to be low in most CEMAC
                      and WAEMU countries, reflecting the stable peg to the euro. The low inflation environment in Tanzania,
                      Uganda, and Zambia allowed their central banks to cut interest rates at the start of the year. Bank of
                      Ghana also cut its policy rate. Although inflation in Ghana remains in double digits, it has narrowed from
                      over 19 percent in 2016, to around 13 percent in January.

1.6). The fiscal balances of
non-resource-intensive
countries worsened in 2016, reflecting elevated investment spending levels. Widening fiscal deficits
and, in some cases, sizable exchange rate depreciations have resulted in rising public debt levels
in the region. Large non-concessional borrowing for infrastructure development has led to high
debt servicing costs in several countries. South Africa’s 2017/18 budget reaffirms the government’s
commitment to fiscal consolidation, with the introduction of a new personal income tax bracket to
mobilize additional revenue. It remains to be seen whether the stance of fiscal policy will be affected
by political developments. Among oil exporters, Angola’s 2017 budget targets a stable fiscal deficit, but
the risks of large expenditure overruns in the run-up to the election this year remain high. In Nigeria, the
government plans to increase infrastructure spending, financed in part through borrowing. Elsewhere,
Ghana’s 2017 budget signaled a slowdown in fiscal consolidation, which could increase fiscal risks,
given limited fiscal space. Mozambique’s budget points to a moderate increase in spending. Reflecting
the continued weakness of fiscal balances, caused by the fall in commodity prices and the continued
upward trend in government debt, the region’s rating outlook in 2017 remains negative.

Financial Risks

Banking sector vulnerabilities remain elevated in the region, including in Angola, CEMAC countries,
the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Nigeria. Foreign exchange restrictions, policy uncertainty,
and weak growth have affected the soundness of the banking sector. Non-performing loans have
increased, and profitability and capital buffers have decreased. Several proactive measures have been
introduced to contain risks to financial stability, including through increased provisioning and by
intensifying the monitoring and supervision of banks. While banking system resilience needs to be
strengthened, steps by banks to limit credit risks, by tightening lending standards and reducing credit
to the private sector while continuing to invest in government securities, are contributing to the slow
recovery in economic activity.

                  Outlook

                  Growth in Sub-Saharan Africa is forecast to pick up to 2.6 percent in 2017, rising to 3.2 percent in 2018
                  and 3.5 percent in 2019 (figure 1.7). The turnaround is predicated on the projected rise in commodity
                  prices (box 1.3) and policy actions to tackle still-large macroeconomic imbalances in several countries.
                  The forecasts are weaker than those in October, reflecting a more moderate recovery among metals
                  exporters and a muted recovery in growth in South Africa. Non-resource-intensive countries are
                  expected to continue to expand at a solid pace. Overall, growth is projected to rise only slightly above
                  population growth, a pace that is largely insufficient for creating employment and supporting poverty
                  reduction efforts in the region.

                  •	 Growth in South Africa is projected to recover to around 0.6 percent in 2017, rising to 1.1 percent

                            sector will be constrained by foreign exchange restrictions and high inflation. The subdued outlook
                            for Angola, Nigeria, and South Africa implies that per capita output will decline in these countries
                            over the forecast horizon.
                  •	 Growth will be weaker than previously projected in the CEMAC area, as oil production increases at
                            a slower pace than previously projected, due to maturing oil fields in several countries, and fiscal
                            adjustment reduces public investment. In metals exporters, high inflation and tight fiscal policy will
                            be a greater drag on activity than previously expected in several countries.
                  •	 Growth in non-resource-intensive countries should remain robust, based on infrastructure
                            investments, buoyant services sectors, and the recovery of agricultural production. Ethiopia and
                            Tanzania in East Africa, and Côte d’Ivoire and Senegal in WAEMU will expand at a solid pace, although
                            some of these countries may not reach the high growth rates of the recent past. Growth is projected
                            to strengthen in Ghana, as increased oil production boosts exports.

   According to the World Bank’s Commodity Markets Outlook, oil prices are expected to average $55/barrel            BOX 1.3:
                                                                                                                     Commodity
   in 2017, up 28 percent from 2016, as the stock overhang is expected to unwind during the second half
                                                                                                                     Markets
   of 2017. Oil prices are projected to average $60/barrel in 2018. There are considerable risks (especially         Outlook
   downside) to the oil price forecast. Key among them is the resilience of the U.S. shale oil industry. Indeed,
   the U.S. Energy Information Agency reported higher than expected output in its March report, which
   was the key cause of the weakening in oil prices in March. On the upside, disruptions among politically
   stressed producers (Iraq, Libya, and Nigeria) or an extension of OPEC cuts into 2018 could exert upward
   pressure on prices.
   Average annual prices of metals and minerals, which declined 6 percent in 2016, are projected to rise 11
   percent in 2017 and 1 percent in 2018. Price forecasts have been increased since January due to stronger
   than envisioned demand in China and some unexpected supply constraints.
   Agricultural prices are projected to remain broadly stable in 2017 and 2018. The stock-to-use ratios of
   the three key grains (maize, rice, and wheat) have reached 15-year highs, while supplies of other food
   commodities (such as edible oils) are adequate. Since agricultural production is energy intensive, lower
   costs due to lower energy prices (compared with pre-2015 levels) continue to have a dampening effect
   on grain and oilseed prices in 2017. In addition, lower energy prices reduce the incentive to divert land
   use away from food to biofuel commodities.



Underlying the outlook, lower inflation is expected across most of the region. The recovery of agricultural
production, following the end of the drought, will help reduce food price inflation in several countries,
including South Africa. Reduced inflation will allow central banks to loosen monetary policy. However,
inflation is expected to remain elevated in Angola and Nigeria throughout the forecast horizon, reflecting
limited adjustment in the foreign exchange market. Drought conditions remain in parts of East Africa—
notably Kenya—and will exert pressures on inflation in these countries this year. Fiscal and current account
deficits are expected to improve somewhat for commodity exporters, helped by the continued recovery of
oil and metals prices and some reduction in fiscal spending. In non-resource-intensive countries, the fiscal
and current account positions are likely to remain under pressure as countries struggle to strike a balance
between the need for fiscal consolidation (Kenya, WAEMU) and public infrastructure investment spending.

Growth Resilience Revisited

Overall, the difficult economic conditions facing African countries in 2015 and 2016 have taken their
toll on the economic resilience of the region. In the October 2016 issue of Africa’s Pulse, 45 Sub-Saharan
African countries were categorized into four groups based on the comparison of their average annual
GDP growth rates during 1995–2008 and 2014–16. We revisit the categorization by using growth rates
for 2015–17. This more recent period better captures the resiliency of countries to the commodity
shock and difficult economic conditions and to the adequacy of policy response. The thresholds used
to classify the countries remain the same: top and bottom terciles of the average annual growth rate of
the 45 countries between 1995 and 2008—that is, 5.4 and 3.5 percent, respectively. The latest data reveal
that only seven countries are seeing growth rates above 5.4 percent in 2015–17. The seven countries
exhibiting resilience are Côte d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Rwanda, Senegal, and Tanzania (figure 1.8).
These countries house nearly 27 percent of the region’s population and account for 13 percent of the
region’s total GDP.

                    Several countries that were resilient in our earlier analysis are less so now: Benin, Cameroon, the
                    Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, and Togo. Mozambique’s growth trajectory has been
                    derailed by the rapid deterioration of the country’s debt position, which has eroded investor confidence,
                    sharply depreciated the currency, and prompted a tightening of monetary and fiscal policy. The
                    deceleration in growth in the Democratic Republic of Congo reflects declining mining production
                    and a fall in investment spending, combined with domestic political uncertainty. An additional seven
                    countries, most of them resource-abundant countries (the Republic of Congo, Gabon, Mauritania, and
                    Zambia), have moved into the slipping or falling behind category.

                    Resilient countries tend to enjoy robust and broad-based growth. Our previous analysis found that
                    these countries generally have better macroeconomic management, and recent evidence continues
                    to support this finding. These countries have managed to contain non-priority spending and mobilize
                    domestic revenue, building fiscal space for investment and social spending. The size of debt relative to
                    GDP is lower for this group of countries (averaging about 40 percent in 2016) compared with that of


 20     >    A F R I C A’ S P U L S E
other countries in the region (54 percent). Inflation rates in resilient countries are lower than in other
countries in the region, averaging 4 percent and 5.8 percent, respectively, in 2015–16.

Risks
The economic outlook for the region is subject to significant downside risks, including the following on
the external front:
•	 In Sub-Saharan Africa, sovereign bond issuance has become a key financing strategy in recent years,
  as countries have looked to global financial markets to facilitate domestic investment. Higher global
  interest rates could narrow the scope for this financing. Sustained increases in global interest rates
  could reduce the ability of governments in the region to raise this level of finance.
•	 Weakening of growth in advanced economies or emerging markets could reduce demand for exports,
  depress commodity prices, and curtail foreign direct investment in mining and infrastructure. Oil and
  metals exporters are particularly vulnerable to this risk, given their less diversified economies.
•	 The change in government in the United States following the elections in November 2016 is not
  expected to have major effects in the region. However, there is a risk that the United States will cut
  back official development assistance. This will hurt the region’s smaller economies and fragile states,
  which have strong economic ties with the United States.

Risks on the domestic front include the following:

•	 In countries where significant fiscal adjustments are needed, especially in CEMAC countries, failure to
  implement appropriate policies could weaken macroeconomic stability and slow the recovery.
•	 Worsening security, drought conditions, or political uncertainty ahead of key elections pose risks to
  the outlook for some countries, including Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa.

Challenges
The region faces a myriad of challenges to regaining the momentum on growth. Addressing these
challenges will require deep reforms to improve institutions for private sector growth, develop local
capital markets, improve the quantity and quality of public infrastructure, enhance the efficiency of
utilities, and strengthen domestic resource mobilization. In this report, we spotlight a few pressing
challenges that several African countries are facing: a slowdown in investment, still high trade logistics
costs that impede competitiveness and export diversification, and rising debt levels.

Slowdown in Investment

The low growth in Sub-Saharan Africa is reflected in part in the investment growth slowdown the
region has experienced. Investment growth in the region slowed from nearly 8 percent in 2014 to 0.6
percent in 2015, well below the long-term (1990–2008) average of about 6 percent and the fast-paced
growth of 11.6 during 2003–08 (figure 1.9). The sharp drop in investment growth in 2015 is evident
across public and private investment. The deceleration in investment growth has pulled down the share
of investment in GDP by 1.05 percentage points, reversing the cumulative gains in this measure over
the three previous years.

                      Given the large investment needs of the region, increasing public investment will be a priority. Public
                      investment directly boosts overall investment in the economy and can foster private investment. But few
                      countries in the region are well positioned to ramp up public investment. Most countries have little fiscal
                      space to increase public investment, because of their high debt-to-GDP ratios and the need for fiscal
                      consolidation. External financing conditions have tightened with increased uncertainty in the United
                      States and Europe, which makes tapping debt markets increasingly difficult and risky. At the same time,
                      in many countries, low tax revenues, weak banking systems, and underdeveloped capital markets limit
                      the share of domestic resources that can be allocated to public investment. In low-income countries,
                      regulatory and implementation capacity constraints are key obstacles to scaling up public investment in
                      infrastructure.

                      Four key areas of policy priorities to address investment needs and ensure sustainable financing are the
                      following:

                      •	 Sustaining public investments. Domestic resources—tax and nontax revenue—are likely to remain the
                           dominant source of financing for infrastructure. Increasing domestic revenue may provide the most
                           sustainable way to finance infrastructure investment. This will require improving tax collection as
                           well as cost recovery. In many countries, debt levels are still manageable, and borrowing to increase
                           spending on infrastructure remains a viable option. However, debt sustainability should not be
                           compromised.

                      •	 Encouraging greater private sector participation in infrastructure. Countries need to strengthen the
                           pipeline of bankable projects that can meet the financial objectives of private investors. Innovative
                           fund and deal structures, such as guarantees and risk sharing, should be developed to mitigate




 22    >     A F R I C A’ S P U L S E
   risk. Blended finance instruments that can leverage private sector development financing should
   be promoted. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are a tested strategy that can be applied to many
   sectors. However, governments must establish autonomous regulatory agencies to oversee private
   agents. The terms of the partnerships must be monitored carefully to ensure that PPPs deliver a
   normal return and not a monopoly profit.

•	 Strengthening public investment management systems. Effective public financial management capacity
   is critical for scaling up infrastructure investment spending. Countries should seek to strengthen the
   capacity for project selection and appraisal, and enhance the monitoring of project execution to
   minimize leakages. Operation and maintenance expenditures for existing infrastructure should be
   fully integrated into a medium-term expenditure framework to ensure that they receive adequate
   budgetary resources.

•	 Promoting regional integration of infrastructure. A regional approach to the provision of infrastructure
   services is needed to overcome the region’s geographic and physical challenges. This will require
   effective regional institutions, setting priorities for regional investments, harmonizing regulatory
   frameworks and administrative procedures, and facilitating cross-border infrastructure.

	 These issues are discussed in more detail in the special topic of this report (section 2).

High Trade Logistics Costs

Trade logistics costs remain high in the region, constraining the competitiveness of local firms. Lowering
these costs can help countries to exploit the opportunities for trading in goods and services, globally
and within the region.

Trade logistics and intraregional trade in Sub-Saharan Africa are areas of untapped potential.
So far, growth in regional trade has been limited. Although the total value of exports between

                There is enormous untapped potential for intraregional trade in Africa to increase and drive export
                diversification, job creation, and poverty reduction. For example, greater regional trade integration could
                bring the following benefits:
                •	 Food security can be enhanced by increasing intraregional trade in staple foods and processed
                   agricultural products (box 1.4).
                •	 There are emerging opportunities for cross-border trade in basic manufactures, such as metal and
                   plastic products that are relatively costly to import from the global market.
                •	 There are opportunities to develop regional value chains to drive global exports of manufactures,
                    such as phosphates for fertilizers and regional processing of nickel and copper.
                •	 There is considerable potential for cross-border trade in services, such as health, education, and
                    business services.

                     found that crossing the border between Niger and Nigeria is equivalent to pulling these countries 639
                     kilometers further apart; the Nigeria-Chad border effect is equivalent to adding 594 kilometers.

                     In addition, the segmentation of markets in Africa increases the volatility of food production prices. In
                     every West African country, the volatility of within-country production is greater than that of the region,
                     and production is imperfectly correlated across countries. The implication is that greater intraregional
                     trade would help stabilize prices in individual countries in the face of local shocks. This would hold more
                     strongly for the larger pan-African continental market. Hence, deeper integration with larger regional
                     markets can reduce the impact on the poor of the price effects from localized shocks. In addition, lower
                     trade barriers and better trade infrastructure allow faster and more efficient response to localized food
                     shortages due to disasters of all types.

                However, the high cost of connecting to markets is a fundamental detriment for African producers. It
                is estimated that intraregional trade costs are around 50 percent higher in Africa than in East Asia, and
                are the highest of intraregional costs for any developing region.1 Achieving the trade potential of the
                region will require substantial improvement in the quantity, quality, and range of trade-related transport
                and logistics services. Various studies have shown that, in general, less developed and expensive trade
                logistics lead to the following:

                •	 High overhead costs for manufacturers. The World Bank’s 2011 report on Light Manufacturing in Africa
                    showed how poor trade logistics increase production costs (often wiping out the advantage of lower

    labor costs) and lead to long and unreliable delivery times, making local firms in Africa uncompetitive
    in regional and global markets.

•	 Inefficiencies in logistics services that undermine agricultural supply chains. Continued productivity
    improvements in agriculture will require enhanced access to modern inputs, seeds, fertilizers, and
    pesticides, often through imports. Investment in new inputs requires access to markets and fast,
    efficient, and predictable transport and logistics. Increasing the productivity of the agricultural
    sector, and the resulting growth of the agro-processing sector, will be crucial for continuing rural
    development; however, it will be constrained if the trade logistics services available in the country are
    of poor quality and high cost.

•	 Continuation of the current logistics systems in Africa, which impose very high costs on small firms
    participating in trade. Thriving regional trade in staple foods and manufacturing, including processed
    agricultural products, will require efficient consolidation and distribution services if small firms are to
    benefit from economies of scale in transportation.

Although the region has made considerable progress in addressing the logistics constraints to trade,
there is still much more to be done to reach the levels of other developing countries and help African
firms compete on an equal footing in regional and global markets. Several countries in Sub-Saharan Africa
have made some of the largest gains in trade logistics, as measured by the World Bank’s Doing Business
and Trading Across Borders indicators. For example, between 2009 and 2014, nine of the top 10 reformers
globally in the trade indicator were in Sub-Saharan Africa, and 70 percent of the economies in Africa
implemented at least one reform. Along corridors, there has been some success in removing roadblocks
and reducing border-crossing times, with impacts on transport efficiency and cost, such as in East Africa.

However, Africa still has some catching up to do, compared with other regions, on broader measures of
logistics quality, such as the World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index, and in ensuring that poor people
are connected to markets through efficient and reliable logistics services. The following are the key
priorities for African countries as they seek to improve competitiveness and deepen regional integration:2

•	 Improvements in trade logistics need to facilitate trade not only along corridors to the main ports, but
    also across borders between African countries, to realize the potential from regional integration and
    regional sourcing of inputs in Africa.

•	 Improvements in physical infrastructure must be complemented by better policies and procedures
    applied to trade. Experience is increasingly showing that the largest impact often comes from the
    latter. Hence, there is a need to deepen the focus on simplifying trade rules and procedures, and
    ensure transparency and predictability in their implementation.

•	 Improvements in trade logistics are not just about goods in trucks and containers, although those
    are vitally important. These improvements are also about facilitating the movement across borders
    of people and services. The logistics of trade in services, whether it be issues related to virtual
    connectivity or mutual recognition of the qualifications of professionals, such as accountants,

                    engineers, or health and education workers, require more attention to realize the enormous
                    opportunities from trade in services.

                •	 The political economy of reform is such that it is essential that the private sector is the main driver
                    of change.

                •	 Finally, benchmarking and measuring trade logistics performance are a critical part of any strategy
                    that seeks to leverage trade, including regional trade, as a driver of diversification and poverty
                    reduction. Monitoring is needed to ensure that (a) reforms are being implemented, and (b) the
                    benefits of improved trade logistics are being passed on to producers and consumers in the form
                    of a broader range of lower-priced and more widely available goods and services.

                Governments in Africa can exploit a range of agreements and instruments to support the
                implementation of this reform agenda. Groups of like-minded countries in subregions in Africa can
                come together to address the logistics constraints that undermine mutual trade opportunities—
                such as is being done by countries in Southern Africa under the Accelerated Program of Economic
                Integration, and between the Democratic Republic of Congo and countries in the Great Lakes Region.
                Countries can enhance their efforts to implement the commitments to facilitate trade made through
                regional economic communities, as have the countries of the East African Community, and could
                leverage the Tripartite Agreement and the Continental Free Trade Agenda as vehicles to push a
                transformation agenda for trade logistics that prioritizes impacts on the poor.

                Finally, global agreements, such as the Trade Facilitation Agreement, can be implemented in a
                way that ensures that the improvement of regional trade logistics accompanies efforts to improve
                connectivity to the global market.

                Rising Debt

                Debt levels are on the rise in Sub-Saharan Africa and, in some cases, rapidly. Public debt in the region has
                continued to rise amid large/widened fiscal deficits and weak growth. The median general government
                gross debt-to-GDP ratio stood at 48 percent in 2016, more than 10 percentage points above the level
                in 2014. But there is wide variation across countries. For the bottom quartile of countries in the region,
                general government gross debt is less than 40 percent of GDP; for the top quartile, it exceeds 60 percent
                of GDP.

                Debt ratios among oil exporters have increased by about 15 percentage points of GDP over the past
                three years (2014–16), to a median value of 50 percent. Among non-resource exporters, Mozambique
                has public debt levels exceeding 100 percent of GDP, after information exposed government
                guarantees on debt by several state-owned enterprises (figure 1.11). Other countries have borrowed
                to finance much-needed infrastructure programs—for example, Ethiopia, with the second phase of
                the Growth and Transformation Plan.

ANNEX 1A: GROWTH AFTER A COMMODITY PRICE PLUNGE:
WHAT TO EXPECT?

Commodity Price Cycles

The post-2000 commodity super cycle the world recently witnessed is not an isolated phenomenon.
Over the past century, three other super cycles (from trough to trough) have taken place in 1894–1932,
1932–71, and 1971–99. The World Bank (2015) argues that these long and protracted commodity price
upswings were associated with the rapid industrialization and urbanization of a group of dynamic
economies—U.S. growth in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the post-World War II reconstruction
of Europe, and the emergence of Japan as a major economic player. As the income per capita levels
of these countries increase, their commodity consumption follows an S-curve pattern.1 Once this
commodity consumption stabilizes, a period of much lower commodity prices follows (Jacks 2013).

Commodity price boom-bust cycles take a toll on countries, especially developing and resource-rich
countries. Resource-abundant countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are no exception to such economic
upheavals owing to super cycles. To examine the behavior of economic performance after a commodity
plunge, periods of sharp decline in commodity prices are identified. Specifically, the criteria identify
episodes where the annual Energy Price Index declines by more than 25 percent, namely, 1986, 1998,
2009, and 2014.2 This annex examines the behavior of growth per worker as well as the sources of
growth—capital accumulation and total factor productivity (TFP)—after a plunge in commodity prices.3
Given that some of the effects of the 2014 plunge are still evolving, inference from previous commodity
price busts is used to extract some lessons for the current episode.4

Figure 1A.1 depicts the behavior of commodity prices over a window of time starting from the year
before the bust year (labeled T). International prices of metals and mineral ores as well as agricultural
goods also experienced a decline—although not as pronounced as that of energy commodities.
Precious metals, typically regarded as safe-haven commodities, experienced an increase in prices. Energy
prices did not fully recover to pre-crisis levels in the span of six years, while other commodities recovered
relatively rapidly.


Evolution of Real Gross Domestic Product per Worker in Sub-Saharan
Africa after a Plunge in International Energy Prices

The behavior of real gross domestic product (GDP) per worker after a price plunge in the region and in
country groups classified according to their extent of resource abundance is presented in figure 1A.2. For
the region, output per worker drops about 9 percent in the first year, and takes five years to recover to the
pre-shock level (figure 1A.2, panel a). Looking at the regional aggregate masks differences across country
groups (figure 1A.2, panel b). As expected, output per worker among oil-rich countries deteriorates sharply


1	 Commodity consumption tends to stabilize at very high levels after rapid and accelerating growth (Roache 2012).
2	 Energy price data were extracted from the World Bank Pink Sheet. The Energy Price Index is comprised of three commodities: coal, crude oil, and natural gas, and their weights are 4.7, 84.6,
   and 10.8, respectively.
3	 The data on real GDP, capital stock, employment, and TFP were obtained from Penn World Tables 9.0 (Feenstra, Inklaar, and Timmer 2015).
4	 Not all commodity price busts are alike. The plunge in 1986 was driven by oil supply factors, whereas those in 1998 and 2009 were demand driven.

                     Sources of Growth and the Energy Price Plunge in Sub-Saharan Africa
                     The median recovery of income per worker after a sharp drop in commodity prices is about five years
                     for the region as a whole. However, the speed of recovery appears to be slower for resource-abundant
                     countries. What are the dynamics of the sources of growth underlying this recovery? What is the
                     behavior of capital per worker and TFP across countries in the region after such a shock?

                     The behavior of capital per worker after a sharp deterioration of energy prices in Sub-Saharan Africa and
                     selected country groups is plotted in figure 1A.3. For the region, capital per worker declines slightly over
                     the next four years after the price decline, and increases afterward. The cumulative growth of capital per
                     worker over the next five years after the commodity price shock is about 5 percent (figure 1A.3, panel
                     a). When looking at country groups, non-oil and non-resource-rich countries have relatively unchanged

levels of capital per worker throughout the six-year window. However, oil-rich countries experience a
faster increase in capital per worker, which is attributed to a large stream of capital investment in the
aftermath of this profound shock (figure 1A.3, panel b).

The evolution of TFP is presented in figure 1A.4. For the region, TFP shows a slight increase in the first
two years after the shock, which might reflect the shedding of inefficient vis-à-vis efficient workers.
Afterward, TFP exhibits a marked downward trend. In the sixth year after the shock, TFP in Sub-Saharan
Africa is still 15 percent below pre-shock levels (figure 1A.4, panel a). Furthermore, the behavior of TFP
over time is particularly striking among oil-rich countries. TFP fluctuations in oil-rich countries after the
energy price plunge are much more volatile than in the other two groups. Such volatility in productivity
may suggest a greater extent of resource misallocation within these economies, which, in turn, may
inhibit sustained economic growth. Non-resource-rich countries in the region also show no productivity
improvement, suggesting that economic growth was primarily driven by capital accumulation.

                      The response of GDP per worker, capital per worker, and TFP during the commodity price plunge, from
                      their peaks in 1985 and 2008, is examined in figure 1A.5. Although the magnitude and persistence of
                      the drop in energy prices may differ between these two episodes, one reason for their comparison is the
                      difference in the nature of the sources of the price declines. The 1985 episode is explained by shocks that
                      expanded the supply of energy (say, technological innovations, increased supply coming from the Soviet
                      Union, and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries’ mandate to maintain market shares
                      rather than defend prices, among others). By contrast, the price collapse in 2008 is attributed to a global
                      demand shock, as the level of economic activity was severely affected by the global financial crisis.5

                      Some interesting results emerge from figure 1A.5. First, the fall in output per worker (measured by the
                      distance from peak to trough) is sharper in the 2008 episode than in 1985; however, the recovery after
                      2008 is faster. Second, the recovery of output per worker in 2008 is primarily driven by massive capital
                      deepening—as shown by the steady increase in capital per worker. For the 1985 episode, capital per
                      worker declines moderately and slowly converges to pre-shock levels. Third, TFP levels decline over time
                      in both episodes—although at a faster pace in the 1985 episode. From these findings, it can be inferred
                      that supply-driven commodity price collapses (compared with demand-driven ones) are associated with
                      slow recoveries in output per worker, stagnant capital ratios, and sharper TFP declines.

                      Figure 1A.6 depicts the evolution of GDP per worker, capital per worker, and TFP after the two
                      commodity price shocks (1985 and 2008) across country groups in Sub-Saharan Africa classified by their
                      extent of resource abundance. Interestingly, the figure shows that when the commodity price plunge
                      is explained by supply shocks (the 1985 episode), the output drop is larger than when it is driven by
                      demand shocks (the 2008 episode). Looking at the supply-driven shock, output per worker declines the
                      most among resource-abundant countries, and it does not recover to previous peak levels after six years.
                      In the case of non-resource-abundant countries, output recovers in the second year after the shock hits.
                      The behavior of output per worker in each group is primarily explained by the evolution of TFP.

In sum, vulnerability to shocks represents a huge cost (in output and productivity) for countries in Sub-
Saharan Africa. Plunging energy prices—along with relatively moderate declines in agriculture and metals
prices—may have constrained or delayed the decision of African economies to implement growth-
enhancing policies. Particularly vulnerable is the group of oil-rich economies, where recovery in output
per worker comes along with massive capital deepening, and it is not accompanied by TFP growth. This
situation implies that the growth recovery financed by investment programs may not provide the biggest
bang for their buck. The recurrence of commodity price busts poses challenges to resource-abundant
countries, once again, to formulate policies to withstand these adverse shocks. In this context, countries
should not only rely on capital accumulation for sustained growth. They need to formulate policies to
boost productivity and the efficient allocation of resources within and across their industries.

                ANNEX 1B: HEIGHTENED EXCHANGE MARKET PRESSURES
                IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA
                Stagnant economic growth coupled with declining oil and commodity prices have underpinned fiscal
                and external imbalances in countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. At the height of mounting economic
                pressures, countries in the region may react differently to such a terms-of-trade shock. Some countries
                may allow a significant but orderly depreciation of their currencies. Others with fixed exchange rate
                regimes may experience a large and abrupt decrease in foreign reserves. One method to assess the
                impact of such shocks on foreign exchange (FX) markets across countries in the region is to quantify
                the extent of exchange market pressure (EMP). Girton and Roper (1977) model EMP as a measure of
                excess demand for a currency. It was later modeled to compute pressure in FX markets under a flexible,
                intermediate, or fixed regime, thus enabling us to evaluate the impact of policy actions such as FX
                market interventions and/or interest rate adjustments.

                In its simplest version, EMP is computed as the weighted sum of exchange rate depreciation and foreign
                reserve loss.6 The analysis exploits monthly data on the exchange rates and international reserves
                of 40 Sub-Saharan African countries from April to September 2016, compared with the same period
                in the previous year. Based on the calculated EMP, countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are classified into
                three groups: high-pressure, moderate-pressure, and no-pressure.7 The high-pressure group consists of
                countries with EMP greater than 25 percent. The moderate-pressure group is those with positive EMP
                but less than 25 percent. The no-pressure group is comprised of those with negative EMP, indicating no
                pressure of currency weakening observed during the period studied.

                Table 1B.1 shows the list of countries in each group, with its dominant contributing factor. The overall
                average EMP of the high-pressure group is 50 percent, more than five times larger than that of the
                moderate-pressure group. About two-thirds of the pressure in the high-pressure group originates from
                foreign reserve losses. The moderate-pressure group has an EMP of 9.4 percent, with exchange rate
                depreciation and foreign reserve loss equally contributing to the cumulative FX pressure. Finally, the
                no-pressure group has an EMP of -25 percent. Small pressures coming through currency weakening
                are offset by foreign reserve accumulation among countries in the no-pressure group in the observed
                period.

                When we look at the output-weighted averages of EMP for the different country groups, the results
                show a different picture. The high-pressure group still has an EMP of 50 percent and the contribution of
                exchange rate depreciation is now about two-thirds. This outcome is attributed to Nigeria’s transition
                to a more flexible exchange rate regime in June 2016. This transition led to a weakening of the naira of
                about 50 percent in the following months. Angola is an example of another country that allowed its
                currency to undergo a significant level of depreciation when comparing April-September 2016 vis-à-vis
                April-September 2015. However, the Angolan kwanza has remained almost invariant since June 2015.



                6	 A more complete version of the EMP index includes not only changes in exchange rates and international reserves, but also interest rate differentials; see Aizenman and Hutchison (2012).
                   The analysis undertaken for countries in Sub-Saharan Africa uses only exchange rates and reserves, because: (a) there is insufficient data on domestic and foreign interest rate differentials in
                   many of the countries in the region, and (b) many countries in the region belong to a currency union and have no independent (interest-driven) monetary policy.
                7	 South Sudan is excluded from the analysis. Its computed EMP is about 1,291 percent.

EMP = exchange market pressure.



When faced with shocks, flexible exchange rate arrangements act as shock absorbers in some Sub-
Saharan African countries. For instance, Mozambique has an EMP of 85 percent; the source of pressure
primarily stems from exchange rate depreciation (figure 1B.1). A few countries in the moderate-pressure
group, such as South Africa, Tanzania, and Rwanda, endure currency depreciation during the period.

Countries with fixed exchange rate regimes, particularly those in the Central African Economic and Monetary
Community (CEMAC) and West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), had limited room for such
adjustments. For example, Chad marks an EMP of 94 percent, most of which comes from loss of international
reserves. Although the level of international reserves in Chad was relatively small, the country lost about
95 percent of its total reserves compared with the prior year. Two countries from the WAEMU (Benin and
Mali) also endured rapid accumulation of pressure due to loss of international reserves. Although countries
participating in the regional monetary unions have limited leeway to manage monetary shocks, the impacts
of external shocks are not identical across the board. For example, Cameroon and Togo, both with CFA francs,
increased international reserves by 13 and 77 percent, respectively.

The heterogeneity of EMP across countries participating in monetary unions could possibly be attributed
to countries’ dependence on natural resources, especially oil wealth. As depicted in figure 1B.2, the EMPs
of six oil-rich countries in the region are on average 51.8 percent, slightly higher than the overall average
of the high-pressure group. All the countries, except Gabon, are in fact in the high-pressure group,
although Gabon is barely below the threshold. Finally, most countries in the no-pressure group managed
to accumulate international reserves.

specification that includes terms-of-trade
changes and the 2015 fiscal balances, as
well as the dummy variables for oil abundance and exchange rate pegs. Terms-of-trade changes yield a
negative and significant coefficient; that is, an increase in export prices (vis-à-vis import prices) reduces
exchange market pressures—as the more favorable terms-of-trade tends to strengthen the currency.
Furthermore, fiscal balances tend to have a negative and significant relationship with EMP. This finding
suggests that an increase of one percentage point in the fiscal balance-to-GDP ratio reduces EMP by 3.2
percent. Column 3 combines the previous two specifications. Inflation remains significant, but none of
the other variables reports any statistical significance. The fiscal balance is particularly noteworthy. The
variable had a statistically significant coefficient in column 2, but it disappeared with the inclusion of CPI
inflation in the model. This finding could imply that the impact of fiscal imbalance on EMP is an indirect
one; that is, it is channeled through its impact on higher CPI inflation. Finally, column 4 includes the
current account of the balance of payments as an additional determinant. When controlling for all the
determinants, the econometric analysis still shows that inflation is the only variable yielding a significant
coefficient. This finding implies that most macroeconomic outcomes—either fiscal imbalances or
external imbalances—or global shocks—say, changes in the terms of trade—may affect EMP through
their own effect on inflation.

Overall, Sub-Saharan African countries have recently shown substantial signs of FX market pressure.
Macroeconomic fundamentals, such as the level of inflation, seem to spark pressure on countries regardless
of the monetary arrangements in place. Furthermore, attention should be paid to countries that lack
monetary or fiscal space—that is, countries with lower reserves and widened fiscal deficits—as they have a
reduced margin for staving off the impact of shocks on their currencies—for example, CEMAC countries.

Section 2: Infrastructure in Sub-Saharan Africa
SUMMARY
An adequate supply of infrastructure services has long been viewed as a key ingredient for economic
development, but Sub-Saharan Africa ranks at the bottom of all developing regions in virtually all
dimensions of infrastructure performance. Yet, there are varying trends in the region’s infrastructure
performance across key sectors. In telecommunications, Sub-Saharan Africa has seen dramatic
improvement in the quantity and quality of infrastructure, and the gains are broad-based. Access to safe
water has also risen, with 77 percent of the population having access to water in 2015, from 51 percent
in 1990, but disparities between rural and urban access rates persist.

In the power sector, by contrast, the region’s electricity-generating capacity has changed little in
more than 20 years. At about 0.04 megawatts per 1,000 people, capacity is less than a third of that
of South Asia, and less than one-tenth of that of Latin America and the Caribbean. There is some
variation by country, with little progress in electricity-generating capacity per capita in the region’s
low-income countries (LICs) and lower-middle-income countries (LMCs), but more than a doubling of
capacity among upper-middle-income countries (UMCs). Access to electricity is low, at 35 percent of
the population, with rural access rates at less than one-third of urban ones. Transport infrastructure is
likewise lagging, with the region registering the lowest road and railroad densities among developing
regions. Sub-Saharan Africa is the only region where road density has declined over the past 20 years
(1990–2011). Despite a doubling in access to improved sanitation facilities, the access rate remains low,
at about 30 percent in 2015; the largest gain in access has been in rural areas and LICs.

Controlling for geographic and demographic factors shows that most countries in Sub-Saharan
Africa are close to the international norm that characterizes the relationship between infrastructure
and development. This section considers that a country underperforms (overperforms) in a specific
dimension of an infrastructure sector relative to an international norm if, after controlling for geographic
and demographic factors, it has a level of infrastructure that is below (above) its level of economic
development. But some countries are underperforming according to the international norm. For
example, Angola, Gabon, Nigeria, Rwanda, and Tanzania underperform in telecommunications density
and electricity-generating capacity; and Angola, Ethiopia, and Madagascar underperform in access to
improved water source. Some countries do much better than predicted by the international norm, such
as Kenya in Internet density and South Africa in Internet quality.

The growth effects of narrowing Sub-Saharan Africa’s infrastructure quantity and quality gap are
potentially large. For instance, growth in GDP per capita for the region would increase by an estimated 1.7
percentage points per year if it were to close the gap with the regional median (excluding Sub-Saharan
Africa) of each infrastructure indicator. Eliminating the quantity gap would deliver 1.2 percentage points
higher growth per capita per year; catching up in quality would bring about 0.5 percentage point higher
growth per year. The growth effects of the quantity of infrastructure vary by sector, with the largest
growth benefits obtained by narrowing the gap in electric power–generating capacity, at 0.7 percentage
point higher per year. For quality, improving road quality provides the largest benefits.

Closing the infrastructure quantity and quality gap relative to the best performers in the world, as
proxied by the top decile of the distribution of infrastructure stocks and quality, would yield higher


                                                                                              A F R I C A’ S P U L S E   >   39
                growth rates in GDP per capita of about 1.8 and 0.8 percentage points per year, respectively. That is
                additional growth in GDP per capita of 2.6 percentage points per year. Again, the largest potential
                growth benefits would come from closing the gap in electric power–generating capacity. Narrowing the
                gap in the length of the road network would render large gains as well.

                The growth benefits for Sub-Saharan Africa are directly related to the potential gains of narrowing
                the gap for LICs and LMCs in the region. Energy appears to be a more binding constraint among LICs,
                whereas roads are the most binding constraint among LMCs, in quantity and quality.

                Public investment as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) in Sub-Saharan Africa is below its recent
                peak of 5.8 percent in 2014. The average masks considerable variation across country groups. The
                evidence suggests that public and private investment are substitutes in 19 of the region’s countries
                (of 45) and complements in 26 countries. Public spending tends to be less procyclical or more
                countercyclical in countries with stronger institutions, and more procyclical in countries with more
                inflows of foreign capital or when access to global capital markets is procyclical.

                Public capital spending, based on data collected by the BOOST initiative for 24 African countries, is
                estimated at 2 percent of GDP annually between 2009 and 2015. Roads accounted for two-thirds of
                overall investments. Capital spending on electricity and water supply and sanitation each accounted
                for 15 percent of total capital expenditures. Overall, actual spending in infrastructure was considerably
                lower than capital allocations during the same period. The latter amounted to around 3.4 percent of GDP,
                reflecting substantial under-execution of such investments. Foreign aid continues to play an important
                role in some of the infrastructure subsectors, with the share of the overall capital budget allocations
                funded through external aid registering 36 percent in 2015. In electricity, a substantial increase in foreign
                funded projects has been driven mainly by the infrastructure push embedded in the “Power Africa”
                initiative. Road transport is the sector with the greatest share of domestic contribution.

                Public-private partnerships (PPPs) in Sub-Saharan Africa remain a very small market, with projects
                concentrated in only a few countries, namely, South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, and Uganda. Together they
                account for 48 percent of the 335 total PPP infrastructure projects in the region in the past 25 years. This
                amounts to $36.7 billion of investment commitments, or 62 percent of the $59 billion in total investment
                commitments in the region. In the past five years, PPP infrastructure projects in the region have mainly
                been concentrated in the energy sector (78 percent)—mostly renewables—followed by transport (22
                percent) and water and sanitation (0.5 percent). International financial institutions play a larger role in
                financing PPPs in Sub-Saharan Africa than in other emerging markets and developing economies. A
                robust institutional and regulatory framework is critical in attracting private investment for infrastructure
                projects. The region performs below the global average in each of the four PPP thematic coverage
                areas—project preparation, procurement, unsolicited proposals, and contract management.

                The impact on growth of public investment can be enhanced by implementing policies that foster
                the efficiency of public investment. For instance, improving the institutions and procedures governing
                project appraisal, selection, and monitoring can render considerable economic dividends. Recent
                studies show that the public investment multiplier could double if the gap between the bottom and top
                performers in public investment efficiency is closed. There is evidence that countries with sound public
                investment management systems tend to have lower but more efficient levels of public investment,
                crowd in more private investment, and exhibit higher growth rates.

INTRODUCTION
After two decades of per capita income growth rates that outpaced those of rich countries (Africa Rising),
economic activity in the region has decelerated. There is an urgent need to regain the momentum on
sustained growth. Amid an unfavorable external environment, observers in academic and policy circles
are advocating a “big push” to help the region escape poverty and narrow the gap vis-à-vis the rest of the
developing world (for example, Sachs et al. 2004; Collier 2006; IMF 2014). These calls for action propose
a wide array of policy agendas; however, virtually all of them list infrastructure development among the
top priorities in the region.

An adequate supply of infrastructure services has long been viewed as a key ingredient for economic
development, in the academic literature (since the work of Aschauer 1989) as well as in policy debate
(for example, World Bank 1994; IMF 2014). Over the past quarter century, academic research has
devoted considerable effort to theoretical and empirical analysis of the contribution of infrastructure
development to growth and productivity. More recently, increasing attention has also been paid to the
impact of infrastructure on poverty and inequality (Estache 2005; World Bank 2003, 2006; Calderon and
Serven 2004, 2010). Although the empirical literature on these two topics is far from unanimous, on the
whole, a consensus has emerged that, under the right conditions, infrastructure development can play a
major role in promoting growth and equity—and, through both channels, help reduce poverty.

Sub-Saharan Africa ranks at the bottom of all developing regions in virtually all dimensions of infrastructure
performance. The region, in which almost one-seventh of the world lives, has a score of 2.91 in the World
Economic Forums’ (WEF’s) Global Competitiveness Report.1 This score clearly states that there is a severe
infrastructure bottleneck to be addressed. The region has some inherent characteristics that may enhance
the potential role of infrastructure for its economic development—notably, the large number of landlocked
countries, which are home to a major proportion of the region’s total population (about 40 percent), and
the remoteness of most of the region’s economies from global market centers (Calderon and Serven 2010).2

Sub-Saharan Africa’s geographic disadvantages result in high transport costs that hinder intra- and
inter-regional trade (Limao and Venables 2001; Elbadawi, Mengistae, and Zeufack 2006; Behar and
Manners 2008). Limited openness to trade is the main factor behind the stylized fact that, ceteris
paribus, landlocked countries tend to grow slower than others. However, adequate transportation and
communication facilities can help overcome these geographic disadvantages. The region’s problem is
that poor infrastructure adds to its geographic disadvantage.

The analysis in section 2 addresses several aspects of infrastructure in Sub-Saharan Africa. First, it presents
information on the performance of infrastructure in the region along three broad dimensions: quantity,
quality, and access. It examines the trends in these three dimensions from an international comparison
perspective. Then it compares infrastructure trends in the region with other benchmark regions, and
the performance of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa is compared vis-à-vis their level of development
while accounting for demographic and geographic drivers. Second, the section explores the relationship
between infrastructure growth and economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa. The potential growth
benefits of closing the infrastructure gap in the region and the financing needs are considered. Third, it
documents the stylized facts on public investment in the region, presents granular information on public
spending collected by the BOOST initiative, and takes stock of public-private partnerships (PPPs) in

2	 Storeygard (2016) argues that the lack of infrastructure could also reflect the low population density in the region—which may play a role in explaining the low maintenance of most
   infrastructure networks.

                  infrastructure. Finally, the section examines the quality of infrastructure spending—as measured by the
                  quality of public investment management systems and procurement methods.
                  A few conceptual issues about infrastructure are summarized in box 2.1.
                  A host of issues drive the gaps in infrastructure in the Africa region, beyond the financing gap. For
                  instance, there is a lack of commitment to sustainable tariffs in infrastructure services, such as electric
                  power, transport, and water. Yet, there is heavy reliance on public subsidies. Another problem is the
                  poor performance of public utilities—affected not only by weak management, but also political
                  interference. There is lack of political support for sector reforms that will help crowd in private investment
                  in infrastructure—for example, opposition from state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to PPPs. In addition,
                  domestic capital markets are not deep enough to provide local-currency long-term debt for infrastructure
                  and, in some jurisdictions, tax systems may discourage the issuance of infrastructure-related bonds (for
                  example, South Africa). Finally, an in-depth discussion of the issues mentioned above—although very
                  relevant to understand infrastructure gaps in the region—goes beyond the scope of this section.


BOX 2.1:          What is meant by infrastructure has evolved; it is now generally defined as a complex array of capital
What Is
                  goods that provide services in combination with other inputs (Prud’Homme 2004; Snieska and Simkunaite
Economic
Infrastructure?   2009). Infrastructure can be identified by five characteristics (Kay 1990). First, infrastructure projects can be
                  described as networks, which involve delivery systems and allow significant interactions in the provision of
                  services to individual customers (Oughton and Tyler 2013). As a network is a public good, other individuals
                  can still use it when delivered. This type of infrastructure is referred to as collective capital goods. The fact
                  that individuals use these collective goods makes it difficult to reveal consumer preferences.

                  Second, when infrastructure is built, new projects form a small part of the total cost of the wide range
                  of products in which they are used. In the case of service failure, the corrective cost becomes very large
                  compared with the basic cost of service production (Ahmed and Donovan 1992). Since changing the
                  marginal cost results in no revenues, and the users would always try to find someone else to pay for the
                  service attained, or free-ride due to the lack of properly declared property rights, it becomes difficult for the
                  private sector to be entirely responsible for infrastructure provision (Coase 1937; Varian and Repcheck 2010).

                  Third, infrastructure construction results in monopolistic elements. In turn, these elements rely on
                  the combination of durable and immobile investments, and provide strong economies of scale. The
                  government seeks control over the private sector in the delivery of infrastructure services, due to the lack of
                  competition (that is, the high cost of network building). Regulation is a partial solution to setting fair rules
                  over the relationship between the government and the private sector (Gómez-Ibañez 2003).

                  Fourth, the capital cost of infrastructure might be larger than its running cost.

                  Fifth, infrastructure projects usually incur relatively important sunk costs (Kay 1990). These are considerable
                  proportions of the service’s total cost, and have already been covered before the service has been used
                  (Ahmed and Donovan 2002).

                  Infrastructure can be classified into hard or soft, which some call economic or social (Jerome 1999;
                  Fourie 2006; Perkins, Fedderke, and Luiz 2005; Snieska and Simkunaite 2009) (figure B2.1.1). Soft or social
                  infrastructure refers to the social, political, and cultural institutions and services supporting a community
                  or nation (Wanmali and Islam 1997). Soft infrastructure includes different sectors, namely, education,
                  commercial, housing, and security or defense. Hard or economic infrastructure refers to large physical
                  networks that are needed to promote economic activity and maintain a functioning nation (Ahmed

Hard and soft infrastructure comprise
different sectors. At the same time,
there is a great deal of heterogeneity              Local            National  Transnational   Levels
within a single sector. For instance,
the transportation sector includes
roads, airports, water ports, railways,
                                                        Quantity     Quality  Access         Dimensions
and subways, and each of these             Source: World Bank staff.

subsectors is characterized by
different costs, planning techniques, and maintenance requirements. Furthermore, the energy sector is
also composed of heterogeneous subsectors, like electric energy, hydro energy, gas, and oil, among others.

Another element to consider in the definition of economic infrastructure is its level, namely, local, national,
and transnational (Fourie 2006).a The level adds spatial dependence and spatial heterogeneity to the data.
The level is also relevant because it builds a component of endogenous placement for infrastructure
(Anselin 1988). For instance, it might not be necessary to have a dam in every state—because a dam might
provide services to neighboring states. Sharing a border and complying with globalization decisions will
also affect the mode of infrastructure provision. For instance, very localized and globalized goods are
becoming more important because of technological improvements (Fourie 2006; Taylor 2010).

Finally, infrastructure (economic and social) is a multidimensional concept: it involves measuring quantity,
quality, and access (Rietveld and Bruinsma 2012; Calderón and Servén 2008). The quantity dimension refers
to stocks of infrastructure—that is, physical capacity. It may also refer to flows—as proxied by measures of
consumption and/or production. Measuring the quality dimension of infrastructure is not trivial. Typically, it is
measured by qualitative indicators, like those in the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report.
These indicators survey perceptions on the quality of infrastructure services.b However, the set of objective
measures for quality is limited, namely, the share of paved roads in the transport sector, or the percentage of
distribution and transmission losses in electric energy in the energy sector. The third dimension is access.

Most research focused on the impact of infrastructure on growth and productivity relies on quantity
measures. Recent efforts to have a better assessment on the growth effects of infrastructure include the
quality dimension (Calderón and Servén 2004, 2010; Loayza and Odawara 2010).c The access dimension is
mostly used in studies of inequality or poverty. However, all the elements of infrastructure—dimension,
level, sector, and type—coexist in the area of development.

a. Depending on the political division of the country, provincial or federal levels may be added (Fourie 2006).
b. The World Economic Forum (WEF) report surveys executives on their perception of the quality of different infrastructure sectors. These WEF measures on the quality of infrastructure
    are highly correlated with the corresponding quantity measures of road transport, electricity, and telecommunications. See Albino-War et al. (2014), Calderón, Cantu and Servén
    (forthcoming).

                2.1 TRENDS IN INFRASTRUCTURE
                Evolution of Physical Measures of Infrastructure

                The infrastructure network in Sub-Saharan Africa remains poor on average, despite recent government
                efforts to improve it. This subsection assesses the patterns of infrastructure stocks and their accumulation
                across countries in the region. It updates the benchmarking analysis of infrastructure in the region
                conducted by Calderon and Serven (2010), and confirms the continuing existence of a wide gap in
                infrastructure provision between Sub-Saharan Africa and other developing regions.

                Benchmarking the performance of infrastructure sectors in the region’s countries involves the
                assessment of economic infrastructure across three dimensions: quantity, quality, and access. To place
                the infrastructure trends in Sub-Saharan Africa in context, the report uses a comparative perspective.
                First, the analysis uses different comparator regions, namely, South Asia, the Middle East and North
                Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and East Asia and the Pacific. Second, it examines infrastructure
                trends across income groups in the region—including LICs, LMCs, and UMCs. The full list of countries is
                presented in the appendix.

                The evolution of infrastructure in Sub-Saharan Africa is evaluated for different sectors, namely,
                telecommunications, energy, transport, and water and sanitation. Within each of these sectors, and
                to the extent that data permit, the quantity, quality, and access dimensions are examined. Time series
                availability and country coverage across the different indicators of infrastructure are heterogeneous.
                Table 2.1 summarizes the indicators that are used to examine the performance of infrastructure in Sub-
                Saharan Africa.

Telecommunications. Sub-Saharan Africa has seen a dramatic jump in telecommunications density
over the past quarter century. The median number of fixed and mobile phone lines per 1,000 people
has risen sharply, from three in 1990 to 736 in 2014 (figure 2.1). A similar pattern is observed in other
benchmark regions in the world, reflecting the global nature of the boom in mobile phone technology.
A comparison of telecommunications density across regions shows that, despite a surge, Sub-Saharan
Africa lags behind other regions.

Modern technological innovation has provided other forms of telecommunications connectivity
among people. In this context, the number of Internet users and fixed broadband subscriptions (both
normalized by population) are proxies for telecommunications density other than phone lines. Internet
density—as measured by the number of users per 100 people—in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2015 was only
16.7, less than that of any other benchmark region. Another indicator of Internet penetration is the
number of fixed broadband subscriptions per 100 people.3 Again, Sub-Saharan Africa, with a penetration
rate of only 0.19, lags other regions.

Within Sub-Saharan Africa, gains are observed across all income groups. Telecommunications density
expanded at the fastest pace among the region’s LICs, although starting from low levels. Specifically,
the number of fixed and mobile phones per 1,000 people grew among LICs, from three in 1990 to 687
in 2014 (figure 2.2). Moreover, the gap in telecommunications density relative to UMCs has narrowed
significantly for LICs and LMCs over the past two decades. For instance, telecommunications density
was only twice as high in UMCs compared with LMCs in 2014 (it was 11-fold in 1990). The fast growth of
telecommunications density over the past two decades among the region’s UMCs, increasing from 55
lines per 1,000 people in 1990, to 1,605 in 2014, has placed this group above the medians of other regions.


3	 This indicator refers to fixed subscriptions to high-speed access to public Internet, at downstream speeds equal to or greater than 256 kilobits per second.

                 Internet density has risen sharply over the past two decades for all income groups in Sub-Saharan
                 Africa. For instance, the number of Internet users increased from 1.1 per 100 people in 2005, to about
                 11.4 in 2015 among LICs, while it grew from 7.5 to 50.1 for UMCs. Fast growth of Internet density
                 among LICs and LMCs in the region has narrowed their gap relative to UMCs. Finally, the extent of
                 Internet density among Sub-Saharan Africa’s UMCs is above the regional median of countries in East
                 Asia and the Pacific (45.5 users per 100 countries).

                 Reflecting the regional aggregate, the density of fixed broadband subscriptions is dismal for virtually
                 all income groups in Sub-Saharan Africa. Notwithstanding the low penetration, there is a very large
                 gap between the region’s LICs and LMCs relative to UMCs. At the same time, the density of fixed
                 broadband across UMCs (5.25 subscriptions per 100 people) is lower than that of Latin America and
                 East Asia (8.1 and 9.1 subscriptions per 100 people, respectively).

                 Power. Sub-Saharan Africa was vastly outperformed by the other benchmark developing regions
                 in the power sector in 2012. The electricity-generating capacity of the region has changed little in
                 over 20 years and is about 0.04 megawatts (MW) per 1,000 people—that is, less than a third of that
                 of South Asia (with 0.15) and less than one-tenth of that of Latin America and the Caribbean (figure
                 2.3). Among the regions studied, East Asia and the Pacific registered the fastest growth in power-
                 generating capacity over the past two decades—jumping from 0.15 MW per 1,000 people in 1990
                 to 0.84.

                 Insufficient electricity–generating capacity in Sub-Saharan Africa is explained by the trends observed
                 in LICs and LMCs. There has been slight or no progress in MW of installed capacity per 1,000 people
                 over the past two decades for these groups of countries; that is, keeping capacity at at a low 0.03
                 and 0.06 MW per 1,000 people for LICs and LMCs, respectively, by 2012 (figure 2.4). Electricity-
                 generating capacity more than doubled among UMCs, growing from 0.33 MW per 1,000 people in
                 1990, to 0.72 MW per 1,000 people in 2012.

density has declined over time
among LMCs (figure 2.6). This
might capture the fact that the
expansion of the road network is not as fast as the pace of urbanization in these countries. The data also
reveal a large gap in road density for LICs and LMCs relative to UMCs, and that this gap has increased
sharply over time. Finally, the road density among UMCs in Sub-Saharan Africa (1.04 km per square km of
surface area) is larger than the regional median of all other developing regions. The trends observed in
railroad density are similar to those in roads: there has been a decline in the density of railroads among
the region’s LICs and LMCs over the past two decades, which might be attributed to poor maintenance.
At the same time, railroad density remained almost invariant among UMCs, and it was outperformed
only by South Asia.

                      Infrastructure Quality

                      It is imperative for the region to reduce the gap in the quantity of infrastructure. At the same time, the
                      quality of these service-providing capital goods will be the major contributor to their optimal usage. The
                      quality measures examined here can be objective or subjective. The former refers to hard measurements
                      (for example, electric power and transmission losses); the latter refers to perceptions of the quality and
                      reliability of these services obtained from entrepreneur services—such as the quality of infrastructure
                      indicators from the WEF’s Global Competitiveness Report.4

                      4	 It is important to note that this survey, which was conducted by the WEF’s Global Competitiveness Report, captures the perceptions of businesspeople about the quality of infrastructure in
                         the country. These indicators take values from zero (worst) to seven (best). The periods under analysis for this section are 2006 and 2015.

Telecommunications. Lack of data availability across sectors and, more importantly, over time prevents
us from capturing the quality of the services of fixed telephone and mobile lines. However, the quality
of Internet services can be approximated by the international bandwidth connection (which captures
used capacity and average traffic load). Over the past 15 years, there has been a broad-based increase in
Internet speed throughout the world. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the bits per second per Internet user grew
from 97 in 2000, to 4,370 in 2015 (figure 2.7). In South Asia, this indicator is nearly twice as large (8,816),
and in the remaining regions it is between 27,000 and 44,000 bits per second per Internet user.

There has been an increase in capacity and traffic on the Internet for all income groups in Sub-Saharan
Africa. The largest improvement is evidenced for UMCs, with this group seeing Internet traffic volume
greater than the regional median of other developing areas—except East Asia and Latin America (35,764
and 43,394 bits per second for every user, respectively).

Power. One measure of the quality of the power infrastructure sector is captured by the percentage of
electric power transmission and distribution losses (as a percentage of electricity output). Figure 2.8
depicts that electric power losses increased in Sub-Saharan Africa over the past quarter century, from
15.5 percent in 1990, to 16.7 percent in 2014, while declining in most other regions. Another measure
of the quality of power supply is from WEF; it is a qualitative indicator that fluctuates from a low of 0
to a high of 7. According to this indicator, the perceived quality of power supply in the region dipped
from 3.1 to 2.9 between 2006 and 2015. Sub-Saharan Africa registered the lowest scores in quality of
power supply in 2015, with a regional median of 2.9, practically the same as for South Asia, which also
experienced a decline in quality. Other benchmark regions, such as Latin America and the Caribbean and
East Asia and the Pacific, saw an improving trend in quality and scored above 4.5.

                     Within Sub-Saharan Africa, there is considerable disparity in the evolution over time of power losses
                     across the different income groups. For instance, power losses declined sharply in LMCs, to 11.8 percent
                     of output in 2014, from 22.5 percent in 1990; power losses in UMCs remained almost invariant over the
                     past decade (figure 2.9). By contrast, power losses slightly increased, from 15.5 percent of output to 16.9
                     percent during this period among the region’s LICs. Power losses in Sub-Saharan Africa’s LMCs and UMCs
                     are smaller than those in other regions, with the exception of East Asia.

The perception of the quality of power supply in the region is comparable across income groups. This
convergence is the outcome of different trends between 2006 and 2015: quality increased slightly
among LICs, varying between 2.8 and 2.9; it increased from 2.4 to 3.1 among LMCs; and it declined
sharply among UMCs, from about 5 to 2.9.

Transport. The quality of transport infrastructure is measured by (a) the share of paved roads in total
roads, and (b) the WEF perception scores on the quality of roads and railroads. The results with the hard
measures should be taken with caution, as not all road networks in the country are meant to be paved.
Other likely measures—for example, percentage of roads in good condition—are not available for the
wide array of countries and over time.

Figure 2.10 shows that in Sub-Saharan Africa the share of paved road declined from 17 percent in 1990
to 16 percent in 2010, bucking the rising trend observed in other regions. Sub-Saharan Africa also has
the lowest share of paved roads in the total road network of any region, and well below that of South
Asia (53 percent) and East Asia and the Pacific (71 percent).

The perception of road quality in Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as in other developing regions, shows
an improving trend during 2006–15. WEF scores for Sub-Saharan Africa on perceived road quality
climbed from 2.4 in 2006, to 3.3 in 2015. Still, Sub-Saharan Africa is the weakest performing region in
this category of quality, well below the score of 4.5 for East Asia and the Pacific. There is also a slight
increase in the surveyed perception of railroad quality in Sub-Saharan Africa, from a score of 1.9 in
2006, to 2.2 in 2015. But the region has among the lowest perceptions of railroad quality among
developing regions, and is well below regions such as South Asia and East Asia, which have scores in
the range of 3.9 and 4.3, respectively.

                   The share of paved roads in total roads is similar across income groups in Sub-Saharan Africa for 1990 (in
                   the range of 16.5 to 17 percent). It grew slightly to 18 percent among LICs and declined to 10 percent
                   among LMCs.5 The trends in perceived road quality are quite different from those of the share of paved
                   roads in the total road network. First, the perception of road quality increased for all income groups
                   in Sub-Saharan Africa—although at different rates (figure 2.11). Second, at a score of 4.8, the median
                   perception of road quality among UMCs in Sub-Saharan Africa outperforms the regional median of other
                   developing areas. The evolution of the perception of railroad quality for the different country groups
                   in Sub-Saharan Africa during 2006–15 shows improvement among LICs and LMCs in the region, and a
                   decline among UMCs.

                   Infrastructure Access

                   The performance of the infrastructure sector relies not only on quantity and quality, but also on the
                   universality of access. From the point of view of equality of opportunities and poverty reduction, it is
                   important to examine the extent to which infrastructure assets yield services to the broad population
                   rather than just a few. This subsection discusses the evolution of indicators of access to electricity, safe
                   water sources, and improved sanitation facilities.

                   Access to electricity. Figure 2.12 presents the percentage of the population with access to electricity in
                   Sub-Saharan Africa and other developing areas for 1990 and 2014. The figure depicts overall access as
                   well as access rates for urban and rural populations. The data show that total rates of access to electricity
                   more than doubled during this period, growing from 14 percent in 1990, to 35 percent in 2014. Yet,
                   all developing regions significantly outperformed Sub-Saharan Africa in access to electricity in 2014,

with universal access to electricity in East Asia. The disparity in rates of access to electricity between
urban and rural areas is especially marked in Sub-Saharan Africa, where about 63 percent of the urban
population and only 19 percent of the rural population had access to electricity in 2014.

Access to electricity has increased across all Sub-Saharan Africa income groups over the past two
decades—although at a slower pace among LICs. Overall access rates to electricity went from 10 percent
in 1990, to 23 percent in 2014 among this income group, while it increased from 29 to 45 percent
among LMCs over the same period (figure 2.13). The region’s UMCs have the largest overall access rate to
electricity (with 89 percent of the population in 2014).

                   The fast increase in the overall access rate in the region is driven by rising rural access rates—
                   although they were coming from low levels in 1990. Yet, there is a great disparity between urban and
                   rural rates of access to electricity across income groups in Sub-Saharan Africa. For instance, about
                   63 percent of the urban population had access to electricity in 2014, while only 19 percent had
                   access in rural areas. The urban and rural rates of access for the region’s LMCs are 83 and 18 percent,
                   respectively. Finally, the rural rate of access to electricity in UMCs (about 67 percent) is still below than
                   that of other developing regions.

                   Access to safe water. Total access rates to improved sources of water grew sharply in Sub-Saharan Africa
                   over the past quarter century (to a median of 77 percent in 2015, from 51 percent in 1990). Although
                   more than three-fourths of the region’s population had access to water in 2015, other benchmark
                   regions have access rates that exceed 90 percent (figure 2.14). Again there is a large disparity in urban
                   and rural access rates in Sub-Saharan Africa, despite the sharp growth of urban access. In 2015, more
                   than 90 percent of the urban population had access to water, while only 67 percent had access in rural
                   areas. For other developing regions, rural access exceeded 85 percent of the population.

                   The percentage of the population with access to improved sources of water increased over the past
                   quarter century across all income groups in Sub-Saharan Africa—with LICs showing the larger rates of
                   improvement. Their overall access rates jumped from 48 percent in 1990, to 77 percent in 2015. The
                   disparities across income groups are driven by those in rural areas. Interestingly, a greater proportion
                   of the rural population has access to water among LICs in the region (67 percent in 2015) than among
                   LMCs (57 percent) (figure 2.15). Among UMCs in the region, access is above 90 percent in urban areas,
                   while it covers 81 percent of the population in rural areas. In spite of covering four-fifths of the rural
                   population in 2015, rural access rates among UMCs in Sub-Saharan Africa are not higher than those in
                   other developing areas.

Access to improved sanitation facilities. Over the past quarter century, Sub-Saharan Africa has doubled
total access rates to sanitation; however, they are still low relative to other benchmark regions.
Sanitation access rates went from 15 percent in 1990, to about 30 percent in 2015 (figure 2.16). In
2015, about 55 percent of the population of South Asia had access to sanitation facilities, while that
proportion exceeded 80 percent for Latin America and the Caribbean and East Asia. With a rate of 38
percent, access to sanitation has changed little for Sub-Saharan Africa’s urban population. In the region’s
rural areas, only 25 of every 100 people had access to improved sanitation facilities in 2015, up from 9
in 1990.

                      Overall access rates increased over the past 25 years for LICs and LMCs in Sub-Saharan Africa, and
                      declined among UMCs. Again, these developments are primarily driven by the evolution of rural access
                      rates. Across rural areas, access rates more than doubled among LICs (jumping from 7 percent in 1990
                      to 16 percent in 2015) (figure 2.17). Gains in access were significant, although not as high, in LMCs (they
                      went from 18 percent in 1990, to 25 percent in 2015). Among UMCs, rural access rates declined, from
                      64 percent in 1990, to 61 percent in 2015. Finally, the rural access rate for UMCs is only higher than the
                      regional median for South Asia.

                      Sub-Saharan Africa’s Infrastructure Gaps: A Scorecard

                      Table 2.2 depicts a scorecard of Sub-Saharan Africa’s infrastructure gaps in terms of quantity, quality,
                      and access, as well as subregions and selected countries. The scorecard summarizes the information
                      presented in figures 2.1 through 2.17. It captures the gap between the region, income groups, or
                      percentile of the regional distribution vis-à-vis the top decile of the world excluding countries in Sub-
                      Saharan Africa. This gap is represented by the ratio of the infrastructure measure in Sub-Saharan Africa
                      vis-à-vis the equivalent measure for the top decile of the rest of the world. In this context, the regions,
                      income groups, and countries in brown represent those whose ratio is lower than 0.25—that is, their
                      infrastructure gap is greater than 75 percent. These are the most lagging areas in infrastructure provision.
                      We denote in yellow those areas with a ratio between 0.25 and 0.5 (a gap that is greater than 50 percent
                      but lower than 75 percent). Those with an infrastructure ratio relative to the benchmark between 0.5 and
                      0.75 are represented in light green, whereas those with a ratio greater than 0.75 (that is, a gap less than
                      25 percent) are depicted in dark green.

                      When looking at the region as a whole (as captured by the median across countries in Sub-Saharan
                      Africa) and its different groups classified by income level, all of them (except UMCs) have a gap that
                      exceeds 75 percent relative to the top decile of the world sample in energy-generating capacity as well

as road density and quality (table 2.2, panel A). For telecommunications penetration, the gap for most
regions exceeds 50 percent—except for UMCs (with a gap lower than 10 percent). In the case of total
access to improved water sources, the gap in Sub-Saharan Africa vis-à-vis the benchmark is lower than
50 percent—and it is even lower than 10 percent for UMCs in the region. Qualitatively, these gaps hold
for rural access to improved sources of water.

Table 2.2, panel B, shows the gap for the best and worst performers in the region (relative to the
top 10 percent of the world distribution), as approximated by the top decile, top quartile, bottom
quartile, and bottom decile of the Sub-Saharan Africa distribution. For the bottom percentiles of the
distribution (10th and 25th percentiles), the gap in quantity and quality of infrastructure is greater than
75 percent—regardless of the infrastructure sector. The same holds for access to electricity and access
to sanitation. The gaps for the bottom percentiles are not as large in access to safe water. For the best
performers in the region (75th and 90th percentiles), the performance is still dismal in electric power–
generating capacity. For the top decile of the distribution in Sub-Saharan Africa, there is a narrow gap
in telecommunications penetration (about 20 percent), overall access to electricity, and access to water.
The gaps in energy quality and access to sanitation facilities are moderate.

                Benchmarking Physical Infrastructure across Countries
                in Sub-Saharan Africa

                Regional differences in infrastructure trends may partly reflect the differences across regions in key
                infrastructure drivers—for instance, geographic and demographic factors, as well as real income per
                capita (see Canning 1998). It is far from trivial to assess this hypothesis, since some of these drivers—
                notably, income levels—are themselves affected by infrastructure trends. The cross-regional comparison
                presented in the previous section implicitly takes some of these factors into account, to the extent that
                it focuses on infrastructure stocks normalized by population or labor force (or, in the case of transport
                networks, by country area) and includes benchmark groups among the relevant comparators for Sub-
                Saharan Africa.

                Benchmarking infrastructure sectors across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa involves a systematic
                approach to examining the trends in infrastructure after adjusting for the effect of country-specific
                characteristics. This procedure is conducted in two stages. First, measures of adjusted infrastructure
                quantity—as well as quality and access—and adjusted income per capita are defined by the residuals
                from projecting these variables on indicators of country size (population and/or labor force) and
                geographic characteristics (surface area of the country). Second, the relationship between these
                adjusted measures of infrastructure and per capita income is examined—and this constitutes a partial
                correlation between infrastructure development and the levels of development. This exercise is
                conducted for two time periods: the averages for 1998–2002 and 2008–12. For reasons of space and
                without loss of generality, the focus here is on the benchmarking exercise for the latter period.


                Infrastructure Quantity

                Telecommunications. The partial correlation results show a positive association between
                telecommunications density and real income per capita. This implies that, even after controlling for
                geographic and demographic factors, countries with greater income per capita tend to have a greater
                density of telecommunications. The analysis also finds that there has been a significant increase in
                telecommunications density among some countries in Sub-Saharan Africa over time.

                Given certain idiosyncratic features (say, demographic and geographic characteristics), some countries in
                the region perform above the international norm according to their level of development (as depicted
                by the regression line), while others remain below that norm. For 2008–12, South Africa and Mauritius
                register the highest extent of telecommunications density (as measured by the adjusted fixed and
                mobile lines per 1,000 people), and they are both above the international norm for that period (figure
                2.18). However, some countries have similar levels of telecommunications density as that of South Africa
                but with lower levels of income per capita (say, Paraguay and Jordan), while other countries have similar
                levels of telecommunications density despite having higher levels of development (for example, Greece
                and Turkey).

A closer look at middle-income countries (MICs) in the region, other than South Africa and Mauritius,
shows that most of these countries are below the international norm—especially Gabon, Nigeria,
and Angola. This implies that, for their level of development, there is significant under-provision of
telecommunications services in these countries. Most of the LICs in the region are along or below the
international norm that characterizes the relationship between infrastructure and development. The
weakest performers (as measured by the negative distance to the norm) are Rwanda and Tanzania.
Finally, one of the most improved countries in the provision of telecommunications services is
Ethiopia—a country that shifted from being one of the weakest performers in 1998–2002 to being at the
international norm for its level of development in 2008–12. However, it has improved from a very low
base, and it is still one of the most underachieving countries in the region.

A positive conditional correlation between Internet density and income per capita is also observed,
along with marked progress among countries in Sub-Saharan Africa over time—almost half the Sub-
Saharan African countries in the sample are above the international norm in 2008–12. Nonetheless,
the region still lags behind other developing countries with similar levels of economic development.
For 2008–12, controlling for geographic and demographic variables, Mauritius, Nigeria, and Sudan
show remarkable progress in Internet density (figure 2.18). Other MICs in the region (such as Gabon
and Angola) have a level of Internet density that is significantly below their level of development.
Kenya is significantly above the international norm and has experienced significant progress over the
past decade. LICs in the region with significant under-provision of Internet services according to the
international norm are Ethiopia, Guinea, and Côte d’Ivoire.

Fixed broadband services, which is another quantity variable for telecommunications infrastructure, were
only available in a few countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (only seven) in 1998–2002. With time, in 2008–12,
more countries in Sub-Saharan Africa delivered fixed broadband subscriptions. In the latter period,
Mauritius led all African countries; at the low end were Ethiopia, Malawi, and Guinea.

                                            when compared with infrastructure stocks in telecommunications and power. During this period,
                                            Ghana appears to be the best performing country in the region, with adjusted road density that is not
                                            only higher when compared with other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, but also significantly above

include Guinea and Madagascar. Finally, most of the countries in the region lie close to or below the
international norm for 2008–12.

Another important mode of transportation infrastructure is the railroad sector. The data on the
length of the railroad network are not as complete as those on the road network. There is information
available only for 74 countries for 1998–2002 and 65 countries for 2008–12. Still, there is a positive
and significant relationship between income per capita and rail density. For 2008–12, South Africa
continues to have the highest rail density in the continent, and its rail network remains over the
international norm. The adjusted rail density is larger than those of countries with larger GDP per
capita (for example, Chile and Malaysia, among others). By contrast, Côte d’Ivoire, Cameroon, and
Burkina Faso have underperformed relative to their level of income per capita, and also show the
lowest density of railroads in the region.7


Infrastructure Quality

Telecommunications. Figure 2.21 depicts a positive relationship between international Internet
bandwidth (in bits per second per Internet user) and real income per capita after controlling for
demographic and geographic indicators. One finding that emerges from this analysis is that the partial
correlation between Internet density and income per capita has increased over time (when comparing
1998–2002 vis-à-vis 2008–12), and most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are above the international
norm in the latter period.

                                          a lower percentage of power losses (that is, higher quality of electricity supply). For 2008–12, Mauritius,
                                          Cameroon, Ethiopia, and Mozambique are among the best performers in the region (with the lowest
                                          level of adjusted losses). All these countries overperform when compared with the predicted level of
                                          power losses according to the international norm (figure 2.22, panel a). Togo and Benin, by contrast,
                                          continue to underperform, with massive power losses.

                                          Benchmarking the quality of power infrastructure is complemented by the analysis of WEF perception
                                          measures of the quality of electricity supply. Figure 2.22, panel b, plots a positive partial correlation
                                          between income per capita and the perceived quality of power for 2008–12. For most MICs in Sub-
                                          Saharan Africa, the perceived quality of the power infrastructure sector is lower than what the
                                          international norm predicts for their level of income per capita. However, for some LICs, such as The
                                          Gambia, Côte d’Ivoire, and Rwanda, the perception of the quality of electricity supply is way above the
                                          level predicted by the international norm. Finally, Gabon, Nigeria, Angola, and Guinea have a level of
                                          power quality that is significantly below the one predicted by the international norm.
                                          Transport. Benchmarking the quality of transport infrastructure involves assessing the performance of
                                          African countries on the hard and perceived measures of road and rail quality. Figure 2.23 depicts a
                                          positive relationship between the share of paved roads (a proxy for road quality) and income per capita
                                          for 2008–12. This implies that, after controlling for geographic and demographic factors, countries with
                                          higher income per capita tend to have a greater share of paved roads.
                                          For 2008–12, Mauritius appears to be the leader in the share of paved roads (figure 2.23, panel a). The
                                          country’s (adjusted) share of paved roads is close to the level predicted by the international norm,
                                          and it outperforms countries with greater levels of income per capita (for example, Poland). Tanzania,
                                          Cameroon, Kenya, and Ghana are the weakest performers in the region—with shares of paved roads that
                                          are significantly below those predicted by the international norm.

Figure 2.23, panel b, depicts the partial association between income per capita and the WEF perception
of road quality during 2008–12. The figure confirms the findings of figure 2.23, panel a, that countries
with higher income per capita tend to have better road quality. Perceived quality of the road network is
the highest in South Africa (and above the international benchmark) for 2008–12—thus, outperforming
countries in South America, like Brazil and Colombia. Other MICs in the region (for instance, Nigeria
and Gabon) clearly underperform for their level of income per capita. Among LICs in the region, Guinea
appears to have the lowest level of road quality, whereas the quality of roads in Rwanda and Ethiopia is
far better than the one predicted by the international norm.
Railroad quality also exhibits a direct and positive relationship with income per capita after controlling
for demographic and geographic indicators. The perception of railroad quality is the highest in Gabon,
closely followed by South Africa. Among MICs in the region, the perception of rail quality in Nigeria and
Angola is lower than that predicted by the international norm. In the group of LICs in Sub-Saharan Africa,
Uganda exhibits the largest distance to the international norm.

Infrastructure Access

Electricity. Countries with greater income per capita tend to provide greater access to electricity. This
finding holds after controlling for geography and demography (figure 2.24). For 1998–2012, the countries
with the highest rates of access to electricity are Gabon and Mauritius—with adjusted rates that are
higher than those of countries with similar income per capita (for example, Brazil and Mexico). Several
LICs in this period have weak performance when compared with the international norm, namely, Malawi,
Rwanda, and Lesotho. Over 2008–12, Gabon and Mauritius continued to display higher rates of access
in the region. South Africa moved closer to the international norm. There was improvement over time in
Rwanda and Tanzania, and Malawi remained the weakest performer in electricity access.

                       Recent figures show that Ethiopia has made good progress in terms of extending access to water services. In

                       access to improved sanitation facilities. For 2008–12, Mauritius and South Africa remain along the international
                       norm, while Gabon appears to have fallen off track (figure 2.25, panel b). Over the past decade, Ethiopia moved
                       from being the weakest performer to being close to the access rates predicted by the international norm. Niger,
                       Togo, and Tanzania continue to have the lowest adjusted rates of access in the region.

2.2 INFRASTRUCTURE, GROWTH, AND PRODUCTIVITY
IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA

Introduction

In academic or policy circles, few experts would dispute the view that infrastructure development
fosters growth. However, there is no consensus on the magnitude of the effect or the factors that
shape it. Triggered by Aschauer (1989), there is a massive empirical literature that focuses on the
impact of infrastructure on the level and growth rate of aggregate output or productivity. One strand
of this literature examines the long-term growth impact of infrastructure—primarily using a reduced-
form growth regression framework that links long-term growth to indicators of infrastructure, public
capital, or public investment.8 Growth regressions have used monetary measures of public capital and/
or investment, as well as physical indicators of infrastructure stocks. Using physical indicators renders
invariably significant growth effects. Some studies have focused on single-sector analysis (typically,
indicators of telecommunications penetration or density); others have used synthetic indicators that
capture stocks of physical infrastructure in different sectors—say, telecommunications, electric power,
and transport.


Infrastructure in Sub-Saharan Africa: What Does the Evidence Tells Us?

Empirical research on the impact of infrastructure on long-term growth in Africa has taken off. Ndulu
(2006) presents a diagnostic view of the main issues in infrastructure for the region. Ayogu (2007) surveys
the literature on the growth and productivity effects of infrastructure development. For instance, Estache
2005 estimate an augmented Solow model using pooled ordinary least squares. They find that roads,
power, and telecommunications infrastructure (rather than water and sanitation) have a significant
association with long-run growth in Africa. Other studies follow a production function approach. For
instance, Ayogu (1999) estimates an infrastructure-augmented production function using regional panel
data from Nigeria, and finds a strong association between infrastructure and output. Kamara (2006)
evaluates the dynamic effects of infrastructure in an aggregate production function for a panel of African
countries. Analogously, Boopen (2006) estimates the output contribution of transport infrastructure
using panel data.

Among country studies, South Africa and Nigeria have attracted special attention—partly reflecting
the better quality of their data when compared with other countries in the region. Perkins, Fedderke,
and Luiz 2005 estimate the existence of a long-run relationship between infrastructure (investment and
capital stocks) and real economic activity over a span of 100 years. They find two-way causality for most
of their monetary measures of infrastructure. Kularatne (2005) examines the impact of infrastructure
investment (and spending on health and education) on output. He also finds bi-directional effects;
however, the impact of infrastructure investment is indirect—it boosts growth by crowding in private
investment. Dynkelman (2011) finds a significant impact of household electrification on employment in
South Africa’s rural labor markets.


8	 The growth regression approach often includes standard control variables from the empirical growth literature (see Calderon and Servén 2004, 2010).

                 Few papers address the multidimensionality of infrastructure and its impact on long-term growth.
                 Calderón and Servén (2010) find that the quantity and quality of infrastructure have positive impacts
                 on growth and the distribution of income in Sub-Saharan Africa. Narrowing the infrastructure gap for
                 countries in the region yields significant growth benefits, but the costs of financing are high. More recent
                 evidence for the region shows that there are no short-term growth effects of improved quantity and
                 quality of infrastructure (Kondongo and Ojah 2016). Box 2.2 summarizes some of the microeconomic
                 evidence on the impact of infrastructure sectors on employment and output.



BOX 2.2:         Two distinct approaches have been developed to understand the cross-country differences in aggregate
Microeconomic
                 productivity from a microeconomic perspective. The first approach is to evaluate the drivers of the total

Infrastructure   cross-country differences in the ability to adopt more efficient technologies (Parente and Prescott 1994) or to
in Sub-Saharan
Africa
                 operate technologies efficiently (Bloom, Schankerman, and Van Reenen 2013; Bloom, Draca, and Van Reenen
                 2016). The second approach is to examine resource misallocation as a key factor in accounting for cross-
                 country differences in TFP.

                 The resource allocation process is characterized by: (a) the types of establishments operating in the
                 economy (if newcomers are more productive than incumbents or exiting firms), and, (b) the allocation of
                 labor and capital across establishments in operation. Distortions in either of these two features will lead
                 to resource misallocation and, in turn, lower aggregate TFP. The resource misallocation approach aims not
                 only at quantifying the extent of resource misallocation (indirect approach), but also understanding the
                 underlying sources of misallocation (direct approach)—namely, product and labor market distortions, trade
                 restrictions, financial frictions, informality, entry barriers, and credit market imperfections, among others
                 (Restuccia and Rogerson 2013).

                 In this context, poor infrastructure networks can restrict factor mobility and hamper productivity. Shiferaw
                 et al. (2015) examine the impact of having an improved road network on the entry decision and entry size
                 of manufacturing firms in Ethiopia. The analysis is conducted using geographic information system–based
                 panel data on the road accessibility of Ethiopian towns and census-based panel data for manufacturing
                 firms over 1996–2008. The authors construct three measures of road infrastructure: (a) total distance that
                 can be traveled during a 60-minute drive, (b) total area accessible during the 60-minute drive, and (c)
                 total travel time from a particular locality to major economic destinations.a The evidence shows that: first,
                 the quality of local road infrastructure is positively associated with the number of firms present in the
                 locality. However, the number of firms has no significant relationship with the connectivity of the road
                 infrastructure. Second, the size of new entrants is more strongly associated with connectivity rather than
                 with the quality of the local road infrastructure. In sum, local road infrastructure is important because it
                 enables more firms to set up, but more extensive market connectivity may be important for the entry of
                 large firms. In other words, poor infrastructure could be a source of resource misallocation through the
                 selection channel.

                                                                                                                                                                      Continued
  results from the interplay among sectoral productivities (in agriculture and manufacturing) and
  transportation productivity. Manufacturing goods are produced in urban areas. Agricultural activity takes
  place in near and remote rural areas. There are iceberg transportation costs of moving goods into and
  out of the remote region. Labor is mobile across regions, and people living in remote regions belong
  to the subsistence agriculture sector. After calibrating the model for Sub-Saharan Africa, it is found that
  improvements in agricultural productivity and lower costs of intermediate inputs free up labor from the
  agriculture sector—primarily from subsistence agriculture. Improving transport productivity (lower iceberg
  transportation costs) helps move individuals from subsistence agriculture into manufacturing, leaving the
  share of workers living in the near region unchanged. A boost in manufacturing productivity alone, by
  contrast, lowers the share of population in subsistence agriculture, but the magnitude of this effect is lower
  than that of greater agricultural productivity or lower transport costs. Therefore, structural transformation
  at low levels of development is mainly driven by productivity surges in agriculture and transportation.
  Economically speaking, a 10 percent increase in agricultural TFP combined with a 10 percent reduction
  in transport costs leads to a 14-percentage-point reduction in the labor share in subsistence agriculture.
  The welfare effects are significant—comparable to raising consumption per capita in the economy by
  62 percent.

  Other research papers provide evidence that deficient infrastructure hinders Africa’s development. There
  is evidence that an unreliable supply of electricity deters firm-level investment in Uganda (Reinikka and
  Svensson 1999). Insufficient power-generating capacity limits growth in Ghana (Estache and Vagliasindi
  2007). Poor transport infrastructure also imposes a high cost in the region. Diao and Yanoma (2003) show
  that growth in the agriculture sector is constrained by high marketing costs, which largely reflect poor
  transport (as well as other infrastructure) facilities. In general, it is found that higher costs of transportation
  alter the incentives for agricultural investment (Renkow, Hallstrom, and Karanja 2004; Stifel and Minten
  2008). Overall, deficient infrastructure hinders the growth impact of private investment—especially foreign
  direct investment—in Africa (Lumbila 2005).

  the connectivity of firms with local and distant markets.




Growth Benefits of Closing Sub-Saharan Africa’s Infrastructure Gap
Computing Growth Benefits

Since Aschauer’s (1989) seminal work on infrastructure, more sophisticated techniques have been
developed to compute the short- and long-run effects of infrastructure on growth. Researchers have
used monetary measures of public capital and/or investment (Devajaran et al. 1996) or physical stocks
(Calderon and Serven 2004, 2010). Estimating the impact of infrastructure should address the issues of:
(a) multidimensionality at the sector level, (b) improving the quantity and/or enhancing the quality of
infrastructure, and (c) ameliorating issues of likely endogeneity and reverse causality.

                Computing the growth benefits of narrowing the infrastructure gap in Sub-Saharan Africa is not trivial.
                It will depend on several factors, including (a) the economic approach used to examine this impact,
                (b) the infrastructure sectors included in the analysis, (c) the econometric techniques utilized, and
                (d) the sample of countries. This section uses the empirical estimation undertaken by Calderón and
                Servén (2010), that is, a cross-country panel data regression model that includes synthetic indicators
                of the quantity and quality of infrastructure. The analysis also uses other control variables that exert
                an influence on growth per capita, namely, education, financial development, trade openness, lack of
                price stability, government burden, institutional quality, and terms-of-trade shocks (see table 2.3). The
                econometric methodology and description of the instrument sets are summarized in box 2.3.

                The synthetic measure of infrastructure quantity, IK1, is the first principal component of three variables:
                (fixed and mobile) phone lines per 1,000 people (Z1/L), electric power–generating capacity expressed
                in MW per 1,000 people (Z2/L), and the length of the road network in km per square km of arable
                land (Z3/A). Each of these variables is expressed in logs and standardized by subtracting its mean and
                dividing by its standard deviation. The three infrastructure stocks enter the first principal component
                with roughly similar weights:

                                    IK1 = 0.6036 ln   (–)

                                                                          Z2
                                                                          L
                                                                             + 0.5096 ln    (–)
                                                                                              Z3
                                                                                              A

                We compute a synthetic index of infrastructure quality by computing the first principal component
                of the (arithmetic inverse of ) electric power transmission and distribution losses as a percentage of
                output (Q2), and the share of paved roads in the total road network (Q3). The first principal component is
                defined as: IQ1 = 0.7071 ln (Q2) + 0.7071 ln (Q3).


                Table 2.3 yields a positive and significant coefficient estimate for the infrastructure quantity index
                that is robust to the various sets of instruments used. Hence, expanding infrastructure quantity
                contributes positively to long-term growth—although the coefficient estimate is smaller when using
                external instruments than when using internal ones (columns [3] and [1], respectively). Furthermore,
                infrastructure quality also contributes positively to long-term growth. In this case, the coefficient
                estimate is larger when using external instruments than otherwise.

BOX 2.3:         The econometric technique used to estimate the impact of infrastructure on long-term growth is the
Measuring
                 system generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator (Arellano and Bover 1995; Blundell and
the Impact of
Infrastructure   Bond 1998), which combines the growth equation expressed in first differences—using lagged levels
on Growth        of the regressors as internal instruments—and in levels—using lagged differences of the regressors as
                 instruments. In addition to internal instruments (lagged levels and differences of the regressors), the
                 analysis also uses demographic and geographic variables as external instruments.
                 The consistency of the system GMM estimator depends on the validity of the internal and external
                 instruments. In turn, this is examined through two specification tests: first, the test of over-identifying
                 restrictions (Hansen and Difference-Sargan tests), which tests the null hypothesis that instruments are
                 uncorrelated with the estimated residuals. Failure to reject the null hypothesis gives support to the model.
                 Second, the analysis uses tests of serial correlation of the residual, where the null hypothesis is that the
                 estimated residuals of the regressions in differences do not exhibit second-order serial correlation. Again,
                 failure to reject the null hypothesis gives support to the model.
                 The standard errors of the efficient two-step system GMM estimator are significantly downward biased in
                 small samples. The bias arises from the fact that the approximation to the asymptotic standard errors does
                 not account for the extra small-sample variation due to the use of estimated parameters in constructing
                 the efficient weighting matrix. Windmeijer (2005) proposes a correction that accounts for this fact. The
                 correction term vanishes with increasing sample size and provides a better approximation in finite samples
                 when all moment conditions are linear.
                 Table 2.3 reports the GMM estimates of the parameters of the growth regression augmented by the
                 synthetic indexes of infrastructure performance (quantity IK1 and quality IQ1, respectively). Columns [1]
                 to [3] in the table report the coefficient estimates of the baseline growth regression equation including
                 the synthetic quantity and quality indicators in the regression. This baseline specification is estimated
                 using three sets of instruments for infrastructure: (a) lagged synthetic IK1 and IQ1 indicators (column
                 [1]), (b) lagged values of the individual components of the synthetic indicators (quantity and quality of
                 telecommunications, power, and transport) (column [2]), and (c) lagged values of external instruments,
                 namely, urban population, labor force, and population density (column [3]).

                 Using the regression estimates in column [2] in Table 2.3, the growth effects of narrowing the
                 infrastructure gap of Sub-Saharan African countries is computed. Two scenarios are presented: first,
                 closing the gap of the region as well as selected groups within the region relative to the world
                 median (excluding Sub-Saharan Africa) of the infrastructure distribution. The second scenario involves
                 closing the infrastructure gap relative to the world’s top decile of the infrastructure distribution. Table
                 2.3 depicts the region’s gap for the second scenario.

                 infrastructure relative to the median of the world (excluding Sub-Saharan Africa) for each infrastructure
                 sector.9 For instance, growth in GDP per capita for the region would increase by 1.7 percentage points
                 per year if it were to close the gap with the regional median of each infrastructure indicator.

                 9	 If the contribution is zero, there is no gap between the region (and/or subregion in Sub-Saharan Africa) and the benchmark.

the infrastructure gaps observed
in LICs and LMCs. The distance
to the benchmark (and, hence, the growth effect) is greater for LICs in electric power installed capacity;
it is greater for quality of roads among LMCs. UMCs in the region only trail the world median in electric
power installed capacity. The gap is narrow and so are the growth benefits (about 0.05 percentage point
per year). Narrowing the infrastructure gap among the worst performers in the region (the bottom 10
percent) improves growth per capita by 3 percentage points per year (2 percentage points attributed
to closing quantity gaps), while it is only about 0.5 percentage point per year (0.2 percentage point
attributed to closing quality gaps) for the best performers (the top 10 percent).

                potential benefits come from closing the gap in electric power–generating capacity and the length of the
                road network.

                The growth benefits for the region are directly related to the potential gains of narrowing the gap for
                LICs and LMCs in the region. Energy appears to be a more binding constraint among LICs, whereas
                roads are the most binding constraint among LMCs—in quantity and quality. The growth rate of the
                worst performer in the region (bottom 10 percent) would be 3.9 percentage points higher per year, if
                it were to close its infrastructure gap with the top decile of the world distribution. About two-thirds of

                the region, growth per capita might increase by 1.3 percentage points per year in this scenario (with 0.8
                percentage point attributed to closing the quantity gap). Even for the top performers, the sectors with
                the greatest potential contributions to growth are electric power and roads.
                Although the focus is on supply-side issues for infrastructure, the demand side also requires
                consideration. This is especially the case for electricity. Box 2.4 shows that, in the case of electricity, there
                are important drivers of lower demand (lower uptake) among countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.

                         Note: Panel a shows take-up rates of electricity in 31 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The take-up rate is the share of households connected to the
                         grid to households living under the grid. Panel b shows the take-up rate across regions in Uganda, which has a national access rate of 24 percent and
                         take-up rate of only 45 percent.

Low take-up is an important issue for understanding the demand side of electricity, especially given that                                                                          BOX 2.4
most off-grid communities are rural and poorer—hence, ceteris paribus, take-up rates would be even lower                                                                           Continued
in such areas if they were covered. This situation underscores the need for a deeper understanding of the
constraints on the demand side and the incentives for take-up. To make electricity expansion financially
viable and incentivize private sector participation in the sector, take-up rates need to be higher.

     agriculture in gross domestic product is negatively associated with rates of electrification take-up.
     However, the modernization of agriculture (energy use for mills and irrigation) may foster some
     electricity expansion, which otherwise will not be financially viable due to insufficient demand
     (Banerjee and Malik 2016).
(3)	 Household evidence. Not only the level of income, but also its flow and predictability have an impact
     on the ability of households to connect to electricity services. Hence, the creation and enhancement of
     income-generating activities would raise take-up and enable households (businesses), the government
     (through taxes), and the utilities (revenues) to overcome financial constraints. Improvement in this area
     implies providing credit facilities to bundle access to electricity with access to certain appliances, to
     foster economic activity.

     issues in the electricity market. The report will examine these issues by interacting the decision-making
     process of households, regulators, and utility companies.

                Infrastructure Gap, Financing Gap

                The evidence shows that there are severe infrastructure bottlenecks to be addressed in Sub-Saharan
                Africa, and the potential growth benefits of addressing these bottlenecks are large.

                However, fast-paced infrastructure catch-up requires the mobilization of resources for financing. The
                private sector has fairly limited involvement in the various infrastructure sectors across the region,
                except in South Africa. If the additional spending that is needed to close the infrastructure gap falls
                on the public sector, it imposes a heavy burden. First, the countries have limited domestic resource
                mobilization. Total government revenues fall short of 20 percent of GDP in many countries in Sub-
                Saharan Africa. Second, in the presence of scarce resources, governments must compare the benefits of
                investment in infrastructure relative to those of other pressing demands (such as education and health,
                among others).

                Narrowing the infrastructure gap requires financing. It has been estimated that the infrastructure needs
                of the region exceed US$93 billion per year over the next decade. That amount is about 15 percent of the
                region’s GDP (Foster and Briceño-Garmendia 2010). To date, less than half that amount is being provided:
                actual investments in infrastructure amount to US$45 billion annually—with more than half being
                funded by the public sector. This leaves a financing gap of US$48 billion per year. Estimates show that
                about one-third of the infrastructure gap can be met through operational optimization, thus narrowing
                the gap to US$31 billion (5 percent of the region’s GDP). Public-private partnerships could potentially
                represent 40 percent of this optimized gap, with an amount of US$12 billion annually, or about 2 percent
                of GDP (figure 2.28).10

                When the government drastically reduces growth-promoting spending (for example, in infrastructure,
                education, and health care), the present value of future government revenues falls by more than
                the immediate improvement in the cash deficit (Easterly, Irwin, and Serven 2008). Targeting short-
                term government cash flows introduces an anti-investment bias into fiscal discipline, which can turn
                into lower future growth and, hence, adverse consequences for the sustainability of public finances
                (Serven 2007).

                Financing public infrastructure investment will indeed depend on a country’s fiscal position. The
                real effects, more generally, would depend on how public investment is financed and the existing
                levels of debt and various taxes. Christie and Rioja (2012) developed a two-sector endogenous
                growth model to examine the impact on long-term growth of the composition and financing
                of infrastructure spending. The authors find that: (a) raising taxes to fund public investment may
                promote long-run growth in an environment where tax rates are not high; (b) public investment
                promotes growth if the investment is funded by restructuring the composition of total public
                spending, if tax rates are high; and (c) debt-financed public spending can have adverse effects on
                long-run growth if the spending results in rising interest rates and debt-servicing costs.




                10	 Recently, the African Development Bank launched an initiative, called Program for Infrastructure Development in Africa, to increase infrastructure provision. The main objective of the
                    program is to build a strategic network for the development of regional and continental economic infrastructure over 2012–40.

   The cascade approach has four levels of diagnosis (figure B2.5.1). The starting point is to identify
   whether a development program can be financed on commercial terms. When diagnosed as
   commercially viable and cost effective without government guarantees, then the investment is not a
   priority for concessional or public financing. When commercial financing is not viable, due to perceived
   risks or market failures, upstream reforms to strengthen policies, regulations, and institutions and
   capacity are needed. If risk and cost remain high, governments need to explore the possibility for
   lowering financing costs by deploying concessional and public resources in risk-sharing instruments,
   such as guarantees. Finally, where commercial financing is not cost-effective or viable, despite sector
   reform and risk mitigation, governments need to mobilize public and concessional resources.

2.3	 PUBLIC INVESTMENT IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA

Introduction
Sub-Saharan Africa’s two decades of unprecedented economic performance beginning in mid-
1990, coined as Africa Rising, was characterized by many countries in the region growing at a rate
that exceeded 5 percent per year. Africa Rising’s earlier narrative attributes the region’s rapid growth
to external tailwinds, progress in macroeconomic management, and robust public investment. As
economies in the region decelerated in the post-crisis period, there was a significant countercyclical
effort to support aggregate demand among countries in the region, which was partly reflected in a large
increase in public investment. For instance, the cumulative increase in public investment exceeded 5
percentage points of GDP in Togo, Guinea, and Ethiopia during 2008–15.

This section first documents stylized facts on public investment in Sub-Saharan Africa: (a) trends
in public investment compared with other regions and across subregions in Sub-Saharan Africa,
(b) the interplay between public and private investment (whether public investment crowds in or
crowds out private investment), and (c) the behavior of public investment along the business cycle
(whether public investment has been pro- or counter-cyclical). Next, the section takes a preliminary
look at capital spending on infrastructure across 24 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, using the BOOST
program. This initiative takes a granular approach to government accounts and uncovers information
on capital spending as well as capital allocations—which enables us to distinguish actual expenditure
and the extent of under-execution of investment programs. Finally, the section takes stock of PPPs
in infrastructure in the region, focusing not only on the uptake of this mode of financing, but also
the country and sectoral breakdowns, project types, structure of financing, type of support from the
government or multilateral development banks, and revenue sources, among others.


Public Investment across Sub-Saharan Africa:
Trends, Complementarities, and Cyclicality 	

Public investment as a percentage of GDP in the region shows three marked periods: (a) a rising trend
in the 1970s that reached a peak of about 7.8 percent in 1977–78, (b) a steady decline throughout
the 1980s and stagnation in the 1990s that reached a trough of 3 percent of GDP in 2002, and (c) an
increase in public investment that reached a peak of 5.8 percent of GDP in 2014. When comparing public
investment across regions, East Asia and the Pacific outperforms all other regions, with levels of public
capital spending that exceed 10 percent of GDP (figure 2.29)

Focusing on averages for Sub-Saharan Africa masks the heterogeneity across country groups.
Disaggregating the data by countries’ resource abundance shows different trends and phases in public
investment across country groups (figure 2.30). On average, in oil-rich countries, public investment has
followed a rising path since the early 1990s. After reaching a peak of about 6.9 percent of GDP in 2006-08,
public investment among oil-rich countries declined sharply, to 3.1 percent of GDP in 2015, partly due to
lower commodity-based public revenues. For non-oil-resource-rich countries and non-resource countries,
public investment has experienced a steady increase since 2006 (with a cumulative gain up to 2015 of
about 2.8 and 2.9 percentage points of GDP, respectively).

Public Investment: Crowding-In or Crowding-Out Private Investment

The interaction between public and private investment remains a subject of controversy. Do public and
private investment have different growth effects? If they both matter for growth, what are the possible
links between them? If public investment crowds in, say, the participation of (domestic and/or foreign)
private investors in transportation or energy projects, the relevant policy question becomes how to
maximize the complementarities and prioritize public investment in sectors with high productivity
and/or large positive spillover effects (for example, infrastructure). By contrast, if private investment
is crowded out by public investment, the relevant policy question is what can be done to reduce this
crowding-out effect, so that countries can reap more benefits from higher public investment (Cavallo
and Daude 2011).

Figure 2.31 depicts the correlation between public and private investment ratios for 45 countries in
the region over 1970–2015. The correlation ranges from -0.59 (Equatorial Guinea) to 0.85 (Chad), and
the regional median (average) public-private investment correlation is 0.11 (0.08). Two findings emerge
from this figure: first, 19 of 45 countries display a negative correlation between public and private
investment, and the median correlation for these 19 countries is -0.275. Second, there is a positive
association between private and public investment for 26 of 45 countries, and their median correlation
is 0.282. In other words, the evidence suggests that public and private investment are substitutes in 19
countries, and complements in 26 countries. Although central measures of correlation do not appear
to be large, there are countries where either the degree of substitutability is important (say, Equatorial
Guinea, Zambia, South Africa, and Senegal) or the extent of complementarity (say, Botswana, Zimbabwe,
Rwanda, and Chad).

                To reduce the crowding-out effect of public investment on private investment or to foster crowding-in
                effects, there is the need to formulate policies that elevate the marginal product of capital or alleviate
                financial constraints (Aschauer 1989; Cavallo and Daude 2011). In this context, policies to foster
                institutional quality and/or enhance access to international credit markets will help to reduce the
                substitutability or increase the complementarity between private and public investment. The correlates
                of the degree of substitutability/complementarity between public and private investment and measures
                of institutional quality, financial openness, and financial development are examined.

                Cavallo and Daude (2011) estimate the private investment equation for 116 countries for 1980 to
                2006, using dynamic panel data techniques that address issues of unobserved components and
                reverse causality. On average, they find a negative effect of public investment on private investment
                in developing countries: a 1 percentage point increase in public investment (as a percentage of GDP)
                reduces private investment by 0.22 percentage points. This finding suggests that the crowding-out
                effects of public investment through weak public institutions or borrowing constraints tend to outweigh
                the crowding-in effects from the rising marginal product of private capital.12 Raising the efficiency of
                public investment and improving the ability to crowd in private investment should be at the top of the
                policy agenda. In this context, efforts to improve institutions (at the country and project levels) and
                implement policies to alleviate borrowing constraints (say, creating fiscal space and fostering financial
                openness) are necessary.

                Table 2.4 presents a simple analysis of the correlates of the interaction between private and public
                investment for three samples: developing countries, developing countries excluding Sub-Saharan Africa,
                and countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.13 Some preliminary findings emerge from the table: (a) political
                stability and government effectiveness have a positive (although not statistically significant) association
                with the interaction between private and public investment among developing countries (excluding
                Sub-Saharan Africa); (b) developing domestic financial markets may help boost the effectiveness of
                public investment to crowd in private investment; (c) an analogous result to (b) is observed when foreign
                capital flows into developing countries (as captured by a widened current account deficit); and (d) the
                correlates are weak when the regression analysis is restricted to countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. In sum,
                alleviating borrowing constraints—through deepening local financial markets or fostering financial
                openness—is associated with rising complementarities between public and private investment.




                12	 The empirical findings of Cavallo and Daude (2011) are consistent with those of Blejer and Khan (1984) and Everhart and Sumlinski (2001). The latter two papers use a smaller sample of
                    countries and earlier sample periods.
                13	 This regression analysis captures associations at the cross-sectional level rather than causality. The analysis is not as exhaustive as the one presented in Cavallo and Daude (2011).

Public Investment along the Business Cycle in Sub-Saharan Africa

Fiscal policy in developing countries tends to be procyclical. Governments typically cut taxes and
increase spending during booms, and retrench outlays—especially capital expenditure—and implement
tax hikes during busts (Kaminsky, Reinhart, and Végh 2004). In the literature, this destabilizing policy
behavior has been attributed to the limited access to (external) funding for policy actions or political
economy distortions.

Historically, fiscal policy has behaved pro-cyclically among countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (Thornton
2008; Lledó, Yackovlev, and Gadenne 2011). The degree of procyclicality has been not only greater
than that of other developing countries, but also higher in the 1980s and 1990s (Lledó, Yackovlev, and
Gadenne 2011). Greater foreign aid inflows and fiscal space have played an important role in reducing
the degree of fiscal policy pro-cyclicality among countries in the region.

Figure 2.32 depicts the correlation between the cyclical components of the ratio of public investment
to GDP and the level of output across 45 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa for 1970–2015: 26 of the 45
countries exhibit a negative correlation between public investment and the level of economic activity,
while 19 countries show a positive association. For those countries with a countercyclical relationship
between public investment and the level of economic activity, the median correlation is about -0.12
(South Africa). The countries with the largest negative correlation (exceeding -0.25) are The Gambia,
Mauritius, Burkina Faso, Lesotho, Swaziland, and Sierra Leone. The median correlation for the countries
with a procyclical relationship between public investment and the level of economic activity is 0.14 (Côte
d’Ivoire). The countries with the largest positive correlation (exceeding 0.35) are Sudan, Madagascar,
Rwanda, Gabon, and the Central African Republic.

                                   Table 2.5 looks at the correlates of the extent of cyclicality of public investment on the level of
                                   institutional quality, amount of external financing (as proxied by the current account balance as a
                                   percentage of GDP), and depth of local financial markets. The regression estimates show that:

                                   (a)	 Public spending tends to be less procyclical or more countercyclical in countries with stronger
                                          institutions. It has been argued in the literature that public investment tends to be higher and more
                                          procyclical in countries with bad institutions. This reflects the enhanced rent-seeking incentives
                                          of governments in environments with insecure property rights (Keefer and Knack 2007; Alesina,
                                          Campante, and Tabellini 2008) and/or environments with common pool problems (Tornell and
                                          Lane 1999).14

                                   (b)	 Public spending is more procyclical in countries with more inflows of foreign capital (that is, when
                                          the current account is in deficit). This finding is attributed to the fact that developing countries are
                                          unable to borrow in bad times—as these countries have procyclical access to global capital markets
                                          (Gavin and Perotti 1997; Catao and Sutton 2002).

                                   In sum, stronger institutions supporting macroeconomic policies tend to be related to a lower extent
                                   of pro-cyclicality (and even counter-cyclicality) of capital spending. Access to global financial markets,
                                   by contrast, contributes to a larger degree of pro-cyclicality. These findings are consistent with those of
                                   Calderon and Nguyen (2016).




                                   14	 Analogously, public health and education spending has a positive and significant impact on child mortality and education failure rates only in countries with good governance (Rajkumar
                                       and Swaroop 2008).

Public Capital Spending in Infrastructure: BOOST Program Measures

Capital spending represents a major share of expenditures for national and subnational governments,
and a critical instrument to lift people out of poverty by promoting economic growth and improving
access to basic services. The recognition of the critical role that well-designed and efficiently
implemented investments in infrastructure can play in addressing these access gaps and fostering
potential GDP gains is well documented (for example, Calderón and Servén 2010; Bom and Ligthart 2008;
Calderon, Moral Benito, and Serven 2015). The relevance of the role of such investments is also reflected
in the Sustainable Development Goals and International Development Association (IDA) 18 frameworks,
which place a much needed emphasis on the need to significantly scale up investments in infrastructure
for the positive, cross-cutting spillover effects they can generate in promoting shared prosperity and
poverty alleviation.

Despite the consensus on the relevance of investing in infrastructure as an accelerator for long-term
growth and poverty alleviation, there still exists very little knowledge about how much is being spent,
how well, and with what results. This lack of information is particularly compelling in Sub-Saharan Africa,
where infrastructure needs are most acute and the overall quality of fiscal statistics is problematic.
Without a strong empirical baseline of current public spending in infrastructure and a robust set of
granular data and performance metrics, it is difficult to: (a) identify which geographic areas and sectors
are being underserved, (b) assess whether policy stances are being translated into actions, and (c) isolate
critical bottlenecks that are undermining efficiency in public investment management systems across
the developing world.

Leveraging the wealth of micro fiscal data collected by the BOOST initiative (box 2.6), this subsection
offers a baseline of public spending on infrastructure in Africa. Using an initial sample of 24 countries
in Sub-Saharan Africa for 2009 to 2015, the subsection examines overall annual trends, execution rates,

                 of their systems in producing high-quality data. Despite the preliminary nature of this work, and the
                 need for further refinements in data quality and expansion to additional countries in the region, some
                 important findings have already emerged. (See annex 2A on data challenges.)

                 transparency, and accountability. Since its launch, the program has centered its activities around
                 three work streams: (a) supporting expenditure analysis, (b) advancing fiscal transparency and public
                 dissemination of budget data, and (c) improving public financial management processes and systems.

                 Using the government’s data from public expenditure accounts held in the governments’ financial
                 management information systems, and benefiting from a consistent methodology, the program
                 transforms highly granular fiscal data into accessible and readily available formats to facilitate expenditure
                 analysis. The program has designed and delivered more than 60 national and subnational BOOST data
                 sets in standardized formats, whose contents are country specific. Each data set typically allows for
                 approved, revised, and executed budgets to be cross-referenced across years with categories such as:

                 •	   Government levels (central or local)
                 •	   Administrative units (ministries, departments, agencies, schools, hospitals, and so forth)
                 •	   Subnational authorities (districts, municipalities, and other local government units)
                 •	   Economic classification categories (staff salaries, procurement of goods, and so forth)
                 •	   Sources of funding (budget funds, off-budget funds, external finance, and so forth)
                 •	   Budget programs (if the country uses a program-based budgeting system).
                 An expanding work stream of the BOOST program focuses on providing support for government efforts
                 around fiscal transparency and citizen participation in the budget process. To this end, the program
                 facilitated the dissemination of country BOOST data sets via (a) the World Bank’s Open Budgets Portal,
                 which has already witnessed the release of more than 40 million line items of expenditure data, and
                 (b) development of country-owned web portals, such as in the cases of Burundi, Haiti, Paraguay, Togo,
                 and Tunisia. The Open Budgets Portal is the largest repository of micro fiscal data in the world, offering
                 invaluable resources for stakeholders involved in the systematic use of fiscal data in their countries
                 or globally, as a catalyst to motivate other countries into action. The portal is accessible at www.
                 worldbank.org/openbudgets.
                 a BOOST is not an acronym. It is the name of a new data tool developed at the World Bank to help enhance public sector performance.

Current Spending Levels Are Too Low to Address Infrastructure Needs

A summary of the stylized facts of capital spending in infrastructure for the sample of 24 countries in
Sub-Saharan Africa across the main infrastructure subsectors—roads, water, air transport, electricity,
telecommunications, and water and sanitation—for 2009–15 is presented below. The sample accounts
for about 70 percent of the regional GDP, and is compared with five countries from other regions,
namely, Albania, Guatemala, Moldova, Peru, and Tunisia. The list of countries in the sample along with
basic indicators on data quality is presented in annex 2b.

and water supply and sanitation
each accounted for 15 percent of

2.33). Overall, actual spending on
infrastructure was considerably
lower than capital allocations during the same period, amounting to around 3.4 percent of GDP,
reflecting substantial under-execution of such investments.

Figure 2.34 shows that there is a positive relationship between capital spending and income per capita;
that is, wealthier countries tend to investment more on average—although with notable exceptions. For
instance, São Tomé and Príncipe, Lesotho, and Ethiopia exhibited high spending levels during the period,
despite low per capita income levels, while Namibia underspent vis-a-vis the expected threshold for its
income level.

The quality of governance and institutional capacity has a dual impact on the size of capital spending.
On one hand, the overall size of infrastructure capital allocations tend to be larger among countries with
low to moderate institutional quality as measured by the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI). This
is consistent with the notion that countries with lower levels of governance might allocate more on
infrastructure due to greater rent-seeking behavior, lack of technical capacity to prepare projects, among
other things (figure 2.35). On the other hand, under-execution rates (as measured by the gap between
capital allocation and spending) are more pervasive in countries with low to moderate levels of governance
effectively reducing the size of actual capital spending (figures 2.35 and 2.40). This finding is consistent
with the prevailing notion that countries with good governance tend to exhibit higher growth rates in the
long run, as a result of higher efficiency, quality and effectiveness of infrastructure investments.

percent or more between 2009 and 2015, driven mostly by allocation increases in roads (figure 2.37). On
the other side of the spectrum, São Tomé and Príncipe, Lesotho, Angola, and Benin recorded the largest
percentage decreases in public capital allocations in infrastructure from 2009 levels. Although São Tomé
and Príncipe, Lesotho, and Angola continue to experience large levels overall (5.6, 4.2, and 4.5 percent of
GDP, respectively), the slowing pace of capital allocations in Benin—driven mostly by roads and water and
sanitation—is more problematic in light of lower spending levels overall and acute infrastructure gaps.

High Dependence on Foreign Aid Can Crowd Out Domestic Sources

Foreign aid continues to play an important role in some of the infrastructure subsectors. Although the
share of the overall capital budget allocations funded through external aid decreased from 39 percent in
2009 to 36 percent in 2015, the distribution of this change was different across sectors. Road transport
is the sector with the greatest share of domestic contribution, with the foreign funded share steadily
accounting for around 30 percent of total allocations (figure 2.38, panel a).

                For electricity, there has been a substantial increase in foreign funded projects, driven mainly by the
                infrastructure push embedded in the “Power Africa” initiative (figure 2.38, panel b). Uganda, Angola,
                Kenya, and Burkina Faso are among the countries in the sample that recorded the largest increases in
                foreign funded capital allocations in the sector. However, the data suggest that the increased reliance
                on foreign funding might be crowding out domestic spending in the sector, making it particularly
                vulnerable to sudden drops in aid volume (as experienced in 2015), as well as the unpredictability of
                funding that is typical of these interventions.

                Capital spending in water and sanitation is also vulnerable to sudden drops in foreign assistance and
                crowding out of domestic capital. The significant decrease of foreign funds devoted to this sector since
                2012—moving from 60 percent to less than 50 percent of the total—was the main driver behind a
                corresponding decrease in overall capital allocations by Sub-Saharan African countries in the sample,
                moving from 1 percent of GDP in 2012 to less than 0.5 percent in 2015 (figure 2.38, panel c). In Niger
                and Benin, for instance, foreign assistance traditionally accounted for a major share of total capital
                allocations. When foreign assistance was reduced in 2015, this generated a significant drop in overall
                capital allocations in the sector. Similar patterns were found in Mozambique, Tanzania, and Sierra Leone,
                although overall capital reductions were less significant. Given the strategic importance of improving
                the size and quality of public spending in the sector, it is imperative for African countries to reduce their
                exposure to and reliance on foreign aid, by striving to reach a better balance of funding sources for the
                sector toward greater domestic mobilization.


                Under-Execution Affects the Efficiency of Public Investment

                Analyzing the under-execution of public investment is important for assessing the magnitude of
                efficiency losses, and examining the underlying determinants of these inefficiencies. This analysis focuses
                on the difference between what was originally approved versus what was actually spent in any given
                year. Focusing on the deviations from original approved budgets (rather than mid-year supplementary
                budgets) enables the assessment of the level of credibility built into approved capital budgets.
                Given the uneven availability of spending of foreign funded aid, the analysis relies on examining the
                deviation between capital allocations and execution of domestic funded projects. This provides a better
                assessment of the ability of national systems to implement capital projects.

                The Sub-Saharan Africa region displays very large levels of under-execution. On average, over 30 percent
                of total domestic allocations was not executed annually from 2009 to 2015. This amounted to almost 1
                percent of GDP per year remaining unspent on capital infrastructure. Roads account for two-thirds of the
                total underspending, well above underspending in electricity and water and sanitation (figure 2.39). This
                is particularly worrisome, since most of the domestic resources are mobilized toward roads, with capital
                spending on electricity and water and sanitation still dominated by foreign assistance.

                Several factors account for these levels of under-execution. Historically, most African countries have taken a
                residual approach to capital spending, which often results in mid-year decreases in disbursement in typical
                scenarios of over-optimistic revenue projections leading to in-year prioritization toward recurrent expenses.
                Further drivers include late releases in countries without a proper medium-term capital commitment

faced by many developing
countries is understanding
the factors hindering the
implementation of public investment projects. The ability of public investment management systems
to provide an accurate, integrated view of the project cycle is very weak, especially in low-capacity
countries across Africa. In the few countries where the financial management systems capture individual
project information, the data recorded are typically limited to that year’s budget, allocation, and
expenditure amounts.17

A recent study carried out by the Construction Sector Transparency Initiative—a multi-stakeholder

phases in eight countries—including four countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (Ethiopia, Malawi, Tanzania,

                 the lifespan of the asset. In this context, very few countries in Sub-Saharan Africa provide a precise
                 distinction between pure capital expenditure—that is, gross capital formation—and the operational
                 expenses of the investment. A best case scenario is represented by Namibia, which neatly distinguishes
                 between the two categories, allowing for quick visualization of the ratio of gross capital formation versus
                 related operational expenditures.


                 Public-Private Partnerships in Sub-Saharan Africa

                 Amid heightened interest in crowding-in private investment, there is renewed interest in public-private
                 PPPs. PPPs in Sub-Saharan Africa remain a very small market. The development of PPPs, which has
                 been slow, started in the early 1990s, beginning with projects in South Africa and Côte d’Ivoire in 1990.
                 Eventually, PPPs spread to 41 of the 48 countries in the region, most recently Botswana and Somalia in
                 2011 and 2013, respectively. Burundi, Eritrea, Equatorial Guinea, Mauritania, the Seychelles, South Sudan,
                 and Swaziland do not have any PPPs. According to the World Bank’s Private Participation in Infrastructure
                 (PPI) database, there are 335 PPPs18 in infrastructure19 projects in Sub-Saharan Africa that have reached
                 financial closure20 in the past 25 years.


                 18	 A PPP is defined as “any contractual arrangement between a public entity or authority and a private entity, for providing a public asset or service, in which the private party bears significant
                     risk and management responsibility.”
                 19	 Infrastructure refers to the energy, transport, and water and sanitation sectors, as defined by the PPI database (www.ppi.worldbank.org).
                 20	 The definition of financial or contractual closure varies among types of private participation as a result of the availability of public information. (a) For management and lease contracts,
                     a contract authorizing the commencement of management or lease service must be signed with the private consortium assuming the operation of the services. (b) For brownfield
                     concession projects, contractual closure is reached when the concession agreement is signed and the date for taking over the operations is set. (c) For greenfield projects, financial closure
                     is the date whereby (i) there is the existence of a legally binding commitment of equity holders and/or debt financiers to provide or mobilize funding for the full cost of the project; and
                     (ii) the conditions for funding have been met and the first tranche of funding is mobilized. If this information is not available, the construction start date is used as an estimated financial
                     closure date. (d) For divestitures, the equity holders must have a legally binding commitment to acquire the assets of the facility. Such commitment usually occurs at the signing of the
                     share purchase contract.

and another 13 have
produced only two or three in the past 25 years. The low number of PPPs in these countries can be
attributed to the fact that some are small economies; others have been in conflict for several years; or
they have weak legal and regulatory frameworks for procuring and implementing PPPs.

Overall, the number of PPP infrastructure projects in the region is a relatively small proportion of the
total number of projects in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs), ranging from 2 to
12 percent.21 Because the proportion is so small, in figure 2.42, the scale for the number of projects in
Sub-Saharan Africa has been expanded; the right scale shows the fluctuations over the years. Although
growth has been evident in the past 25 years, it has been somewhat less pronounced in Sub-Saharan
Africa than in the rest of the EMDEs, with slightly more volatility as well.

This pattern also holds when we look at PPP investment commitments in Sub-Saharan Africa, which
make up only a small portion (2–10 percent) of total EMDE investment. When adjusting the data by the
size of the economy, it can be observed that before the Asian financial crisis (1997–98), PPP investment
as a percentage of GDP was clearly below the average for the rest of the EMDEs, reaching a peak of 0.2
percent in 1997 compared with 1.1 percent for the rest of the EMDEs (figure 2.42). However, after the
Asian financial crisis, investment as a percentage of GDP fluctuated between 0.2 and 0.6, closer to the
average for the rest of the EMDEs.

                    High Concentration in the Top Four Countries in the Region

                    PPP projects in Sub-Saharan Africa have been concentrated in only a few countries, namely South Africa,
                    Nigeria, Kenya, and Uganda, which are the top four countries in investment and number of projects.
                    Together they account for 48 percent of the 335 total PPP projects in the region in the past 25 years.22
                    This amounts to $36.7 billion of investment commitments, or 62 percent of the $59 billion of total
                    investment commitments in the region.23

                    Looking at PPP investment over the years also demonstrates the role these four countries have played in
                    the region’s PPP market. Investment as a percentage of GDP tends to be somewhat sporadic for the top
                    four countries, jumping during boom years, such as 2005–06, 2012–13, and 2015 (figure 2.43). In three of
                    the past five years, the top four countries (especially South Africa and Nigeria) have played a significant
                    role in the development of Sub-Saharan Africa’s PPPs. This has been largely due to renewable energy
                    initiatives in South Africa and port renovations in Nigeria.

                    Another way to assess at the concentration of PPPs is to look at the number of countries per year that
                    had new PPP investment commitments. The number of countries gradually increased in the 1990s and
                    early 2000s, peaking during the latter 2000s (figure 2.44). The first half of the 2010s has subsequently
                    seen a falloff in the number of countries with new PPP commitments. Looking at the annual number of
                    PPPs per country (countries with at least one PPP) shows that averages have increased slightly in recent
                    years, reflecting a surge of 19 port projects in Nigeria in 2005, and the large number of renewable energy
                    projects in South Africa—31 in 2012, 12 in 2013, and 16 in 2015.

                    22	 Projects that cross borders are counted only once, and this count only represents each country’s portion of those projects divided evenly between the participating countries. For example,
                        for the Belt Bridge Border Post project between South Africa and Zimbabwe, only half of the project is represented by the top four countries. Another example is the West African Gas
                        Pipeline, which is split among Togo, Ghana, Benin, and Nigeria. The top four countries account for only one-quarter of this project.
                    23	 The same information about cross-border projects applies to these investment sums. Total investment is divided among countries participating in cross-border projects, and then only
                        applied to their category of aggregation. For example, only one-quarter of the total investment for the West African Gas Pipeline is attributed to Nigeria’s aggregated investment.

                      Project Type and Sector

                      The PPI database identifies three types of PPP projects: management and lease contracts, greenfield
                      projects, and brownfield projects. In the 1990s, as PPPs started to gain traction, management and
                      lease contracts were the predominant type of PPP, likely due to their relative simplicity and ease
                      of implementation. Brownfield projects gained popularity in the mid-1990s, peaking in 2005 and
                      then subsequently declining, probably as existing assets that were eligible for PPPs were exhausted.
                      Greenfield projects exhibit continued growth, as emphasis has been placed on renewable energy
                      projects, which are largely responsible for the increase in greenfield projects in the most recent years,
                      and particularly in 2012 (figure 2.45).

                      A look at the number of projects in Sub-Saharan Africa broken down by sector demonstrates the
                      increasing dominance of energy PPP projects, which have overshadowed the transport and water and
                      sanitation sectors in recent years. The large presence of transport projects in 2005, 23 in total, was due
                      to a boom of 19 transport projects in Nigeria, all projects to rehabilitate and expand seven ports in four
                      major cities. This was part of a broad Nigerian initiative to attract private participation in the port sector.

                      The PPP infrastructure projects in Sub-Saharan Africa in the past five years have mainly been
                      concentrated in the energy sector (78 percent), followed by transport (22 percent) and water and
                      sanitation (0.5 percent) (figure 2.46). Among the energy projects, the majority are renewable energy
                      projects (68 percent), distributed across solar (46 percent), wind (37 percent), and hydro (14 percent).
                      The solar projects are concentrated almost entirely in South Africa, which produced 35 of the 37 projects
                      between 2012 and 2015. Total PPP investment in solar is $7.6 billion (2015 US$). Wind power is slightly
                      less concentrated, but South Africa is still the dominant player, producing 23 of 28 total projects, worth
                      $4.9 billion (80 percent) of the $6.1 billion total investment commitments in wind projects. The five
                      remaining projects were undertaken by Kenya (two), Cabo Verde, Ethiopia, and Mauritius. The largest

project by investment commitment is the Aldwych Lake Turkana Wind Farm in Kenya, worth $765
million. The next largest project is worth $506 million (South Africa), and the average wind project in
Sub-Saharan Africa is worth $219 million.

The increase in recent years in greenfield and energy projects is in part due to the increasing emphasis
on renewable energy projects, which have expanded rapidly. A large boom in 2012 was mainly due to a
surge in solar and wind projects in South Africa. In total, South Africa had 31 greenfield energy projects
in 2012, worth a combined $5.9 billion: $4.24 billion in solar (23 projects) and $1.65 billion in wind (eight
projects). These two categories made up the extent of PPP projects in South Africa for 2012. In 2013 (four
solar, seven wind) and 2015 (eight solar, seven wind), the number of renewable projects in South Africa
was lower but still significant.

Financing of PPPs

Financing structure. PPP financing may come from public, private, or development finance institution
(DFI) sources. Public source financing includes (a) governments providing part of a project’s upfront
capital costs through grants or viability gap funding (government subsidies24); (b) state-owned
enterprises investing equity; and (c) state-owned banks extending loans. Private source financing
includes equity (including equity financed by corporate debt) through the project’s developer, or project
finance debt through private lenders, which can be commercial banks or institutional financiers. DFIs
also provide various forms of support in the form of loans and equity.

There are limited data on financing for PPP projects in Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2015, there were 334
projects for all countries in EMDEs, 24 of which were in Sub-Saharan Africa, and only 17 of those have
complete financial information. The data that are available, however, show that the projects in Sub-
Saharan Africa are financed in a very similar way to those in the rest of the EMDEs. In general, projects are

                    financed with about 70 percent debt and 30 percent equity, most of which is private (figure 2.47). There
                    is a slight variation in the debt structure between EMDEs and Sub-Saharan Africa. In both cases, debt
                    tends to be about half commercial, but in Sub-Saharan Africa international financial institutions play a
                    larger role in financing the other half, about 34 percent as opposed to only 18 percent in the rest of the
                    EMDEs, where public debt plays a larger role.

                    MDB support. Multilateral development banks (MDBs) have helped to facilitate, prepare, and structure
                    complex PPPs to mobilize private sector and institutional capital, and they have helped expand the
                    pipeline of bankable infrastructure projects. The PPI database defines MDB support as financial assistance
                    to the project company, including loans,25 guarantees,26 equity, quasi-equity,27 syndications,28 and risk
                    management instruments.29 In the past five years, 31 (25 percent) of the 126 projects in Sub-Saharan
                    Africa received some type of financial backing from MDBs, mainly in the form of loans (27 projects) and
                    guarantees (11). This is almost twice as high as the figures for the rest of the EMDEs, for which only 12
                    percent (213/1,909) of projects have MDB support.30 In the energy sector, MDBs also provide equity,
                    syndication, and a slightly higher proportion of risk management instruments in Sub-Saharan Africa than
                    they do in the rest of the EMDEs. In the rest of the EMDEs, MDBs contribute more equity in all sectors,
                    some insurance in the energy sector, and syndication in the transport sector. For water and sanitation,
                    there were only three projects between 2011 and 2015, only one of which had MDB support in the form
                    of a debt/equity guarantee—the Befesa Desalinization Plant in Ghana (figure 2.48).

                    Government support. When projects are not funded through user fees, power purchase agreements (PPA),
                    or water purchase agreements (WPA) with private entities or wholesale markets, governments must

                    25	 Direct loans using multilateral institution funds (also referred to as A-loans).
                    26	 Guarantees include political risk coverage and partial credit guarantees, which turn medium-term finance into a longer-term arrangement by guaranteeing longer maturity or offering
                        liquidity guarantees in the form of put options and take-out financing.
                    27	 Quasi-equity includes both debt and equity characteristics, and some of them are convertible debt, subordinated loan investments, and preferred stock and income note investments (also
                        referred to as C-loans).
                    28	 A multilateral institution arranges the financing with the resources of other investors, but the institution is always the lender of record (also referred to as B-loans).
                    29	 Risk management products, or derivatives, allow project companies to hedge currency, interest rate, or commodity price exposure. Some of them are currency and interest rate swaps,
                        options, and forward contracts and derivatives.
                    30	 There is limited information on projects that do not have MDB support and projects for which we have no information. For this reason, only relative comparisons should be made, on the
                        assumption that research rigor and availability of data are the same in Sub-Saharan Africa and the rest of the EMDEs.

support the deals through fixed and variable payments from their budget31 (direct support). In some
cases, governments can offer indirect support through guarantees to reduce specific project risks—for
example, payment, revenue, and exchange rate guarantees.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, 91 of the 334 projects have information on government support. Of these
projects, 46, or 50.5 percent, have some form of government support: four of those received direct
government support and the rest, 42, received only indirect support. Of the projects receiving
direct support, three received a capital subsidy, and only one received a revenue subsidy. Of the 42
projects receiving indirect support, for 38 it was in the form of a payment guarantee (37 were energy
projects); three received a debt guarantee; and only one received a revenue guarantee. Projects in
Sub-Saharan Africa tend to receive less government support than those in the rest of the EMDEs,
with most of the support in Sub-Saharan Africa going toward payment guarantees, which are most
typical for energy projects.

Revenue sources. The sources of revenue for a project can be grouped into three categories: (a) user fees,32
(b) power or water purchase agreements (PPA or WPA)33 and sales to wholesale markets,34 and (c) annuity/
availability payments from the government. In the last category, the government makes direct transfers in
the form of fixed or variable payments.35 Very few projects in Sub-Saharan Africa require fixed or variable
annuities as a source of revenue (figure 2.49). This is not surprising, since the PPPs in the region are
concentrated in the energy sector, which demands PPAs, but it is surprising in the water sector, because
there were only three water projects with available information (see n to right in the figure).

31	 In some cases, the government may collect user fees but pay availability payments to the private entities bearing the demand risk.
32	 When the PPI project relies exclusively or mainly on user fees to cover its cost.
33	 In some cases, the government may collect user fees, but the government still bears the demand risk.
34	 This includes power/water plants or transmission lines that sell or transport electricity/water to private off-takers. Wholesale markets include cases when outputs are sold to a single buyer
    or a group of buyers at market prices.
35	 This is when the government agreed to make payments to the project company in exchange for the provision of infrastructure.

                     Cancelled projects. Cancellations have taken place. Although cancelling a project is a last resort, it can still
                     have a meaningful impact on the PPP market. From 1990 to 2015, relatively few infrastructure projects
                     witnessed the exit of a private investor before the contract ended. Although rare, such cancellations
                     can have a sustained impact on a country’s PPP program, reducing the private sector’s confidence in
                     the government’s commitment, as well as the government’s confidence in the robustness and “value for
                     money” of these arrangements.
                     Of the 5,456 infrastructure projects reaching financial closure in EMDE countries during 1990–2015, 204
                     were cancelled,36 accounting for 3.7 percent of all projects and 5.7 percent of investment commitments.
                     Sub-Saharan Africa shows only a slightly higher PPP cancellation rate (4.2 percent) compared with the rest
                     of the EMDEs, which is mostly due to a higher cancellation rate of 10 percent in the water and sanitation
                     sector (three of 29 projects). The three cancelled projects were all management and lease contracts.

                     Quality of the Institutional and Regulatory Framework for PPPs
                     A robust institutional and regulatory framework is critical in attracting private investment for infrastructure
                     projects. Given the high costs and risks investors face, many criteria must be met, especially in Sub-
                     Saharan Africa, where economic and financial conditions are often more tenuous. For example, there must
                     be peace and stability, rule of law, good governance with accountability and transparency, clear property
                     rights, and enforceable contracts, just to name a few. Yet another key element for attracting private
                     investment is instilling confidence in investors. One way to do this is by maintaining a stable environment
                     in which domestic and foreign investors can operate with limited risk in unpredictable circumstances.
                     Empirical evidence suggests that a favorable regulatory and institutional framework corresponds with
                     a successful PPP investment environment, despite limited data on the subject. One such gauge is the
                     Benchmarking PPP Procurement (BPPP) report,37 which measures governments’ capability to prepare,

                     36	 A project was deemed to have been cancelled if, before the end of the contract period, the private company sold or transferred its economic interest in the project to the public sector; the
                         private company physically abandoned the project (such as withdrawing all staff ); or the private company ceased operation or halted construction for 15 percent or more of the license or
                         concession period, following the revocation of the license or repudiation of the contract. A project is also considered cancelled if the host government issued a decree cancelling the project.

proposals. The 2017 edition of the BPPP includes 20 of the 48 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.38
According to the BPPP, the region performs below average in each of the four thematic coverage
areas: project preparation, procurement, unsolicited proposals, and contract management. Moreover,
when compared with other regions, Sub-Saharan Africa places in the bottom two, except for contract
management, where it places above the Middle East and North Africa and South Asia, but still below the
global average. Sub-Saharan Africa’s lowest performance is for the PPP preparation indicators (figure 2.50).

The average performance masks wide variation across countries. Procurement is the area where
the economies obtained more similar and higher scores, indicating a more consistent and overall
adequate performance (figure 2.51). However, even in this area there are outliers, such as the
Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, and Togo (PPPs), which score significantly lower than the other
economies in the region.
There are wide variations around unsolicited proposals, for which some countries have enacted
comprehensive regulations (Tanzania, Nigeria, and South Africa), and others have regulations that are
far from recognized good practice (Cameroon). Similarly, wide variations in scores appear around PPP
project preparation, with some economies performing relatively well (South Africa and Mauritius), and
others lagging (Togo and the Democratic Republic of Congo). South Africa has adopted comprehensive
regulations on contract management, and scores very well in that area.
The area where there is more room for improvement is project preparation. The Benchmarking PPP
Procurement 2017 data measure whether economies conduct six assessments: socioeconomic analysis,
affordability assessment, risk identification, financial viability or bankability assessment, comparative
assessment, and market assessment. Some economies conduct all these assessments (such as South
Africa and Mauritius), while others conduct only one of them (Togo (PPP) and the Democratic Republic

                     of Congo), or none at all (Togo (Concessions)). And in the Republic of Congo, Senegal (Concessions),
                     Togo (PPP), and Zambia, the government is not required to integrate the prioritization of PPP projects
                     with other public investment projects. The Benchmarking PPP Procurement report also examines
                     whether the ministry of finance, or a central budgetary authority, needs to approve the PPP project
                     before a procurement process is launched. The available information suggests that such an approval is
                     not required in three of the 20 economies measured (Angola, Gabon, and Togo (PPP and Concessions)).
                     Overall, the regulatory frameworks governing the procurement of PPPs in the region have room for
                     improvement in all areas, to increase the quality of the regulatory framework to match those in advanced
                     economies. Preparation of PPPs appears to be the area where the region could focus its efforts to the
                     improve regulatory frameworks for PPPs.

2.4 QUALITY OF INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING

Introduction

Public investment (in infrastructure and services) is capable of crowding in private efforts and boosting
inclusive growth. However, public investment also attracts political interest—often the kind that lowers
efficiency. Inadequately designed, underfunded, long-delayed, or poorly implemented public projects
have a negligible impact on real economic activity. This is a challenge for many developing countries,
especially countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Some countries lack the absorptive capacity to execute their
limited investment budget; others fail to have a portfolio of “shovel-ready” projects to stimulate the
economy (Rajaram et al. 2014).

In this context, the productivity of public capital is a hot issue of debate.39 So far, the literature has
argued that infrastructure contributes positively to real economic activity, but there is no consensus on
the magnitude of this effect (Agénor 2011). Recent literature, by contrast, focuses on the quality of the
spending. It suggests that economic production is the outcome of an effective stock of infrastructure at
work—or what is called economic public capital.40

A recent study evaluates the long-run growth effects of surges in public investment (Warner 2014), and
finds that the impact is limited due to poor institutions governing the lifecycle of infrastructure projects.
In this context, enhancing the institutions and procedures associated with project appraisal, selection,
and monitoring plays a key role in raising the quality of infrastructure spending. More efficient public
investment can foster growth through several channels (IMF 2015): (a) reducing transaction costs for
the private sector; (b) increasing the marginal productivity of private physical and human capital; (c)
generating fiscal space through the provision of low-cost, better infrastructure services; and (d) releasing
resources for growth-enhancing recurrent expenditure.

Closing efficiency gaps in public investment could significantly raise the public investment multiplier.
For instance, a one-off increase in public investment of 1 percent of GDP will boost output by about 0.3
percent among countries in the lowest quartile of public investment efficiency. An analogous increase in
public investment will raise output by 0.6 percent among countries in the highest quartile (IMF 2015). In
other words, closing the efficiency gap between the top and bottom quartiles could double the impact
of public investment on growth.

This section looks first at the quality of institutions governing public investment management systems
(PIMs) as well as the transparency of procedures associated with the procurement cycles of public
and PPP projects. Next, the section looks at the correlation of the soundness of public investment
management and economic performance. Countries with sound PIMs tend to have greater growth and
efficiency, higher private investment, and lower public investment. Finally, the section considers the
relationship between PIMs and governance. Again, countries with sound PIMs tend to display strong
levels of governance—that is, improved control of corruption, rule of law, and regulatory quality.

                            Public Investment Management
                            The efficiency of public investment is closely tied to the quality of institutions at the country and
                            project levels. Rajaram et al. (2014) identify several institutional features that countries need to adopt
                            to deliver growth-enhancing public investment. Their findings imply the need for the following: (a)
                            implementation of a transparent and accountable system for guiding, appraising, reviewing, and
                            selecting projects that will enhance inclusive growth; and (b) design mechanisms and procedures to
                            implement, adjust, operate, and evaluate projects to optimize public service delivery. Weaknesses in any
                            of these areas may lead to poor investment and lower growth.

                            Fostering development through public investment requires strengthening institutions for public
                            investment management.41 Dabla-Norris and associates (2012) constructed an index that evaluates the
                            underlying institutional features of the Public Investment Management Index (PIMI), for 71 developing
                            countries from 2007 to 2010 across four stages: project appraisal, selection, implementation, and
                            evaluation. Scores for this index range from 1 to 4, with higher scores denoting better performance—
                            that is, best (worst) performing PIMs are described by a score of 4 (1).

Public Procurement Practices

Delivering infrastructure may require that governments acquire goods, services, or works from the
private sector. This process of acquisition is called public procurement, and involves a wide array of
economic sectors. For instance, governments may rely on the private sector to supply goods and
services to construct schools
and hospitals, build a dam,            FIGURE 2.53: Public Procurement (% of GDP)                                                South Asia has the

by Sub-Saharan Africa (14.9
percent). For some countries in the region (for example, Eritrea and Angola), a considerable amount of
development assistance goes through public procurement. Hence, the share of public procurement in
Eritrea and Angola is 33 and 26 percent of GDP, respectively.

In addition to the institutions governing public management systems, the efficiency of investment
also relies on sound procurement practices and sound institutions governing the public and PPP
project cycles (see PPPs in Sub-Saharan Africa, in section 2.3). Broadly, the enhancement of public
procurement practices (such as transparency, equal treatment, open competition, and sound procedural
management) may boost competition in the markets for government goods and services, and render
benefits for consumers in the form of greater quality and lower prices. Furthermore, transparent
procurement processes will help reduce corruption (World Bank 2016a).

This subsection benchmarks aspects of public procurement. The procurement lifecycle of infrastructure
projects covers the following dimensions: (a) needs assessment, call for tender, and bid preparation; (b)
bid submission phase; (c) bid opening, evaluation, and awarding phase; (d) content and management of
the procurement contract; (e) performance guarantee; and (f ) payment of suppliers. The rationale and
areas covered in these six stages of the procurement process are described in World Bank (2016a).

Figure 2.54, panel a, benchmarks the stages of the procurement lifecycle of infrastructure projects by
the public sector in Sub-Saharan Africa vis-à-vis other developing regions, namely, East Asia and the
Pacific and Latin America and the Caribbean. Sub-Saharan Africa is outperformed by the other two
regions in the initial stages of the procurement cycle—that is, needs assessment, call for tender, and
bid preparation, as well as bid submission. Sub-Saharan Africa’s score on performance guarantee is

                        stages of the procurement cycle, and tend to outperform UMCs in two areas: bid opening, evaluation,
                        and award, and performance guarantee (figure 2.54, panel b).

                        Public Investment Management and Economic Performance

                        Weak institutions tend to distort the effectiveness of public investment, thus limiting its impact on growth
                        (Cavallo and Daude 2011). In other words, one dollar invested by the public sector in an economy with
                        high levels of rent-seeking and corruption renders a smaller amount of public services compared with
                        an economy with good institutions. This subsection looks at the association between the institutions
                        governing public investment management (as proxied by the PIMI index) and economic performance,
                        namely, growth per capita, investment (public and private), and efficiency of investment.

                        Plotting the overall PIMI index vis-à-vis growth per capita for a sample of countries across the world
                        shows that there is a positive relationship between these two variables. That is, countries with stronger
                        public investment management tend to have higher per capita growth rates. Some interesting findings
                        emerge from investigating the relationship between the PIMI and public and private investment (figure
                        2.55). First, countries with stronger PIMs (higher values of the PIMI index) tend to have lower ratios of
                        public investment to GDP (panel a) and higher ratios of private investment to GDP. Second, the lower
                        public investment in countries with high PIMI values can be attributed to the improved efficiency of these
                        investments. In this context, lower public investment may imply an improvement in public procurement
                        and lower red tape and corruption, among others. For the PIMI level, several countries in the region have
                        a ratio of public investment to GDP that is above the international norm (the Republic of Congo, Ethiopia,
                        and Mozambique, among others). Third, having sound PIMs appears to attract private investment—as
                        suggested by the positive association. Having transparent procurement rules and best practices in
                        project appraisal, selection, implementation, and evaluation may help de-risk the country (as well as its

investment procedures). Finally, for the PIMI level, some countries in the region have a ratio of private
investment to GDP that is above the international norm (Botswana, Namibia, and Zambia). The large
countries in the region (South Africa and Nigeria) have ratios that are close to the international norm.

                 Public Investment Management and Country Governance

                 The effectiveness of public investment requires not only having sound PIMs, but also having strong
                 institutions at the country level. The latter will also have a positive impact on the cost of doing business
                 and the ability of the government to crowd in private investment. The relationship between the PIMI
                 index and selected governance indicators from Kaufmann, Kraay, and Mastruzzi 2010—regulatory
                 quality, rule of law, control of corruption, and a synthetic indicator obtained from the first principal
                 component of the three variables—is examined. An important message that emerges is that countries
                 with sound PIMs tend to have strong institutions, as captured by our synthetic indicators of governance
                 (figure 2.57). This finding also holds for the various components of the synthetic governance indicators.
                 That is, countries with sound PIMs tend to have greater regulatory quality, improved rule of law, and
                 better control of corruption. Another key message is that some countries in the region exhibit not
                 only high PIMIs, but also high levels of country governance—for example, South Africa, Rwanda, and
                 Botswana. Others show the opposite—for example, Sudan and the Republic of Congo are among the
                 countries with low PIMIs and low levels of governance. This finding holds for all the components of the
                 synthetic index.

ANNEX 2A: DATA CHALLENGES AND THE METHODOLOGICAL
APPROACH FOR TAGGING EXPENDITURE ON INFRASTRUCTURE
Issues of data quality complicate the task of properly tagging capital expenditure on infrastructure, and
constrain the range and quality of analytics. Some general considerations include the following:

(1)	 Only general government expenditures were included; that is, capital spending by state-owned
       enterprises (SOEs) was rarely captured. This has minimal impact on the overall amounts, given the
       limited role played by SOEs in the African context.
(2)	 Off-budget spending was also excluded from total amounts. In some countries, off-budget spending
       accounts for a significant share of total expenditure—although to a lesser degree for capital
       expenditures. Hence, total amounts are likely to be underestimated.
(3)	 Only information captured in treasury systems was included in the analysis. Foreign funded
       infrastructure spending kept off-budget is not included and might affect total spending—especially
       for high-aid countries.
(4)	 In some Francophone countries, budget classifications are not fully integrated with the chart
       of account. This makes it difficult to ensure seamless tracking of transactions covering a typical
       Engagement/Liquidation/Ordonnancement/Paiement (ELOP) expenditure chain.45
Additional country-specific caveats include the following:
•	 Actual data for 2015 were not available for a few countries at the time of writing this report; data for
     2014 were used as proxy. This includes Burkina Faso, São Tomé and Príncipe, and Ethiopia.
•	 The fiscal year rarely coincides with the calendar year in several African countries. Therefore, 2015
     refers to the fiscal year 2014/15.
•	 Several countries do not properly report sources of funding, especially distinguishing capital
     investments funded through foreign aid. Hence, they are excluded from the analysis of foreign versus
     domestic funding sources.
•	 Equatorial Guinea and Zimbabwe provided minimal information at the administrative and economic
     levels, which did not allow for proper identification of infrastructure spending. Hence, they were
     excluded from the analysis.
•	 Guinea-Bissau’s treasury systems fail to capture execution amounts of capital expenditures; hence,
     only approved amounts were used in the analysis.
•	 Several Francophone African countries often accumulate spending by multiple ministries into one
     administrative unit (“depense communes”), which does not allow for proper functional identification.
     This was the case in Guinea and Mali. It potentially leads to underestimation of spending.
•	 Foreign funded capital expenditure was only available at the budget level for Togo, Benin, and Guinea.
     Other countries such as Uganda and Mauritania among others also presented some gaps. Hence,
     deviation analysis was only conducted for domestic funded levels.




45	 For instance, Mali uses bridge tables to link accounting data with budgetary operations, effectively retrieving execution data from their systems that are fully consistent with budget
    nomenclature. Others, like Togo, Mauritania, and Niger, only present data at the committed and payment order stages but not actual payments.
