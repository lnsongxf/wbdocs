FOREWORD

Agriculture and the land uses associated with it are an enormous source of greenhouse
gas emissions, contributing about half of global methane emissions through livestock
and rice production, and about 60 percent of nitrous oxide emissions through fertiliz-
ers and the burning of crop residues. At the same time, agriculture is the economic
sector most susceptible to the effects of climate change. And while agricultural devel-
opment is pressed between the dual imperatives of feeding an expanding population
and reducing its ecological footprint, the sector has at least one other unique char-
acteristic. It can be, and very often is, a net carbon sink—actively sequestering more
carbon out of the atmosphere than it releases into the environment. Agriculture is the
only sector that does this, and it will need to do it more.

Climate-smart agriculture, which simultaneously intensifies production, improves
resilience to climate change, and capitalizes to the fullest on its mitigation potential,
is highly knowledge-intensive. The knowledge base needed to inform the planning
and design of climate-smart interventions will rely on well-designed and context-­
sensitive analysis to inform it. It will also interface directly with other sectors such as
energy, for instance by transforming agricultural methane emissions into an energy
source—one that offsets the need for fossil fuels. The knowledge base also requires an
understanding of policy environments that enable and encourage investment, as well
­
as an awareness of the factors that constrain the uptake of climate friendly practices
and technologies. Most of the opportunities for reducing agricultural emissions are in
low- to middle-income countries, but these opportunities vary greatly between coun-
tries and their farming systems. Efforts to get the most out of agriculture’s mitigation
          ­ herefore need to be tailored specifically to local conditions.
potential t

Capitalizing on opportunities to reduce agricultural greenhouse gas emissions while
building resilience into production systems will entail changing the way that ­producers,
consumers, and investors behave—and changing what they base their production, con-
sumption, and investment decisions on. To implement successful strategies, political,
institutional, and social barriers must be overcome. Nationally Determined Contribu-
tions, which set forth current emission levels, reduction targets, and strategic priori-
ties, will provide decision makers with a new and useful framework of reference for
this purpose.

Developing a global food system that both achieves food security and reduces agricul-
tural greenhouse gas emissions is one of the major challenges of our time. This report
serves as a catalyst to focus potential actions for addressing this challenge.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Agriculture, and the patterns of land-use change that are associated
with it, have a significant ecological footprint, including the effects it has
on climate change, accounting for about one-quarter of anthropogenic
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally. The scale of global emissions from
agriculture and land-use change is increasing as a result of population growth, grow-
ing consumption of meat and dairy products, and the rising use of nitrogen fertiliz-
ers, among other factors. Projections indicate that emissions from human activities
other than agriculture and land-use change could increase from 54 gigatons (Gt)
of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq) to roughly 70 Gt CO2-eq by 2050.
To avoid dangerous global warming in which global temperature rises above 2°C
relative to preindustrial eras, global GHG emissions by 2050 need to fall to roughly
21–22 Gt CO2-eq. Under business-as-usual practices, agriculture would contribute
roughly 70 percent of these total emissions by mid-century. This implies that agricul-
ture will need to cut its current emissions by two-thirds while simultaneously increasing
food production.

Yet agriculture is also the only economic sector in which opportunities
are present to mitigate climate change, mainly by removing substantial
volumes of carbon from the atmosphere and sequestering them in soils
and plant tissues. More broadly, its mitigation potential exists in the way that
natural resources are managed—natural resources such as croplands, pastures, soils,
and water. Opportunities also exist to transform sources of emissions into sources of
energy, particularly in the case of methane with its high carbon equivalence.

Together, these opportunities and the largely technical solutions that are
entailed in capitalizing on them have become the focus of a relatively new
approach known as climate-smart agriculture (CSA), which relates to but
expands on earlier approaches such as “integrated natural resources management”
and “environmentally sustainable development.”
    »» CSA consists of three broad pillars. The first is to sustainably increase agricul-
       tural productivity to support equitable increases in incomes, food security, and
       economic development. The second is to adapt agriculture to the effects of

CHAPTER ONE
MITIGATION IN AGRICULTURAL
LANDSCAPES
In 2013, the World Bank Group set out two goals: to end extreme poverty
by 2030 and to promote shared prosperity. These goals are aligned to support
the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Yet the projected increase in extreme
weather events will likely threaten the objective of sustainably eradicating poverty.
Although developing countries are most vulnerable to extreme climate-related shocks,
adopting climate-smart practices, developing enabling polices and institutions, and
mobilizing financing will enable countries to contribute to climate change mitigation.

Agriculture is the main driver of the impacts that climate change has on
poverty, but at the same time has great mitigation potential. The IPCC
estimates that the global technical mitigation potential from agriculture could reach
the equivalent of 7.18 to 10.6 Gt CO2-eq per year by 2030 (IPCC 2014). Mitiga-
tion efforts are consistent with carbon prices up to US$100/t CO2-eq (for example,
restoration of organic soils), and about a third of those can be achieved at less than
US$20/t CO2-eq (for example, through improved cropland and grazing land manage-
ment). Although there is less difference between measures at different carbon prices in
forestry, there are significant differences between the forestry mitigation potential in
different regions. The Latin American and Caribbean region has the largest potential
in deforestation reduction.

Climate change is likely to result in significant decreases in both the effi-
ciency and the resilience of agricultural production globally.2 The impacts
of climate change are already being felt in the form of reduced yields and more fre-
quent extreme weather events. Cereal yields decline by 5 percent for every Celsius
degree rise in global warming, and globally 40 million tons (Mt) of crops were lost
per year to a warmer climate between 1981 and 2002 (IPCC 2014). By 2050, nega-
tive impacts of climate change on agricultural production will lead to a 16 percent

CHAPTER TWO
MITIGATION OPPORTUNITIES
AND INTERVENTIONS
Total global GHG emissions are currently estimated at about 54,000 Mt of CO2
equivalent (Gt CO2-eq) per year. To avoid dangerous climate change, further emis-
sions reductions will need to close the “emissions gap”—the difference between
what countries have already committed themselves to doing and what will be
necessary to keep global temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius above prein-
dustrial levels. In the absence of sufficient emissions reductions before 2020, this
gap will be 8,000—10,000 Mt CO2-eq in 2020 and 14,000—17,000 Mt CO2-eq
in 2030 (United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP] 2014). Significantly
scaled up highly effective agriculture and land-use technology could make this
transition happen, and increase the likelihood of substantially closing the emis-
sions gap.

The IPCC estimates the potential for climate mitigation from the land sector as 7,000
Mt CO2-eq/year in 2030 at a nominal price of $50/ton, and nearly 10,000 Mt at
$100/ton (figure 2.1). The estimates do not include the effects of demand-side meas-
ures such as shifting diet trends away from high-emissions foods and reducing food
waste, with a total potential considered to be roughly similar to the supply side esti-
mates. This implies that the potential of the land sector to closing the emissions gap
can be quite considerable.

Mitigation actions in the land sector need to be increased, not only to help close the
gap but also to avoid the substantial increases in emissions and global warming that
would result from conventional practices. Agricultural GHG mitigation options are
found to be cost competitive with nonagricultural options (for example, energy, trans-
portation, forestry) in achieving long-term climate objectives—that is, the climate
objectives to 2100.

CHAPTER THREE
ADOPTION CONSTRAINTS AND
ENABLING ENVIRONMENTS
To successfully achieve these mitigation targets through climate-smart interventions (see
“Mitigation Measures and Interventions” in chapter 2), specific adoption constraints
must be overcome and specific enabling environments are needed. Common adop-
tion constraints are insufficient capital, limited access to technologies and inputs, lack
of information, general community acceptance of change, land tenure insecurity, and
trade-offs. To address these barriers and constraints, the following enabling means must
be in place: policies, institutional arrangements, financing, and gender considerations.

This chapter provides an overview of the common adoption constraints and describes how
enabling environments can help ensure sustainable adoption of mitigation interventions.

ADOPTION CONSTRAINTS
Despite the benefits provided by climate-smart interventions and technologies, their adop-
tion faces many economic and socioeconomic barriers. Factors affecting adoption tend
to be specific to the different measures. Table 3.1 shows the relative costs, cobenefits, and
constraints for implementing agricultural mitigation measures. Appendix C provides the
relative importance of different factors for adopting the mitigation interventions.

HIGH COSTS IN ADOPTION
Climate-smart technologies have the potential to improve yields and increase farmers’
income in the long term. In the short term, however, some losses in income can be
expected while ecosystems are restored. Some land management techniques such as
agroforestry to restore degraded lands and integrated soil fertility management often
require significant up-front expenditure that poor farmers cannot afford. Maintenance
costs can also be prohibitive for smallholder farmers (table 3.2).14 This indicates the
importance of verifying significant returns to ensure viability. At the same time, there
are practices with relatively low establishment costs, pointing to the feasibility of climate-
smart technologies even with limited financial resources.

NATIONALLY DETERMINED
CONTRIBUTIONS
Nationally Determined Contributions outline country-level strategies to address cli-
mate change. An NDC is a statement of a country’s current emissions, reduction tar-
gets, and adaptation priorities. It also provides an important baseline for prioritizing
climate actions. Most parties describe policy dimensions that support their NDC, such as
National Climate Policies or Strategies, National Adaptation Plans, low emissions devel-
opment strategies (LEDs), and Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions.

As of February 24, 2016, 161 parties have submitted NDCs. This represents 188 coun-
tries because the European Union submitted one for 28 countries. These countries
account for 98.7 percent of global emissions.20 These NDCs are part of the agreement
signed at COP21 in Paris.21

NDCs offer opportunities for the World Bank to better understand our client coun-
tries’ plans for addressing climate change. At the same time, NDCs help us in identify-
ing the kind of support that the client countries may need toward implementing the
plans and transitioning to low-emission development pathways. This chapter describes
the key features of agricultural and land-use NDCs, and provides recommendations
for prioritizing mitigation engagement in the region. It outlines an approach to filling
mitigation financing and knowledge gaps in country programs, boosting the Bank’s
CSA investment portfolio, exploring carbon finance, and creating a cohesive strat-
egy for mitigation implementation. This is achieved by channeling IDA/IBRD invest-
ments, GEF, BioCarbon Fund and other grants, and technical assistance to country
clients with the greatest needs and potential to use the resources. Specific activities to
be supported include expanding investment in proven mitigation technologies; build-
ing technical capacity and supporting a knowledge management system; and strength-
ening policies and institutions.

APPENDIX A
HISTORICAL AGRICULTURAL EMISSIONS
AND LAND-USE NET EMISSIONS/REMOVALS

AGRICULTURAL EMISSIONS
Contribution to global agricultural emissions are highest in EAP (29 percent), SA
(18 percent), and LAC (17 percent) (figure A.1). Between 2000 and 2012, global agri-
cultural emissions grew at a rate of 1.21 percent per year. Africa’s emissions grew the
highest at a rate of 1.96 percent, and accounts for 15 percent of global agricultural
emissions in 2012. Agricultural emissions in EAP, SA, LAC, and MENA grew at rates
of 1.73, 1.56, 1.38, and 1.04 percent annually, respectively. Only ECA experienced
a decline in agricultural emissions at a rate of 0.48 percent per year. Agricultural
emissions growth is expected to be the highest in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa—two
regions that will account for two-thirds of the increase in overall food demand—by
2050. The production of vegetable oils and animal products—products with high
GHG intensity—is expected to grow the most among total agricultural outputs. In
2012, 43 percent of global emissions from agriculture came from just four coun-
tries: China, India, Brazil, and the United States (table A.1). EAP was responsible for
29 percent of total agricultural emissions (figure A.2). Agricultural emissions make up
more than 50 percent of national emissions in 42 countries and more than 20 percent
in 91 countries.

Agricultural contributions to national GHG emissions vary widely from 0.1 percent
for Equatorial Guinea to 95.9 percent for Mali (figure A.3). Agricultural contributions
to national GHG emissions are about 6 percent or less in one-fifth of the countries,
and about 16 percent in more than 50 percent of the countries globally. Agricultural
contributions to national GHG emissions are more than 42 percent in 25 percent of
the countries. In Sub-Saharan Africa, agriculture contributes more than 30 percent to
national GHG emissions in 33 countries, reflecting the dominance of the sector in the
economies of the region.

In Latin America and the Caribbean, the percentage of national emissions from agri-
culture is lowest for the Bahamas (0.6 percent) and highest for Uruguay (69 percent).

 Ruminants (for example, cattle, sheep, goats, water buffalo) emit CH4 directly as a by-product of digestion.
 Manure
     Stored manure                                                                                                                           15
     Livestock manure and urine cause both CH4 emissions through increased decomposition in wet storage systems and N2O emissions in
     dry storage systems.
     Manure management                                                                                                                        7
     Manure and urine that fall on grazing lands causes N2O emissions.
     Manure deposited on croplands                                                                                                            3
     Manure is another source of nitrogen fertilizer for crops, resulting in N2O emissions.
 Synthetic fertilizers                                                                                                                       14
 N2O emissions from soils resulting from large amounts of nitrogen fertilizer added to crops
 Rice production                                                                                                                             10
 Most rice production systems result in CH4 emissions from anaerobic decomposition on flooded fields. This percentage represents CH4
 emissions from rice only. N2O emissions from fertilizers are counted in “synthetic fertilizers.”

DRIVING FACTORS OF AGRICULTURAL
LAND-USE CHANGE
An understanding of the driving factors of agricultural land-use change30 is fundamen-
tal to the identification of viable mitigation opportunities. The drivers are categorized
as proximate causes and underlying drivers. Proximate causes are human activities
that directly affect the environment and thus constitute proximate sources of change.
Underlying causes or processes are fundamental forces that underpin the proximate
causes. They are generally a complex suite of social, political, economic, technological,
and cultural variables that enable land degradation and change. Figure B.1 shows the
relationship between proximate and underlying causes.

Proximate causes are more immediate and direct factors. They are grouped into three
categories: agricultural expansion (expansion of cropped land and pasture), wood
extraction (harvesting or extraction of wood), and expansion of infrastructure. Under-
lying causes operate directly at the local level or indirectly from the national or global
level. These are economic factors (commercialization, development, economic growth
or change), technological factors (technological change or progress), policy and insti-
tutional factors (change or impact of political-economic institutional change), cultural
factors (values, public attitudes, beliefs, and individual or household behavior), and
demographic factors (human population dynamics). In addition to proximate and
underlying causes, there are also biophysical and teleconnection factors that often
work as catalytic factors leading to sudden shifts in the human-environment condition.

Biophysical drivers (such as droughts, fires, and floods) operate at a local level (Geist
and Lambin 2001). Some of these drivers (for example, forest and savannah fires)
can exert an immediate and direct impact on forest-cover change, and may thus be

  Land-cover and land-use change fall under two classes: conversion and modification. Land-cover conversion is the
change from one land cover to another, for example, forest to cropland. Land-cover modification is the change in the
condition within a land-cover category, for example, thinning of forest, reforestation, change in forest composition, or
agricultural intensification. Land-use conversion is the shift to a different use, for example, timber production to village
settlement. Land-use modification is the intensification of an existing condition, for example, use of more fertilizer to
produce more crops. Land-use change often leads to land-cover change.
