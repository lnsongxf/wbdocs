          his paper documents an initial study focused on understanding the physical impacts of climate change on
         water resources throughout the world. The research performed in this study is based on the application of an
         Integrated Assessment Model to quantify these impacts for a wide range of scenarios of socioeconomic devel-
opment that offer a mix of possible futures for the availability, use, and management of water resources. Through this
research and analysis, this study provides an integrated qualitative and quantitative understanding of the implications
of several selected issues, including climate change and mitigation, and socioeconomic and technological develop-
ments, on water scarcity and water-energy-food interactions in a global context. The understanding gained through
this analysis is expected to contribute to the ongoing dialogue on the sustainability of multiple human activities and
their trajectories toward global development pathways.

Global generation of electricity tends to follow a similar                                first century. However, as figure 6 shows,
                                                                               the twenty-­
pattern to that of the water demand for electricity shown                      SSP1 predicts significantly less water consumption in
in figure 6. The levels of energy production is signifi-                       the electricity sector than the other SSPs. Water demand
cantly greater in SSP5 than in the other four scenarios,                       for global food production tapers off and then declines
again because of the assumption of a much larger econ-                         in all scenarios (SSP1 and SSP5 circa 2050, SSP2 and SSP4
omy. It is interesting to note that SSP1, SSP3, and SSP4 all                   circa 2070) except for SSP3. This is mostly consistent
predict similar ­
                levels of energy production throughout                         with the irrigation water use trends shown in Figure 6.
