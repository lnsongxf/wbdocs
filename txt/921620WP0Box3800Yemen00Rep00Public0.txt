THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practi ce or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

        Obtain preliminary review of building permit application

        BuildCo must submit a memorandum to request to build a warehouse,
        along with the proof of land ownership document and the engineering
        drawings and designs, to the Construction Licensing Department of the
        Ministry of Public Works. Subsequently, the construction form, along
        with the aerial plan, will be given to the district where the construction
        is to be done. An actual permit is not granted at the end of this first
        step; this stage simply initiates the process by which the Construction
        Licensing Director signs the construction forms and dispatches ministry
   1    engineers to conduct an on-site preliminary inspection and make note         36 days          YER 3,000
        of the construction on the district aerial plan (Procedure 2).

        It takes about 3 weeks for the Construction Licensing Department to
        conduct the preliminary review of the building permit application. It
        takes about another 2 weeks to arrange for the preliminary inspection
        of the work site (Procedure 2).

        The construction form should be completed and signed by the

      provisional building permit necessary in order to commence work.
      Although the law does not require provisional permits, the
      administration of the ministry imposes this condition to minimize
      construction violations and to force the permit applicant to adhere to
      the conditions of construction that the Ministry has approved.

      The following breakdown of costs applies for a standard warehouse
      (block + steel):

      1. Waste removal fee (cleanup):
      - 1st floor: 650.3 sq. m. x 3 meters x YER 250 x 0.1 (if concrete floor --
      most common, or 0.05 if steel floor) = YER 48,772.50 for the first floor
      - 2nd floor: 650.3 sq. m. x 3 meters x YER 250 x 0.05 (2nd floor is only
      0.05) = YER 24,386.25
      TOTAL cleanup fee = YER 73,158.75
      2. Street occupancy fee = 25m x 12 (width of street) x 40 (if unpaved --
      most common) = YER 12,000.00 x 2 floors = YER 24,000.00
      3. Additional building permit fees = 929 sq. m. x YER 5.00 = YER
      4,645.00
      4. Disaster fund = YER 360.00

      Doing Business assumes a 12 meter width of the street next to the
      warehouse (average standard in Sana’a).


      Agency: Construction Licensing Department, Ministry of Public Works



      Request and receive foundation work inspection

      The request for an inspection of the foundation work can be made in
      writing, and the Construction Licensing Director will delegate an
4     engineer to inspect the work.                                                 1 day        no charge

      Agency: Construction Licensing Department, Ministry of Public Works



      Obtain final building permit

      After BuildCo has completed the construction of the warehouse
      foundation, municipal engineers should visit the work site to verify that
      the foundations conform to the engineering drawings and designs
      upon which the company obtained the provisional permit. If so, BuildCo
      will be granted the permit. Inspectors are hired by the municipality.        90 days       no charge

      these inspections during construction.

      Request inspection to begin work on the 2nd floor

6     The request is usually done in person at the Ministry of Public Works.        1 day        no charge
      The Construction Director will delegate an engineer to inspect the
      work.

        The application process is followed by a site inspection by the Public
        Electricity Corporation (PEC). However, the inspector has to be picked
        up, as they do not always have their own means of transportation. Also,
        because of some issues in Yemen’s addressing system, it might be
        difficult for inspectors to know the exact location of the building if they
        are not picked up.
        The Public Electricity Corporation (PEC) inspects the site to determine the
   3    specifics of the connection. The inspector then prepares an estimate of        1 calendar day         YER 0

        For capacities above 100 kW, a private transformer is needed. For a load
        over 200 kW or 300 kW, customers usually prefer to buy the material

the case from simple debt enforcement. To make the
data comparable across economies, Doing Business
uses several assumptions about the case:
       The seller and buyer are located in the
        economy’s largest business city. For the 11
