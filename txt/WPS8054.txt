Introduction
'Experience is the teacher of all things,' offered Julius Caesar in his commentary on the Roman
Civil War of 49-48 B.C. – an adage that has held fast for over 2,000 years as common wisdom
about the importance of learning through experience, particularly in situations characterized by
complexity. In the case of public infrastructure projects, which are intrinsically complex
arrangements with large investment requirements and important implications for economic
development and the health and quality of life of the citizen public, the stakes are high to learn
from experience to deliver infrastructure services more efficiently and effectively than in the past.
Public-private partnerships (PPPs) for infrastructure require that governments learn how to
harness the strengths of the private sector while preserving public interest and affordability of
infrastructure services, all within long-term contractual relationships subject to inevitable
uncertainties over time. The PPP – while a powerful and effective tool for infrastructure delivery
– requires sound design and management, a good appreciation of public direct and contingent
liabilities, a certain degree of customization to the local context, and the management of
relationships between the public and private sectors over long periods. These requirements and
their fine calibrations are neither apparent nor fully standardized. Rather, they must be
understood, enhanced and designed by the PPP participants – i.e., governments and sponsors –
to improve PPP arrangements, with the expectation of increasing the likelihood of future contract
success.
This paper asks how country experience with public-private partnerships impacts the probability
of contract cancellation – an extreme form of PPP failure – for future infrastructure PPP contracts.
The results suggest that PPP experience does, indeed, reduce the likelihood of contract
cancellation. These results are an important starting point for ongoing research on the multiple
channels by which experience and lesson-drawing may be leveraged to improve PPP
performance, contract management, and government support over the future.


Learning, Experience, and PPP
A fairly well-developed management literature – particularly relating to joint venture models,
concession models, strategic alliances, and other types of business-to-business partnerships –
and a nascent 'policy learning' literature attend to the importance of experience-based learning
to the success of complex organizational arrangements. Additionally, a large and growing body of
work by PPP practitioners, including those within government, the private sector, and multilateral
development organizations, has focused on cataloguing 'lessons learned' for PPP implementation
across different sectors, political and economic contexts, and levels of government. The
perceived importance of organizational, relational, and technical learning to improved
performance is apparent in the proliferation of reports, papers, and other publications focused
on case studies and lesson-drawing for infrastructure PPP.
Learning is expected to improve the generation and utilization of useful knowledge to help
governments avoid future policy failures and increase the potential for greater success with
respect to future policy goals and outcomes (Howlett, 2009). Failures may be attributable to
inability to anticipate the consequences of a program, particularly in the face of unforeseen risks
(Howlett, 2009; Bovens and t'Hart 1996), poor execution during implementation (Mandri-Perrott
and Bisbey, 2016; Linder and Peters, 1987), failure to effectively evaluate policies and programs
or learn from evaluation to improve future design (May 1992), or the general intractability of a
'wicked problem,' for which there is no clear and apparent cause nor solution (Churchman, 1967).



                                                                                                   2
A PPP might be subject to any one of these roots of failure, and the PPP literature quite actively
examines why some PPPs fail and others succeed, with studies varyingly focusing on such factors
as contract management, regulation, PPP frameworks, governance, principal-agent problems,
and government capacity, among other factors. The common thread in these studies is that PPPs
are complex arrangements that require the alignment and constant adjustment of many working
parts to succeed over the long term –requirements that demand multiple kinds of learning to
discover, fine-tune, and maintain workable arrangements.

'Thick learning' for PPP
Because PPPs are complex organizational forms that must necessarily balance different and
sometimes-conflicting interests and incentives of the public and private sectors, and because
successful implementation requires dealing with distinct local legal, financial, regulatory,
economic, and physical contexts, it would naturally be expected that multiple kinds of learning
would be needed when implementing a PPP in a new market. This multifaceted learning is what
policy scholars refer to as 'thick' learning (Howlett, 2012), in that it necessarily entails learning
across program, process, and political dimensions (McConnell, 2010).
Moreover, because some PPP situations are unique, shared knowledge that emerges through
practice and engagement is likely to be important to improving PPP arrangements. While a
syntactic perception of knowledge assumes that information can be collected and transferred,
and a semantic view emphasizes interpretation, the pragmatic approach sees knowledge as
'localized, embedded, and invested in practice' (Weber and Khademian, 2008). This practical
knowledge – or 'metis' as termed by Scott (1998) – evolves through practice and is tied to the
experiences and relationships of the participants, who jointly build knowledge to create better-
fitting policies, adopt a more unified mental mode, and align values and interests (Weber and
Khademian, 2008). Metis is particularly important when information needs are unclear, problems
are multifaceted, and differentiated solutions are required.
New infrastructure PPPs may incorporate technical components informed by sector-wide best
practice or case studies of similar infrastructure projects. But not all PPP-related lessons and best
practices can be automatically transferred to new contexts. Some knowledge must be hard won
over time as partners collectively generate knowledge specific to the conditions at hand and
overcome initial obstacles in the operating context. For example, as countries undertake early
PPPs, they may discover regulatory or legal challenges that require resolutions or improved
governmental capacities (such as contract management) that require development, which in turn
improve the design, implementation, and oversight of projects to follow. Moreover, while
participants bring individual knowledge to a new PPP, this knowledge can be difficult to transfer
and challenging to integrate into a functioning compilation without experience. For this reason,
demonstration projects –those first PPPs implemented by a country– are recognized to be pivotal
learning experiences for governments initiating a PPP program and supportive PPP framework
(Delmon, 2009).

Lesson-drawing from PPP experience
Governments, policy think tanks, multilateral development organizations, consultants, ratings
agencies, and other parties with interests in infrastructure PPP have produced an extensive body
of literature and reporting on lessons learned from PPP experience. The World Bank's Public-
Private Partnership in Infrastructure Resource Center (PPPIRC), for example, provides an
extensive listing of links to PPP case studies and lessons learned produced by multilateral




                                                                                                   3
development organizations and governments. 1 Lesson-drawing and dissemination is geared
towards improving the likelihood of future project success and avoiding some of the most
deleterious pitfalls that have caused prior PPP distress and cancellation. Extensive reports have
been produced that discuss lessons related to contract design, legal frameworks, modes and
approaches to risk allocation, pricing, bidding and award methods, financial structures, public
support mechanisms, project preparation, political risks, and other factors relevant to PPP
implementation.
Many developed countries with extensive and long-standing PPP experiences have also seen the
value of cataloging lessons learned in order to improve the legislative, regulatory and policy
environment and associated governmental mechanisms for PPPs. For example, the United
Kingdom, whose Private Finance Initiative of the early 1990s has undoubtedly influenced
governments, sponsors and lenders, continues to evolve their program to improve how
government facilitates and manages PPP contracts. The UK Treasury's 2011 'Private Finance
Initiative' report cited a number of weaknesses in the prevailing Private Finance Initiative (PFI)
model, including inflexible contracts, limitations in transparency with respect to investor returns,
higher than expected risk premiums incurred by government, and questions over public value for
money, all leading to the recommendation of an evolved 'PF2' model of PPP.
Given the efforts to evaluate, compile, and disseminate lessons learned through active and
concluded PPPs, it is a worthwhile pursuit to ask whether governments do, in fact, learn from PPP
experiences to improve future PPPs. While the purview of this paper is not to diagnose learning
across all aspects of PPP globally, we more simply ask whether experience has a limiting effect on
the most extreme cases of PPP contract failure –premature contract cancellation. To answer this
question, we quantitatively model the effect of experience with PPP on future contract
performance using a large data set.


Data and PPP Country Experience
The descriptive statistics and econometric models reported in this study are based on data from
the World Bank's Private Participation in Infrastructure (PPI) Project Database, which tracks
infrastructure projects in developing regions that entail some form of private participation since
1990. 2 As of August 2016, the database includes 7,192 projects across 139 countries with
recorded variables for each project, including project status (active, cancelled, or concluded),
project sector and subsector, committed investments, contract duration, contract form,
multilateral support, and project sponsors, among other variables.
Of the 7,192 projects in the database of projects with some form of private participation in
infrastructure (PPI), 5,478 are more narrowly defined as 'public-private partnerships'. This set
excludes projects for which the degree of private participation tends toward the extreme-private
side of the public-private spectrum. They are either full divestitures (i.e., total privatization of an
asset) or 'merchant' projects, where a private sponsor builds a facility for which no government
revenue guarantees are provided (thus bearing all construction, operating, and market risks).
A further limitation is imposed on the data set: we include only active or cancelled projects that
reached financial closure before 2011. The reason for truncating the data set to include only the

3,400 PPP projects with at least a six-year history is simple: a project's status (i.e., conclusion after
full contract term, early cancellation and ongoing operation) is only reasonably observable and
measurable when the project has been (or could have been) in effect for a sufficient amount of
time. Contract cancellation rates would undoubtedly be underestimated if one-year operational
projects were included, for example, as these projects are likely too early in their development
to reveal potential problems that might otherwise lead to cancellation. Upon examining the
project data in the PPI Database, cancelled projects exhibit an average duration (between
financial closure year and cancellation) of 5.89 years (Marcelo and House, 2016). This average
duration is justification for truncating the data set to remove projects whose closure dates are
less than six years before the analysis.3
Of the 3,400 PPPs with at least six-year histories, 94% are active – i.e., operational or under
construction– while 6% (191 PPPs) were canceled. Figure 1 describes the subsets of data used for
modeling, and Table 1 provides summary statistics for the 2,833 projects used in modeling.

In order to capture the effect of country-level experience on PPP cancellations, a variable to proxy
the degree of familiarity and experience in facilitating public-private partnerships was estimated.
The PPP country experience associated with each project is defined as the number of PPPs that
reached financial closure within the past decade in the same country. So then, the level of PPP
experience associated with any project initiated in country in year , is equivalent to the sum of
all PPPs that reached financial closure in that country in the previous 10 years.
Following this definition, Figure 2 gives a visual overview of the maximum PPP experience reached
by each country over the past decade from 1990 to 2016. African and Central Asian countries
have the lowest levels of PPP experience in the developing world, though the region includes
three countries (i.e. South Africa, Nigeria and Algeria) with more than 20 PPP deals. In contrast,
South American countries have relatively high levels of PPP experience, led by Brazil (387 PPPs).
China and India are developing countries with the highest PPP experience, with more than 600
PPP deals each.

 This map reflects the maximum level of prior PPP experience (over past ten years) within a country for any project within the data set described above (excluding
merchant projects). Countries with one PPP (e.g. Paraguay) are classified as ‘zero prior PPP experience’ since the single project is the first in the country (within at least
10 years) during the specified time period.

Methodology
The question this paper seeks to answer is straightforward: does a country's experience with PPP
reduce the probability of project cancellation? In order to answer this question, this study utilizes
mixed-effect probabilistic models in combination with linear and cubic splines to examine the
role of experience on project cancellation rates.

Effects of PPP experience on probability of contract cancellation
Within a country, PPP projects are generally subject to the same macroeconomic and legal
environments. They typically align to a national development plan and follow common sector and
investment policies. At the same time, other important actors and organizations such as
multilateral development banks (MDBs), operators and sponsors, private financiers, etc. have an
equalizing effect on the PPP environment at the country level (Marcelo and House, 2016).
Common exposure to national level factors could mean that PPPs do not behave independently.
Rather, they may be significantly correlated at the country level. In this context, the study of their
outcomes (e.g. PPP cancellation rates) must follow a strategy that accounts for such a clustered
structure – i.e., a multilevel structure – in order to avoid potential biases in the analyses.5
The advantage of using multilevel or mixed-effect models over traditional econometric cross-
sectional or pooled regression models is that they allow the correction of biases in parameters
and standard errors that result from clustering of projects at the country level. As mentioned
above, outcomes of projects in the same country are likely to be correlated, since PPPs are subject
to the same socioeconomic, political, regulatory and legal environments. Neglecting this
correlation could lead to incorrect statistical inferences. This bias can be corrected by utilizing a
mixed-effect regression approach (Guo and Zhao, 2000).
This study uses mixed-effect probit models to analyze cancellation rates. We describe the logic
and construction of this model in three steps. First, in a mixed-effect or 'multilevel' model, the
intercept and estimated coefficients may randomly vary between different clusters (e.g., clusters
defined by countries), or even groups of clusters that define a hierarchy (e.g. region–country–
project).6 For example, if PPP projects are clustered at the country level, a significant part of the
variation in the probability of cancellation would be due to the fact that the PPPs belong to a
particular country. This would mean that PPPs do not behave independently at the national level.
This clustering effect is hypothesized, but not known in practice. To test for clustering, this study
applied standard intra-class correlation tests (see Table 3, 'Empty model', Intra-class correlation
coefficient).
Second, mixed effect probit models and traditional probit models follow the same basic logic. A
dependent variable (the probability of a positive outcome) is a latent (non-observable) variable
that can be proxied by an observed binomial phenomenon. Despite the fact that the probability
of contract cancellation is not observable at the project level, the current status of each project
is observable. In this case, a dummy variable denoted as Status equals 1 if the PPP project is
canceled and 0 otherwise.


5
  As described by Guo and Zhao, "multilevel modeling corrects for biases in parameter estimates resulting
from clustering. In contrast to popular belief, ignoring multilevel structure can result in biases in parameter
estimates as well as biases in their standard errors. The more highly correlated the observations are within
clusters, the more likely that ignoring clustering would result in biases in parameter estimates" (2000).
6
  Mixed-effects or multilevel models are also referred to as hierarchical modes.



                                                                                                             7
Third, while a number of factors may explain the behavior of the probability of contract
cancellation, this study focuses mainly on the role of country PPP experience. The data presented
in the following sections suggest that cancellation rates do indeed decrease as countries gain PPP
experience (as PPP country experience is defined in the Data section). To better understand this
behavior, the econometric models presented in the results section use several transformations
of the variable country PPP experience to allow an accurate understanding of the shape of the
relationship between cancellation and experience.

Cancellation rate estimation based on splines
The observed data suggest that the relationship between PPP cancellation rates and country PPP
experience is not linear, but rather asymptotic (see Figure 3). On average, the observed
cancellation rate for projects initiated in countries without any prior PPP experience is 22%. This
cancellation rate drops to nearly 8% when countries have closed at least 50 PPP deals.
Interestingly, most of the reduction in cancellation rate is reached with an approximate range of
country experience of only five to ten PPP deals. In a case like this, where the relationship to be
analyzed is so markedly curved, the use of linear splines and restricted cubic splines may be more
appropriate than a linear equation (Gould, 1993).

                                              Cumulative PPP Country Experience in the Past Decade

A linear spline (denoted as LSpline in the Results section) allows the estimation of the relationship
between and as a piecewise linear function composed of linear segments. Each linear
segment captures the effect on when values of vary within a certain range. That is, the linear
spline transforms an explanatory variable into segments and estimates the slope of the linear
function between and for each segment. In turn, the linear segments join at pre-defined
'knots', or inflection points, in the slope. In this case, five knots were arbitrarily placed at 12, 24,
48 and 96 PPP projects of country experience (see annexes 4 and 5). 7

    Annex 4 presents several linear and cubic spline estimations.



                                                                                                               8
Transformation of the variable PPP country experience through auxiliary variables –linear
segments– was specified following Panis (1994), as described below:

                            =          ( ,     )																																																																			
                            =                  ( , ),               ) −               										 = 2, … ,4
                            =                ,    − 																																																							

where is PPP country experience, and the seven linear segments                                           join at six inflection points,
or knots , 12, 24, 48 and 96 PPP projects of country experience.
The estimated coefficient associated with each linear segment reflects the effect of PPP country
experience, within that range of experience, on the probability of contract cancellation.
Moreover, a cubic spline (denoted as RCSpline in the Results section) may be a better choice than
a linear spline when working with pronouncedly curved functions. As shown in Figure 3, the
observed relationship between PPP country experience and cancellation rate displays a highly
curved shape. When using a restricted cubic spline, it is possible to obtain a piecewise smooth
cubic polynomial function that connects at pre-defined knots. In this case, the locations of the
knots (six in total) were determined by the percentiles strategy proposed by Harrell (2001).8
The resulting auxiliary variables follow the specification bellow:

                       = 																																																																																																
                            (       ) 	 (                )     (            ) (            ) (          ) (                 )
                        =                                           (           )
                   			 = 1, … , − 2																																																																											

where	 − 2 corresponds to the number of auxiliary variables to be created.
Unlike the linear spline, coefficients associated with auxiliary variables under a cubic spline
specification do not directly reflect the effect of PPP country experience within a specific range
on the probability of cancellation. Instead, the marginal effect of PPP country experience on the
cancellation rate entirely depends on the value of the variable PPP country experience chosen to
evaluate the estimated probabilistic function.




8
 Harrell (2001) recommends placing knots at equally spaced percentiles of the original                                          variable's
marginal distribution.

Descriptive Statistics
Tables 1 and 2 summarize the information used in the econometric models presented in the
Results section. As mentioned above, about 6% of PPPs that reached financial closure before
2011 were canceled. But remarkable differences were observed when disaggregating by sector,
type of PPP, and region. First, the lowest PPP contract cancellation rate is observed in the energy
sector (3.2%) – a rate that is less than half the cancellation rates in transport and water and a fifth
of that observed in the ICT sector.
Second, the cancellation rate for new infrastructure projects or 'greenfield' projects (4.3%) is
about 60% of the brownfield concession project cancellation rate (7.1%) and 31% of the
management and lease contract cancellation rate (13.7%). Finally, from a regional perspective,
the highest cancellation rate was registered in Africa (9.6%), with a rate almost 70% higher than
those observed in East Asia and the Pacific (EAP), East Europe and Central Asia (ECA) and Middle
East and North Africa (MENA). Compared with South Asia (SAR), Africa has a cancellation rate
seven times higher (Table 1).

In terms of the size of the PPP projects under study, the average investment committed to a PPP
project at the time of financial closure was US$258 million, though half of these projects did not
exceed US$78 million in size. Only a quarter of the PPPs that reached financial closure before
2011 surpassed the average investment size (Table 2).

Results
Table 3 presents econometric estimations, including the various functional specifications
described in the Methodology section. As mentioned before, the objective of the econometric
analysis is to provide a better understanding of the effects of PPP country experience on the PPP
contract cancellation rates, with particular emphasis on the shape of the relationship between
cancellations and PPP country experience. Moreover, it is of interest to examine variations in the
influence of experience in different sectors.
First, PPP projects do not behave independently. Instead, their outcomes are clustered at the
national level. Nearly 25% of the variation in the probability of contract cancellation is due to
country-level clustering (see Table 3, Empty model, Intra-class correlation). This means that a
significant part of the variation in the probability of cancellation is due to the fact that PPPs belong
to a certain country. In this case, multilevel or mixed-effect models allow the correction of
potential biases in parameters and standard errors resulting from clustering at the national level.
Second, PPP country experience has a negative effect on the probability of PPP contract
cancellation. In other words, as countries gain experience in PPPs, the likelihood of subsequent
PPP deals ending in cancellation is significantly reduced. Each additional PPP project added to a
country's PPP experience is expected to reduce the probability of cancellation by 0.029%, on
average (see Table 3, Basic model).9 This simple linear functional specification, however, does not
reveal how the rate of reduction varies at different levels of PPP country experience. The data
suggest that the relationship between cancellation rates and PPP country experience is markedly
curved (Figure 3).
Third, cancellation rates rapidly decrease as PPP experience increases, especially over the first
few projects initiated in a country (Table 3 and Figure 4). A basic quadratic specification of the
relationship between cancellation and PPP experience suggests that the gains associated with
PPP country experience are attained only over the first 22 PPPs (Table 3, Square model). 10
However, this specification has a limitation, it does assume that, after a certain point, experience
could also be counterproductive, which contradicts intuition and the observed data (Figure 3).
Conversely, linear and restricted cubic splines do not impose such an assumption.
All the models reveal that the 'experience benefit' from each additional PPP is greatest for the
first few deals. After five projects in a country, the reduction in the probability of cancellation
from each additional PPP project is considerably diminished. A linear spline specification predicts
that the probability of a PPP project to be canceled is 15% when the country to which it belongs
has no PPP experience (Table 3, LSpline1 and LSpline2 models). 11 After five PPP projects of
country experience, the probability of contract cancellation drops 35% (to approximately 10%).
Over the course of the next five projects of the country's PPP experience, the probability of
cancellation is expected to fall another 38% (to nearly 6%), with almost no change in the
probability of cancellation for PPPs when country experience ranges between 50 and 150
projects.

 -0.029% is the marginal effect ( ⁄ ) associated with the estimated coefficient -0.003 (Table 3).
10
   The quadratic function reaches a minimum when ( ⁄ ) = 0 and the PPP country experience is equal
to −     ⁄ 2∗          .
11
   In models LSpline and Full_LSplinel (Table 3), the probability of PPP contract cancellation is about 15%
when the probability function is evaluated at        = 0		∀		 = 1, … ,6 and all the other variables at their
mean value (see Annex 3).

A restricted cubic spline functional specification generates very similar results: the probability of
cancellation is about 16% when countries have no PPP experience, but the cancellation rate
rapidly reduces as countries gain PPP experience (Table 3, CSpline model). The probability of
contract cancellation drops 35% and another 33% after five and ten PPP projects, respectively,
whereas the reduction in the probability of cancellation is marginal after about 20 projects of PPP
experience. After this point, the probability of cancellation is close to 4% (Figure 4).
Finally, the probability of PPP contract cancellation is significantly lower in the energy and
transport sectors. In a country with no PPP experience, the probability of a PPP contract to be
cancelled in the water sector is predicted at 27%, while in the transport and energy sectors,
project cancellation rates are expected at around 17% and 11%, respectively. These differences
in sector cancellation rates for early projects in new markets suggest the relative complexity of
water PPPs as compared to energy and transport projects.
More interestingly, the results show that after 20 contracts of PPP country experience, the
probability of cancellation in the water sector is reduced by 63%, whereas the reductions in
cancellation rates are higher for transport (70%) and energy (74%), with more rapid reductions
in the probability of cancellation after only a few deals of PPP country experience (i.e., at five and
ten experienced PPPs) (Figure 4).

Sensitivity analysis

In order to test the robustness of the results, the models above were additionally estimated under
several configurations of the data set. First, PPPs with shorter and longer periods of maturation
were considered in a new set of regressions. Second, to eliminate the risk of biased results due
to inclusion of extremely high-experience projects, models excluding PPPs with accumulated
country experience higher than 200 and 100 PPPs were also estimated.
In the first sensitivity analysis, estimations included more recent PPPs that reached financial
closure in or before 2013 as well as PPPs with longer maturation periods closing in 2007 or before.
In the second sensitivity analysis, the PPP country experience restriction applied to a subset of



                                                                                                            13
projects in China, India, and Brazil, where the accumulated experience for some projects was
higher than 200 PPPs. The restriction also applied to projects in Argentina, Turkey and Mexico for
country experience levels higher than 100 PPPs (see Annex 4).
The overall results for this new set of regressions are similar to those obtained in the reported
models. The probability of PPP contract cancellation rapidly decreases after a relatively low
amount of PPP country experience. The quadratic models predict that the probability of
cancellation reaches a minimum at a level between 21 and 23 PPPs of accumulated country
experience. Moreover, according to the linear and cubic spline models, there would be almost no
reductions in the probability of cancellation beyond the 50th deal, with an average probability of
cancellation from this point between 3% and 5% (see Annex 4 and 5 and Figure 5).

Conclusions
Countries learn very quickly from only a little PPP experience. The analysis shows that after a
country closes a relatively low amount of PPP contracts, the probability of contract cancellation
rapidly declines –a finding that is more pronounced in the energy and transport sectors than in
water. The econometric results also reveal how quickly early experience and country-specific PPP
knowledge translates into concrete benefits to future PPP performance. The practical experience
of bringing PPP contracts to financial closure is most impactful over the first PPP deals (e.g., from
one to ten PPPs). The experience dividend, in terms of reduced probability of cancellation,
plateaus after about 20 contracts.
The sector results suggest that the water sector may require more careful, lengthy preparation,
but that early PPPs are nevertheless notably beneficial to subsequent success in the sector. Based
on research and experience, the observed sectoral differentiation in cancellation rates may be
attributable to the very local and political nature of the water sector, where reforms are subject
to the unique urban and geographical conditions as well as local customs, beliefs, and politics
(Araral, et al., 2011). Further, water sector projects have tended to transfer demand risk to
sponsors whereas transport and energy projects will isolate revenues or payment streams to a
single paying entity, typically a government body, ministry or agency (Mandri-Perrott & Stiggers,
2013).
Early PPP projects offer important lessons to reduce the likelihood of future contract failures.
Implementing interim oversight and evaluation programs can help capture the insights from early
PPPs in order to improve contracts, regulation, bureaucratic capacity, and other facets of PPP
implementation for future projects. Moreover, while some technical knowledge can be
transferred from PPP-experienced countries to other countries without experience (e.g.,
inclusion of key contractual clauses, regulatory tools, costing and pricing methodologies), some
of the knowledge required to sustain healthy PPPs is undoubtedly hard-won and invested in the
construction, adjustment, and implementation of the earliest PPP deals within the country.
These observations have implications for the advisors that support the development of PPP
programs to increase provision of infrastructure. For one, multilaterals and other PPP proponents
would do well to focus efforts on supporting countries with limited PPP experience rather than
supporting easier 'wins' in countries with more extensive PPP experience. Knowing that public
and private resources are at a higher risk when embarking on PPPs in countries with very low
levels of experience, MDBs should strategically target PPP support to countries with little or no
PPP experience. The results suggest that from a regional perspective, this might include most of
the African and Central Asian countries and some of the Central American and Caribbean nations.
That said, MDB technical assistance should be provided to those governments that are also willing
to create and preserve the conditions that enable a PPP market to develop, including institutional
and legal reforms that underpin functional contracts, fair arbitration, and healthy financial
markets.
With respect to financial support and managing investment risk in new PPP countries, MDBs must
also take into account sectoral considerations and may choose to focus initial lending efforts in
the energy and transport sectors, where cancellation rates are lower. In doing so, consideration
should be given to contractual structures where revenue streams are 'protected' from demand
risk. This is done, for example, through the use of direct payments from government agencies in
the case of energy IPPs, where payments are made by a single off-taker, or in the transport sector
when demand risk is limited to remuneration through a public entity by using some form of
availability payment. Moreover, financial support should be offered based on careful examination
of the local context prior to proposing PPP as a viable option, and with an eye to develop the

earliest PPPs as learning-oriented projects. This means carefully weighing the option of proposing
a PPP vis-à-vis other modes of infrastructure provision, including public provision, as well as
developing PPP programs with careful consideration of local legal, political, financial, and
governmental conditions. Furthermore, it means building in adjustment mechanisms in early
PPPs and encouraging lesson-drawing to inform future deals.
It is worth noting that a reasonable target cancellation rate for infrastructure PPPs is not
necessarily zero percent. Indeed, contract cancellation is sometimes found to be necessary, and
cancellation rates for countries with high levels of PPP experience across all sectors are
approximately 4%. Nevertheless, project cancellations are associated with high costs and the
threat of disruption of critical infrastructure services. Based on the econometric results, an
estimated $1.5 billion per year could have been saved with interventions and support to reduce
cancellations in less experienced countries (i.e., those with less than 23 prior PPPs) to a 5%
cancellation level.
The results of this study also have implications for future research. Future research could focus
on evaluating the impact of PPP country and subnational government experience on the quality
of infrastructure and service provision. At the moment, there exist only some general insights on
the effects of PPP country experience that are based on quantitative analysis, and these are
limited to the impact on contract sustenance, whereas the impacts of learning for particular
facets of PPP implementation are case-based and often anecdotal. Future research could also
examine the channels of learning to support future PPPs, including what impact centralized PPP
units have on accumulating and disseminating lessons learned to improve the future success of
PPPs and how widely-disseminated PPP 'best practice' (e.g., standardized contract clauses)
improves the success of future PPPs. Also, it would be helpful to examine what lessons are
transferable across sectors and geography – in other words, what PPP factors are inevitably local
and unique, demanding customization, and what can be more readily transferred from
international experience to directly inform new markets. Lastly, related analyses of the drivers of
PPP cancellations could be enriched by analyzing the effects of different contract types, e.g.
management contract, lease / affermage, Build Operate & Transfer (BOT) contract and its
variants, concessions (including Design-Build-Operate-Finance contracts) and divestitures.
