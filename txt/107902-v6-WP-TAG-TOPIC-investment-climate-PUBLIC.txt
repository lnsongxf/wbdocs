    The term prerequisite program (PRPs) has evolved to be
    most frequently used to describe the systems that sup-
    port HACCP. The importance of prerequisite programs
    in this context cannot be overstated.

    Prerequisite programs are good agricultural, manufac-
    turing and/or hygienic practices that create the founda-
    tions for the production of safe food.

    The internationally accepted requirements for prerequi-
    sites are defined in the Codex General Principles of Food

towards organic production, where no inorganic substanc-                           Waste management standards in line with waste hierar-

producers who meet those requirements are allowed to label
their products as “organic.” In the EU, products of organic
farming are visibly marked with the logo, which is mandated
by legislation and it must be used, as per legislation.41

It is often found that developing and transitional countries
expect organic production to increase their profits from the
export of agricultural products to developed markets. Be-
fore launching this type of production, a cost benefit analy-
sis of the transfer from conventional to organic production
should be performed. Also, data on soil contamination with
chemicals need to be assessed. Only after these data are as-
sessed, should the decision on launching organic production
be made. Often in developing countries, organic production
is only taken up for a limited number of products and the
majority of food continues to be produced according to the
conventional agricultural methods.
