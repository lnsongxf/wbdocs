      Clean and
Inclusive Cities
   in Argentina


     November 2016
“Clean and Inclusive Cities in Argentina” was produced as part of a technical assistance
on urban policies in support of the program of the World Bank on Agglomeration Econo-
mies and Resilience in Argentina and through financing from the Korean Green Growth
Trust Fund. The diagnostic served as is an input to the report ‘Leveraging the potential
of Argentine cities: A framework for policy action’ (World Bank, 2016) and the ‘Argentina:
Country Environmental Analysis’ (World Bank, 2016). The document was elaborated by
Karina Campos (Environmental Specialist Consultant, World Bank), John Morton (Senior
Urban Environment Specialist, World Bank) and Bernardo Deregibus (Urban Specialist
Consultant, World Bank). The document received important review comments and inputs
from Miguel Suarez (Solid Waste Management Specialist Consultant) and Silpa Kaza (Ur-
ban Development Specialist, World Bank). The team would like to thank Augustin Ma-
ria, World Bank Team Leader of the technical assistance on Agglomeration Economies
and Resilience in Argentina for his support and inputs as well as Ming Zhang (World
Bank Practice Manager, Social, Urban, Rural and Resilience Global Practice) and Jesko S.
Hentschel (World Bank Country Director, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay).

In addition, we thank the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development of
Argentina for their feedback on early drafts of the document and cooperation collecting
data for this diagnostic.

Summary

Cities and their agglomeration economies are an important engine for growth in Ar-
gentina. Argentina is a country of cities, with over 90 percent of its population living
in urban areas. Although highly diverse, Argentine cities have a common denominator:
they all play a key role in fostering Argentina’s sustainable economic growth and the
improving living standards of its population, especially the most vulnerable. Not only
do the country’s urban agglomerations benefit economically from the spatial concen-
tration of people and firms, but they also generate economy by concentrating ideas,
talent, and knowledge. However, to fully leverage the potential benefits of these agglo-
merations, the “congestion effects” caused by urbanization, including the associated
impacts on aesthetics, insecurity, air pollution, and failures in land and labor markets,
among others, need to be managed and contained.1

The cleanliness of a city is the backdrop for urban agglomeration economies. One of the
common “congestion effects” of urban agglomerations worldwide has been the sight of
city streets, buildings, public spaces, residential and commercial areas strewn with lit-
ter, graffiti, uncollected waste and other signs of poor maintenance. As the backdrop to
most all economic and residential activities in the city, ineffective services and the per-
ception of a uncleanly, disordered environment can have a subtle but systemic impact
on the functioning of the city and its individual neighborhoods affecting their livability,
property values, and attractiveness for businesses and tourism. It also can reduce a
population’s sense of security and confidence in their neighbors and local government
and contribute to a process of community decline in the medium and long term2. This
can be particularly impactful in the context of the multitude of challenges faced by mar-
ginalized and informal neighborhoods.

Urban growth has also created an unacceptable informal waste economy for the most
marginalized. Urban agglomerations and the resulting proximity of industries to resi-
dential and commercial sources of waste have also created a market for recycling that,
because of a lack of a modernized waste sector, has developed into a large informal
economy. It is estimated that currently over 4,000,000 people in Latin America work
in the informal waste sector collecting recyclable materials from the streets and from
open dumpsites, often times living and working under difficult conditions and with low
incomes. In many cases because of the combination of easy entry into the livelihood
and poor working conditions, informal recycling functions as an unacceptable social
safety net for the most marginalized people including the unemployed, addicts and
commonly children.

 Adapted from “Leveraging the Potential of Argentine Cities, A Framework for Policy Action”, World Bank
(2016) which was undertaken in conjunction with this diagnostic. The study identified three main challen-
ges to take full advantage of the benefits of agglomeration economies: (1) moving toward a more balanced
regional development; (2) transitioning from local to global cities; and (3) transitioning from urban sprawl to
articulated densities.

 Litter, lack of cleanliness and other physical disorder creates a perception of lawlessness and that there is a
lack of guardianship which in the case of opportunistic crime can affect the perception of opportunity of the
offender and sense of security felt by the suitable victim.(Cullen 2010; Wilcox et al. 2003; Cohen and Felson).
The impact of physical disorder such as litter on community decline is based on the Broken Window theory (J.
Q. Wilson, G. L. Kelling, 1982) which suggests that signs of disorderly and petty criminal behavior trigger more
disorderly and petty criminal behavior, thus causing the behavior to spread. This may cause a development
sequence in a neighborhood leading in the medium and long term to decay and deterioration of the quality of
life of its inhabitants.

Municipalities bear the responsibility for clean urban areas. Solid waste management
services, cleaning and beautification are the responsibility of municipalities in much of
the world and Argentina is no exception. It is one of the most important urban services
provided at the municipal level, affecting citizen’s daily lives and for many is representa-
tive of the ability of their municipal government to manage the urban area. However, the
service is often times the least modernized of municipal services and the most costly; and
municipalities are challenged to provide these services to the entire population while
building the citizen participation necessary to sustain a clean community.

Clean and Inclusive Cities in Argentina

This document reviews the existing information on solid waste management and city
cleanliness to understand how the country’s municipalities are responding to this im-
portant challenge and how these services are supporting the growing urban agglome-
rations in the country. The review provides data by urban agglomeration but also inclu-
des data at the provincial and national level. It considers not only the service coverage
and infrastructure but the role they play in a range of issues including the proximity of
waste to people’s homes, inequality of access to services, and the impact on municipal
budgets. Informality, both in terms of informal employment in the waste sector and
the ability of municipal services to reach informal and precarious urban settlements, is
also considered. The review is intended as a compilation of data for use by local and
national governments, international organizations, academics and non-governmental
organizations in their ongoing efforts to improve cities. The data presented highlights
the current service gaps and opportunities that can be explored to avoid the costs of
congestion in order maximize Argentina’s cities’ role as an engine for inclusive growth.

Some of the important conclusions are:

Solid waste management and city cleaning services have among the lowest service
coverage relative to other basic services. Nationally, over 4 million people (10.1 per-
cent) do not have regular waste collection service, 7.3 million (18.4 percent) do not have
street sweeping service and 19.8 million people (46.5 percent) do not have disposal
service in sanitary landfills. This is a significantly larger deficit than other basic services
in Argentina3.

The service gap is acute in informal and precarious settlements. Low income popula-
tions living in informal and precarious urban settlements are suffering the most from
deficiencies in waste management service. 58.6 percent of households in informal or
precarious urban settlements consider open dumpsites a problem in their neighbor-
hood and 17.9 percent do not have waste collection service.

There is a high level of informal employment. Nationally, an estimated 323,354 people
work in services related to solid waste and city cleaning and 117,698, or 36 percent,
are people working informally, predominantly collecting, sorting and selling recyclable
materials.

Municipalities spend a significant amount on solid waste and cleaning services. Muni-
cipalities, on average, spend 13 percent of their budget on solid waste and city cleaning
services. Tariffs have been established in some municipalities which, on average, cover

 Estimated service deficits in Argentina based on available information are: Water supply: 829,000 people without
access (2%); Sanitation: 1,658,000 people with access (4%); Electricity: 580,000 people without access (1%)


                                                                                                               8
30 percent of the budget for these services. These tariffs, on average, can be collected
from only 50 percent of the people benefitting from the service.

Service coverage is higher in urban agglomerations. Urban agglomerations have been
able to provide solid waste management and city cleaning services to a large proportion
of the population, with 95.7 percent of the population benefitting from regular collection
service (verses 89.1 percent nationally) and 77 percent of the population benefitting
from sanitary landfill disposal service (verses 53.5 percent nationally).

The urban agglomerations in the northern part of the country more commonly have
gaps in service provision. On average waste collection service is lower in the urban
agglomerations in the Northeast (90.9 percent versus 95.7 in all urban agglomerations
nationally) with Formosa having the lowest, servicing 77.1 percent of the population.
Similarly, five urban agglomerations in the northern part of the country (Jujuy-Palpala,
Greater Resistencia, Santiago del Estero-La Banda, Greater Catamarca, and Corrientes)
do not have a sanitary landfill.

Greater Buenos Aires contains the highest absolute number of people affected by poor
solid waste management. One third of the population in the country without regular
waste collection service (633,622 people) live in Greater Buenos Aires. In addition, the-
re are 1,453,749 people in Greater Buenos Aires living within three blocks of an open
dumpsite.

There are higher levels of informal employment in urban agglomerations. Within the 31
main urban agglomerations in the country, an estimated 60 percent (61,977 people) of
those working in solid waste and city cleaning related services are working informally.
Outside of urban agglomerations it is estimated that 25 percent of the employment re-
lated to these services is informal.

Regionalized services are being established to take advantage of the economies of scale
provided in urban agglomerations. Regional landfills and waste transfer stations, which
aggregate the waste from multiple municipalities to take advantage of the economies
of scale of these services, have been developed in several urban agglomerations. There
are waste transfer stations in 6 of the 31 main urban agglomerations and an estimated
31.4 percent of the waste generated in the 31 main agglomerations is being processed
through a waste transfer station. Regional sanitary landfills have been setup in some
urban agglomerations using various management arrangements including in Greater
Salta; Greater Tucuman, Rawson-Trelew, Greater Cordoba, Greater Buenos Aires, Misio-
nes and Greater Rosario.

Methodology

In the following chapters, a diagnostic of municipal solid waste management and cleansing
services in Argentina is presented. As summarized in Figure 1, solid waste management
was analyzed in an integrated manner, evaluating waste collection, sweeping, waste transfer,
waste treatment, and final disposal services. For each of these elements, whenever informa-
tion was available, indicators of service coverage and efficiency were analyzed. In addition,
the report includes an analysis of: (a) data on the quantity of households living near open
dumpsites; (b) a measurement of performance for solid waste management implemented in
a sample of municipalities; (c) costs of services; and (d) data on the number of formal and
informal jobs created by the solid waste sector. Points (a) and (b) help evaluate the efficiency
of the service, and points (c) and (d) shed light on the finance and economics of the services
and their relationship to informal employment.

The report includes data from publicly available sources of information on solid waste
management in Argentina, and also provides new or updated indicators based on avai-
lable information. Additional data was also collected specifically for this report when
no updated and consolidated source of information was available. The report includes
national, regional, provincial, and municipal level data and makes comparisons to ave-
rages of the Latin America and the Caribbean Region. Figure 2 summarizes the main
sources of information used for each of these different levels of analysis.

  National Census: The National Institute of Statistics and Censuses (INDEC) conducted
  the National Census of Population, Households, and Housing in both 2001 and 2010.The
  scope of the census is the whole country, including every urban and rural household. It
  measures the service by “segment” which is a unit that represents the geographic area
  that was assigned to a census worker and aggregates the data by region within Argen-
  tina, province, department (the political subdivision below the province) or ‘partido’ (the
  political subdivision in the Province of Buenos Aires). Data on waste collection from the
  National Census in 2001 and 2010 are used in this report.

  Regional Evaluation of Municipal Solid Waste Management in Latin America and the
  Caribbean (EVAL): In 2010, the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), in association
  with the Inter-American Association of Sanitary and Environmental Engineering (AIDIS),
  carried out a Regional Evaluation of Municipal Solid Waste Management (EVAL) based
  on surveys of municipal representatives from a sample of municipalities, providing ave-
  rage results for the Latin America and Caribbean Region and also provided results by
  country including information by region and size of municipality. In 2002, the IADB and
  the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) published a similar evaluation with data
  collected in 2001. In 2013, the IADB also published a technical note on waste mana-
  gement in Argentina with more specific information for the country based on the data
  collected in the previous reports. The chosen regions in these reports were different
  than those used by INDEC:

	       Misiones, San Juan, and San Luis);

	       Region III: Central and Patagonia (Provinces of Buenos Aires, Córdoba, Chubut, 	
	       La Pampa, Neuquén, Río Negro, Santa Cruz, Santa Fe, Tierra del Fuego, and the 	
	       City of Buenos Aires)

Data on waste collection, street sweeping and urban cleaning, waste transfer, waste
disposal, and jobs generated by the solid waste management sector from these sour-
ces are used in this report.

Permanent Survey of Households (Encuesta Permanente de Hogares, EPH): The Per-
manent Survey of Households (EPH) is undertaken every quarter by INDEC. It includes
data from the 31 main urban agglomerations comprising the provincial capitals and
urban agglomerations with more than 100,000 inhabitants. Data from between 2010
and 2014 on waste collection, overall population, and population living near dumpsites
from the Permanent Survey of Households are used in this report.

Annual Survey of Households (Encuesta Anual de Hogares Urbanos, EAHU): In addition
to the Permanent Survey of Households (EPH), INDEC carries out an Annual Survey of
Urban Households (EAHU) which covers households in all urban municipalities with
more than 2,000 inhabitants. Data from between 2010 and 2013 on population living
near dumpsites from the Annual Survey of Urban Households are used in this report.

Survey of Argentina’s Social Debt (Encuesta de la Deuda Social Argentina, EDSA): This
is a survey undertaken by the Argentine Catholic University (UCA) that focuses on ur-
ban households. The latest survey covered the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires and
16 other urban agglomerations with a sample size of 5,700 households. Data from be-
tween 2010 and 2015 on waste collection and population living near dumpsites from
the Survey of Argentina’s Social Debt are used in this report.

National Urban Solid Waste Management Project (MAyDS): The National Urban Solid
Waste Management Project of the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Develo-
pment (MAyDS) was a World Bank financed project executed between 2006 and 2015
that provided support to the solid waste planning and investment program in Argenti-
na. As part of the Project, data was collected nationally and in targeted municipalities.
The data collection efforts included, most significantly, the implementation of a detailed
methodology to assess the costs of waste management services at the municipal level;
a detailed socioeconomic evaluation; and a comprehensive performance evaluation of
municipalities. Data on waste collection, waste transfer, waste treatment, waste dis-
posal, municipal performance in solid waste management, jobs generated by the solid
waste management sector and costs of solid waste management services from the
National Urban Solid Waste Management Project are used in this report. The data co-
llected originated from between 2012 and 2015.

Municipalities, Private Companies, Official Websites and Publically Available Sources.
To supplement, confirm and update the data available through secondary sources,
information was obtained directly through municipalities and private companies and
through a variety of publically available resources on the internet. Data on waste collec-
tion, waste transfer, waste treatment and waste disposal from these sources are used in
this report.The information was collected in 2015.

Solid Waste Studies and Plans: Many provinces and municipalities undertake solid
waste planning studies or project design studies as part of the process of establishing
and improving their solid waste system. In addition, a National Plan was developed in
2005 and updated in 2012. Data on waste treatment and jobs generated by the solid
waste management sector from these sources are used in this report. The majority of
plans were published between 2010 and 2014.

Child Labor in the Recovery and Recycling of Solid Waste: In 2006, the International
Organization for Migration (IOM) and the United Nations Children’s Emergency Fund
(UNICEF) published a report on child labor in the recovery and recycling of solid was-
te. The report provides data on the City of Buenos Aires, the Department (‘partido’) of
Moreno (Buenos Aires Province), and Posadas (Misiones Province) in the year 2004.
The number of children and teenage workers includes those that could counted during
the time period of the survey. Data on jobs generated by the solid waste management
sector and separation plants from this source are used in this report.

1. Waste collection services

  The country has high levels of waste collection service coverage in urban areas. 94.8
  percent of households in urban areas and 95.7 percent of those in the 31 main urban
  agglomerations have waste collection service at least twice a week. In terms of absolu-
  te numbers, however the deficit in service is significant.1,868,411 people in urban areas
  do not have this service, and 33 percent of this unserved population is located in Greater
  Buenos Aires.

  89.9 percent of the population in urban and rural areas have waste collection service
  at least twice a week. A total of 4,004,221 people do not have this service including
  2,135,810 people in rural areas.

  Between 2001 and 2010, the expansion of waste collection service kept pace with po-
  pulation growth. An additional 3.9 million people were provided waste collection service
  at least twice a week during this time period. As this increase was comparable to the
  overall population growth, there was not a substantial increase in the proportion of the
  population provided with this service (it was 89.7 percent in 2001 and 89.9 percent in
  2010).

  Waste collection service coverage in urban areas is significantly lower in informal or
  precarious urban settlements. Among urban households located in informal or preca-
  rious urban settlements, 17.9 percent of households did not have waste collection ser-
  vice at least every other day. This service deficit is four times higher than that for the
  general urban population.

  The percentage of urban households without waste collection service increases signi-
  ficantly in low income populations. A higher proportion of urban households that are
  marginal working class (8.7 percent do not have service) and in houses where the head
  of household is unemployed or underemployed (7.8 percent) do not have waste collec-
  tion service at least every other day.The deficit for this service for both households in
  the medium-high socioeconomic strat and with a professional head of household is 1.2
  percent.

  There are inequalities in waste collection service in urban areas. The proportion of hou-
  seholds with waste collection service at least twice a week in urban areas is lower in the
  Northeast provinces (90.9 percent on average), with the lowest service coverage found
  in Formosa (77.1 percent). Among the 31 main urban agglomerations, Santa Rosa-Toay
  has the highest proportion of households with waste collection service at least twice a
  week (98.9 percent) and Greater Resistencia has the lowest (88.7 percent).

  Provinces in the Northeast achieved the most significant improvements in overall waste
  collection service between 2001 and 2010. In 2001, the provinces of Chaco, Corrientes,
  Formosa and Misiones had the lowest overall (including urban and rural) proportion
  of households with waste collection service at least twice a week. By 2010, the service
  coverage in these provinces increased, covering an additional 5.1 to 7.3 percent of the
  population.

  Deficiencies in equipment are worse in the Northern Region and in smaller municipali-
  ties. Nationally 45 percent of the collection vehicles are more than 10 years old, and in
  small municipalities (<15,000 people) this number increases to 85 percent. In addition,
  waste generated by 29.5 percent of population is collected with vehicles without a com-
  pactor, a number which increases to 45.8 percent in the Northern region.

  Greater Buenos Aires is host to the largest population without waste collection service.
  One third of the population without collection service at least twice a week (633,622
  people) live in Greater Buenos Aires.

  76 percent of the surveyed population from six urban agglomerations are satisfied or
  very satisfied with their waste collection service.




                                                                                           15
                                                               1. Waste collection services




1.1 National Census 2001 and 2010

The National Census evaluated waste collection service coverage considering that a
household has service when there is a presence of regular service in a “segment” at
least twice a week. A “segment” is a unit which represents the geographic area that was
assigned to a census worker. The presence of waste collection service is determined by
the census worker based in the predominant situation in a given segment as recorded
in the survey.

The National Census reports data on solid waste collection service coverage nationwide,
by province and department and in the case of Buenos Aires Province by ‘partido’ (a
political subdivision of Buenos Aires Province). In addition to the total number of hou-
seholds and inhabitants with waste collection service, the National Census provides
disaggregated figures for waste collection service coverage for both urban and rural
households and inhabitants. As the National Census does not report data by munici-
pality (the administrative jurisdiction of a town or city within a department) or urban
agglomeration (urban areas as defined by the Permanent Survey of Households), for the
purpose of this study, figures disaggregated by urban agglomerations were developed.
This was done by determining the departments that comprise each urban agglomera-
tion and then adding the number of urban households and inhabitants provided with the
service. The National Census also analyzes the characteristics of the households. In the
2001 National Census it was possible to analyze waste collection service coverage for
different types of housing.

  A Type B house is a house with at least one of the following conditions: has a dirt or loose brick floor (no ceramic flooring, tile, mosaic, marble, wood, carpet, concrete,
or brick fixed), has no provision of piped water inside the house, or does not water discharge. A type A house do not have any of these characteristics and is not a ranch
or Precarious house.

  A precarious house is usually made out of low quality materials or waste, it is found in urban areas.




                                            Data analysis

                                            - The country has a high level of waste collection service coverage in urban areas, with
                                            94.8 percent of households in urban areas having collection service at least twice a
                                            week. In the 31 main urban agglomerations it is slightly higher, reaching 95.7 percent.

                                            - Considering not only urban, but also rural households, 89.9 percent of households in
                                            the country have waste collection service at least twice week.

                                            - There are significant populations without service. Nationwide, 4,004,221 persons do
                                            not have waste collection service at least twice a week. When only taking into account
                                            urban households, 1,868,411 persons do not have this service and 33 percent of this
                                            unserved population lives in Greater Buenos Aires.

                                            - Table 1 shows significant differences in waste collection service coverage among
                                            provinces. The proportion of households with waste collection service at least twice a
                                            week in urban areas is lower in the Northeast provinces, with Formosa being the lowest
                                            (77.1 percent). Similarly, service coverage is lower in these provinces when considering
                                            both urban and rural households. Chaco, Corrientes, Formosa, and Santiago del Este-
                                            ro, have a significantly lower proportion of households with waste collection service
                                            at least twice a week, ranging from 62.5 percent (Santiago del Estero) to 78.9 percent
                                            (Corrientes).

                                            - There is no significant increase in the percentage of households with waste collection
                                            service at least twice a week (0.2 percent increase) over the period of the two National
                                            Census (2001 and 2010). However, it should be noted that the country’s population
                                            grew 10.6 percent over this period. Therefore, the expansion of this waste collection
                                            service managed to keep pace with population growth. In 2001, waste collection at least

                                                               1. Waste collection services




twice a week was provided to 31,695,832 people, while in 2010, 35,668,299 people were
provided this service.

- Between 2001 and 2010, Misiones, Formosa, Corrientes, and Chaco, all Northeast pro-
vinces, achieved the most significant improvements (greater than 5 percent improve-
ment) in the proportion of households with waste collection service at least twice a
week. Those provinces also had the lowest proportion of households with waste collec-
tion service in 2001.

- Three Patagonian provinces (Chubut, Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego), the City of
Buenos Aires and the 24 ‘partidos’ of Buenos Aires Province did not manage to keep
pace with the inter-census population growth. Considering both urban and rural areas,
between 2001 and 2010 there was a reduction in the proportion of households with
waste collection service at least twice a week.

- There are differences in the proportion of the population with access to waste collec-
tion service at least twice a week among the 31 main urban agglomerations, with
Santa Rosa-Toay having the highest service coverage (98.9 percent) and Greater Re-
sistencia having a service coverage that is more than 10 percent lower (88.7 percent).
Deficiencies are concentrated in the Northeast and Northwest urban agglomerations
including Formosa, Greater Resistencia, and Santiago del Estero-La Banda. These ur-
ban agglomerations also contain the provinces with highest deficit in service coverage
when waste collection service coverage is analyzed by province.

- There are differences in access to waste collection service at least twice a week de-
pending on the type of house. While 94.0 percent of “type A” houses have waste collec-
tion service at least twice a week, this number decreases to 79.0 percent for “precarious
houses”, 72.2 percent for “type B’” houses, and 34.6 percent for “ranches”. This indica-
tes that in precarious urban settlements, and in rural areas, where ranches are common,
there is a higher percentage of households without this service.

- In the 31 main urban agglomerations over 25.5 million inhabitants have waste collec-
tion service at least twice a week.

                                          The Regional Evaluation of Municipal Solid Waste Management (EVAL), 2010 provides
                                          information on solid waste collection services from a sample of municipalities. Results
                                          are based on surveys of municipal representatives who provide information on the per-
                                          centage of inhabitants with waste collection, the average frequency, equipment types
                                          and amount and information on special services (debris collection and waste collection
                                          from markets). The data is reported nationally and by sub-region and disaggregated by
                                          size of municipality. As the survey was undertaken for the entire Latin America and the
                                          Caribbean Region it allows comparisons with averages for the Region.

Data analysis

- Both the EVAL (2010) report and the 2010 National Census assessed the waste collec-
tion service coverage in the same year, but the numbers found by EVAL are significantly
higher. They use different methodologies. The numbers presented in the 2010 National
Census are based in the assessment of the census workers, who used survey results to
determine the predominant situation in given census area or segment, while EVAL is ba-
sed on information provided by municipal representatives for a sample of municipalities.

- Argentina has more frequent waste collection than the Latin America and Caribbean
Regional average. The percentage of the population with daily waste collection service
nationally (71.9 percent) is much higher than the Latin America and the Caribbean Re-
gional average (45.4 percent).

- EVAL estimated that the country has 1.3 vehicles per 10,000 inhabitants, which is the
same as the Latin America and the Caribbean Regional average.

- There are differences in waste collection service provision between regions in Argen-
tina. Region I, has the worst indicators related to equipment and are below the averages
for the Latin America and the Caribbean Region. Region III, which includes the Greater
Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area, has a higher number of vehicles per 10,000
inhabitants (1.5), a newer fleet of vehicles (60 percent are less than 10 years old), and a
higher number of vehicles with compactors (75.4 percent) than the other regions.

- Table 4 also shows differences among different sized municipalities. According to
EVAL, the smaller the size of the municipality, the higher the number of vehicles per
10,000 inhabitants. Smaller municipalities are also less likely to have vehicles with a
compactor and more likely to have old trucks.

- With 45 percent of vehicles being more than 10 years old, Argentina has an older ve-
hicle fleet than the Latin America and the Caribbean regional average. This indicator is
even worse in Region I (66 percent), and in municipalities with less than 15,000 inhabi-
tants (85 percent).

- 29.5 percent of the population has waste collection service that does not utilize com-
pactor trucks. Region I has the lowest numbers in this category, with almost 45.8 per-
cent of the population being served by waste collection without compactors.

- In the country, some municipalities provide special collection services such as cons-
truction and demolition waste collection or collection services for markets. In this case,
Region II has the lowest service coverage for these special services.

                                         1.3 Survey of Argentina’s Social Debt (EDSA)

                                         The Survey of Argentina’s Social Debt (EDSA) is performed by the ‘Observatory of Ar-
                                         gentina’s Social Debt’, an institutional research department in the Catholic University
                                         of Argentina (UCA). The observatory has been carrying out surveys in urban agglome-
                                         rations since 2004. The survey includes Buenos Aires metropolitan area and 16 other
                                         urban agglomerations with a sample size of 5,700 households.

                                         The section of the survey that analyzes public services takes into account waste co-
                                         llection. Specifically, the survey asks,“In the block where your house is situated, is there
                                         waste collection at least every other day?”. Unlike the National Census, where the cen-
                                         sus worker evaluates if there is service coverage for a census area (‘segment’) based
                                         on survey results, or EVAL, where the municipal representative assesses total service
                                         coverage, EDSA provides direct information using individual household survey respon-
                                         ses. The survey assesses access to the service for different socioeconomic levels and
                                         for different urban agglomerations and specifically provides service coverage levels for
                                         households located in informal or precarious urban settlements (the survey specifically
                                         mentions “villas”, or slums, and precarious settlements).

Data analysis

- The proportion of households with waste collection service coverage at least every
other day in selected urban agglomerations reported in EDSA between 2010 and 2015
(95.4-96.8 percent) is similar to the proportion of households with waste collection ser-
vice at least once a week from the National Census in 2010 for the 31 main urban agglo-
merations (95.7) and for urban areas nationwide (94.8).

- For households located in informal or precarious urban settlements, the percentage of
households without service at least every other day (17.9 percent) is four times higher
than the average for the urban population (4.3 percent) and more than twice as high as
that for households in the low socioeconomic stratum but with an urban layout (7.1
percent).

- The percentage of households without waste collection service at least every other
day is higher for households that have an unemployed or underemployed head of hou-
sehold (7.8 percent) and in households belonging to the ‘marginal working class’ (8.7
percent). The percentage of households without waste collection service at least every
other day is the lowest for households in the medium-high socioeconomic stratum and
in houses with a professional head of household (both are 1.2 percent).

- Between 2010 and 2015, there was no improvement in the proportion of households
with waste collection service coverage at least once a week for urban households or for
households in informal or precarious urban settlements.




1.4 National Urban Solid Waste Management Project (MAyDS)
Socioeconomic Evaluation

Under the National Urban Solid Waste Management Project of the Ministry of Environ-
ment and Sustainable Development (MAyDS), a socioeconomic survey with 3,600 res-
pondents from six Argentine urban agglomerations was undertaken in 2014. The survey
included questions about the level of satisfaction with waste collection service in par-
ticular as well as with public services in general. The selected urban agglomerations
were Greater Mendoza, the ‘partidos’ of La Matanza and Berazategui (Greater Buenos
Aires), and Rosario, where waste is collected six times a week, on average; Resistencia
where waste is collected four times a week; and San Salvador de Jujuy where waste is
collected three times a week.

                                        - 68 percent of the respondents described the quality of public services as ‘good’ or
                                        ‘very good’, while for waste collection in particular, the results show that 76 percent of
                                        those surveyed are ‘satisfied’ or ‘very satisfied’ with the service.

                                        - 93 percent of those surveyed said that they properly dispose waste in front of their
                                        door or in the nearby container, as applicable. In addition, 68 percent said they would
                                        store waste in their house if the waste is not collected for one week. This number is
                                        higher (83 percent) in San Salvador de Jujuy and lower (49 percent) in Villa Gobernador
                                        Galvez.

2. Street sweeping and urban cleaning services

  The country has high levels of street sweeping service coverage. 81.6 percent of the
  population benefits from street sweeping services which is close to the average for the
  Latin America and the Caribbean Region (82.3 percent). This corresponds to 7.3 million
  people without street sweeping service in 2010.


  Street sweeping service coverage is particularly low in Region II (Provinces of Corrien-
  tes, Entre Ríos, Mendoza, Misiones, San Juan, and San Luis). This region has the lowest
  service coverage (64.3 percent versus 81.6 nationwide) while the other regions have
  street sweeping service coverages that are closer to the national average (83.9 percent
  for Region I and 84.9 percent for Region III).


  Mechanized street sweeping services are also high. The proportion of the population
  with mechanized street sweeping service is 18.9 percent in the country, which is signifi-
  cantly higher than the average for the Latin America and the Caribbean Region (7.1 per-
  cent). This service exists in municipalities of all sizes with an average service coverage
  of 12.9 percent in thevery small municipalities; 9.3 percent in the small municipalities;
  22.6 percentin the medium-sized municipalities; and 18.1 percent in the large munici-
  palities.

  The number of mechanized sweeping vehicles is high. Municipalities have an average
  of 0.4 mechanized vehicles per 10,000 inhabitants nationwide which is higher than the
  average for the Latina America and the Caribbean Region (0.2 per 10,000 inhabitants)
  and the percentage of vehicles that are in good working condition (87 percent) is also
  higher than the average for the Latin America and the Caribbean Region (81 percent).
  The number of mechanized sweeping vehicles also varies significantly between regions
  and among different sizes of municipalities.The highest values are found for municipa-
  lities with less than 15,000 inhabitants (1.0 vehicles per 10,000 habitants) and for the
  Northern region (0.9 vehicles per 10,000 inhabitants).




  2.1 Regional Evaluation of Municipal Solid Waste Management in Latin
  America and the Caribbean (EVAL)

  The Regional Evaluation of Municipal Solid Waste Management (EVAL) obtained data
  from 2001 and 2010 on street sweeping, and special urban cleaning services (parks
  and garden maintenance and cleaning up after fairs and exhibitions) from a sample of
  municipalities. Results are based on surveys of municipal representatives who provide
  information on the percentage of inhabitants with the service and other information.
  The data is reported nationally and by sub-region and disaggregated by size of muni-
  cipality. As the survey is done for the entire Latin America and the Caribbean Region, it
  allows comparisons of data from Argentina with averages for the Region.

                                          There are waste transfer stations in the City of Buenos of Aires and 8 out of the 23
                                          provinces. An estimated 20.5 percent of the solid waste generated in the country goes
                                          through waste transfer stations.

                                          There are waste transfer stations in 6 of the 31 main urban agglomerations. 31.4 per-
                                          cent of the solid waste generated in the 31 main urban agglomerations goes through
                                          transfer stations.

                                          Waste transfer stations located in Greater Buenos Aires are responsible for 76.3 percent
                                          of the total solid waste transferred in the country. This amounts to 7,300 tons of waste
                                          per day.

                                          The use of waste transfer stations is more significant in large municipalities.The per-
                                          centage of the population that have waste transfer service is 42 percent among large
                                          municipalities (300,001- 5 million inhabitants) and zero percent in municipalities with
                                          less than 15,000 inhabitants.

                                          There are three common circumstances where waste transfer stations are found in Ar-
                                          gentina. Waste transfer stations are found in several very large urban agglomerations;
                                          in municipalities with significant tourism; and in cases where regional disposal systems
                                          were encouraged by a particular policy or financing source.

                                          information on solid waste transfer services from a sample of municipalities. Results
                                          are based on surveys of municipal representatives who provide information on the per-
                                          centage of inhabitants with waste transfer service for collected waste. The data is re-

                                            - EVAL indicates there are differences in waste transfer service coverage depending on
                                            the size of the municipality. Municipalities with less than 300,000 inhabitants have sig-
                                            nificantly lower levels of waste transfer service coverage, indicating that waste transfer
                                            stations are mainly used in larger municipalities.

                                           For the purposes of this report, a compilation of existing waste transfer stations and
                                           an estimation of the tons of solid waste that go through waste transfer stations was
                                           carried out. The data was based on available information from the National Urban So-
                                           lid Waste Management Project (MAyDS), consultations with municipal representatives,
                                           and information available in official Internet webpages. The data is different than that of
                                           EVAL is based on the tons of waste being transferred rather than the population covered
                                           by transfer service.

Data analysis

- Waste transfer service exists in the City of Buenos Aires and in 8 out of 23 provinces
(37.5 percent of these jurisdictions). The province with the highest number of waste
transfer stations is Misiones (25 transfer stations).

- Waste transfer stations exist in 6 out of the 31 main urban agglomerations: Grea-
ter Buenos Aires; Greater San Miguel; Greater Rosario; Greater Cordoba; Posadas; and
Rawson-Trelew.

- The waste transfer stations located in Greater Buenos Aires account for the majority
total solid waste transferred in the country and in the 31 main agglomerations.

- Table 11 indicates there are three main areas where waste transfer stations are lo-
cated: (i) the large urban agglomerations (Greater Buenos Aires, Greater San Miguel de
Tucumán, and Rosario);(ii) small and medium-sized tourist municipalities (Pagancillo,
Trevelin, San Martín de los Andes, and Puerto Madryn); and (iii) those where provin-
cial authorities encouraged the establishment of regional disposal systems that involve
waste transfer stations (Misiones and Cordoba) or where international financing ins-
titutions had programs to encourage this (the waste transfer stations in Tucumán, La
Rioja, Chubut, and Neuquén were developed as part of regional disposal systems that
were encouraged by IADB and World Bank – financed programs).

4. Waste treatment services


  There are 147 solid waste treatment plants in the country. The City of Buenos Aires and
  19 out of the 23 provinces have at least one waste treatment plant. The provinces of
  Entre Ríos, Buenos Aires, and Santa Fe have the most, with more than 20 plants each.


  The waste treatment plants in the country have a combined designed treatment capa-
  city of 8,675 tons per day, enough to treat 18.6 percent of total solid waste generated
  in the country. Most treatment plants, however, operate below their designed treatment
  capacity and, in some cases, the plants are not operating.


  Most of the plants have a small to medium waste treatment capacity. 137 of the 147
  waste treatment plants in the country have a capacity of less than 100 of tons of waste
  per day.


  Larger treatment plants are found in the main urban agglomerations. 1/3 of Argentina’s
  waste treatment plants (49 plants), accounting for 78 percent of the waste treatment
  capacity (6,735 tons/day) in the country, is installed in the 31 main urban agglomera-
  tions.


  The City of Buenos Aires has the largest plants. Considering all the City’s waste treat-
  ment plants together, they account for 44.5 percent of total waste treatment capacity
  in the country and 57.3 percent of the capacity in the 31 main urban agglomerations.




  4.1 Data from the National Urban Solid Waste Management Project
  (MAyDS) and publically available information.

  The information presented in this chapter is based on public information provided by
  municipal representatives and treatment plant suppliers compiled in 2015 as well as
  diagnostics carried out by the National Urban Solid Waste Management Project (MA-
  yDS) in Formosa, Catamarca, Río Negro, and Entre Ríos provinces in 2014. Information
  on existing solid waste treatment plants, the municipality or municipalities using the
  plant, the population, and the estimated treatment capacity of the plant was compiled
  along with data on solid waste recycling companies. The data includes constructed me-
  chanized separation plants and uses the design treatment capacity but does not provide in-
  formation on the capacity in operation and therefore the actual amount being treated. It also
  does not include other forms of recycling such as ‘green points’, and formal and informal

Data analysis

- There are 147 solid waste treatment plants constructed in the country with a combi-
ned installed treatment capacity of 8,675 tons per day.

- The City of Buenos Aires and 19 out of the 23 provinces have at least one plant. The
provinces of Entre Ríos, Buenos Aires, Santa Fe have the most, with more than 20 plants
each.

- 18 of the 31 main urban agglomerations have waste treatment plants.

- The largest quantity of waste treatment plants are located in Region III (61 percent of
the plants in the country), followed by Region II (32 percent). Region I has the smallest
number (7 percent).

- 78 percent of the waste treatment capacity (6,735 tons per day) but only 1/3 of the
waste treatment plants (49 plants) in the country are located in the 31 main urban ag-
glomerations of the country.

- The City of Buenos Aires has a waste treatment capacity of 3,860 tons per day which
accounts for 44.5 percent of total waste treatment capacity in the country and 57.3
percent of the waste treatment capacity in the 31 main urban agglomerations. There
are also 3 plants under procurement or construction in the City of Buenos Aires that
together would provide an additional 2,020 tons per day of installed waste treatment
capacity.

- An estimated 18.6 percent of the total solid waste generated in the country and 23.2
percent of the solid waste generated in the 31 main urban agglomerations could be
treated if the capacity of constructed waste treatment plants is fully utilized.

- With a combined capacity of 2,750 tons per day, the construction and demolition was-
te treatment plants in the City of Buenos Aires and Rosario account for 31.7 percent of
the country’s installed waste treatment capacity and 40.8 percent of the installed treat-
ment capacity in the 31 main urban agglomerations.

- Most installed waste treatment plants are small or medium sized (only 10 out of 147
waste treatment plants have a capacity greater than or equal to 100 tons per day).
Apart from the waste treatment plants in the City of Buenos Aires, the largest facilities
are found in Rosario (2 plants, 350 and 220 tons per day), Paraná (400 tons per day),
Bahia-Blanca (140 tons per day), and Mar del Plata (120 tons per day).

- Table 14 shows that the waste recycling companies are concentrated in the provinces
of Buenos Aires and Santa Fe, and the City of Buenos Aires.

                               An estimated 53.5 percentof the population dispose of their waste in sanitary landfills.
                               An estimated 19.8 million people do not have this service and 24,101 tons of waste per
                               day is not properly disposed.

                               The City of Buenos Aires and 17 out of 23 provinces have at least one sanitary landfill in
                               operation. Notable exceptions are the provinces of Santa Cruz, Corrientes, Catamarca,
                               Jujuy, Chaco, and Formosa.

                               89 percent of the landfill capacity in the country is located in the 31 main urban agglo-
                               merations where 77 percent of the population have sanitary landfill disposal service.
                               However, 13 out of the 31 main urban agglomerations do not have a sanitary landfill
                               including five in the northern part of the country (Jujuy-Palpala, Greater Resistencia,
                               Santiago del Estero-La Banda, Greater Catamarca, and Corrientes).

                               Regional disposal service provision is common but takes different forms. In several
                               urban agglomerations there are disposal services shared among different municipali-
                               ties. A variety of institutional arrangements have been pursued including the formation
                               of public companies, consortiums of municipalities and having a single municipality
                               provide the service for others.

                               The Regional Evaluation of Municipal Solid Waste Management (EVAL), 2002 and 2010
                               provides data on solid waste disposal practices (sanitary landfill, dumpsites and bur-
                               ning practices) and equipment for disposal from a sample of municipalities. Results are
                               based on surveys of municipal representatives who provide information on the percen-
                               tage of inhabitants with waste disposal service for collected waste. The data is reported
                               nationally, by region and disaggregated by size of municipality. As the survey is done re-
                               gionally it allowed comparisons with the entire Latin America and the Caribbean Region.

                                             Data analysis

                                             - According to EVAL, in 2010, the country has a higher sanitary landfill waste disposal
                                             service coverage (64.7 percent) than the average for the Latin America and the Carib-
                                             bean Region (54.4 percent).

                                             - According to EVAL, in 2001, 60.7 percent of the population in Argentina disposed of
                                             their waste in sanitary landfills, indicating there was not a significant improvement be-
                                             tween 2001 and 2010.

                                             - There are significant differences in the proportion of the population that disposes their
                                             waste in sanitary landfills between regions. For example, 79.4 of the population of Re-
                                             gion III, which includes the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area, disposes their waste in
                                             sanitary landfills where as in Region II 15.2 percent of the population disposes their
                                             waste in sanitary landfills.

                                             - In addition, there are differences in waste disposal service coverage depending on
                                             population of the municipality. In municipalities with less than 15,000 inhabitants only
                                             9.4 percent of populationon average disposes their waste in sanitary landfills while for
                                             municipalities with populations greater than 300,000, 89.4 percent of the population
                                             disposes their waste in sanitary landfills.

                                                                                                    5. Waste disposal services



                            - For every 10,000 inhabitants with waste disposal service there are: (i) 0.25 pieces of
                            equipment for compacting, (ii) 0.42 pieces of equipment for placing daily waste cover
                            material, and (iii) 0.40 pieces of equipment for other activities related to waste disposal.

                            - Figures from EVAL, indicate that in 2001 the number of pieces of equipment for opera-
                            tion of a waste disposal site per 10,000 inhabitants are: (i) for compacting of the waste
                            in the disposal site, 0.05, (ii) for placing cover material, 0.06, and (iii) for other activities
                            in the disposal site, 0.09. This indicates that there was a substantial increase the num-
                            ber of pieces of equipment at waste disposal sites between 2002 and 2010.

                            ble information.

                            As the data provided by EVAL in 2010 is slightly outdated in terms of sanitary landfi-
                            ll service coverage, for the purposes of this study, a compilation of existing sanitary
                            landfills in the country and an estimation of the total tons of waste disposed in these
                            landfills was carried out.

                            The data was based on available information from the National Urban Solid Waste Ma-
                            nagement Project (MAyDS), consultations with municipal representatives or operators,
                            and information available in official Internet web pages and other public documents.

                            To arrive at an updated value of sanitary landfill waste disposal service coverage and
                            the amount of waste disposed in sanitary landfills, a list of all the existing sanitary
                            landfills in the country was compiled. Quantities of waste (tons per day) disposed in
                            each landfill was gathered. Population served by these landfills was determined by the
                            population of the municipalities served by the landfill that have collection service using
                            National Census data and collection rates from the EVAL 2010 report by region. Total
                            waste generation was determined using the average per capita waste generation for
                            those serviced by these landfills and the total population using National Census data.

Data analysis

- An estimated 53.5 percent of the country’s population has sanitary landfill waste dis-
posal service. In EVAL 2010, the proportion of the population with this service was es-
timated to be 64.7 percent. Possible reasons for this discrepancy include: (a) between
2010 and 2015, there was an important reduction in amount of waste sent to landfills
by the City of Buenos Aires due to the development of recycling strategies; (b) there was
population growth so the same capacity now covers a lower percentage of population;
and/or (c) there are differences in the methodologies used.

- 89 percent of the landfill capacity in the country is located in the 31 main urban
agglomerations and this capacity is able to service 77 percent of the population of the-
se urban agglomerations.

- The City of Buenos Aires and 17 out of the 23 provinces have at least one sanitary
landfill in operation. Notable exceptions are the provinces of Santa Cruz, Corrientes,
Catamarca, Jujuy, Chaco, and Formosa.

- 18 of the 31 main urban agglomerations have at least one sanitary landfill. Five urban
agglomerations in the northern part of the country (Jujuy-Palpala, Greater Resistencia,
Santiago del Estero-La Banda, Greater Catamarca, and Corrientes) do not have a sani-
tary landfill.

- Some provinces have been successful in promoting regional landfills. For example,
Misiones has developed a system based on 25 waste transfer stations and two sanitary
landfills that services a large portion of the province.

- Large landfills are commonly operated by private companies (e.g., Mar del Plata, Grea-
ter Tucumán, Greater Cordoba, and Rosario) and small landfills are commonly operated
mainly by municipalities (e.g., Malargue, Alvear, El Bolson).

- Regional landfills also have private operators. In Virch-Valdez, Chubut; the Eastern
Zone of Mendoza (under construction in 2016); and Greater Tucumán a consortium is
in charge of supervising the operation of the system by a private company. In the case
of Greater Buenos Aires, a public company is in charge of the operation and they sub-
contract private companies.

- Manual sanitary landfills are not common.

6. People living near open dumpsites


  8.7 percent of urban households in the country are located within three blocks of an
  open dumpsite. Similarly, 8.8 percent of households in the 31 main urban agglomera-
  tions are located within three blocks of an open dumpsite.

  19.4 percent of urban households consider open dumpsites a problem in their neigh-
  borhood. This number is 58.6 percent for households located in informal settlements or
  precarious urban settlements.

  A person living in an informal settlement or precarious urban settlement is much more
  likely to live within three blocks of an open dumpsite. 39.5 percent of households in an
  informal urban settlement are located within three blocks of an open dumpsite.

  There are differences in proximity to open dumpsites among socio-economic levels.
  5.9 percent of households from the medium-high socioeconomic strata consider open
  dumpsites a problem in their neighborhood while this number increases to 34.7 percent
  for the very low socioeconomic strata.

  Between 2010 and 2015, there was no significant change in people living near open
  dumpsites. For the country overall, both the percentage of total urban households that
  considered open dumpsites a problem in their neighborhood and percentage of urban
  households within three blocks of an open dumpsite did not change significantly in any
  of the surveys.

  335,462 children in Greater Buenos Aires live within three blocks of an open dumpsite.




  6.1 The Survey of Argentina’s Social Debt (EDSA)

  Survey of Argentina’s Social Debt (EDSA) is performed by the ‘Observatory of Argenti-
  na’s Social Debt’, a research department in the Catholic University of Argentina (UCA).
  The observatory has been carrying out surveys in urban agglomerations since 2004.
  The last survey included the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires and 16 other urban ag-
  glomerations, with a sample size of 5,700.

  The section of the survey that analyzes quality of life takes into account the proximity
  of a household to open dumpsites by including the question “In your neighborhood, do
  you have problems with open dumpsites?”. It is worth highlighting that the results are
  based on the respondent’s perception. The survey allows disaggregation of this statis-
  tic for households located in informal or precarious urban settlements (includes “villas”
  or slums, and precarious settlements) and evaluates proximity of households to open
  dumpsites for different socioeconomic groups, based on their education levels, housing
  conditions, structure of the family, and urban agglomerations.

Data analysis

- The proximity of households to open dumpsites is a common problem in urban areas
in Argentina, and this problem is significantly worse in informal or precarious urban
settlements. In 2015, 19.4 percent of respondents from urban households replied that
open dumpsites were a problem in their neighborhood, and this number increased to
58.6 percent when only considering the responses of those living in informal or preca-
rious urban settlements.

- Between 2010 and 2015, there was not a significant change in the percentage of hou-
seholds that consider open dumpsites a problem in their neighborhood.

- Between 2010 and 2015 there was, similarly, no significant change in the households
located in informal or precarious urban settlements that consider open dumpsites a
problem in their neighborhood.

- The percentage of households located in low economic strata neighborhoods but with
an urban layout (areas with well-defined plots, roads and blocks and therefore not con-
sidered informal or precarious urban settlements) that consider dumpsites a problem in
their neighborhood is higher than the overall average (30.2 percent versus the national
average of 19.4 percent in 2015), but much lower than for households located in infor-
mal or precarious urban settlements (58.6 percent).

- The City of Buenos Aires has a significantly lower proportion of households that con-
sider open dumpsites a problem in their neighborhood.

- People with lower educational attainment and from lower socioeconomic strata are
more likely to consider open dumpsites a problem in their neighborhood. In 2015, 27.0
percent of households with a head of household without secondary school education
consider open dumpsites a problem in their neighborhood, while this number decreases
to 12.4 percent when the head of household has at least a secondary education. Simi-
larly, 5.9 percent of households from the medium-high socioeconomic strata consider
open dumpsites a problem in their neighborhood while this number increases to 34.7
percent for the very low socioeconomic strata.

- Households from a lower socioeconomic strata more commonly consider open dump-
sites a problem in their neighborhood than those from a higher socioeconomic strata
even when the neighborhood has a formal urban layout. 30.2 percent of households
with an urban layout from the low socioeconomic strata consider open dumpsites a
problem in their neighborhood.

                                        6.2 Permanent Survey of Households (EPH)

                                        INDEC undertakes surveys in the 31 main urban agglomerations every quarter. The sur-
                                        vey takes into account all provincial capitals and urban agglomerations with more than
                                        100,000 inhabitants, which comprise more than 70 percent of Argentina’s urban po-
                                        pulation. The EPH evaluates if there is an open dumpsite three blocks or less from the
                                        household and allows for comparison across years and type of household. The survey
                                        provides specific information for households located in informal settlements (the sur-
                                        vey refers to “villas de emergencia”, or slums).

                                         - There are important differences between urban agglomerations in terms of the per-

                                         - In Greater Buenos Aires, the percentage of households located within three blocks of
                                         an open dumpsite (12.3 percent) is slightly above the national average (8.7 percent).
                                         This represents the 1,331,198 people which is the highest absolute number of people

                                        6.3 Annual Survey of Urban Households (EAHU)

                                        In addition to the EPH, INDEC carries out an Annual Survey of Urban Households (EAHU)
                                        every year in those urban municipalities with more than 2,000 inhabitants. The ques-
                                        tionnaire is very similar to the one used in the EPH. The interviewer, based on the survey
                                        results, evaluates whether the household is within three blocks of an open dumpsite
                                        and the survey includes more and a larger proportion of the smaller municipalities than
                                        the EPH.

                                         - The EDSA reports higher values than the EPH and the EAHU. This is consistent with
                                         the methodological differences of the surveys, as the EPH and EAHU indicate when
                                         the household is within three blocks of an open dumpsite, where as the EDSA asks the
                                         respondent, more generally, if in the neighborhood where he/she lives open dumpsites
                                         are a problem.

                                         - The EDSA and EPH both indicate that the percentage of households near open dump-
                                         sites dramatically increases among households located in informal or precarious urban
                                         settlements.

                                         - The percentage of households located in informal settlements that are within three
                                         blocks of an open dumpsite is higher in the EAHU than in the EPH implying that in sma-

                              Municipal performance in solid waste and city cleaning services is relatively low. When
                              applying a set of systematic performance criteria covering institutional-legal, technical,
                              social, environmental, and economic-financial aspects to 73 municipalities in 3 pro-
                              vinces in Argentina, on average municipalities complied with 35 percent of the criteria.

                              The surveyed municipalities have better performance for the social and institutional-le-
                              gal aspects of solid waste management and city cleaning services.The lowest perfor-
                              mance was found for the economic-financial and environmental criteria.

                              Environmental problems with waste disposal sites are common.74 percent of the sur-
                              veyed municipalities experience burning in the disposal site; 82 percent of the analyzed
                              municipalities have domestic animals in the waste disposal site; 81 percent have waste
                              outside the disposal site; and only 4 percent practice vector control.

                              A large proportion of the surveyed municipalities have informal waste workers working
                              in the streets (41 percent of the municipalities) and at the waste disposal site (73 per-
                              cent).

                              Larger municipalities on average perform better than smaller municipalities in solid
                              waste and city cleaning services. This is particularly true for many of the institutio-

                              The National Urban Solid Waste Management Project (MAyDS) undertook a diagnostic
                              in three Argentine provinces. A database on performance in solid waste management
                              in these three provinces was developed in 2014 and includes information on the so-
                              lid waste management systems of 73 municipalities from these three Argentine pro-
                              vinces. The goal was to quantify the performance of each municipality including the
                              institutional-legal, technical, social, environmental, and economic-financial aspects of
                              their solid waste management system using a range of criteria. The data was gathered
                              through consultants that undertook field visits and is based on data provided by the
                              municipalities and visual inspection undertaken by the consultants whenever possible.
                              The municipalities included the capital city of the province and all the municipalities
                              with more than 10,000 inhabitants. At least 70 percent of the municipalities with less
                              than 10,000 inhabitants had to be visited.

monitoring system for soil, water and air, vector control, collection and leachate treat-
ment systems; and anabsence of animals at the disposal site.

- 74 percent of the municipalities experience burning in the disposal site; 82 percent
have domestic animals in the site; 81 percent have waste outside the disposal site; and
only 4 percent practice vector control.

- The social performance indicators demonstrate that a large proportion of municipa-
lities have informal waste workers in the streets (41 percent of the municipalities) or
at the disposal site (73 percent). The use of personal protection equipment among the
staff is low (38 percent) and only 45 percent of municipalities have public awareness
programs forsolid waste.

- Only 9 percent municipalities have specific tariffs or fees for solid waste management
and only 22 percent use different rates for large generators.

- The overall performance increases with the size of the municipality. Large municipa-
lities, on average, comply with 53 percent of the performance criteria; medium-sized
municipalities comply with 35 percent and small municipalities comply with 25 percent.

- For the institutional and financial-economic criteria in particular, the municipalities
with more than 50,000 inhabitants have much higher compliance with the criteria. For
example, 18 percent of all municipalities have an institutional department dealing with
complaints, while for large municipalities this number is 70 percent, and for medium
sized and small municipalities this number is 7 percent, and 11 percent respectively.

8. Employment in the solid waste management sector

  The solid waste management sector is an important source of both formal and informal
  employment providing an estimated 323,354 jobs in Argentina.

  There is, on average, 21.2 municipal employees dedicated to solid waste management
  per 10,000 inhabitants which is similar to the average for the Latin America and the
  Caribbean Region (21.7 percent).

  Smaller municipalities have proportionally larger quantities of municipal employees in
  solid waste management. There is an average of 105.7 employees per 10,000 inhabi-
  tants in municipalities of less than 15,000 people; an average of 34.0 for municipalities
  with populations between 15,000 and 50,000 inhabitants and an average of 22.6 for
  municipalities with populations between 50,000 and 300,000 inhabitants.

  The number of informal workers in solid waste is also significant. Overall it is estimated
  there are 117,698 informal workers in the solid waste sector in the country and based
  on data from more than 60 municipalities, there is an average of 15.7 informal workers
  per 10,000 people.

  Informal workers are more prevalent in the 31 main urban agglomerations. In the muni-
  cipalities of the 31 main urban agglomerations, 60 percent of the workers in the sector
  are informal and for the municipalities outside of these urban agglomerations only 25
  percent of the workers in the sector are informal.

  Regional Evaluation of Municipal Solid Waste Management in Latin Ame-
  rica and the Caribbean (EVAL)

  In 2010 the IADB carried out a regional evaluation of the solid waste management sector
  in the Latin America and the Caribbean Region based on the information provided by a re-
  presentative sample of municipalities. The data was further elaborated in a technical note
  in 2013 also published by the IADB. The assessment included an analysis of the number
  of formal employees in the sector. The figures in this section present information disa-
  ggregated by region and service and also provide, separately, the average numbers of
  municipal workers and workers contracted by the municipality. As the evaluation was
  undertaken in the whole Latin America and the Caribbean Region, EVAL allows compa-
  rison to averages for the Region.

                                       Data analysis

                                       - In Argentina, there is an average of 21.2 formal workers dedicated to solid waste ma-
                                       nagement per 10,000 inhabitants, a similar number as the average for the Latin America
                                       and the Caribbean Region (21.7).

                                       - Argentina has 14.2 formal workers per 10,000 inhabitants for sweeping, collection,
                                       and final disposal services which is a slightly higher number than the Latin America and
                                       the Caribbean regional average (12.2). Argentina uses a lower number of administrative
                                       and maintenance staff per 10,000 inhabitants (1.5) than the regional average (2.3).

                                       - For almost all services, except for waste transfer stations, the number of municipal
                                       employees is higher than the average for contractual personnel. Overall, of the 21.2 em-
                                       ployees per 10,000 inhabitants involved in solid waste management, 13.1 are municipal
                                       employees and 8.1 are contractual employees.

                                       - The results show there are regional differences within the country. The number of
                                       employees per 10,000 inhabitants is twice as high in Region II as the other two regions
                                       in the analysis. This is due to the high reported number of staff for maintenance in this
                                       region.




                                       National Urban Solid Waste Management Project (MAyDS) Database

                                       The National Urban Solid Waste Management Project (MAyDS) developed a tool to help
                                       municipalities estimate their solid waste management costs. Three-day workshops
                                       were carried out in different provinces between 2012 and 2014 to work with the muni-
                                       cipalities to collect the data from over 85 Argentine municipalities in 11 different pro-
                                       vinces including the number of formal employees working on solid waste management.
                                       The database not only estimates the number of employees, but also includes informa-
                                       tion on the time worked, as in small and medium municipalities it is a common practice
                                       to use this measure.

                                       - The larger the municipality, the lower number of formal employees working on solid
                                       waste management relative to the municipal inhabitants. This number is particularly
                                       high in municipalities with less than 15,000 inhabitants (105.7 employees per 10,000
                                       inhabitants).

                                       - The number of employees per 10,000 inhabitants increases significantly (up to 500
                                       formal workers per 10,000 inhabitants in some cases) and has more variability for mu-
                                       nicipalities with a population of less than 2,000 inhabitants while for municipalities
                                       with more than 3,000 inhabitants the number is smaller and more consistent, averaging
                                       approximately 100 formal workersper 10,000 inhabitants.

                                       - Figure 21 shows that most employees (76 percent) are working on sweeping or co-
                                       llection of solid waste while tasks such as planning and education only employ a very

                                            rica and the Caribbean (EVAL)

                                            In 2010 the IADB carried out a regional evaluation of the solid waste management sec-
                                            tor in the Latin America and the Caribbean Region based on the information provided
                                            by a representative sample of municipalities. The assessment included an analysis of
                                            the number of informal workers in the sector by place of work (for example, in segrega-
                                            tion plants; in the street; and in final disposal sites). The figures in this section present
                                            information disaggregated by region and service and also provide, separately, the ave-
                                            rage numbers of municipal workers and workers contracted by the municipality. As the
                                            evaluation was undertaken in the whole Latin America and the Caribbean Region, EVAL
                                            allows comparison to averages for the Region.

                                            - In 2010, there was an estimated 76,985 informal waste workers in the country.

                                            - The average number of informal waste workers per 10,000 inhabitants found by EVAL
                                            in 2010 for Argentina (20.5) is significantly higher than the average for the Latin Ameri-

                                            - The number of informal waste workers per 10,000 inhabitants working on the streets
                                            is more than five times higher in Argentina relative to the average of the Latin America
                                            and the Caribbean Region (14.7 in Argentina versus 2.7 average in Latin America and

                                       - There are significant differences in informal solid waste workers per 10,000 inhabi-
                                       tants between regions with the lowest number found in Region I (6.2) and the highest
                                       in Region III (28.3).

                                       - Regarding the places where informal waste workers recover material, the results show
                                       that most of them work in the streets.

                                       In 2006, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the United Nations Chil-
                                       dren’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) published a report on child labor in the recovery and
                                       recycling of solid waste. The report is based on an empirical work undertaken in the
                                       City of Buenos Aires, the Department (‘partido’) of Moreno (Province of Buenos Aires),
                                       and Posadas (Misiones Province) in the year 2004. The number of children and teenage
                                       workers that they obtained represent an estimated minimum, because they only consi-

                                prehensive manner, information has been compiled from a variety of sources. The num-
                                bers were generated by inventories of informal workers carried out during the execution
                                of the IADB and World Bank projects (MAyDS); those carried out by municipalities; mu-

                                and Update of the National Solid Waste Management Plan -MAyDS) also undertook
                                a compilation of information on the number of informal waste pickers and is used as
                                another source of information. It is important to highlight that compiling different sour-

                                collection; or definition of the type of informal activity or job. The majority of the data
                                sources are studies from 2010-2014, with a few dating back earlier (for example, 2001
                                and 2006).

For the municipalities with more than 15,000 inhabitants and less than 300,000 and no specific data on formal workers, the averages found with
the National Urban Solid Waste Management Project (MAyDS) database were used.Waste pickers are, in general, informal workers.
However, this category includes both informal workers and those have been formalized, for example hired by the municipality and/or are part of a cooperative.

                                          - On average, the number of informal workers in the solid waste sector per 10,000 inha-
                                          bitants is 23.2 for the 31 main urban agglomerations which is similar than that found
                                          by EVAL (2010).

                                          - There is significant variability among provinces, for example, Catamarca has a much
                                          lower number of informal workers in the solid waste sector per 10,000 inhabitants than
                                          Entre Ríos.

                                          - There is a proportionally higher amount of informal workers than formal workers in the
                                          31 main urban agglomerations, where 60 percent of the workers are informal. Outside of
                                          the 31 main urban agglomerations 25 percent of the workers are informal.

                                          - An estimated 323,354 people work in the solid waste sector, 117,698 of them being
                                          informal and 205,657 being formal.

                                       The surveyed municipalities spend, on average, USD 118.2 per ton on all solid waste
                                       services.

                                       The surveyed municipalities spend, on average, 13 percent of their budget on solid was-

                                       Collection and street sweeping account for, on average, 60 percent of the total costs of
                                       solid waste services in the surveyed municipalities.

                                       Matrix of costs

                                       The National Urban Solid Waste Management Project (MAyDS) developed an Excel tool
                                       for municipalities to calculate the costs of the different phases of solid waste mana-
                                       gement systems. Between 2012 and 2014 a series of three day long workshops in 14
                                       Argentine provinces was undertaken to provide training on the tool and collect informa-
                                       tion. At the end of the workshop, the municipal representatives were able to estimate
                                       their solid waste management costs.

                                       It should be noted that most municipalities do not know accurately how much they
                                       spend on solid waste management services and many municipal representatives were
                                       calculating their solid waste mangement costs for the first time. In addition, the costs
                                       presented do not control for the quality of service, so while they represent expenditures
                                       on solid waste collection, the costs do not represent the relative efficiency of different
                                       municipalities in delivering a waste collection service of a given quality.

Data analysis

- The surveyed municipalities spend significantly more budget on waste collection and
street sweeping services than on waste disposal service. 60 percent of the costs of
solid waste management can be attributed to waste collection and sweeping services.

- The surveyed municipalities with sanitary landfills have waste disposal service costs
that are nearly twice as high as the overall average.

- Table 21 shows that in the surveyed municipalities solid waste expenditures, on ave-
rage, account for 13 percent of total municipal spending.

- The surveyed municipalities are not able to fully recover their costs through tariffs.
Tariffs cover less than 30 percent of costs and the average tariff collection rates is less
than 50 percent.
