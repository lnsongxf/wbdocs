             In June, the European Council extended EU economic sanctions against Russia for another six months while Russia
              extended its food import ban against Western countries for a year.
             A fluid situation on global financial markets and yet again lower growth prospects led to oil prices losing ground
              in early July.
             Ruble depreciation pressure remained throughout June as demand for foreign currency increased while supply
              declined slightly due to lower oil prices.
             Russia’s first quarter GDP growth was revised from -1.9 to -2.2 percent−still slightly less than projected
              earlier−while May high frequency statistics show a deepening recession.
             On June 25, the government approved the main parameters for the 2016–2018 budgets, foreseeing persistent
              deficits and evaporating fiscal buffers despite significant expenditure cuts.
