The team expresses its appreciation to the Ghanaian authorities, including the
Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning, Bank of Ghana, the National Insurance
Commission, and the National Health Insurance Authority, as well as the
representatives of financial industry, civil society, and donor community for their
cooperation and collaboration during the preparation of the Review.
The Review was prepared as part of the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs’
(SECO) Global Trust Fund for Consumer Protection and Financial Literacy.




1 The Review is part of the World Bank Program on Consumer Protection and Financial Literacy, which seeks to
identify key measures in strengthening financial consumer protection to help build consumer trust in the financial
sector—and expand the confidence of households to wisely use financial services. The Reviews are conducted
against Good Practices and have been prepared by the World Bank in both middle as well as low-income
countries. For more details and country reports please refer to the following link:

Executive Summary
1.      The objective of the Diagnostic Review of Financial Consumer Protection
in Ghana is to assess the legal, regulatory, and institutional framework for
financial consumer protection (FCP) and develop prioritized and tailored
recommendations aimed at reforming and operationalizing the framework for
FCP. The assessment is based on the revised and enhanced World Bank Good
Practices for Financial Consumer Protection (forthcoming) and focuses on retail
products and services in four sectors: i) banks and nonbank financial institutions
(NBFIs); ii) payments; and iii) insurance. Further, the review covers five topics in
each of the above-mentioned sectors: i) legal, regulatory, and supervisory framework;
ii) disclosure and sales practices; iii) fair treatment and business conduct; iv) data
privacy; and v) dispute resolution mechanisms. The report is based on the review of
the legal and regulatory framework, as well as planned reforms (e.g. draft regulations)
that were presented to or discussed with the World Bank team. It also features
industry practices based on anecdotal evidence gathered through interviews with
financial services providers, financial regulators, and consumer and industry
associations.

2.      Financial consumer protection is becoming an increasingly important
topic in Ghana, and the authorities have already taken initial steps towards
addressing some of the existing challenges. In particular the authorities’ initiatives
include recent as well as planned reforms of relevant laws and regulations in the
banking, NBFI, and insurance sectors, as well as the establishment of a separate
market conduct unit within the Bank of Ghana (BoG). BoG is also taking steps to
improve prudential supervision, particularly in the microfinance sector, in order to
protect depositors and build confidence in financial sector. In line with their FCP
objectives, the authorities have requested this diagnostic review of FCP along with
implementation support. As a result, and in addition to this report, the World Bank
has mobilized trust fund resources for initial technical assistance aimed at supporting
the BoG in operationalizing its market conduct function, which would initiate support
with implementation of some of the recommendations in this specific area.

3. Strengthening and operationalizing a FCP framework in Ghana is critical for
promoting responsible financial inclusion, in particular given the advent of novel
products and innovative delivery channels. Financial inclusion in Ghana is still low
with only 40 percent of adults (age 15 and above) having an account at formal
financial institution. It is however likely expand gradually given the large number and
wide range of regulated financial services providers, some of which are also relying
on innovative products and delivery channels. For example, Ghana is experiencing
innovation in mobile financial services with payments, microcredit and insurance
products increasingly being made available through mobile phones and/or agents. In
some cases this development has blurred the lines between the financial and other
sectors such telecommunications. Whilst mobile financial services can help fulfill
important financial inclusion objectives, they can nonetheless add a further degree of
complexity and risk both to the payments system and the financial system in general.
As diverse formal financial services are expanded to previously excluded consumer
segments that may have limited or no prior experience, knowledge, or familiarity in
this area, it is critical to ensure that new products and services are rolled out in a
responsible way, with minimum consumer protection measures integrated and
supervised from the outset.

4. The existing legal and regulatory framework includes some provisions
addressing financial consumer protection issues, while work is underway on
further expansion of market conduct requirements. In the credit products segment
for example, these include provisions, albeit still limited, related to disclosure, over-
indebtedness, fraud, complaints handling, and data protection. Further initiatives are
underway which are expected to lead to more detailed regulations focusing on internal
dispute resolution requirements (at the financial institution level) and disclosure
requirements, including the calculation of effective interest rate (EIR).

5. The institutional mandates for FCP appropriately rest with financial sector
regulators (either explicitly or implicitly) but further capacity building is needed
to fully operationalize this function. The institutional mandate to regulate and
supervise financial consumer protection in the banking, NBFI, and payments sectors
rests with the BoG, while the National Insurance Commission (NIC) is responsible for
the insurance sector, except health insurance which is covered by the National Health
Insurance Authority (NHIA). However, the capacity of BoG and NIC to effectively
regulate and even more so to supervise market conduct rules is still limited and
emphasis is placed on handling of complaints. NHIA is only in the very early stages
of considering FCP issues.

6. There are three major cross-sectoral issues that if left unaddressed could
have a negative impact on implementation of the FCP agenda.
    First, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MoTI) is sponsoring a general
       Consumer Protection Bill, which also aims to cover financial services that
       would, as such, result in overlapping legal and institutional mandates for
       FCP. As currently proposed, the bill would overlap with current frameworks
       and mandates for regulation and supervision of the financial sector which is
       the responsibility of the respective financial sector regulators. This proposed
       coverage also conflicts with the Banking and Specialized Deposit-Taking
       Institutions (BSDTI) Bill which aims to expand the consumer protection
       mandate of the BoG.
    Second, the enforcement of the data privacy regime needs to be
       strengthened and the capacity of the authority in charge of this agenda
       needs to be enhanced. The Data Protection Act 2 has recently entered into
       force, and a Data Protection Commission (DPC) has been established but is
       still in the institution building mode. As a result of still limited ability of DPC
       to enforce its mandate and limited cooperation with the financial supervisors,
       many financial services providers are not registered with the DPC as per the
       requirements of the law and so as to guarantee the safekeeping of customer
       information.
    Third, clearer internal dispute resolution (IDR) requirements need to be
       introduced, while in the medium to long term BoG’s and NIC’s mandates
       with regard to external dispute resolution (EDR) need to be clarified. IDR

2
    Data Protection Act, Art. 46.
       practices of financial services providers are variable, ranging from mature to
       non-existent. BoG’s E-Money Guidelines include IDR requirements for
       payment service providers issuing e-money. Similar requirements need to be
       extended to all other payment service providers. Also, once adopted, the new
       draft regulation from the Bank of Ghana (Recourse Mechanisms for Financial
       Service Providers, September 2015) will greatly assist in this regard for banks
       and non-banks, and these should be implemented as soon as possible. Finally,
       further clarifications and expansion of IDR requirements in the insurance
       sector (including health insurance) is needed. In terms of EDR, both BoG and
       NIC handle complaints; however, there is lack of clarity regarding their
       mandates, and these activities are ad hoc and heavily reliant upon moral
       suasion. Most importantly, it is done in the absence of a comprehensive and
       enforceable regulatory and supervisory framework for FCP, which is a key
       enabler of an effective external dispute resolution system.

7. Although there is a separate market conduct unit (MCU) within the BoG,
market conduct supervision is not yet done, and the legal and regulatory
framework for credit and savings products includes only limited FCP provisions.
The most comprehensive legislation is the Borrowers and Lenders (B&L) Act but it
only covers credit services and products. BoG is sponsoring a new Bill covering all
deposit taking institutions (i.e. BSDTI) and has drafted two regulations on disclosure
and transparency of credit products and internal dispute resolution, to address some of
the current gaps. Additionally, the MCU is in a nascent stage and does not conduct
supervision nor does it take enforcement actions against providers that do not comply
with existing standards. The MCU is still a unit within the Financial Stability
Department (FSD) and is therefore at a lower hierarchical level compared to other
prudential supervisory functions which are separate departments within the BoG.

8. Given the lack of clear requirements, industry practices amongst financial
services providers vary extensively. In terms of disclosure and transparency there is
no standard practice and only some financial services provider present their clients
with a summary sheet or a clear re-payment schedule including the EIR. Additionally,
there is no standardization in terms of definition of fees and charges, and some
providers disclose nominal interest rates on annual basis while others present monthly
rates which impairs the consumer ability to compare the cost of financial services and
products. In regards to fair treatment principles, policies also vary from institution to
institution. For example, while it is common for credit unions to bundle insurance
coverage with loans other institutions do not seem to resort to such a practice. Debt
collection practices, despite the legal requirements, appear to be abusive. Training of
staff in financial consumer protection principles is not done in any of the institutions
met.

9. BoG’s overall payment oversight function is weak and relevant FCP
provisions are limited and often not applied in practice. While BoG has
established the National Payment System Office (NPSO), it does not enjoy the same
hierarchical level as other supervision departments. Additionally, there is little
coordination between departments, which results in FCP issues in payments not being
supervised. In fact, while the Payment Systems Act (PSA) has some rules on FCP and
the E-Money Guidelines have sections dedicated to FCP.
10. Payment service providers also lack consistent consumer protection policies
and practices and often do not fully adhere to regulatory requirements. While it
is not common to disclose fees and charges or to train staff and agents in FCP, a few
providers do have such requirements. Moreover, the few existing regulatory
requirements do not seem to be applied consistently, and while all e-money providers
have in place measures to protect customers’ funds, a lot of the rules included in the
FCP section of the e-Money Guidelines do not appear to be applied consistently by
payment service providers and are not enforced by BoG.

11. Consumer protection for insurance in Ghana is still developing and is not
sufficiently addressed in the insurance laws. Despite its capacity constraints, the
NIC has been proactive in addressing some FCP issues. In addition to resource
constraints, there are considerable legal and regulatory gaps. The NHIA is in the very
early stages of its supervisory and regulatory work, and possesses a much lower level
of understanding of consumer protection issues than NIC. A joint effort with NIC to
implement a common regime for FCP across all types of insurance products would
allow more confidence in the growing insurance sector in Ghana.

12. A summary of the key recommendations are listed in Table 1 below. These
recommendations should be given priority though some may take more time to
consider and implement than others. Hence, indicative timeframes (short, medium
and long term) and priority level (high, medium) were assigned to each
recommendation        along        with       institutional      responsibilities.

1    Introduction
1.      Financial consumer protection (FCP) has become internationally
prominent with increased policy, regulatory and supervisory attention to this
topic. As shown by the World Bank’s 2013 Global Survey on Financial Consumer
Protection3 a legal framework for financial consumer protection exists in 112 out of
the 114 countries surveyed. The most common approach is to have a specific financial
consumer protection regulatory framework (103 countries). The Global Survey also
showed that the number of regulatory agencies with formal responsibility for financial
consumer protection increased from 74 in 2010 to 97 in 2013. Additionally, the
overall trend shows that both developed and developing economies are moving
towards having either a separate financial consumer protection regulator or a separate
independent financial consumer protection unit within the financial sector prudential
regulator.

2.       A strong legal, regulatory and supervisory framework for FCP is crucial
to protect financial consumers and prevent market abuses. FCP regulation should
at a minimum ensure that consumers: (i) receive information to allow them to make
informed decisions, (ii) are not subject to unfair or deceptive practices, and (iii) have
access to recourse mechanisms to resolve disputes. This protection should extend to
all retail financial services and products irrespective of the type of provider of those
services and products. All laws and subordinate legislation relating to consumer
protection in the financial sector should be considered in this context, with a view to
forming a clear and complete framework, free of major gaps and overlaps.

3.       While a sound FCP framework is critical for market development, it must
be complemented with strong prudential regulation and supervision. Prudential
regulation and supervision are intended to ensure that the financial system and
individual financial institutions remain sound and stable. Poorly managed institutions
- as recently demonstrated in Ghana with failure of a number of microfinance
institutions and subsequent loss of deposits - can cause major distress and losses to
consumers, particularly small depositors. It is therefore paramount that the financial
authorities develop and use adequate tools to deal with problem institutions to
minimize loss of consumer savings and deterioration of public trust in the financial
sector or a specific sub-sector. FCP and financial stability are therefore mutually
reinforcing.

4.      The need for an effective legal and regulatory framework for FCP is even
more urgent in markets such as Ghana, where inclusion of lower-income people
with low levels of financial capability is rapidly expanding, mainly through the
use of mobile money. The financial sector in Ghana is gradually becoming more
inclusive given a wide range of regulated providers and the expansion of products and
delivery channels. Although several banks are utilizing innovative channels, banking
sector is slower in expanding to new client segments as compared to mobile money
providers which also target low-income individuals. Overall, the Ghanaian financial

sector offers a wide range of financial services and products, from basic payments
services to more complex products such as mobile life insurance and leasing. FCP is
important for financial inclusion, at it helps build consumers’ trust in the financial
sector, which in turn can raise demand for, and usage of, financial services. While
new products and delivery channels can support financial inclusion, they may also
pose new risks to consumers if not handled properly. A well-crafted and
comprehensive FCP framework should therefore give regulators and supervisors
flexibility to adapt to new consumer and supervisory challenges.

5.      Given the above illustrated context it is critical to build a strong legal,
regulatory, institutional, and supervisory regime for FCP in Ghana. The
authorities need to ensure consumer protection with respect to retail products and
services, where consumers are usually subject to standard agreements, terms and
conditions, and have little room to protect their rights even if they have the necessary
knowledge, information and confidence to do so. Effective FCP in the fast expanding
mobile money sector and other areas of retail financial services require good
regulations informed with international good practices, and adequate implementation
through supervision and enforcement, which in turn requires clear mandates and
capacity. The FCP framework should also extend beyond on credit services as it is
currently the case in Ghana. It also needs to cover a range of topics, including
disclosure and sales practices, fair treatment and business conduct, recourse and data
protection.
Box 1: Brief Overview of the Ghanaian Financial Sector and Financial Inclusion in
Ghana
 The financial sector in Ghana is diverse and has grown rapidly over the past five
 years though credit to private sector still remains low. The sector is dominated by
 commercial banks, accounting for 75 percent of the total assets of the financial system
 followed by pension funds with 12 percent and the insurance sector with only 4 percent.
 Although the size of insurance sector is relatively low, as of 2014 around 30 percent of
 population had some sort of insurance which is relatively high coverage compared to other
 countries. The financial sector is comprised of 28 banks, 62 non-bank financial institutions
 (including finance houses, remittance houses, savings and loans, leasing, finance and
 leasing, mortgage finance), 133 rural and community banks, 444 credit unions, 540
 microfinance companies, 18 financial non-government organization, and 473 susu
 collectors. There are also money lenders but recent data on their numbers was not
 available. Most of these various non-bank institutions are also classified as microfinance
 institutions (MFIs) as per the BoG Operating Rules and Guidelines for Microfinance
 Institutions (2011) (for more details on MFIs see Box 2). Other financial institutions
 include 103 pension funds, 23 life and 26 non-life insurance companies, and 3 reinsurance
 companies. Overall the financial sector assets accounted for 54 percent of GDP in 2014, up
 from 34 percent of GDP in 2010. Private sector credit to GDP remains low at about 19
 percent in 2014 compared to the Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) average of about 24 percent.
 Meanwhile, total deposits to GDP stands at about 27 percent in 2014 versus the 31 percent
 average for SSA. In addition, both credit and deposit indicators are more than 5 percentage
 points below expected values considering Ghana’s level of development and structural
 characteristics (FinStats 2016).

 Financial inclusion in Ghana is still low with only 40 percent of adults (age 15 and
 above) having an account at formal financial institution, remaining slightly above the
 SSA regional average of 34.2 percent. Mobile financial services in Ghana are at a nascent
 stage with only 13 percent of adults having a mobile money account (provided by 3 major
 mobile money providers) and the number of mobile phone-based financial transactions are




                                             18
    incipient though on the rise. The number of branches and ATMs of commercial banks
    reached 967 and 932 respectively in 2014. The low density of bank branches (at 6.1 per
    100,000 adults) is comparable to regional trends, but stands below the SSA regional
    average of 8.7 branches per 100,000 adults and only 8.2 ATMs per 100,000 adults. This
    poses a challenge for financial institutions to reach customers. Despite modest recent
    growth observed in the ATM network, the still limited distribution of ATMs may be
    contributing to an ongoing reliance on bank tellers as the main mode of deposits and
    withdrawals.

6.      To address current gaps, there have been a number of FCP initiatives in
Ghana; however, more needs to be done to complete and operationalize the FCP
framework. Some of these initiatives include: (i) adoption of the Borrowers and
Lenders (B&L) Act in 2008;4 (ii) the 2009 National Strategy for Financial Literacy
and Consumer Protection for the Microfinance Sector, launched by the Ministry of
Finance and Economic Planning (MoFEP); (iii) establishment of a Market Conduct
Unit (MCU) within the Financial Stability Department (FSD) of the Bank of Ghana in
2011; and (iv) expansion of the National Insurance Commission’s (NIC) regulatory
and supervisory work on market conduct issues. A pending reform of the Banking Act
via the Banking and Specialized Deposit-Taking Institutions (BSDTI) Bill aims to
reinforce BoG’s mandate for financial consumer protection by giving it an explicit
mandate in this area, and BoG has also drafted regulations on disclosure and internal
dispute resolution. Despite these initiatives, the current framework still needs major
improvements to clarify legal mandates of regulatory authorities and address gaps
related to important FCP issues that are not covered by the laws or regulations.

7.      This diagnostic review was conducted with a purpose to inform future
reform of the FCP framework in Ghana, and is based on the revised and
enhanced World Bank Good Practices for Financial Consumer Protection 5
(forthcoming). The content of this report is based on a review of the legal and
regulatory framework, as well as in anecdotal evidence of current FCP issues and
practices gathered through interviews with financial services providers, regulators,
specialists, and through a review of available documents on this topic. The assessment
focuses on retail products and services in four sectors: i) banks and NBFIs; given the
large number of diverse institutions in the non-bank sector the references to NBFI
sector in this report are primarily based on information gathered from rural and
community banks, microfinance companies, savings and loans, credit unions, and
leasing companies; ii) payments; and iii) insurance. Further, it covers five topics in
each of the above-mentioned sectors, namely: i) legal, regulatory, and supervisory
framework; ii) disclosure and sales practices; iii) fair treatment and business conduct;
iv) data privacy; and v) dispute resolution mechanisms. While some sector-specific
sections addressed issues related to data privacy, this topic was primarily addressed as
cross-sectoral issue, discussed in section 2 below. Each of the sections contains
recommendations for reform measures in Ghana, with indication of their priority.
Significant emphasis has been put on building supervisory capacity for FCP, given its



4Borrowers and Lenders Act 2008.

importance for effective implementation of the few existing regulations and additional
regulatory reforms proposed in this report.

2       Cross-Sectoral Financial Consumer Protection Issues

2.1 Legal, Regulatory, and Supervisory Framework
8.      Good practice calls for either a standalone legal framework for financial
consumer protection or FCP provisions in the relevant financial sector laws. This
approach allows for greater flexibility to address issues that are typical of the financial
sector, as compared to having only a general consumer protection law that covers all
financial and non-financial sectors. This further allows for complementarity with
other regulatory frameworks such as prudential regulation, which are typical to the
financial sector. This approach may also facilitate more effective institutional
arrangements for enforcing FCP either by creating a dedicated FCP authority or
expanding mandates of existing financial regulators that focus on prudential
regulation to also include market conduct regulation and supervision.

9.      Institutional arrangements should facilitate the enforcement of FCP laws
and regulations across all regulated financial institutions in a consistent,
thorough and timely manner. Although some countries have assigned FCP to a
general consumer protection agency, this is not a recommended practice given that
specific technical capacity and expertise is required to effectively regulate and
supervise complex and dynamic financial sector issues. In this regard, a general
consumer protection body that is responsible for all types of services and products
across all sectors may very well lack this capacity, as well as the necessary resources
and focus for continuous monitoring of compliance in financial sector, which could be
detrimental for consumers of financial services. This approach may also lead to lack
of coordination with prudential regulators’ positioning and actions, which is necessary
to protect the stability of the financial sector.

10.     Most importantly there should be no overlaps in institutional mandates
for FCP. Regardless of the institutional arrangement for FCP, it is crucial that an
authority that has been vested with this role has an explicit legal mandate for FCP and
that there are no legal or functional overlaps with any other institution.

    2.1.1 Key findings
11.    While the responsibility for FCP in Ghana appropriately rests with
financial sector regulators (either explicitly or implicitly), the Ministry of Trade
and Industry (MoTI) is sponsoring the drafting of a general Consumer
Protection Bill which aims to cover financial sector, and this approach would
certainly result in overlapping legal and institutional mandates. MoTI, in
accordance with its Consumer Protection Policy,6 is preparing a Consumer Protection
Bill aimed at ensuring consumer protection in all economic sectors. Although the
draft was not available for analysis, the information gathered is based on a joint
discussion with MoTI and the consultant leading the drafting of the bill. The bill

covers consumer protection in the financial sector, including provision for the
establishment of an external dispute resolution mechanism and establishment of a
Consumer Protection Agency (CPA) as the main regulatory and supervisory body.
While the initiative to institutionalize consumer protection in Ghana is welcome,
insufficient consideration has been given to the capacity of a general consumer
protection body to oversee the financial services sector and the overlapping mandates
and regulatory contradictions with those of financial sector regulators. In particular,
this includes overlaps with respect to BoG, whose FCP mandate is becoming explicit
through the reform of the Banking Act (see Section 34) and the NIC (see Section 5),
but also to other financial sector regulators whose activities were beyond the scope of
this report.

 2.1.2 Recommendations
12.     It is recommended that any reference to financial products and services
are excluded from the draft Consumer Protection Bill and that the supervisory
and regulatory powers in relation to consumer protection in financial sector
remain exclusively with existing financial supervisory authorities. Considering the
fact that both BoG and NIC already have the mandate to regulate and supervise
consumer protection in financial sector, it is recommended that this arrangement is
reinforced (e.g. as already planned with amendments to Banking Act via BSTDI bill)
rather than weakened with provisions as planned under the proposed draft Consumer
Protection Bill. It is critical to avoid any legal and institutional conflicts and to ensure
close coordination between the financial consumer protection and stability mandates
of both BoG and NIC. Further, multiple institutions and avenues for redress in the
same subsector could result in public confusion and overall efficiency dispute
resolution mechanism. Finally, the financial sector regulators are specialized in
financial sector issues and have the proper technical expertise for market conduct
regulation, supervision, and dispute resolution.

2.2 Data Privacy and Protection in the Financial Sector
13.     Financial institutions, including credit bureaus, are major data collectors
and data controllers. Financial institutions collect several types of consumer
information, including personal information, contact details, consumer agreements,
transaction logs, passwords, and so forth. It is therefore absolutely critical that such
information is kept safe, unaltered and confidential, and used only for the purposes
disclosed to the consumer at the time the information was provided by the consumer,
or otherwise agreed with the consumer. Financial institutions should therefore be
required to have policies and procedures in place to protect the consumers’ privacy
and data and their Board should be held accountable for the effective implementation
of such policies.

 2.2.1 Key findings
14.  The legal, regulatory, and institutional framework for data protection in
Ghana has recently been changed to align with international best practices. In




                                             21
2012 the Data Protection Act7 was passed to improve the legal framework and allow
for measures to guarantee the protection of consumer data. The Act created the Data
Protection Commission (DPC), responsible for regulating the storing and processing
of personal information and the process for obtaining, disclosing, and sharing of
personal data with third parties. The DPC has subsequently been established and is
preparing regulations establishing requirements on processes and procedures that data
controllers need to have in place to guarantee the safekeeping of customers’
information.

15.     Adoption of the Data Protection Act and the establishment of DPC are
welcome developments, but the provisions of the Act have yet to be
operationalized and implemented. The DPC is currently working on completing the
registration of all relevant entities (i.e. public and private institutions handling
personal data) so as to ensure that they have processes and procedures in place to
guarantee that personal data is protected. At present the DPC has limited capacity to
enforce the registration requirement that is a prerequisite for supervision of data
controllers. For instance, many financial institutions have not yet registered with the
DPC, but the DPC has not been able to take any action to enforce the law.

16.     The use of alternative data in the financial sector, albeit still incipient, is
not adequately addressed in the current legal framework. While the use of big
data and other alternative data (either personal data or other) is only emerging, it may
likely grow in the coming years. For instance, there is at least one provider of data
analytics for the purposes of analyzing a potential borrower’s creditworthiness. The
current legal framework does not specifically address this type of innovation and
there might be a need for additional future regulation.

    2.2.2 Recommendations
17.     The BoG, NIC, and the National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA),
should coordinate closely with DPC to enforce registration with the DPC of all
financial services providers, including credit bureaus and insurance
intermediaries, in line with the Data Protection Act. In this regard it is suggested
that BoG, NIC, and NHIA follow up with any unregistered institution under their
regulatory remit to facilitate compliance with the Data Protection Act. Subsequently,
as DPC builds its capacity, further coordination may be required to ensure that data
controller requirements are implemented in practice. In this regard, it may be
worthwhile considering a Memorandum of Understanding between DPC and the
BoG/NIC/NHIA to formalize this collaboration.

18.     DPC, in coordination with the financial sector regulators, should evaluate
whether there is need for additional regulations and measures with regard to the
use of alternative information, such as big data. The use of such alternative data
can raise several issues in privacy and this topic should be carefully analyzed by DPC,
in coordination with the financial sector regulators, with the aim to protecting
consumer while not stifling innovations that could benefit financial inclusion.

2.3 Dispute Resolution in the Financial Sector
19.     Effective consumer redress through internal dispute resolution (IDR) and
external dispute resolution (EDR) mechanisms is an essential element of an
effective FCP framework. Complaint data obtained through EDR mechanisms, and
through mandatory reporting of IDR data by financial service providers, contribute to
effective supervision and market conduct monitoring. Once IDR systems mature
under appropriate regulatory guidance and oversight, and with the positive tension
provided by EDR schemes, most financial consumer complaints will likely be
successfully resolved through internal complaint handling processes of financial
service providers. Effective engagement of financial service providers with
complainants is also key to ensuring that complaints that remain unresolved
subsequent to IDR processes are escalated to an appropriate EDR scheme. EDR
schemes may drive improvements in market conduct and serve to reinforce effective
IDR. It is therefore important to address both IDR and EDR together as interrelated
elements of an effective end-to-end dispute resolution mechanism for complaints
within the regulatory framework for FCP.

20.    Given that most complaints will be for relatively small amounts, the
courts are not a viable and accessible option for the vast majority of financial
consumer complaints in Ghana. The cost of legal representation and the time and
technical complexity of the court process makes the courts inaccessible or ineffective
for most financial consumer complaints. An accessible option to legal action to
resolve low-value financial sector complaints is therefore an important component of
the FCP framework in Ghana.

    2.3.1 Key findings
(For internal dispute resolution see sector-specific sections.)

21.     Currently the BoG, the NIC, and the NHIA have external dispute
resolution (EDR) mandates but they lack clarity and specificity. Within the BoG,
the complaint handling team is comprised of staff of the MCU which does not have
sufficient capacity due to limited resources and technical skill. Also, as there is no
staff dedicated solely to EDR function, it is currently being performed by staff that
may be otherwise tasked with market conduct supervision. While the B&L Act gives
the power to BoG to solve disputes between borrowers and lenders, this is limited to
credit products and its overall mandate lacks clarity.8 Within the NIC, complaints are
received by the Commissioner of Insurance and passed to the NIC’s legal team for
resolution. For the legal team, such referrals of unresolved complaints are additional
to their normal role. Article 106 of the Health Insurance Act, calls for the
establishment of an Adjudication Committee with powers to deal with complaints that
are not resolved by Private Health Insurance Schemes (PHIS). The Adjudication
Committee has yet to be established and is to consist of a chairperson who is a judge,
and representatives from each of a number of groups such as the Medical and Dental
Council, and the NHIA. The Committee may hear and determine complaints made by
a member of the scheme, or a healthcare provider, or referred to it by the NHIA Board


8   Borrowers and Lenders Act, Art. 6.




                                           23
which is also responsible of ensuring that members of the healthcare schemes and
healthcare providers are informed about the Committee and its functions. In all cases,
the details of the EDR schemes and the key operational elements are not sufficiently
set out and aligned with international good practice.

22.     At present neither BoG nor NIC EDR mechanisms have the ability to
compel financial service providers to pay compensation to consumers where
warranted. In practice, however, NIC and BoG staff report being able to resolve
complaints with financial service providers through mediation, the use of moral
suasion, and the threat of taking unresolved complaints into account when making
unrelated decisions such as sanctions or withholding regulatory approvals. This use of
unrelated decisions as leverage to resolve complaints, while potentially effective in
certain cases in the absence of binding authority, could potentially leave the regulator
vulnerable to judicial review and is unlikely to be equally effective with all financial
service providers of various sizes and types.

23.     BoG and NIC prudential mandates could also come into conflict with an
EDR mandate in cases of redress for large-scale systemic problems that arise
through individual or multiple financial consumer complaints. Managing this
potential conflict is particularly important when the EDR function is located within a
regulator and especially when located within an existing department that already has
regulatory (as in the case of the MCU at BoG) or cross-functional responsibilities (as
in the case of the NIC where the legal team handles complaints).

24.     Further, BoG and NIC concern for the reputation of the industry limits
the public disclosure of complaint issues already evident in the Ghanaian
marketplace. This lack of transparency on financial consumer complaints limits
public awareness of the ability to seek redress and of the main problems faced by
financial consumers. It also reduces political pressure to change existing market
conduct that is already giving rise to complaints. Finally, it reduces financial service
providers’ and industry’s overall perceived risk of public reputation exposure from
the perpetuation or introduction of products and services and market practices that
could give rise to consumer complaints. Lack of transparency also limits the ability of
consumer groups and other interested stakeholders to utilize complaint-related
information for the purpose of public education and advocacy.

25.    BoG and NIC lack the resources to effectively handle the intake,
mediation, investigation, analysis, and stakeholder outreach functions typical of
an effective EDR scheme as well as the attendant administrative load . The current
funding model is to handle complaints out of the regulatory staff funded out of
Ghana’s public revenue base. This function is subject to possible wide swings in year-
over-year volumes (>200% annual increases in complaint volumes were common in
many jurisdictions during the aftermath of the 2008-2009 financial crisis).

26.     Both regulators lack the systems capability to effectively handle the
recording, work flow management, and reporting requirements of an EDR
scheme. Current case file handling by both the BoG and NIC was reported by staff as
manual and paper-based. This makes the conduct of analysis and reporting more
difficult, less effective, and less efficient given the limited resources available to the
teams responsible for this process.




                                            24
27.     Most financial services providers are not making their customers aware
of the ability to raise a complaint with the provider and the options available to
do so. Without an effective requirement for providers to communicate the existence
of an IDR process, consumers are left to abandon their complaint, settle it for an
unfairly low amount of compensation, or progress it through various informal means
with the financial services provider in the hope of obtaining fair redress.

28.     There is therefore also a lack of a “sealed system” to ensure that all
financial consumers with complaints are made aware of their option to seek
redress through available IDR and EDR pathways. In the absence of a clear
regulatory requirement (with the exception of life insurance) to inform consumers of
the ability and how to make a complaint to the financial services provider, many
potential complaints will not be appropriately handled. Furthermore, in the absence of
a clear regulatory requirement to inform consumers of the ability and how to escalate
an unresolved complaint to available EDR may lead to consumers abandoning
complaints that are not successfully resolved through the IDR without the benefit of
an appeal to the regulator.

29.    Current IDR activities and proposed initiatives, if any, vary across the
financial sector and are therefore addressed under the banking/NBFI, payments,
and insurance sections of this report.

    2.3.2 Recommendations
30.     In the medium term, once their complaint handling mandates are
clarified and their supervisory capacity is enhanced, the BoG and NIC should
each establish complaints handling units and develop and implement consistent
EDR (mandatory, binding and enforceable) schemes to resolve financial
consumer complaints in the banking, NBFI, payments, and insurance sectors.
NHIA should operationalize its Adjudication Committee in harmony with
existing approaches of BoG and NIC. The regulators should develop and implement
EDR schemes consistent with the Good Practices and informed by the collective
experience of the extensive network of dispute resolution practitioners around the
world. The International Network of Financial Services Ombudsman Schemes (INFO
Network)9 may be a good source of additional information on this topic.

31.    In the meantime, a limited number of staff, not to impair supervisory
needs, within the BoG and NIC should be specialized and dedicated to the EDR
function. Complaint handling is different operationally from most regulatory
functions and requires a different staff skillset and mindset. Training specific to the
function is important to establish consistency and credibility of the function with
consumers and industry.



9 The INFO Network has developed a seven-part guide to effective approaches to fundamental principles to which
INFO Network member schemes aspire, available at http://www.networkfso.org/assets/info-network_effective-
approaches-to-fundamental-principles_september2014.pdf. The INFO network comprises approximately 60
financial sector Ombudsman schemes and is active in developing good practices and effective approaches to
challenges faced by financial sector EDR schemes worldwide. The INFO Network meets annually to promote
professional development and networking across its members.




                                                      25
32.    Gradually, in the medium term, both the BoG and NIC should implement
scale-appropriate systems to facilitate workflow management and to improve
ease of analysis and reporting on complaints handled as well as analysis of
complaint reports provided by financial service providers. Even relatively simple
application of information technology can have a significant impact on the ability to
manage significant case file volumes and enable basic analysis and reporting.

33.     Both the BoG and NIC should embark on programs of capacity building
in the area of EDR international good practices as well as staff training and
development in the areas of inquiry and case file handling, investigation, and
mediation/adjudication. The nature of complaint handling will have staff interacting
extensively with the public and other stakeholders. The demonstrated capacity and
skills will be critical to maintaining the reputation of the regulator and the complaint
handling unit. Hence, once the capacity building efforts on the supervisory side are
completed and adequate regulations are in place, both BoG and NIC should undertake
capacity building programs to effectively perform their EDR functions.

34.    Both the BoG and NIC should establish internal information flow
pathways to ensure that market conduct intelligence acquired by the teams
carrying out the EDR function is shared with the relevant supervision and
enforcement teams. EDR schemes are often seen as early warning systems for
regulators, both for FCP and prudential purposes. Individual financial consumer
complaints can serve as valuable early warnings of systemic issues or can indicate
areas where market conduct regulation or guidance to financial service providers is
warranted.

35.     In the longer term, both the BoG and NIC to explore the possibility of
gradually securing some or all of the required financial resources from industry
for external dispute resolution schemes through some combination of levies
and/or case fees to either supplement or replace their own funding of the cost of
that function. The appropriate transition point for considering this approach is once
the IDR regulations have been made operational and once the respective EDR
functions are operationalized. Given the expressed desire of public bodies to support
the financial viability of the emerging financial sector, such an industry-supported
funding model may not be politically viable at this time. It should be considered,
however, for the future to incorporate some form of direct industry funding to avoid
the moral hazard of financial service providers (collectively and individually) not
having to internalize the cost of complaint handling at the EDR stage. Regulators
need to be vigilant to ensure that the providers’ referral behavior is not undermined by
the imposition of a case fee funding model or a levy whose amount is sensitive to
historical complaint volumes.

36.     In the long run, financial sector regulators could explore opportunities for
establishment of a unified dispute resolution mechanism for the entire financial
sector (e.g. such as specialized financial ombudsman). While there is a clear
consumer protection benefit from each of the regulators (BoG, NIC, NHIA) adopting
the immediate recommendations regarding IDR and EDR, the current fragmented
environment for introduction or refinement of IDR and EDR suggests a need to
consider a long-term plan to move toward a single, consistent approach to IDR and
EDR across the regulated sub-sectors of the Ghanaian financial services industry.
Short-term and intermediate decisions regarding the introduction or refinement of



                                           26
IDR and EDR within each sub-sector would ideally be made in a coordinated fashion
with a view to such a long-term sector-wide vision. The value of a unified approach is
consistency across the financial sector, lower overall cost, and development of a
concentrated capacity (resources and expertise) in complaint handling, complaint
intelligence gathering and analysis, and complaint process management.

Bank and Nonbank Deposit and Credit Products and Services

2.4 Legal, Regulatory and Supervisory Framework
 2.4.1 Key findings

2.4.1.1 Institutional, legal and regulatory framework

37.     BoG is the licensing, regulatory and supervisory body for banks and
nonbanks providing deposit and credit services, as well as credit information
systems, and it has a broad regulatory and supervisory mandate. The BoG has
jurisdiction over banks and a range of NBFIs. According to the BoG Act, 2002, the
objectives of BoG include promoting effective and efficient operation of banking and
credit systems in the country. Pursuant to this Act, BoG has to perform several
functions, including to regulate, supervise, and direct the banking and credit system;
ensure the smooth operation of the financial sector; and license, regulate and promote
and supervise NBFIs. The functions with regard to banks are expanded in the Banking
Act, 2004, which states that BoG shall have an overall supervisory and regulatory
authority in all matters relating to banking business and shall be responsible for
promoting and effective banking system; dealing with any unlawful or improper
practices of banks; and considering and proposing reforms relating to banking
business.10

38.     BoG’s FCP mandate could be inferred by the current laws, but it is not
explicit. According to the legal interpretation by the BoG of the Banking Act and the
NBFI Act, BoG has a clear and broad regulatory and supervisory mandate, and its
FCP powers cannot be questioned. In addition to the aforementioned broad mandate
and functions, the NBFI Act, 2008, empowers BoG to revoke a license if a NBFI
conducts business in a manner detrimental to the interests of depositors or customers,
and limit a license with the purpose of protecting depositors or potential depositors.11
Moreover, both the Banking Act and NBFI Act have provisions in the area of safety
of deposits, assurance of returns of savings, and confidentiality of client data (see
more details in the sections below). Finally, BoG is also the regulator and supervisor
of credit information systems and responsible for protecting the interests of credit
information subjects, according to the Credit Reporting Act, 2007.12




10 BoG also covers other institutions under the Banking Act 2004: savings and loans companies, finance houses,
and deposit-taking microfinance institutions. See, Banking Act 2002, Art. 4.
11 See Non-Bank Financial Institutions Act 2008, Art. 2 as well as Notice No. Bg/Gov/Sec/2011/04 Operating

Rules and Guidelines for Microfinance Institutions.
12 The Credit Reporting Act, 2007 covers credit bureaus, data providers, credit information recipients and their

agents.




                                                      27
39.    Pending reforms will ensure clarity of FCP only with regard to banks,
while the FCP mandate with respect to NBFI will continue to be non-specific. A
pending reform of the Banking Act, the BSDTI Bill, among other measures makes
BoG’s mandate for FCP explicit, by including it in the list BoG’s powers and
functions. No such reform is planned with respect to NBFIs but such measure would
be beneficial to ensure that BoG’s future regulatory and supervisory actions in
consumer protection of the NBFI sector are not questioned.
40.     NBFIs must be licensed and meet certain minimum requirements. In
January 2011, a team for the supervision of the microfinance sector was established
within the Banking Supervision Department (BSD) and has subsequently transformed
into the current NBFI Supervision Department (NSD). In July 2011 the BoG issued
operating rules and guidelines for microfinance operations which categorized
providers into Tiers (see Box 2), defined permissible activities, and stipulated
minimum paid-up capital and other licensing requirements that should align the
regulation of this sector to international good practices. Nevertheless, the MFI sector
– in particular deposit taking microfinance institutions – has been experiencing a
number of challenges in practice.

41.      The remaining legal gap was closed in late 2015, when credit unions were
brought under BoG’s remit. Credit unions were outside BoG’s legal jurisdiction
until late 2015. Although they have previously been covered by BoG under the NBFI
Act, they were later excluded through a BoG Notice issued in 2011 that left them to
be regulated by a specialized Legislative Instrument (LI). The LI has been finally
passed in late 2015, formally bringing credit unions under the BoG and envisaging
creation of the Credit Unions Supervisory Agency (CUSA), in whose Board BoG will
participate. This will allow BoG to deal with FCP issues in the credit union sector. In
practice, however, credit unions are currently still outside BoG’s regulatory and
supervisory scope, since the LI has not yet been implemented and CUSA has not yet
been created.
Box 2: Categorization of Microfinance Institutions
  Tier 1: Deposit-taking MFIs licensed and supervised by BoG: Rural and Community
Banks and Savings and Loans.
  Tier 2: Deposit-taking MFIs:
Microfinance Companies; supervised directly by BoG;
Credit Unions: currently self-regulated by Ghana Cooperative Credit Unions Association
and to be regulated separately under a new Legislative Instrument that envisages supervision
through an independent Board under BoG.
   Tier 3: Non-Deposit-taking MFIs: Incorporated Money Lenders and Financial non-
government organization. These are MFIs that do not mobilize deposits from the public
(though in practice take client funds as collateral for loans, or offering interest on
“investment” in the case of money lenders); in principle supervised by BoG; in practice,
associations are being asked to take the lead in monitoring and reporting on their subsectors.
   Tier 4: Others, specifically, individual Susu Collectors (who only take daily savings)
and Money Lenders (who only make loans). These are not allowed to intermediate funds and
are not supervised directly by BoG, but are expected to join and report to their respective
industry associations.

42.    The legislation which explicitly provides for FCP measures is the B&L
Act, but it only covers credit services. The B&L Act applies to all types of lenders


                                               28
and guarantors and includes a section dedicated to borrowers’ rights, disclosure and
fair treatment.13 Amongst other, the Act makes BoG responsible for: a) promoting and
supporting the development of a fair, transparent, competitive, and accessible credit
market; b) receiving complaints; c) monitoring credit markets to detect and prevent
prohibited conduct; d) promoting public awareness; and e) reporting to the Ministry14
the volume and cost of different types of credit products, market practices and their
implications for borrower choice and competition.15 Although this legislation is useful
to cover many aspects of consumer protection in credit services, it is not sufficient,
particularly as it does not cover other types of services, such as savings, and overall
business practices of banks and NBFIs.

43.     The current regulatory framework is insufficient to cover most FCP
issues in line with international good practices. There is virtually no regulatory
framework in place for financial consumer protection, except for two draft regulations
which are supposed to be issued in 2016 (they have been under preparation for a
couple of years). These are the Disclosure and Transparency Rules for Credit
Products and Services (Draft Transparency Regulation), to be issued under the B&L
Act, and the Recourse Mechanisms for Financial Service Providers (Draft Recourse
Regulation), to be issued under the Banking Act. The content of these draft
regulations are discussed in the following sections, under specific FCP topics. It is
important to note that although the Draft Recourse Regulation would be issued under
the Banking Act, it also covers NBFIs, based on BoG’s broad regulatory mandate
over NBFIs. After passing these two regulations and building its capacity and
structure to start enforcing them, BoG will need to issue a range of additional
regulations to cover issues such as disclosure, sales practices, fair treatment, and
business conduct in deposit services. It is likely that it will also need to issue specific
regulations with regard to data privacy and security, to deal with the incipient but
slowly growing use of electronic channels by banks and NBFIs (digital finance is
currently more pervasive in the payments sector, see section 3).

44.     Ghana Association of Microfinance Institutions Network (GHAMFIN)16
and the Ghana Association of Bankers (GAB)17 have developed voluntary codes
of conduct, but they do not have a formal self-regulation mandate or
enforcement powers. 18 While the Banking Code of Conduct covers all the key
principles of financial consumer protection, and even provide detailed guidance (e.g.,
on changes in terms and conditions), its application by banks seems to be uneven and
GAB has no enforcement mandate, even though it may receive consumer complaints


13 See Borrowers and Lenders Act 2008, Art. 1.
14 Presumably Ministry of Finance, though the law is not specific in this regard.
15 See Borrowers and Lenders Act, Art. 6.
16 GHAMFIN is the umbrella institution for the microfinance sector, with various sub-sector associations

represented on GHAMFIN’s Board. Its functions include advocacy for microfinance sector as its umbrella body,
data collection, monitoring and benchmarking; good practice dissemination; consumer education; studies,
compiling aggregate data on all subsectors; implementation and monitoring of national Code of Conduct, etc.
17 GAB is the National Organization of Banks in Ghana with functions including advocacy, research, analysis, and

dissemination of information relevant to banking sector, promoting good practice in the banking industry (i.e. via
Code of Conduct), as well as processing customer complaints.
18 The diagnostic team did not manage to meet the Ghana Association of Microfinance Companies (GHAMC),

which unites companies providing microfinance under Tier 2 category established by the BoG and offer deposit
and credit services.




                                                       29
with regards to violations of the Code. Similarly, the GHAMFIN Code, while less
detailed than the Banking Code of Conduct and focused on transparency, provides for
some key consumer protection standards. The other associations covering the NBFI
sector and the Association of Rural Banks (ARB) – which functions as mini “central
bank” of rural banks – do not have codes of conduct.

2.4.1.2 Supervisory framework

45.     BoG has established a dedicated market conduct unit; however, MCU
function is still nascent and requires further strengthening. The MCU is a cross-
sector unit, covering all banks and NBFIs regulated by BoG, and also intended to
cover payment service providers. In practice, however, its operations and the bulk of
staff time are primarily dedicated to complaints handling. While dispute resolution is
important element of financial consumer protection its effectiveness is largely
dependent on proper regulation and enforcement of market conduct rules. Currently,
the MCU’s regulatory activity is limited and FCP supervision is not done. In addition,
MCU is not actively involved in other related supervisory activities such as licensing
of new institutions or during inspections carried out by other departments.

46.      There is lack of clarity on the roles, powers and functions of different
BoG departments related to FCP supervision. Although the MCU was created (as
part of the FSD) through a deliberation of BoG’s Board,19 there is no formal mandate
that describes its powers (including enforcement powers), scope, functions and
activities. Likewise, there is no formal coordination and collaboration mechanism
between MCU, BSD and NSD, aiming at minimizing overlaps, sharing of key
information, and exploiting synergies. Some aspects of consumer protection
supervision, such as whether fees and charges are posted in branches of banks and
NBFIs, and some aspects of the B&L Act, may be and often are checked by the BSD
and the NSD during the course of their routine inspections, 20 but there is no
systematic treatment of the topic that results in a comprehensive assessment of
existing and forward-looking risks to consumers and their impact on the risk profile of
individual institutions.

47.     As only a unit within FSD, MCU is not fully independent or at the same
hierarchical level as BSD and NSD, which could limit its effectiveness in the
future. This status could limit its ability to secure resources, defend its supervisory
and enforcement actions (particularly in case of conflicting views across departments)
and fully develop an adequate regulatory and supervisory framework.

48.    There is no comprehensive and systematic collection and use of data for
consumer protection supervision and there is virtually no dissemination of
supervisory information to the wider public. Effective supervision must make use
of several data sources to inform institution-focused and cross-sector assessments and
analyses. Also, despite having a database of consumer complaints that are received by
MCU, BoG does not transform this information into analytical reports for ongoing

19 According to information provided by BoG. The diagnostic team did not have access to the minutes containing
the Board decision.
20 The Payments Unit (PU) within the Banking Department (BD) is not cited as it is yet not conducting supervision

of retail payment service providers, and therefore does not cover FCP issues.




                                                       30
supervisory and regulatory purposes, and its use by BSD and NSD is not consistent
due to the lack of supervisory policy guidance in the area.

49.      BoG has broad enforcement powers, which may cover FCP, but
additional improvements are needed. BoG can intervene in the affairs of a financial
institution if it contravenes the Acts mentioned previously, any related regulation,
Notices, or Circulars issued by BoG. It may impose remedial actions such as requiring
the implementation of orders or directives (enforceable undertaking), issue a cease
and desist order to stop an “unacceptable practice”, and impose fines. The current
legal and regulatory framework or the draft regulations do not include specific
enforcement measures that are typically adopted by FCP supervisors, such as
requesting withdrawal or modification of consumer contracts and marketing/sales
materials, withdrawal of products, reimburse of charges and fees to consumers, or the
power to apply fines due to misconduct related to, for instance, unfair treatment of
consumers, and ineffective handling of consumer complaints at the financial
institution level. The B&L Act does allow BoG to apply administrative sanctions in
case of contravention of the Act.21 However, it only covers credit and is not being
enforced to its full extent (e.g., with respect to fairness, transparency, and
competition).

50.     With the passing of the LI, credit unions will now be licensed by BoG and
supervised by CUSA (once it is set up). Under the new legal framework passed in
late 2015, credit unions must register with the Registrar of Cooperative Societies22
and licensed by BoG. 23 BoG is the supervisory authority, but CUSA – on whose
Board BoG will participate – will have the power and the mandate to issue
regulations, and conduct inspection and supervision “subject to the powers and
functions of BoG”.24 It seems that the LI is intended to create a framework in which
BoG could delegate some regulatory and supervisory functions to CUSA, but it is not
clear how this would work in practice. For instance, it is not clear what types of
regulations would be issued by BoG or by CUSA or what types of specific
supervisory activities and powers would actually be delegated to CUSA. This
confusion is reinforced by a provision stating that CUSA could delegate its ordinary
supervisory functions to the Ghana Coo-operative Credit Union Association (CUA).25
The LI does not specifically empower the BoG to issue and enforce consumer
protection rules for credit unions, although it is understood that it would be able to
cover this topic through regulations.

51.     Existing industry associations play a limited role in regulation and
supervision of FCP. The CUA conducts audits and limited inspections on credit
unions, but has so far not incorporated consumer protection aspects in its supervision
and it does not issue specific rules on FCP issues. Likewise, the ARB, and the Ghana
Co-operative Susu Collectors Association for example do not systematically look into


21 The Borrowers and Lenders Act, 2008, gives BoG power to apply fines, which would include: (i) instituting
proceedings in case of contravention of the Act; (ii) conducting investigation to ensure compliance with the Act;
and (iii) issuing and enforce compliance orders.

FCP issues when auditing their members (they do not conduct ongoing supervision,
only annual audits). This is the case even with respect to the B&L Act, which applies
to all types of lenders operating in Ghana and should be followed by the members of
these associations. The focus of the industry associations is financial audits, advocacy
and training. Moreover, none of them seem to have or be able to exercise enforcement
powers, such as powers to apply fines and require withdrawal of membership.

 2.4.2 Recommendations
52.     Design and gradually implement a strategy for FCP regulation and
supervision. BoG should give priority to issue the pending regulations and building
its supervisory capacity so that future regulatory reforms can be effectively enforced
by BoG’s MCU and other departments. In tandem with the issuing of the pending
draft regulations, which are a good start for the MCU’s initial supervisory work, BoG
should develop a pragmatic and clear strategy for FCP regulation and supervision that
makes the most of the upcoming regulations and the existing supervisory capacity
inside BoG. The points below address a gradual approach to supervision, while the
following item addresses the needed legal and regulatory reforms.
     a. The strategy should delineate the supervisory approach (e.g., risk-based
        and shift from the focus on handling complaints), the key consumer risks to be
        prioritized in the next few years, the expected outcomes of supervision, the
        tools (e.g., market monitoring, institution-based assessments, and thematic
        reviews) and techniques to be deployed, the categorization (and underlying
        criteria) of institutions. The strategy should also explain how BoG will
        develop specialized supervisory guidance, build staff expertise, and improve
        data collection and knowledge management.

     b. The strategy should clarify the mandates, powers and activities of
        different BoG departments/units with respect to consumer protection
        supervision. The creation of specialized and dedicated expertise in financial
        consumer protection, separate from prudential supervision and payment
        systems oversight, is aligned with international good practices and current
        trend. The formalization of such mandates and powers (including the listing of
        specific enforcement powers26) within the MCU, and with the complementary
        role to be played by the BSD, NSD, and NPSO will help build the credibility
        of BoG’s consumer protection supervision over time.

     c. The process of implementation of the strategy should not delay the
        oversight of FCP in the interim period. While the MCU gradually develops
        its capacity and internal structure, securing qualified human resources, it is
        recommended to ensure that that consumer protection issues are addressed in
        the meantime. This means taking advantage of existing expertise in BSD,
        NSD and NPSO, by focusing on a specific sector (e.g., NBFIs or banks), and
        conducting joint inspections. Gradually, MCU will be able to implement a


26A consumer protection supervisor must have power to adopt a wide range of civil/administrative enforcement
actions, such as private and public reprimands, sanctions (suspension or withdrawal of products, model contracts,
or advertising materials, fines, suspension of a regulated activity, suspension or dismissal of management, etc.);
power to require compensation or refunds to consumers, and powers to refer a case to the public prosecutor.




                                                       32
       comprehensive, specialized and independent supervisory approach as
       envisioned in the strategy.

   d. Likewise, MCU could start improving dissemination of some key
      information about FCP in the supervised markets, and gradually broaden
      the scope of dissemination in line with international good practices. Some of
      the examples of key information include statistics about consumer complaints,
      and BoG’s powers and supervisory approach with respect to FCP. Other
      information could include reports with results of sector-wide reviews of FCP
      issues. As its credibility is built internally and externally, MCU should seek
      support to elevate its hierarchical status and become a department.

   e. BoG should issue regulations (or similar instruments) clarifying the new
      institutional arrangement for regulation and supervision of credit unions.
      Credit unions are major providers of financial services to low-income
      communities, so it is paramount that the institutional arrangement for
      regulation and supervision is clearly defined and effective.

53.     The strategy should foresee a pragmatic schedule for the design and
issuance of needed legal and regulatory reforms to align Ghana with
international good practices (specific content related needs in the draft and future
regulations are dealt with in the next sections):
   a) BoG should issue the pending draft regulations as soon as possible. The
      draft regulations create a basic – albeit incomplete – framework on the basis of
      which BoG can start its FCP supervisory approach. To signal to the market
      BoG’s commitment to FCP, these regulations need to be put in place as soon
      as possible.

   b) BoG should push for the passing of the BSDTI Bill, as it is a major step to
      strengthen BoG’s FCP mandate by making it explicit.
   c) BoG should initiate a reform of the NBFI Act, similar to the reform of the
      BSDTI Act, to make its FCP mandate explicit. This is to ensure that BoG
      has clear powers to regulate, supervise and enforce consumer protection rules
      in the NBFI sector.

   d) BoG should issue regulations to set comprehensive minimum standards
      for FCP in credit and non-credit products as well (at least deposit and
      payment services – see section 3). It is important to highlight that good
      practices require similar requirements for similar products, irrespective of the
      types of providers offering the services, which gives rooms to overarching
      regulations dealing with diverse types of institutions. The FCP issues that need
      to be dealt with through regulation are:
           Disclosure and sales practices:
            i.   format and manner of disclosure;
           ii.   advertising and sales materials;
          iii.   sales practices and conflicts of interests;
          iv.    product suitability;
           v.    disclosure of terms and conditions;




                                              33
              vi.     key facts statements;
             vii.     guarantors and third party mortgagers;
            viii.     requirements for statements; and
              ix.     notifications on changes in rates, terms and conditions.

                  Fair treatment and business conduct:
                i.    unfair terms and conditions;
               ii. unfair practices;
             iii. customer mobility and cooling-off periods;
              iv.     compliance and professional competence;
               v.     agents;
              vi.     compensation;
             vii.     fraud and misuse of customer assets;
            viii. debt collection.

                  Data privacy and protection:
                 i. confidentiality and security of customers’ information; and
                ii. sharing of customer information.

2.5 Disclosure and Sales Practices
 2.5.1 Key findings

2.5.1.1 Disclosure

54.      There is no overarching law or regulation for effective disclosure of credit
and deposit services. The B&L Act has a few requirements for credit products but
does not provide a comprehensive set of disclosure requirements, although it is
currently being revised to this end. 27 The B&L Act requires that information is
provided to potential borrowers in a durable medium, though not necessarily paper-
based, and key product features (e.g., principal amount, all costs, and interest rate)
need to be disclosed before the contract is signed. There are no format and manner
rules (e.g., font size, length and language of documents, oral disclosure, etc.). Good
practices require that minimum common requirements on format and manner are set
for all types of disclosures made by financial service providers, including in consumer
agreements, sales materials and advertisements, statements, and Key Fact Statements
(KFS). Outside the credit market, such as deposit services, there are no regulatory
requirements on disclosure and marketing and sales materials and practices.

55.     Application of the rules in the B&L Act is not consistent and disclosure
practices vary across different institutions. Although the B&L Act provides for a
pre-agreement form,28 it is unclear at which stage the KFS should be disclosed (e.g., if
it should be handed to consumers only right before the contract is signed or at the
inquiry stage). In practice, the Act does not seem to be implemented or enforced. In


27   The Borrowers and Lenders Bill was not shared with the diagnostic team.

fact, the lack of standardization of basic price information makes it quite difficult to
compare the cost of loans across different types of lenders. Specifically, some lenders
apply annual interest rates while others use monthly rates. Similarly, some lenders
require a security deposit or credit life insurance, while others do not have such
requirements. All these elements impact the total cost of the loan for consumers. The
use of KFS is not common but most providers use some type of pre-agreement price
disclosure or quotation that could potentially be used for price comparison. However,
as there are several types of additional fees and charges (including the credit life
insurance premium), which vary across providers, it is not always clear whether the
informed and advertised rates are all-inclusive or comparable.

56.     Draft regulation for credit markets has been prepared and its formal
adoption and enforcement would be a major step forward with respect to
disclosure. The Draft Transparency Regulation would impose a standard KFS (“Pre-
Agreement Truth in Lending Disclosure Statement”), 29 a standard Amortization
Schedule and a standard calculation of the EIR. It also establishes principles that
should be observed in all communications and documents of lenders to consumers,
such as clear, comprehensive and accurate information, disclosure of all costs and
clear and simple language. It requires disclosure of terms and conditions and
consumer rights to be done in a manner that suits a particular client, including when
the client is illiterate.

57.     Adoption of this regulation would also further develop rules for
marketing and advertising of loans. The B&L Act has general rules for marketing
and advertising materials, which are further developed in the Draft Transparency
Regulation. According to the B&L Act, providers must disclose, in marketing and
advertising materials, the nature of their business, their annual interest rate and other
costs of credit, and whether deposit or security is required.30 The Draft Transparency
Regulation reinforces this requirement, explicitly prohibiting misleading statements
and making providers legally liable for all statements made in advertising, marketing
and sales materials.

58.     It is common, particularly across the microfinance institutions, to require
a guarantor, but disclosures to guarantors and related verifications are not
always made. There are no regulations requiring disclosures and verifications to be
done to guarantors, such as confirming whether the guarantor is aware of the
consequences of guaranteeing a loan and whether he/she has financial capacity to
cover the debt in case the borrower defaults. Particularly in the microfinance sector
(e.g., credit unions and rural banks), where loans are offered within smaller
communities, a single guarantor may be guaranteeing several loans, and may have a
significant portion of their assets compromised. The Draft Transparency Regulation
addresses this issue.

59.  Currently there are no rules, either in regulations or laws, on the format
and manner of disclosure of contractual terms and conditions in consumer

29 The proposed Pre-Agreement Statement is to be valid for 5 days, to allow the potential borrower time to shop
around, and time to think about the operation. It combines disclosure of the effective interest rate, the total cost of
the loan, the amount to be paid per installment, and the total number of installments.

agreements and other materials. The current framework does not include an explicit
requirement for terms and conditions to be disclosed in a consumer agreement and
there is no specific requirement for providers to hand an agreement to consumers
(except in the Draft Transparency Regulation, with respect to credit). It is common for
banks and NBFIs not to give signed agreements to consumers, including for savings
and checking accounts. Also, not all consumer agreements for deposit accounts are
easy to understand, and not all inform the costs of transactions that can be performed
with the account. Additionally, not all providers make price information easily
available to consumers, such as through their websites or through conspicuous posting
in their branches. When contracts are handed to consumers, they do not necessarily
have price information. Disclosure practices seem to be slightly better in foreign-
owned banks than in domestic banks and NBFIs.

60.    There are no provisions on periodic statements and the general practice is
to provide consumers with only the bare minimum, once or twice per year, or
upon the consumer’s request for an extra charge. Not all providers of savings and
checking accounts, or loans, offer a periodic statement to consumers. The frequency
and content also varies, in cases where a statement is provided. The Draft
Transparency Regulation requires a monthly loan statement with minimum
information, at the borrower’s request, in paper or electronic form. However, if
providers do not clearly communicate to consumers that they can request a periodic
statement, this provision may have limited practical results.

2.5.1.2 Sales practices

61.    There are no regulations prohibiting mis-selling and aggressive sales.
Currently the regulations do not deal with these issues, but the Draft Transparency
Regulation does, albeit in a limited manner, by prohibiting lenders from exerting
undue pressure on consumers at any stage of the product cycle, including coercing
them into purchase of a particular product or service, or accepting particular terms
and conditions. There are reports of aggressive sales in Ghana, both for loans and
deposit products, particularly in the microfinance sector.

62.      The Draft Transparency Regulation introduces the concept of suitability
for credit products. Currently there is no requirement for providers to ensure
suitability of the products offered to their clients, although some financial institutions
claim to look at the suitability of the product they are offering. Some practices in the
microfinance sector may result in inadequate products, particularly loans, to
consumers who may end up looking for another loan in another institution to pay off
the first loan (e.g., standardized loan sizes and rates with automatic granting of larger
loans). According to the Draft Transparency Regulation, lenders will need to take into
consideration the suitability of the loan to the consumer’s needs and capacity.

2.5.2 Recommendations
63.    Specific disclosure (including on format and manner of all types of
disclosure and sales materials) and sales practices requirements should be
extended to products other than just loans, particularly for savings and checking
accounts. Such requirements can help create better-informed consumers who are able
to compare prices and make better decisions, which could encourage competition. The
Draft Transparency Regulation does not cover deposit services, despite the



                                            36
burgeoning market for savings that exists in Ghana. There are multiple types of
providers offering different savings instruments, from Susu collectors to banks, and
no consumer protection regulation or supervision is covering such services. The
requirements need to be issued in line with best international practices, for instance,
with regard to disclosure of terms and conditions, contractual clauses, dissemination
of transaction fees and other charges, periodic account statements (some items may be
standardized by regulation), etc. It is particularly important that depositors have easy,
affordable and frequent access to their account balances.

64.     BoG needs to accelerate the adoption of the Draft Transparency
Regulation and start monitoring its implementation. The Draft Transparency
Regulation is a highly welcome development and should be adopted as soon as
possible to ensure borrowers have a minimum level of protection. The regulation
introduces important requirements based on key principles, but the challenges in
enforcing its implementation should not be understated. As recommended in Section
2.4.2 above, BoG will need to create a specialized supervisory approach for consumer
issues, and train its staff accordingly. Certain key issues should be given priority
when implementing the upcoming regulation, namely:
       a. Ensure effective implementation of the pre-agreement statement (Key
          Fact Statement), including the timing when it is provided and how it is
          explained to consumers by sales or other staff or agents, as well as the
          placing of the statement on the front page of the signed consumer
          agreement.
       b. Ensure that the lenders have included all costs in the disclosed EIR
          and cost of loan.
       c. Ensure lenders provide a written (paper or electronic) loan contract to
          the borrower.
       d. Ensure the principle of suitability is implemented in practice through an
          adequate evaluation of the borrower’s needs and payment capacity,
          particularly when the new loan increases the borrower’s level of
          indebtedness.
       e. Ensure adequate periodic statements with all the necessary and clear,
          understandable disclosures are provided timely (and not only when
          consumers request them) and in a convenient manner and free of charge.

65.     As credit cards slowly become more commonly used, complementary
regulations need to be issued to require standards for disclosure. The credit card
market is very incipient, but expected to grow. Given the potential for abuse in this
market, shown by the experience in other countries, it will be crucial to issue
complementary requirements for credit card disclosure, sales materials, and credit
card statements, to require a few standardized disclosures in line with international
good practices so as to ensure growth of this market segment in a responsible way.

2.6 Fair Treatment and Business Conduct
2.6.1 Key findings
66.    There are no specific regulations dealing with unfair terms and
conditions, with a few exceptions for credit products. Currently, no regulation or



                                           37
self-regulation explicitly prohibits unfair terms and conditions or abusive contractual
clauses, except for some provisions in the B&L Act. The Act prohibits discrimination
in credit contracts,31 and guarantees the borrower’s right to repay at any time of the
contract life.32 Neither BoG nor industry associations look into consumer contracts to
identify unfair or abusive clauses in a systematic manner or as part of ongoing
supervision. The Draft Transparency Regulation prohibits providers to exclude or
restrict consumers’ rights through contractual clauses or other communication, and
also requires 20-day notice to the consumer before effecting a change in the terms and
conditions of the loan. These are welcome measures.

67.     The B&L Act sets out that recovery of the loan should be done in a fair
manner,33 but abusive loan collection practices are common in Ghana. The Act
requires the lender to respect the borrower’s privacy and peace when collecting loans.
However, abusive loan collection practices seem to be common, in particular within
the microfinance sector, and this may also be happening sporadically in the banking
sector, particularly when third party loan collection companies are deployed.

68.     There are no regulations dealing with customer mobility, except for a
provision on cooling-off period in the Draft Transparency Regulation. The draft
regulation states that the lender must give the borrower a period of 10 working days
immediately following the signing of the contract, during which time the borrower
can cancel the contract, by written notice to the lender and without any penalty, unless
the loan funds have already been accessed. The lender may charge a fee (it is not clear
what the maximum amount could be relative to the principal amount of the loan),
except if the lender has failed to comply with disclosure or other rules in the
regulation. There are no regulations to facilitate consumer mobility with respect to
savings and checking accounts.

69.     It is common for lenders to require credit life insurance, but usually the
borrower is not given a choice of insurer or type of policy or coverage. In practice
borrowers are not allowed any choice in most cases. Many times, particularly in the
microfinance sector, borrowers are not even aware that they are acquiring insurance
and what it would cover. Usually a written insurance policy is not handed to the
consumer in such cases. Also, providers usually do not check whether the consumer
already has an insurance policy that would cover debts in case of borrower’s death.
To partially remedy some of this deficiencies, the Draft Transparency Regulation
states that if additional products and services are sold in conjunction with, or included
within, a credit agreement, the lender must clearly and separately communicate their
individual costs to the consumer. It also requires that borrowers are given a choice of
provider.

70.     There are no standards for how providers deal with errors and fraud,
such as unauthorized access to deposit accounts. While unauthorized access to
deposit accounts, or erroneous charging of fees to accounts are common problems
affecting consumers in Ghana, there are no regulations or guidance by the supervisor


31 Borrowers and Lenders Act 2008, Art.14.

33 Borrowers and Lenders Act 2008, Art. 31-35.




                                                 38
on how providers should deal with such situations. The Draft Transparency
Regulation requires lenders to efficiently and fairly correct any error in any charge or
price levied to or quoted to a consumer, in which case a new credit agreement and
pre-agreement statement must be created. Currently this is not addressed in practice.

71.      Current regulation and supervision do not adequately address issues of
qualification and financial incentives and compensation of staff and agents. The
B&L and the Draft Transparency Regulation require lenders to minimize conflicts of
interest and to train their staff. In particular, the Draft Transparency Regulation
requires lenders to ensure professional competence and proper supervision of their
staff, including some staff that does not deal directly with consumers (e.g., those
preparing advertising materials). It also makes a specific link between inducements
and conflicts of interests. The NBFI Act imposes requirements and limits for the
appointment and training of management and staff, demanding segregation of duties
and internal controls to ensure compliance with regulations and internal policies.34
Industry practices vary significantly, from training and qualification measures being
barely existent to having internal policies in place (mainly for international firms)
guarantying that staff is appropriately trained and providing incentives to take into
consideration consumer protection related issues (i.e., compensation based not only
on sales volume but also on qualitative indicators).

72.      With respect to agents, there are provisions that guard the rights of
consumers, although outsourced sales are not adequately addressed. In general,
the regulatory framework (including the Draft Transparency Regulation) is not
sufficiently clear as to the application of requirements when third parties, such as
sales promoters, are used to sell products. There is a provision in the Draft
Transparency Regulation that prohibits lenders to restrict any liability or duty, so this
may be used for enforcement in the cases where agents are deployed. With respect to
transactions, account opening and loan applications at agent locations, the framework
is clearer. The Agent Guidelines35, which apply to all deposit taking institutions and
e-money issuers, establishes that the provider is legally liable for the acts of its agents,
a liability that remains even when third party agent network managers are used. It also
requires minimum agent due diligence, minimum contractual clauses for agency
agreements. The Guidelines allow agents to market credit, savings, investment and
insurance products, provided that consumer protection legislation and regulation are
strictly adhered to.36

 2.6.2 Recommendations
73.    Specific regulatory requirements should be introduced to curb unfair
practices and set minimum business conduct standards for all types of financial
services providers regulated by BoG, in addition to lenders. In the medium term,
BoG should work on issuing regulatory provisions to prohibit unfair, exploitative,
unbalanced or abusive terms and conditions, and to make such terms and conditions
void by default if used. Examples of abusive clauses and terms and conditions should

                                                        39
be included in the regulation. The criteria for establishing which clauses could be
deemed abusive and the procedures for BoG to determine how contractual clauses
would be analyzed and determined as abusive (or similar) should also be established.
The BoG should refrain from requiring prior approval of consumer contracts and
instead define a mechanism by which providers register their model consumer
contracts with the MCU, which in turn will have the prerogative to analyze (during
the course of its market conduct supervision), disseminate, and require changes to
such contracts, and sanction providers making use of abusive terms and conditions.37

74.     The BoG should begin assessing the current business practices in all
regulated markets and determine whether they are fair and adequate. Assessing
fairness of business practices and adequacy or suitability of products offered to
consumers is a challenging job for supervisors. For this reason, the MCU could
gradually incorporate this topic into its future supervisory process, starting with
analysis of observed market practices (e.g., cross-sector thematic reviews and
analyses of complaints data reported by financial institutions) and evolve into the
assessment of how providers put in practice the concept of treating customers fairly.
A well-structured supervisory strategy, as recommended in 2.4.2, will be key to this
end.

75.      In the longer run, as its consumer protection supervision evolves, BoG
supervisors should seek to have a broader understanding of corporate incentives
(e.g., financial and other) for staff and senior management that could result in
inadequate behavior or conflicts of interest, particularly for sales staff and
agents. This could be accompanied by regulations explicitly requiring banks and
NBFIs to implement a corporate culture of treating customers fairly, which would not
only cover practices and conduct, but also product management and compensation.

2.7 Privacy and Data Protection
 2.7.1 Key findings
76.     There are some provisions on data protection which apply specifically to
banks and NBFIs. For instance, lenders should not disclose information obtained
from a borrower unless the information is required under the Credit Reporting Act,
2007 or under any other law or by a court.38 Similarly, the Banking Act provides for
basic protection of the privacy of bank consumers’ information, prohibiting directors,
officers, or any other employee of a bank from disclosing information relating to the
affairs of a customer with that bank. 39 Exceptions to this clause include instances
where the disclosure of the information is required by law, by a court of competent
jurisdiction, or by the BoG or when disclosure is authorized by the customer or is in
the interests of that bank. A similar provision is present in the NBFI Act.




37 For instance, the Mexican financial consumer protection agency, Condusef, has established a system to receive
all consumer agreements utilized by financial service providers, and publicize in its website the clauses found to be
abusive, with indication of the respective provider and the sanction applied (if any).

77.     The Banking Act requires the secrecy of customer information. It provides
that a director, an officer or any other employee of a bank shall not disclose
information relating to the affairs of a customer with that bank except where the
disclosure of the information is required by law, or by a court of competent
jurisdiction, or the BoG, or is authorized by the customer, or is in the interests of that
bank40

78.     NBFIs have similar requirements to the one imposed to banks, as the
NBFI Act imposes a duty of confidentiality. According to this Act, a NBFI and its
staff shall ensure that transactions are conducted in strict confidence and that the
confidentiality of customers is maintained.41

 2.7.2 Recommendation
79.    BoG should cooperate with the DPC to ensure that at least the legal
provisions applicable to banks and NBFI are applied. For more details see
section 2.2.2.

2.8 Dispute Resolution Mechanisms
 2.8.1 Key findings
80.     While the B&L specifically states the BoG can receive complaints from
consumers about violation of the Act, no measures are included on IDR. This
results in IDR practices being highly variable and range from mature to non-
existent and the relevant regulatory requirements are either not present or
under development. The B&L Act specifically states that BoG can receive
complaints about alleged violations of the provisions of the Act42 but there are no
specific requirement for internal, institution level, redress mechanisms. Some
Ghanaian subsidiaries or branches of large international and regional providers report
having mature internal complaint handling mechanisms that are broadly consistent
with international good practices. These reflect the regulatory expectations in the
United Kingdom and the EU regarding complaints handling which apply to the group
head offices of some Ghanaian subsidiaries. Such good practices include a dedicated
unit responsible for complaints handling, clear internal complaint escalation
procedures, root cause analysis of complaints, adequate information systems, and
reporting of complaint statistics and themes to senior management and group head
office. Most other firms in the banking and NBFI sectors reported having rudimentary
or non-existent IDR. With regards to regulatory requirements, they are either under
development, as the BoG has yet to adopt the regulation on IDR, or are too high-level
and do not incorporate the elements of international good practice with respect to
standards for IDR operation and procedures.

81.   Moreover, even when an IDR scheme is present, most financial service
providers are not making their customers aware of the ability to raise a
complaint and how to do it. Without an effective requirement for financial service

providers to communicate the existence of an IDR process, consumers may not
present complaints, abandon their complaint, settle it for an unfairly low amount of
compensation, or progress it through informal means with the provider (e.g., through
an acquaintance who works for the provider) in the hope of obtaining fair redress.

82.     At the industry association level, the Code Compliance Committee
established by the GBA claims to play a self-regulatory function to protect the
banking sector from disrepute. The Committee would reportedly adjudicate a
complaint involving a breach of the voluntary Banking Code of Conduct. According
to the GBA, while the decisions are non-binding, redress where deemed warranted by
the Committee is incented through peer pressure as collective interest of banks would
be the maintenance of the industry’s reputation and perceived avoidance of regulatory
measures to control market conduct. The existence of such self-regulatory complaint
handling initiatives from industry associations can be helpful to securing consumer
redress but they should not substitute or delay the regulatory expectations for each
provider maintain an effective IDR. They should also not substitute an effective EDR
system in line with international practice (see 2.3 for more detail on EDR). Customers
should not be referred to these types of bodies by financial service providers (in this
case the Code of Compliance Committee) without being fully apprised of their ability
to escalate the complaint to the relevant EDR scheme (in this case, BoG).

83.     There is no need to discourage these types of industry association efforts
to establish and promote industry practice and/or provide dispute resolution in
conjunction with or on behalf of their member financial service providers.
Provided consumers are made aware of the ability to escalate any unresolved
complaints to the appropriate EDR scheme, voluntary dispute resolution bodies
established by industry associations can help attenuate the volume of complaints
facing the EDR scheme and can help financial service providers internalize good
complaint handling practice through voluntary engagement and peer pressure.

84.    The Bank of Ghana has drafted a comprehensive regulation covering
internal dispute resolution (IDR) entitled Recourse Mechanisms for Financial
Service Providers dated September 2015. The draft regulation applies to all
banking and non-banking institutions regulated by the Bank of Ghana.

85.     The draft regulation establishes clear expectations that financial service
providers will establish internal complaint handling procedures supported by
board of directors oversight, senior management accountability, and internal
staff training. The draft regulation is backed by Bank of Ghana authority to monitor
all internal dispute resolution mechanisms and sanction and fine financial service
providers for non-compliance. Financial service providers have specific reporting
obligations to the Bank of Ghana which will both facilitate regulatory oversight of
internal dispute resolution processes and help to identify potential mass complaint or
systemic issues.

86.     The draft regulation sets out the steps required of financial service
providers to ensure consumer awareness and accessibility of the internal
recourse mechanism. It also sets out the basic complaints mechanism expected of
financial service providers. Finally, it sets out the obligation to make consumers
aware of the ability to appeal decisions of the financial service provider to the Bank of
Ghana and how to do so. The draft regulation is largely consistent with international



                                           42
good practice and will establish an effective benchmark for bank and non-bank
internal complaint handling. It is therefore recommend the draft regulation be adopted
and implemented at the earliest opportunity.

87.    Given the value of providing banks and non-banks with clear guidance at
the earliest opportunity on internal complaint handling, none of the following
suggested enhancements to the draft regulation warrant delaying the
implementation of the current draft. For future enhancements to the regulation, the
following should be considered to provide greater clarity:

      Paragraph 3 – Interpretation: Clarify whether application of regulation to
       agents in an e-money situation should be broadened to include mortgage and
       loan brokers and others who receive referral fees from regulated financial
       service providers.

      Paragraph 8 – Provision of adequate information: Provide further guidance
       as to what constitutes adequate information on the recourse mechanism and
       greater clarity on when the information should be provided to the consumer. It
       is helpful to ensure that the first point of contact of a consumer raising an issue
       is able to provide the consumer with an easy-to-follow yet comprehensive
       guide to the complaint handling and resolution process of the financial service
       provider.

      Paragraph 15 – Third party agents: Similar comment to Section 3, clarify
       whether regulation applies to mortgage and loan brokers and others who
       receive referral fees from regulated financial service providers whether or not
       they fit the legal definition of “agents”.

      Paragraph 18 – Establishment of written procedures: Unclear whether,
       when insufficient policies and procedures are encountered, Bank of Ghana
       will modify the policies and procedures, or propose to the financial service
       provider modifications and improvements as needed. One is clearly intended
       to be mandatory while the other looks like a non-binding recommendation or
       suggestion. Clarification of this point would facilitate subsequent compliance
       reviews by the regulator.

      Paragraph 20 – Right to complaint at branch or the Bank of Ghana: If the
       consumer presents their complaint directly to the Bank of Ghana, it should be
       clarified if the complaint will be referred back to the financial service provider
       to enable a first-level handling per paragraph 17 or if the Bank of Ghana will
       proceed with a level 2 review itself despite the lack of a prior level one review
       by the financial service provider. If the process is to refer back to the financial
       service provider, this should be clarified to enable the Bank of Ghana to do so
       in the face of consumer desire to avoid the financial service provider and
       engage immediately with the Bank of Ghana.

      Paragraph 24 – Translation of verbal complaints: It should be clarified if
       the financial services providers will be required to reply to complaints in a
       manner and local language that the complainant can understand if not English-
       speaking.




                                           43
   Paragraph 26 – Confidentiality: It should be clarified who is required to
    maintain confidentiality, the financial service provider alone or both parties. If
    only the financial service provider, situations can arise where the consumer
    makes unsubstantiated allegations about the firm or the complaint handling
    process that cannot be responded to by the financial service provider because
    of the confidentiality restriction. It is preferable to have both parties respect
    the confidentiality of the complaint handling process and, if unsuccessful,
    allow the consumer to then pursue other means of redress such as the courts.

   Paragraph 28 – requirement for extended resolution period: It would be
    helpful to clarify in the last sentence that the financial service provider is
    permitted ten (10) additional working days to render decision or refer the
    complaint (sic) to Bank of Ghana.

   Paragraph 42 – Reporting information required: It would be helpful to set
    out in a separate paragraph following paragraph 42 the required information
    for the annual summary report to the Bank of Ghana referenced in paragraph
    45(5).

   Paragraph 44 – Board of Directors responsibilities: In order to
    appropriately distinguish between the role of the board of directors (in this
    paragraph) and that of senior management (referenced in paragraph 45), it
    would be helpful to specify that the board of directors shall be responsible for
    the oversight of the complaints handling and dispute resolution within their
    institutions.

   Paragraph 47 – Right not to accept complaint: In some jurisdictions this
    provision would be modified to accommodate situations where the consumer
    had no reasonable way of knowing that there was a basis for a complaint. For
    such situations, one possible option is to include a provision that the consumer
    is required to bring forward their complaint to the financial service provider
    within two years of when the consumer knew or ought to have known about
    the act or omission that gave rise to their complaint.

   Paragraph 48 – Decision of the court: It should be clarified whether
    requiring a consumer to withdraw their court action might result in a denial of
    subsequent legal right to reinitiate their court action should the first two levels
    of complaint handling set out in paragraph 17 prove unsuccessful. If this is a
    risk, an alternative is to require the consumer to suspend their court action if
    this is permitted under Ghanaian law.




                                        44
 2.8.2      Recommendations

88.     The BoG should finalize and issue the draft Recourse Mechanisms for
Financial Service Providers and at a subsequent stage begin oversight of IDR
schemes and enforcement of requirements. IDR processes and complaint handling
procedures, satisfactory handling of individual complaints, and analysis and reporting
of complaint-related statistics and themes should be reviewed as part of the
supervisory and enforcement functions of the MCU, or should be incorporated in the
inspections performed by the BSD and NSD (with MCU participation) while MCU
builds its own supervisory capacity.

3     Payments

3.1 Legal, Regulatory and Supervisory Framework

 3.1.1 Key findings

3.1.1.1 Legal and regulatory framework

89.     The BoG has the statutory responsibility to promote a sound financial
system through prudential supervision of financial institutions and the oversight
of payment systems. The statutory oversight responsibilities are stipulated in the
BoG Act 2002 which empowers the BoG to “promote, regulate and supervise
payment and settlement systems”. 43 The BoG’s mandate for payment systems
oversight is further strengthened in the Payment Systems Act (PSA), which authorizes
the BoG to establish, operate as well as designate payment systems for its supervision,
in the interest of the public.44

90.     The Bills of Exchange Act 1961, governs the operations of bills of
exchange45 including cheques, as defined in the Act. The Act is outdated, having
been passed in the 1960’s and requiring the physical movement of cheques from the
collecting bank to the paying bank as part of the clearing process. The requirement of
physical presentment is usually associated with manual processes, costly clearing
processes and long clearing cycles which ultimately delay the availability of
customers’ funds. In this regard the BoG has in collaboration with the banking
industry introduced electronic clearing and truncation of cheques in order to curb
these inefficiencies. The Act makes no reference to specific issues of consumer
protection.

91.    The NBFI Act provides for the regulation of NBFIs, including those
providing payment services. All NBFIs providing stipulated services, including
money transfer services are required to obtain a license from the BoG. The



43 Bank of Ghana Act 2002, Art. 4.
44 The Payment Systems Act, 2003, Art. 1.
45 The Bills of Exchange Act defines a bill of exchange as an unconditional order in writing, addressed by one

person to another, signed by the person giving it requiring the person to whom it is addressed to pay on demand, or
at a fixed or determinable future time, a certain sum in money to or to the order of a specified person, or to bearer.




                                                         45
qualification criteria, procedures for application, licensing, and revoking procedures
are all stipulated in the NBFI Act.46

92.     The Electronic Transactions Act gives legal certainty and confidence in
electronic transactions, which are important for consumer protection. The Act
provides solid foundations for the development of electronic products and services in
response to customer needs. The Act contains, inter alia, provisions for digital
signatures, admissibility of electronic evidence in courts and the retention of
electronic records for a minimum period of 6 years.

93.     The legal foundation for payments systems in Ghana is generally sound
with explicit provisions for the BoG’s involvement in payment systems and
statutory provisions addressing issues relating to consumer protection. Part II of
the PSA specifically deals with customer information and participants’ obligations
with respect to a transaction. This covers, among others, provisions relating to
transparency, information pre and post execution of the transaction, delays, rights and
obligations relating to availability of the funds transferred and refund in the event of
non-execution.

94.     Using the mandate drawn from the various statutes, the BoG has issued
rules, guidelines,47 directives, and other instruments to regulate the operations of
the various payment streams. While the overall regulatory framework lightly
touches upon FCP, the BoG Guidelines for E-money Issuers in Ghana (E-money
Guidelines) has a dedicated section on FCP. Section 26 of the E-money Guidelines,
for example, specifically deals with consumer protection issues, requiring all e-money
issuers to respect basic consumer principles such as fairness, transparency, disclosure,
complaints handling, among others. These requirements are also reinforced in the
Agent Guidelines that bind both financial institutions and e-money issuers.
However, these guidelines cover e-money issuers and do not apply to other types of
payment service providers. The Agent Guidelines keep providers responsible for
complying with consumer protection provisions set in other regulations.

95.     The BoG has delegated authority to run retail payments infrastructure
for both banks and NBFIs to its wholly owned subsidiary The Ghana Interbank
Payment and Settlement Systems (GhIPSS) Limited. GhIPPS administers the
Ghana Bankers Clearing House Rules which are designed to facilitate the speedy
processing of cheques, direct debits and credits and other payment instruments
cleared through the automated clearing house (ACH). All banks including the Bank
of Ghana are members of the ACH run by GhIPPS and hence are bound by these rules
in their own capacity or as agents of other entities that are not direct participants in
the ACH. The Rules mandate the establishment of a Bankers Clearing House
Association comprising of a representative from each member bank; this Association
acts as an advisory body to the GhIPPS. The Rules do not deal with issues of



46
 Non-Banking Financial Institution Act Art. 3, 4, 5 and 7.
47
 These include the Cheque Code line Clearing Guidelines, the ACH Direct Debits and Direct Credits Guidelines;
Ghana Bankers Clearing House Rules; GH Link Operational Guidelines; Guidelines for E-money Issuers; Agent
Guidelines.

consumer protection but focus more on operational and compliance issues for
participating institutions with appropriate sanctions for noncompliance.

96.     The Guidelines and Operational Procedures for Cheque Codeline
Clearing with Truncation (CCC) provide for the electronic clearance of cheques
supported by truncation and use of cheque images instead of physical cheques.
The Guidelines deal more with operational and procedural issues with no explicit
provisions for dispute resolution and consumer protection issues. The only aspect that
has a bearing on consumer protection is the section that mandates banks to post
debits/credits to their customers’ accounts on the value date. The direct debits and
credits are regulated by the ACH Guidelines and Procedures for Direct Credits and
Direct Debits as defined in Subsection 1.3 of these Guidelines. The latter while
defining responsibilities and rights of the participants and the scope of applicability
lack explicit provisions for consumer protection and dispute resolution mechanism.

97.    The national switch Gh-link also has its Operational Guidelines that act
as rules and procedures dealing with roles and responsibilities, interchange fees,
cash withdrawal fees, inter alia. The rules and processes to guide dealings with the
switch and between members as well as provide consistency for the integrity of the
system. Ultimately, the goal is to protect participants in the system against each other
and ensure adherence to agreed standard practices.

98.    The Guidelines for the operation of ATM and point of sale platforms do
not cover mobile network operators (MNOs) and other non-bank service
providers. In the absence of explicit pronouncement indicating that these would also
be binding on any service providers venturing into this space, a possible regulatory
gap exists and this could affect customers participating in schemes offered by non-
bank service providers using these devices.

99.     Not all payment services providers are required to be licensed or
authorized by the BoG. While e-money issuers need to be authorized by BoG and
the authorization can be withdrawn by BoG at any time,48 most retail payment service
providers are currently not regulated nor subject to oversight by the BoG. Hence,
payment service providers such as aggregators and payment platforms are not subject
to licensing or authorization requirements, despite holding valuable payments
information on customers which needs to be governed by specific data protection
provisions. They are also usually responsible for technical features in service
provision that may impact the reliability, safety and quality of services rendered to
consumers.

3.1.1.2 Supervisory framework

100. The PSA has no explicit provisions for the oversight of payment services
and providers in general. While the National Payment Systems Oversight
Framework (NPS Oversight Framework) stipulates the oversight scope of the BoG as
covering systemically important payment systems, securities settlement systems,

                                                         47
providers of critical services,49 the BoG is yet to fully carry out the oversight activities
in line with international good practices and principles. For this reason, there appears
to be no enforcement of some of the customer related provisions outlined in the E-
Money Guidelines and the PSA.

101. Additionally, the payments system oversight function is limited both in
terms of resources and technical expertise, and by the current organizational
structure within the BoG. The setting up of a National Payment System Office
(NPSO), which is housed in the Banking Department, is a positive development.
However, it needs to be complemented by the recognition of the payment systems
oversight function at the right level within the organizational structure, supported by
adequate staffing resources in both numbers and skills. In fact, at present the NPSO
does not enjoy an adequate level of independence nor the same hierarchical level of
other supervision departments, like BSD or NSD. There is also a risk of potential
conflicts of interests between the Banking Department’s dual role as an operator and
overseer of the NPS.

 3.1.2 Recommendations

102. In the short term, as a high priority, the BoG should review the legal and
regulatory framework governing payments, and strengthen the BoG’s mandate
for oversight of payment services and FCP. In the review of the legal and
regulatory framework BoG should be given a clear mandate for oversight of payment
systems, services, and instruments. This review process would help identify gaps and
inconsistencies that may need to be addressed, such as the fact that only certain
products and providers are currently regulated, including from a FCP perspective,
while others are not. This reform should also codify and expand the current rules on
FCP to go beyond transparency and address fair treatment, redress, and security of
systems and customers’ information, in accordance with the Data Protection Act.

103. In the short to medium term, BoG should also take into consideration
whether deposit insurance (once the Deposit Insurance bill is passed) should also
apply to e-money products. Although it is a new phenomenon, in some countries e-
money issuers are required to put in place mechanisms to protect customers’ funds, in
addition to the requirement to separate customer funds from the issuer’s own
operational accounts (e.g., through trust accounts). For example, the regime for pass
through deposit insurance in Nigeria establishes that the “pool” collected by e-money
issuers must be placed in one or more custodial accounts with an insured and
prudentially regulated depository institution (i.e. a bank) and protection is provided to
individual consumers indirectly through the custodial account provider which is a
member of the deposit insurance system.

104. In the medium term, the BoG should provide for standalone status of the
payment system oversight function and incorporate explicit provisions in the
PSA in order to strengthen the BoG’s mandate in this area. Dynamic
developments in the area of retail payments call for continuous undivided attention by

49 These could be network service providers, security printers, payment instruments including cheques, electronic
cards, mobile money transfers and ACH direct credit and debits.




                                                       48
central banks and adequate resources in order to effectively respond to the regulatory
and supervisory challenges. The NPSO should become an independent department
with hierarchical level similar to the BSD’s, and be given clear responsibilities in
relation to other departments within BoG (e.g., with respect to the role the MCU in
FCP) and external stakeholders.

105. The BoG should embark on capacity building of payment system
oversight function by strengthening NPSO as proper supervision is an important
aspect of FCP. In regards to market conduct supervision of payments, it should
commence with capacity building of MCU. Strengthening of NPSO is a prerequisite
for maintaining a strong oversight function within BoG, given that rapid
developments in the payments business often create a knowledge gap between the
payments overseer and the industry. As the MCU unit builds its capacity in relation to
market conduct supervision, it could establish a cooperative arrangement with NPSO
and consider joint onsite supervisory visits as part of the training process before
assuming this role on its own as part of broader and independent market conduct
supervision.

106. In the short term the cooperation framework should be strengthened,
both internally within the BoG and externally with other regulators and the
industry. The NPSO should strengthen its cooperation with other BoG units, in
particular with the MCU, and with other regulatory authorities, such as the
telecommunications regulator, on the basis of standards set by the Committee on
Payments and Market Infrastructure (CPMI). In fact, for having an explicit objective
of maintaining trust and confidence in money, payment overseers usually take an
interest in some FCP issues. Where they do not have the full mandate in FCP, they
should collaborate and co-operate with the relevant authorities, in particular in
relation to MNOs. The approaches to achieve collaboration and co-ordination across
authorities include creating a National Payment Council (NPC), establishing MoUs
between authorities and including FCP as part of existing co-ordination mechanisms
like inter-regulator councils. Intra-organization collaboration and co-ordination could
be achieved through designated committees/standing groups.

107. In the same spirit of cooperation, the BoG should also aim at establishing
a NPC to facilitate dialogue with all relevant stakeholders in the payments
systems modernization process. The NPC acts as the forum for dialogue between
the central bank and NPS stakeholders on payment system strategic and policy issues,
including relevant consumer protection ones. Successful cooperation between the
BoG, which also include the MCU for consumer protection issues, and the
stakeholders is essential to promoting and facilitating the development of the NPS and
guaranteeing that customers are treated fairly.

3.2 Disclosure and Sales Practices
3.2.1 Key findings
108. Overall, provisions on disclosure and sales practices are scattered and
scarce; when existent, they are often not applied or enforced. While there are
some provisions on disclosure, these are neither systematic nor comprehensive and do
not apply across all payment service providers. Format and manner of disclosure is
not regulated, although this is particularly important in relation to e-money products,


                                          49
which are often only accessed through mobile phones and target low-income
customers.

109. Advertisement in relation to payment services and products is only lightly
regulated. The E-Money Guidelines provide some basic principles on what the
minimum content should be for advertising and sales materials: these materials need
to follow the basic principles of transparency and honesty and provide contact details
of the relevant e-money issuer. The rules only apply to e-money issuers and no
definition or examples of what transparency and honesty mean are provided.

110. The PSA establishes basic rules on transparency governing pre-
contractual disclosure, including indication on the minimum content. Even
though the PSA establishes that there should be overall transparency50 and consumers
should be given pre-transactional information,51 this does not seem to be the practice
in Ghana. Not only clearer requirements have not been put in place by BoG but also
information is not provided to consumers, which may also be due to the fact that the
PSA only mentions that this information should be provided upon request. Similarly,
while the PSA establishes rules on the minimum content of the information that
should be given to consumers, it does not provide a standard format nor it requires
this information to be given in a durable medium.

111. The E-Money Guidelines establish basic transparency requirements but
these do not appear to be implemented in practice and are not enforced. By
regulation, e-money issuers are obliged to disclose sufficient information in a timely
manner on the fundamental benefits, risks and terms of the product. 52 Similarly,
although not clear at which stage of the relationship this information should be
provided, e-money issuers should provide product material indicating key information
(a detailed list is included in the E-money Guidelines). 53 This requirement is not
implemented in practice by the majority of e-money issuers.

112. Similarly, no written agreements are handed to e-money customers,
despite this being an explicit requirement contained in the E-Money Guidelines.
The guidelines require e-money issuers to enter into a written agreement with every e-
money account holder for whom they open an e-money account and provide it to
consumers in a durable medium54. Despite this explicit requirement, probably due to
the lack of supervision, this provision does not seem to be applied.

113. Although there is no clear requirement for payment service providers to
issue users account statements, there is a general requirement to produce
transactions receipts. In fact both the PSA and the E-money Guidelines require
payment service providers to give information subsequent to the execution of a
transfer. While the PSA indicates basic details which need to be included in the
receipt, 55 the E-money Guidelines, in the context of technology and security

requirements, impose an obligation on e-money issuers to notify customers of all
transactions on their accounts either via electronic notification or a physical receipt.56

114. Transparency in the remittance market appears adequate, although some
money transfer operators (MTOs) apply less favorable rates to customers . This is
particularly the case with the larger international MTOs that do not use official BoG
exchange rates. The cost of sending/receiving money normally comprises various
elements including commission paid by the sender and receiver, margin charged by
remittance service providers on the exchange applied, taxes etc. Good practices in this
field require transparency and adequate protection for consumers in the provision of
remittance services. While there is general disclosure of fees and commissions
applicable to remittance services the exchange rate applied to transactions in the
conversion process is not always known, particularly in the case of non-bank
remittance service providers.

 3.2.2 Recommendations

115. In the short term the BoG should lay down requirements, by issuing a
notice or a guideline on transparency, for payment service providers to have in
place clear pre-contractual disclosure materials and procedures. This requirement
should apply to all payment service providers indistinctly and should be such that the
information is disclosed to the customers mandatorily and in the right manner, format
and time. Once this requirement is in place, the MCU should coordinate with the
NPSO to ensure it is implemented by providers, and take enforcement actions in case
of non-compliance.

116. Similarly, in addition to introducing basic disclosure requirements, the
BoG should also impose an obligation on payment service providers to provide
consumers with a copy of the terms and conditions. Given the specificity and
uniqueness of payment services and products, this requirement should vary based on
the specific service offered. For payment service provided on a regular basis, such as
e-wallets, the information provided should resemble standard terms and conditions;57
if a store value product (e.g., e-money) is provided additional information should be
included (e.g. whether there is interest payment, whether the product is covered by
deposit insurance, etc.). For one-off transactions, like a money transfer service, the



56 Bank of Ghana, Guidelines for E-money issues in Ghana, Art. 8.
57 For example, it should include: Identification of the PSP, at minimum by its full name and address, where
applicable also by its identification number and contact details; Key service features (including risks) and terms
and conditions of the agreement; How and when the terms and conditions may be altered unilaterally by the PSP,
and how and when the consumer will be warned about the upcoming change; All costs, fees and charges
(including fees and charges by third parties, particularly if related to the use of a payment instrument) that flow or
may flow from the agreement and when they can be applied, and how they are calculated; Key rights and
responsibilities of the consumer, including any obligation to pay applicable taxes on income generated by the
agreement; Monetary penalties and any other remedies the PSP may seek to impose in the event of a breach of the
agreement by the consumer, including default; How disputes with the PSP can be solved, with contact and process
information about internal and external dispute resolution mechanisms available; The summary of procedures in
the event of a suspicious, unauthorized and mistaken transaction, fraud, system malfunctions, lost or stolen
payment instruments and/or authentication information, including contact information, relevant fees and charges
and the parties’ liability in such cases; and any transaction restrictions (e.g. limits on the value of daily
transactions) and balance limits.




                                                         51
basic information (e.g., fees and charges, limits on the amount, timeframe, etc.)
should be provided.

117. In the medium to long term, BoG should consider putting in place a
standardized disclosure form for basic payment services and products. In certain
countries, including in the European Union, it is common practice that in the pre-
contractual stage payment service providers need to give to consumers a “fee
information document” on paper or another durable medium containing the
standardized terms in the final list of the most representative services linked to a
payment account. This document should be, among other, short, clear, comparable
across providers and easy to understand.

118. All remittance service providers, banks and non-banks, should be
mandated to comply with the same disclosure requirements including the
exchange rate applied for both inward and outward remittances. The banks in
Ghana are the authorized entities for dealing in outward remittances and are mandated
to use the exchange rate that is published on a daily basis. However, there is no
similar explicit requirement for remittance service providers (non-banks) handling
inward remittances; hence the exchange rate applied to transactions is not always
disclosed to customers.

3.3 Fair Treatment and Business Conduct
 3.3.1 Key findings
119.    The legal framework contains provisions for the fair treatment of
consumers. Part II of the PSA specifically deals with customer information and
participants’ obligations with respect to a transaction. Although not in detail, the PSA
lays down basic requirements for business practices. It imposes basic standards for
payment service providers to follow to avoid abusive practices such as imposing on
consumers unnecessary delays.58 Similarly, the PSA obliges providers to make funds
available within the agreed time or within the standard limit applicable to the
system.59

120. Although there are no specific provisions on mistaken transactions, the
PSA imposes certain requirements on refund in the event of non-execution. In
case of non-execution, payment service providers are obliged to refund the money to
the originator and to pay an interest calculated by applying the 91-day Treasury bill
discount rate.60 However, if the transaction is not executed because of a mistake by
the originator then he/she is not entitled to the interest rate.61 In practice, e-money
issuers do not commit to refunding the originator in case funds are transferred to the
wrong person/number (a very common error by e-money users in Ghana), although
they might attend to consumers who report the problem before the funds have already
been withdrawn by the receiver of the funds.

                                             52
121. The E-money Guidelines further specify additional requirements for e-
money issuers on responsible conduct and professional competence. In general
terms the e-money issuers are required to ensure that their staff and authorized agents
behave responsibly towards consumers. 62 For what concerns the management, the
licensing requirements include fit and proper standards for individuals proposed to
manage or control the e-money issuer, such as qualifications to perform their
functions.63

122. In relation to agents, e-money issuers are required to keep a registry of all
their agents. E-money issuers are required to provide a list with the name and
location of all customer service points and all agents. They must also allocate a
unique ID number to each agent, and display it at the agent point. They are also
required to send a short message service (SMS), or any other effective means of
information, to customers of agents that are to close down. These rules are generally
in line with international best practice and largely applied in practice. In addition, they
are complemented by similar requirements of the Agent Guidelines, which are
applicable to all deposit-taking institutions providing transactional services at agent
locations and e-money issuers.

123. Provisions for the protection of customer funds relating to e-money
issuance and transactions are in place and reportedly applied by e-money
issuers. For instance, e-money issuers are required to keep 100 percent of the e-
money float in liquid assets with need to remain unencumbered.64 Following the same
principle and to avoid agent frauds, e-money issuers are required to reconcile liquid
assets (daily by 4 PM) held in the pooled account(s) with the total amount owed to
their customers, agents, and merchants. 65 Moreover, the e-money float cannot be
commingled with other funds and shall be held in one or more banks in Ghana. 66 BoG
is not yet conducting routine supervision to check how effectively these requirements
are met in practice.

124. Finally, although there are provisions allowing the transfer of interests
paid on the float to customers, there are some issues relating to its application.
Similarly to countries such as Tanzania and Kenya, BoG has allowed for the interests
paid on the float accounts to be transferred to e-money customers. The E-Money
Guidelines include specific rules on the payment of such interest.67 However, there
are currently disputes between banks and e-money issuers which require further
investigation to ensure the smooth implementation of the regulatory provision that
would benefit customers.

 3.3.2 Recommendations
125. Specific regulatory requirements should be introduced to curb unfair
practices and set minimum business conduct standards for all types of providers

regulated by BoG, in addition to what is already in place for e-money issuers. In
the medium term, BoG, in particular the NPSO and the MCU, should work on issuing
regulatory provisions to prohibit unfair, exploitative, unbalanced or abusive terms and
conditions, and make such terms and conditions void by default if used. Examples of
abusive clauses and terms and conditions should be included in the regulation. The
criteria for establishing which clauses could be deemed abusive and the procedures
for BoG to determine how contractual clauses will be analyzed and determined
abusive (or similar) should also be established.

126. The BoG should begin assessing the current market practices and take
enforcement actions when regulations are not respected. Given that e-money
issuers are obliged to act fairly the BoG should assess whether the current practices
are fair and reasonable. The BoG should also ensure compliance with the
requirements which are already in place, such as maximum transfer times, the
obligation to make funds available upon transfer, and the obligation to refund
customers in the event of non-execution.

3.4 Data Privacy and Protection and Operational Reliability

 3.4.1 Key findings
127. In the legal and regulatory framework there are requirements for
payment services providers to have secure and reliable systems. In fact, e-money
issuers not only must have prudent management and internal controls68 but are also
required to ensure high-quality performance (99.5% service availability) of the
system.69

128. Debit and credit cards are issued to customers on the basis of terms and
conditions that absolve banks from liability for any loss or damage arising from
misuse of such cards. With the advent of cybercrime and the prevalence of card
fraud a review of this situation is necessary in order to enhance customer protection in
this area. This is particularly important given the tendency to move to more electronic
and other non-cash based means of payment under the overall financial inclusion
agenda.
129.        For Data Privacy and Protection see section 2.2.

 3.4.2 Recommendations
130. BoG and the DPC should work together to ensure that payment services
providers adopt measures to ensure the protection of customers’ information
(for more details see section 2.2). This is particularly important in relation to retail
payments, given the pervasiveness of retail payments transactions in the daily lives of
all adults. Also, as they are characterized by large volumes, they form a rich source of
information which needs to be protected against misuse. A payment transaction in
addition to the data on the underlying transaction, also has information on the location
of the transaction, as well as the time of the day.

                                                         54
131. The BoG, in the medium term, should issue a regulation requiring
customer authentication and set minimum rules for providers to avoid and deal
with mistaken and unauthorized transactions. In line with international best
practice:
     a. All payment transactions need to be authorized in the manner agreed
         between a consumer and a payment service provider. The authorization
         method should be based on an authentication process that uses unique
         identifiers known to (Personal Identification Number – PIN), possessed by (a
         token) or associated with (biometric data) the consumer.
     b. A consumer’s liability for losses from unauthorized transactions should
         be limited to a maximum amount specified by law, except for the
         instances of fraud and gross negligence. A payment service provider
         should be required to provide evidence that the conditions for the
         consumer’s liability have been met.
     c. A payment service provider should be required to provide necessary
         assistance to consumers to recover mistakenly transferred funds.

3.5 Dispute Resolution Mechanisms

 3.5.1 Key findings
132. The E-Money Guidelines have detailed requirements on IDR. 70 E-money
issuers are required to set up effective procedures that allow users to submit
complaints. At a minimum they should have in place mechanisms which are easily
accessible and understandable. This seems to be applied in practice. For instance,
MNOs have call centers which are free of charge, which can be used by the customers
of e-money issuers owned by MNOs. The contact information is usually displayed at
branches and agent locations. In addition, the Agent Guidelines requires e-money
issuers to ensure that their IDR works equally well when agents are used and agents
should display the contact number for the issuer’s IDR.71

133. Not only e-money issuers are required to have such a mechanism but also
they are required to follow certain standards. In accordance with international best
practice, e-money issuers need to solve complaints within a specified timeframe (5
days + 10 days if needed but the customer must be informed) and they are required to
have in place a mechanism allowing consumers to have sufficient information on the
status of the complaint.

134.        For EDR see section 2.3.

 3.5.2 Recommendations

135. In the short term, BoG should issue a regulation imposing minimum IDR
requirements to all payment service providers, similar to the existing
requirements of the E-Money Guidelines.

                                                        55
136. To reinforce the regulatory expectations and improve compliance among
bank and non-bank financial service providers, the BoG should develop training
for financial service providers to support adoption of clear requirements for
internal complaints handling.
137.        For EDR see section 2.3.

4       Insurance

4.1 Legal, Regulatory and Supervisory Framework

 4.1.1 Key findings
138. The regulation and supervision of insurance in Ghana is divided between
private health insurance and life/non-life insurance, with different approaches
taken for each. All classes of insurance, except for health insurance, are regulated
under the Insurance Act,72 and supervised by the NIC. Health insurance is regulated
under the Health Insurance Act,73 and is supervised by the National Health Insurance
Authority (NHIA). Health insurance is not defined in either law, leading to confusion
and potential gaps or overlap in regulation, particularly for health microinsurance
products. Although the NHIA’s legal department is of the view the NHIA regulates
only the insurance issued by a licensed private health insurance schemes (PHIS), this
interpretation may lead to problematic results, such as where health insurance can
then technically be offered by other insurers outside the Health Insurance Act regime
or potentially unlicensed providers, and where PHIS could arguably issue products
that are not actually health insurance.

139.    Across all insurance classes, and in particular non-life and health
insurance, strong competition and apparent underpricing of risk has led to
concerns about insurer stability and the timely payment of claims. This issue has
received focus from both NIC and NHIA. At the end of 2015, both the NIC and the
NHIA implemented a new solvency framework, and are focused on bringing insurers
into line with new or target solvency ratios and ensuring the prompt payment of
claims.

4.1.1.1 Insurance (other than health insurance)

140. The NIC seems to have an implicit legal mandate for consumer
protection. The Insurance Act specifies the functions and objectives of the NIC,
which includes elements of consumer protection, albeit that these are not explicitly
stated. Those functions relevant to consumer protection include approving and setting
standards for the conduct of insurance business and insurance intermediary business,
to encourage the development of and compliance with the insurance industry’s code
of conduct, to provide a bureau for resolution of consumer complaints, to arbitrate
claims referred to the NIC, and to educate the public on insurance.

141. The NIC has a broad range of powers but faces resource constraints for
market conduct supervision. The Insurance Act requires that all persons conducting
insurance business, and all insurance intermediaries have a license from the NIC.74
The NIC has powers to conduct inspections, investigations, issue directives, take
action against unlicensed operators, terminate directors or principal officers, conduct
examinations, and revoke or amend licenses. 75 However, the NIC has only one
supervisory department, which is tasked with both prudential and market conduct
supervision. Despite the resource constraint and the priority given to financial
stability, the NIC appears to be proactive and aware of key consumer protection
matters in Ghana, and continues to improve its coverage of, and response to, such
issues. For instance, the NIC’s risk-based supervision model prioritizes addressing
higher risk consumer protection matters such as claims handling.

142. The Insurance Act contains limited consumer protection provisions, so
the insurance consumer protection framework has typically relied on regulation
and standard-setting by the NIC. The Act includes provisions dealing with such
items as fit and proper requirements for shareholders and principal officers of insurers
and intermediaries, some client money handling requirements, prohibitions on
misleading materials, mandated NIC approval of insurance products, and restrictions
on dealing with unlicensed insurers or intermediaries. There are no provisions
governing contracts of insurance. The NIC was, within six months of the
commencement of the Insurance Act, required to issue a code of practice for insurers
and intermediaries, and to issue market conduct rules. No code has been issued, and
market conduct rules exist only with respect to microinsurance. The NIC has issued a
number of Guidelines under its power to issue directives, which makes them
binding.76

143. The uptake of microinsurance is increasing in Ghana, and the NIC has
cautiously encouraged its growth by providing a clear framework, and building
consumer awareness. The Microinsurance Market Conduct Rules only permit
existing licensed insurers to write such business, but allows insurers to utilize a set of
qualitative tests to classify a product as microinsurance, such as whether the product
is designed to meet the needs of, and be affordable and accessible to, a particular
target market. By meeting these criteria, the product is subject to less onerous
requirements as compared to conventional insurance. Currently, the microinsurance
market is led predominantly by mobile network providers offering “free” and paid
products, although free products are currently being withdrawn from the market.

144. The NIC engages in consumer education and public awareness about
insurance, but should publish timely information regarding the insurance
industry. The NIC runs a series of regular educational activities, and collaborates
with international development partners to produce targeted education tools such as
videos on microinsurance in local dialects. However, there is opportunity to improve
dissemination of industry-wide information. For instance, at the time of this review,


74 Insurance Act, 2006, Art. 36 and Art. 126.
75 See generally, Insurance Act, 2006 (Act 724).
76 Some of these, such as the Claims Management Guidelines, were not accessible on the NIC’s website, so a full

analysis of them cannot be provided.




                                                      57
the latest Annual Report that was publicly available on NIC’s website was for 2011,
and the website does not contain a clear and easy to understand information source for
consumers, which seems to be a missed opportunity. It is important that the public has
ready access to up to date information on the state of the industry and the stability of
insurers.

145. The NIC expects to shortly release a draft Insurance Bill for consultation.
A new draft insurance law for Ghana went through a round of consultation in 2013,
and the NIC is preparing a new draft Bill to put out for consultation and subsequent
introduction to Parliament, with a stated target of mid-2016. The draft Bill, much like
the existing Insurance Act, does not contain extensive consumer protection rules and
relies on the NIC to issue specific requirements.

4.1.1.2 Health Insurance

146. The NHIA’s oversight of PHIS potentially conflicts with its broader
mandate, which is to achieve universal healthcare in Ghana. The mandate covers
the provision of access to healthcare services to persons covered by the national
scheme, managing the National Health Insurance Fund, and paying claims and
accrediting healthcare providers under the national scheme. However, the NHIA also
has a mandate to regulate and supervise PHIS. Managing the relationships with health
care providers and grouping supervision of PHIS with the national (public) scheme
may compromise the effectiveness of supervision due to difficulty in balancing the
two mandates, and the potential conflicts that may arise. For example, the social
objective of ensuring universal access to affordable healthcare may not be aligned
with the need to ensure the short- and long-term sustainability of for-profit,
commercially-run PHIS. This is exacerbated by many challenges facing the NHIA,
such as expanding the scheme to the informal sector, and fiscal shortfalls.

147. The NHIA has created the PHIS Directorate to oversee the PHIS, but it
seems to lack independence. The Health Insurance Act resulted in numerous reforms
to NHIA, including the creation of a dedicated PHIS Directorate. The PHIS
Directorate does not, however, operate independently, as it reports to the NHIA
Deputy CEO, and the NHIA Board 77 determines its mandate, resourcing, and
objectives/priorities. The Directorate’s structure, reporting and funding model do not
indicate independence in the execution of its supervisory and enforcement functions.

148. NHIA’s supervision and enforcement powers are limited. NHIA’s purpose
relating to PHIS includes their registration and supervision, ensuring the efficiency
and quality of services, and the protection of the interests of members. A PHIS must
be registered and licensed either as private commercial or mutual schemes. The
NHIA’s supervision and enforcement powers are limited, with primary powers being
the revocation, suspension or amendments to licenses, inspection powers, the power
to issue binding directives, appointing an actuary to investigate in certain
circumstances, or appoint of interim management of a scheme if a license is revoked.
With the exception of one sanction for the use of health insurance terms without being


77NHIA Board must include a member of the senior staff of the NIC, which is currently the Commissioner for
Insurance.




                                                    58
licensed, there are no sanctions for breaches of the law beyond license revocations or
suspensions, which can lead to harsh outcomes that lack the necessary nuances
required for effective supervision and enforcement, although the NHIA appears to
have attempted to introduce sanctions through its PHIS Guidelines.

149. The regulatory framework for PHIS is underdeveloped and there is
limited focus on consumer protection. After the NHIA clarified its expectations of
both commercial and mutual schemes in 2015, all or most mutual providers are
currently converting to commercial licenses, and hence to more strict regulations. It
appears that some provisions of the Insurance Act are intended to also apply to health
insurance schemes78 but these are described in the law by subject matter rather than
by reference to specific provisions, which leads to uncertainty. Consumer protection
provisions in the Health Insurance Act include security deposits, some fit and proper
requirements for directors and principal officers, the provision of annual reports or of
“essential” information on capitalization, reserves and other information to the NHIA,
the potential for the Minister for Health to prescribe minimum healthcare benefits for
PHIS, the mandated issue of an identity card and information on the insured’s rights,
obligations and benefits, restrictions on rights to terminate a member, and the
requirement for internal complaints handling processes. However, even these
provisions appear to be inadequate, such as allowing a mutual PHIS to take up to
three years to place its security deposit with the NHIA 79 , which leaves members
vulnerable to the failure of the PHIS in the intervening period.

150. The PHIS Directorate has limited capacity, no specialized expertise in
insurance and no dedicated consumer protection staff. The NHIA recognizes its
need to build capacity in insurance supervision generally, and has sought the
necessary resources, as well as assistance with capacity building on prudential
supervision from the NIC. However, the PHIS Directorate’s current focus is securing
the financial strength of PHIS, and the conversion of mutual schemes to commercial
schemes. The senior staff of the PHIS Directorate have only limited exposure to
financial services supervisory practices and concepts. Moreover, although a number
of staff have extensive experience with healthcare and the (public) national insurance
scheme, there is a clear need for specialized knowledge and experience specifically in
insurance.80 Nevertheless, the Directorate conducts quarterly reviews of insurers, in
which it covers consumer protection issues such as the timely payment of claims,
internal complaint handling processes, consumer data protection, and ensuring
employee information sessions are held where an employer signs up to a scheme.

151. The NHIA does not publish a list of registered PHIS on its website, or
aggregated information such as on complaints or the financial strength of the
sector. The NHIA intends to publish a list of registered PHIS and their financials after
31 March 2016, when updated financial reporting is due. The most recent Annual
Report of the NHIA available on its website, which is for 2013, includes only a half-



78 Health Insurance Act, Art. 75.
79 Health Insurance Act, Art. 79.
80 Whilst it has elements in common with the national scheme, private health insurance operates under commercial

insurance contracts, has profit-making objectives, and needs to ensure disclosure and fairness of services.

page section on the PHIS, and none of NHIA’s stated 2013 targets relate directly to
PHIS.

 4.1.2 Recommendations
152. The NIC and Government should finalize and pass the new Insurance Act
and reform the Health Insurance Act to establish a stronger framework for
consumer protection.
          a) Both Acts should clearly state the NIC’s and the NHIA’s mandates for
             consumer protection, and more clearly differentiate what is covered by
             each. The consumer protection mandates should include ensuring fairness
             and transparency of the insurance market.
          b) The laws should also include specific provisions on consumer
             protection. The introduction of a separate part of the laws relating to
             consumer protection would both elevate the importance of protecting
             consumers, and establish the core framework for the structure of regulation
             and supervision in this area. In particular, the laws should contain general
             statements of principles such as the requirement for fairness and the ethical
             conduct of insurers and intermediaries. Principles-based regulation provides
             the opportunity to establish a framework for the fair treatment of customers,
             and can be fleshed out with specific rules and adjusted as market
             developments occur through the issuing of Rules and other instruments by
             the NIC or the NHIA. In addition to a principles-based approach, the laws
             should contain a number of specific provisions, such as those regulating the
             insurance contract.
          c) The laws should also give the NIC and NHIA clear powers to issue
             binding instruments, and make it clear which instruments are either
             binding, with clear legal consequences for breach, or that are merely
             guidance that reflect the individual agency’s interpretation of the law.
          d) The Health Insurance Act should give the NHIA strengthened and
             sufficient enforcement powers, and attach a clear sanctions regime (with
             both administrative and criminal penalties) for breaches of the law.
          e) The meaning of “health insurance” and “health insurance schemes”
             should be clearly defined in the Insurance Act and the Health Insurance
             Act in order to avoid regulatory uncertainty, and cross-references between
             the two Acts81 that are out of date and vague need to be deleted or made
             specific in their application. In introducing such definitions, consideration
             will need to be given to the potential impact on existing health
             microinsurance products, and ensuring such products have the benefit of the
             NIC’s microinsurance regime.

153. Opportunities should be considered to effect a common regulatory and
supervisory approach for consumer protection across all insurance classes. The
NIC has made strides in its consumer protection capability, framework and
implementation, and demonstrates a proactive approach. The NHIA should leverage

81   See National Health Insurance Act, Art. 75 and Insurance Act, Art. 214.




                                                          60
off this experience and the existing rules, and focus on building internal capability in
consumer protection. Both agencies should collaborate to effect a common framework
and standards for consumer protection across all insurance classes, noting that
different classes of insurance such as health or life insurance would also be subject to
bespoke rules, and require specialist expertise. The common standards could
encompass product disclosure, sales practices, claims handling, and complaints
handling. Consideration should ultimately be given to formally merging regulatory
and supervisory responsibility for consumer protection across all insurance classes
under one agency, as it would provide more consistent consumer outcomes, and better
utilize scarce resources. This could be achieved through an MoU, or formally (by law)
through the merging of responsibilities for insurance into a single insurance
supervisor.

154. Both the NIC and the NHIA should have clear and measurable plans to
improve their consumer protection capability and activities, and ensure that,
over time, consumer protection receives dedicated focus, and sufficient priority
as compared to prudential supervision. The NIC and the NHIA should consider
separating supervision of consumer protection from prudential matters, given the
substantially different skillset required. This transition could start with the allocation
of dedicated staff to a consumer protection function within the supervision
department. Ideally, consumer protection supervision should be elevated to the same
level within the organization as prudential supervision.

155. Both the NIC and NHIA should publish key information on the insurance
sector in a regular and timely manner, ensuring easy access for consumers, the
insurance sector and other stakeholders.
In particular, NIC and NHIA should:
    a) Ensure they produce a report on at least an annual basis that contains an
        overview of their work in insurance supervision (including consumer
        protection), and on the insurance sector, including aggregated financial and
        statistical complaints information from insurers. The annual reports should be
        promptly published on their websites so that they are easily available to the
        public;
    b) Ensure that their websites contain an up to date, full set of current
        statutory instruments affecting the insurance sector, so it is clear to the
        industry and public what the statutory regime is; and
    c) Ensure that there is a part of their website that is easy to access and
        understand, which is designed to provide information to assist consumers,
        particularly on microinsurance.

156. The NHIA should:
   a) Increase the amount of information in its Annual Report relating to
      PHIS, or produce a separate annual report on PHIS;
   b) Establish and publish annual targets and priorities, and report on the
      progress of these in its Annual Report; and
   c) Publish on its website an up to date list of registered health insurance
      schemes and all current regulatory instruments such as Rules, Guidelines
      or Directives.




                                            61
4.2 Disclosure and Sales Practices
 4.2.1 Key findings

157. There are only very limited requirements regulating disclosure and sales
practices. A key provision is the requirement for new “forms” of insurance products.
The NIC has issued Guidelines82 for the approval of life insurance products, which
contain some disclosure and insurance contract requirements. In the absence of
specific regulatory requirements as to fairness, disclosure, and contract terms, the NIC
uses this review to ensure the fairness and suitability of products. However, the
requirement for a supervisor to approve products is a resource-intensive and time-
consuming process and can be controversial, with many countries only requiring
filings of product terms, or nothing at all, and placing responsibility directly on the
issuer to meet regulatory requirements. It is unclear when amendments to approved
terms need revisiting by the NIC. Whilst these Guidelines contain a number of
requirements for product disclosure and contract terms, many improvements could be
made to properly address these areas. There are no equivalent Guidelines for non-life
insurance.

158. The most comprehensive disclosure obligations are those that apply to
microinsurance under the Market Conduct (Microinsurance) Rules 2013.
Microinsurance policies must be written in clear, straightforward language, be readily
understood by the target market, must contain no or few exclusions, and be
accompanied by a Policy Summary which is standardized by regulation, and which
must be given to the customer in sufficient time for the consumer to make a decision.
The NIC intends that the new insurance law will establish a clear framework for the
regulation and supervision of microinsurance.

159. The disclosure requirements for PHIS are much less developed. The
NHIA reviews the coverage of schemes when it issues or renews the registration of
PHIS. PHIS are required to provide basic disclosure documents that contain benefits
under the scheme, which are usually subject to substantial exclusions in cover.

160. Insurers are not required to clearly explain duty of disclosure
requirements to the consumer to ensure the obligation and consequences of non-
disclosure are understood. Whilst the NIC Product Approval Guidelines do require
some disclosure (as to fraud and mis-statement of age), these are inadequate to
properly ensure the customer understands the nature and implications of the duty.

161. Consumer protection requirements for the sales process and intermediary
qualifications and conduct are insufficient. Such rules are intended to ensure that a
consumer receives appropriate advice, is sold suitable products, and that
intermediaries meet certain requirements regarding minimum conduct, as well as
having sufficient education, training and experience. This seems particularly
important in the area of life insurance, as there is evidence of mis-selling of life
investment products in Ghana. There are no requirements at all for sales conduct in
relation to PHIS. PHIS Private health insurance is predominantly sold to employers,


82   Guidelines on Application and Approval of new and repackaged Life Insurance Products (undated).




                                                        62
who use health insurance as part of their remuneration and staff retention program,
although some insurers market to individuals or to groups of individuals (such as to
teachers, via teacher unions). Accordingly, the end consumer usually has no say in
the decision to purchase private health insurance, does not have a direct contractual
relationship with the PHIS, and only receives mandated written information as
facilitated by the employer. Consumer interaction with the insurer is usually limited to
claims issues, and clarification of coverage. Insurers have call centers to provide
information to consumers, and deal with customers directly when handling claims and
receiving complaints.

162. Mobile insurance is growing rapidly in Ghana, and poses a number of
consumer protection challenges. Products currently on offer include hospital cash,
funeral, and personal accident policies. MNOs are in the process of withdrawing
“free” products from the market, and are looking at expanding into income protection,
permanent disability, and education savings accounts. GIZ 83 , at the request of the
NIC, commissioned a report 84 on the risks of mobile insurance. Some problems
identified include that many consumers do not realize they have insurance through
their MNOs, and even if they do, they frequently fail to understand the product.
Payment structures can be confusing if a month’s premium is not paid in full, with
cover either being scaled back for the following month, or suspended, with premium
“credits” being carried over until a future month. Further, there are three key parties
involved in the issuing and management of these products: the MNO, which “owns”
the clients; a third party that designs the product, and also conducts outbound sales,
manages claims, and handles complaints; and the insurer. The insurer appears to have
a “light touch” involvement in such products, and rarely if ever has contact with the
customer. The NIC is in the process of drafting Market Conduct Rules to address the
highest risks, and is implementing an MoU with the BoG and the National
Communications Authority, given that these initiatives are led by the MNO, rather
than the insurer.

163. Microcredit insurance is widely used by microfinance institutions, but the
structure of the product and sales practices are problematic from a consumer
protection standpoint. Although the NIC has stated that its Bancassurance
Guidelines85 apply to NBFIs such as credit unions, the Guidelines only refer to banks,
whereas other non-bank financial institutions such as credit unions and other lenders
are involved in insurance business. The use of microcredit policies by credit unions
appears to suffer from a number of issues, including that credit unions may be forcing
consumers to pay for credit insurance “premiums” when providing consumer loans,
and then they retain the pool of premiums, effectively acting as the “insurer”. This
practice is open to abuse, including a lack of oversight by the NIC, non-compliance
with the requirement for customer choice under the Bancassurance Guidelines, and
raises questions whether consumers understand what “product” they are purchasing,
and from whom. Microfinance institutions create further problems in their use of
credit insurance products (see the Box 3 below on one consumer credit product used
by microfinance providers).

Box 3: Microcredit insurance by microfinance institutions in Ghana

Access to credit insurance for death or illness can provide a critical risk management tool for both
microfinance institutions and borrowers alike. One type of product in Ghana, distributed through a
microinsurance agency86, demonstrates many of the challenges of such insurance. The credit insurance
product is technically issued to the microfinance institution as policyholder. The type of cover will
depend on the nature of the loan, with death and disability being standard, and fire and allied perils
applicable to loans for physical property. The microfinance institution requires consumers to whom it
issues loans to make a payment for insurance cover in the event they die or become disabled. The
premium is paid as a single amount added to the loan, less a 10-15 percent commission for the
microfinance institution to be covered under the master policy, the premium and information about
borrowers and outstanding loans must be provided on a monthly basis to the insurer. However, the
agency reported that there is no requirement from the insurer or their agent that the microfinance
institution pass on all premiums collected, regardless of the representations made to the borrower.
When a claim is made, the microfinance institution is responsible to provide claims documentation to
the insurer, and is expected to source the documents from the borrower or his/her family. The
repayment of the loan (with an additional month of interest, less any arrears due) is made directly to the
microfinance institution, which is expected to inform the family that the loan has been repaid.

164. Such arrangements can be vulnerable to a number of abuses. First, if the
microfinance institution can be selective about which loans are insured, it can exercise
adverse selection against the insurer, and effectively self-insure lower risks. However,
this would be misleading for the borrower, who may expect that the premium they
pay is for formal insurance provided by a licensed third party insurer. If the
microfinance institution “self-funds” this insurance, borrowers are vulnerable if the
microfinance institution refuses to cancel the loan, or there is no record of payment of
the premium. Further, since the insurer pays the claim amount directly to the
microfinance institution, there is a risk that a borrower or their family may not be
informed about the repayment of the loan, and despite paying a premium for cover,
could be vulnerable to fraud on the part of the microfinance institution.

Recommendations
165. The NIC should issue more comprehensive Market Conduct Rules and/or
a Code of Practice relating to key consumer protection subject areas, and also
issue the new Market Conduct Rules for mobile insurance. These should include
clear disclosure requirements, such as specific requirements on the insured’s duty of
disclosure, and consequences for breaches, as well as clear sales conduct and
intermediary qualification requirements, and rules as for remuneration of intermediary
and sales staff.

166. The NIC should make amendments to existing guidelines or rules in order
to make their application clearer. It should amend its product approval Guidelines
to ensure that it is clear when amendments to product terms or marketing materials
must be submitted to the NIC for updated approval, and issue equivalent guidelines
for non-life insurance. The NIC should amend the Bancassurance Guidelines to make
it clear these apply to NBFIs including credit unions, and also extend their

companies to the agency. The agency was established to focus specifically on the micro market.




                                                    64
application, or the application of the Microinsurance Market Conduct Rules, to
address the issues arising from micro-credit insurance. For instance, the NIC could
consider a requirement that basic disclosure on the insurance and the provider be
given to the borrower even though they may not be party to the insurance contract; the
microfinance institution may be specifically required to pay all collected premium to
the insurer within a set period; and the insurer be required to inform the borrower or
their family when a payment has been made under the policy.

167. The NHIA should develop and implement a plan for the phased
introduction of market conduct rules for PHIS. The starting point should be
fairness-based conduct requirements and disclosure obligations, to ensure consumers
are aware of the policy terms, coverage limits, their rights and obligations, and any
exclusions.

4.3 Fair Treatment and Business Conduct
4.3.1 Key findings
168. The NIC has implemented Guidelines on Claims Management for both
life and non-life insurance. The Guidelines apply to all forms of life and non-life
insurance, including reinsurance and commercial lines. They impose maximum
timeframes for the assessment and payment of claims, and require notification of the
decision to the customer. However, the Guidelines do not appear to sufficiently
recognize that commercial and industrial insurances may require different claims
approaches.

169. Arising from the relatively low levels of understanding of insurance in
Ghana, there appears to be a common perception that the claims process is
unnecessarily complex, reducing trust in insurance. This includes the requirement
for a police report for all motor claims. Moreover, the lack of a national ID system
means many consumers do not possess formal identification, leading to an increased
risk of fraud on life or personal injury insurance claims, causing insurers to adopt a
more cautious approach that leads to burdensome procedures.

170. The most significant business conduct issue identified for health
insurance is the refusal of healthcare providers to provide service to consumers
where their health insurer is in arrears in paying claims. A solution to this
problem needs to be identified by NHIA, as this situation can result in reduced trust in
the health insurance industry, as well as significant delays in the receipt of treatment
by consumers who are insured.

4.3.2 Recommendations
171. The NIC and NHIA should, as reflected in Section 4 above, work towards
implementing requirements that are currently absent from the rules, with a
priority on implementing fairness and conduct requirements, and addressing
current issues. The NIC should, in addition, examine opportunities to address the
complexity of claims procedures through education and facilitating workshops with
the insurance industry on simplifying claims processes. The NHIA should implement
requirements as to the resolution of disputes between healthcare providers and private
health insurance schemes, and limit the circumstances where healthcare providers can
refuse services to consumers when the scheme otherwise covers the service. To the



                                           65
extent possible, such disputes should not affect the consumer’s timely access to
appropriate healthcare.

4.4 Data Privacy and Protection
 4.4.1 Key findings


172. Insurers handle sensitive personal data in the usual conduct of their
business, such as underwriting or claims assessment. Some data that insurers
would typically handle is classified as “special personal data” under the Data
Protection Act, including health information, and information about a person’s sexual
orientation. This data is subject to higher levels of protection 87 and cannot, for
example, be processed unless necessary or without the specific consent of the person
or unless it is necessary for the protection of the person’s “vital interests”.

173. Specific requirements as to data protection and privacy are limited in the
insurance laws, with only the Health Insurance Act mentioning the issue. PHIS
are required to ensure that data collected on members is protected from unauthorized
access, and the Minister for Health may prescribe guidelines for the security and
privacy of data on members of PHIS. There are no equivalent requirements in the
Insurance Act.

 4.4.2 Recommendations
174. The NIC and the NHIA should collaborate with the Data Protection
Authority to ensure compliance with the general data protection provisions of
the law. This is particularly important in light of the fact that the Act technically
prohibits a person from processing personal data unless they are registered under the
Act. For more details see section 2.2.2.

4.5        Dispute Resolution Mechanisms

 4.5.1 Key findings

4.5.1.1 Insurance (except Health Insurance)

175. Under the NIC Guidelines on Claims Management, insurers are required
to have a documented system and procedure for receiving, registering and
resolving complaints in each of their offices. However, there is no definition of a
“complaint”, and specific requirements of a complaints process (such as ensuring the
insurer appoints a person responsible for the resolution of complaints, the gathering
and analysis of complaints statistics, and the target timeframes for resolution) are not
mandated.

176. Similarly, there are no requirements for insurance intermediaries to have
an internal complaints process. While claims decisions relate to the insurance


87   Data Protection Act, Art. 37.




                                           66
provider, complaints related to mis-selling are usually caused by the actions or
omissions of intermediaries. Intermediaries should ideally be required to have their
own IDR process and/or to cooperate fully with the insurance provider’s IDR process
for activities in the insurance sector.

4.5.1.2 Health Insurance

177. PHIS must have a procedure for settlement of complaints from its
members and its healthcare providers, and ensure those parties are aware of
their right to submit complaints to the Adjudication Committee (which has yet to
be established) where the complaint cannot be settled. Similar to the NIC
requirements, there do not appear to be detailed requirements for the procedure or
operation of internal complaints handling by PHIS. The NHIA Directorate receives
complaints from consumers and healthcare providers, and plays a mediation role.
NHIA reports that PHIS comply with the general requirement.

4.5.2 Recommendations
178. Both the NIC and the NHIA should issue and enforce clear requirements
for internal complaints handling processes for insurers and for intermediaries
(as relevant). This should include fair and consistent complaint handling, the
obligation to investigate complaints, the appointment of a specific person to manage
the complaints process (if possible, who is not subject to conflicts of interest), target
timeframes for communications and resolution, disclosure requirements about the
consumer’s internal and external complaints handling options, giving written reasons
for refusal of the complaint, and required record-keeping and statistical reporting to
the supervisor and the Board on complaints (including by type of complaint,
resolution timeframes, and outcomes). Such requirements should also clearly define
what constitutes a “complaint”. Insurance agents, although they may not be required
to have their own complaints handling process, should be required to comply with the
insurer’s processes, including by providing files and other information in a timely
manner, and otherwise co-operating with any investigation and honoring any decision
made to resolve the complaint.

179. The NHIA should develop and issue standards for IDR for health
insurance providers and begin oversight of IDR schemes and enforcement of
requirements. Without regulator attention to IDR through compliance and
enforcement activities, financial service provider adoption will be slow and
inconsistent with corresponding pressures on the EDR scheme.

180. To reinforce the regulatory expectations and improve compliance among
insurance and health insurance providers, the NIC and NHIA should develop
training for providers to support adoption of regulatory requirements for
internal complaints handling.
181.   For EDR see section 2.3.

4.6 Guarantee Schemes and Insolvency
182. The Insurance Act 88 provides for the establishment of a Client Rescue
Fund, which is to be used to compensate clients of failed insurers. Regulations can
allocate a percentage of the gross premium received by each direct insurer to be paid
into the Fund. The Fund is to be managed by the NIC, which could present a conflict
of interest. A Committee is to be established to assist with making awards under the
Fund.

183. According to the NIC the Fund has been established, and GH¢2 million
(around US$515,000) has been deposited into the Fund from industry
contributions. Policyholder protection schemes should be subject to rigorous public
reporting requirements and independent supervision and oversight to help ensure that
they have the ability to meet their obligations and are based on the principle of
transparency. However, at the time of this review, the guidelines for the operation of
the Fund were not yet in place.

184. For health insurance, there are no provisions for intervention or
resolution of health insurers, and there are other regulatory gaps. There are no
legal provisions for judicial management or winding up, or intervention by the NHIA,
nor is there a regime for the transfer or amalgamation of insurance business, whether
solvent or insolvent. In addition, neither the Insurance Act, nor the Health Insurance
Act, contain provisions ensuring policyholder liabilities have priorities over other
unsecured creditors.
