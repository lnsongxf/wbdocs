Executive Summary


Gender Intelligence for Banks — Moving the Needle on Gender Equality is the result of a joint
partnership between the International Finance Cooperation (IFC) and Habib Bank Limited
(HBL) in Pakistan. The initiative’s goal is to promote gender equality within banks and
to develop insights into how gender intelligence programs can positively impact
organizational gender awareness, financial inclusion for women, and bottom-line results
for banks.

Gender Intelligence Programs —
What Have We Learned?


Women face gender bias both as employees and clients, and women are still underrepresented
in organizations. This is especially so in the banking industry. At the same time, gender-
based discrimination in credit markets disadvantages women, often systematically
denying women equal access to the financial system.

Reducing gender bias in banks thus benefits employees,                  therefore demonstrating a positive contribution both
clients, and financial performance. The focus of this                   to women’s financial inclusion and HBL Pakistan’s

Assumptions


It is important that the following be taken into account when interpreting the results
that are being presented. The survey was envisaged about halfway through the training
program to determine if it was working, and to apply any learnings to the remainder
of the rollout and future programs. The team developed a quasi-experimental design,
but would recommend that for future programs the assessment be built into the design
and rollout of the training program from the very beginning (e.g., in the form of a
Randomized Control Trial). The caveats include:

Also, in HBL branch staff sometimes rotated between
branches which could have increased spillover.

Data Availability: The available sales data is measured
annually (from the baseline year of 2014 onwards). It
would also have been useful to do a trend analysis with
gender-disaggregated data going back at least five years
to better understand trends.
