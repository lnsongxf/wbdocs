• Infrastructure investments have a positive impact on growth
       • A 1% increase in physical infrastructure stocks temporarily raises GDP
         growth by 1-2 percentage points
       • Physical infrastructure in roads and telecoms facilitates spatial access
         and information flows, raising labor productivity, boosting rural non-farm
         incomes, and reducing the incidence of poverty in some geographical
         area
       • Electrification leads to rising female employment (South Africa)
       • Better transportation systems and safer roads raise school attendance
       • Increased access to electricity allows more time to study and the use of
         computers

  2030 period

• Investments in climate mitigation and adaptation are estimated at US$
  440 billion to US$ 780 billion per year over the same period

• Investments required to limit the rise in average global temperatures to
  no more than 2 degree Celsius are estimated to range from US$ 380
  billion to US$680 billion over the period

• Investments in climate adaptation required to adapt to a 2 degree

•    Energy production accounts for 2/3 of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions

•    The full implementation of the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions
     (INDCs) will require the energy sector to invest $ 13.5 trillion in energy efficiency
     and low-carbon technologies over the 2015-2030 period
           • About US$ 8.3 trillion are required to improve energy efficiency in
               transport, buildings and industry sectors
           • The remainder is required to decarbonize the energy sector

     public spending in the scenario with climate change and adaptation as compared to the no climate change scenario, and use the same methodology as has been applied to the other sectors. In
     WB 2010, the costs were incorrectly reported as reflecting the difference in public spending in the scenario with climate change and adaptation as compared to the scenario with climate change
     but no adaptation. The difference lowers the EACC lower bound estimate of the global cost of adaptation from US$ 75 billion reported in WB 2010 to US$ 71.2 billion per year, rounded to

      A long term contract between a public party and a private party, for the
      development (or significant upgrade or renovation) and management of a public
      asset (including potentially management of a related public service), in which
      the private party bears significant risk and management responsibility through
      the life of the contract, provides a significant portion of the finance at its own
      risk, and remuneration is significantly linked to performance and/or the demand
      or use of the asset or service so as to align the interest of both parties.

     Rationale for developing domestic investment component of SWFs
      • Permanent income hypothesis-> countries should save enough of
        revenues from non-renewable resources abroad to maintain
        permanent income flow for indefinite future

      • Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model -> if returns
        are higher at home than abroad, or if future generations can be
        expected to be wealthier than current one, it may be optimal to save
        less abroad and invest more at home now




52
Program context/description: Pillar III
• A number of SWFs have been established since the beginning of the 2000s with
  the objective to undertake domestic investments in key sectors of the economy:
  several SWFs in the Gulf, Samruk-Kazyna in Kazakhstand, Kazanah in Malaysia

• In the last four years, Nigeria and Angola have joined funds with domestic
  investment function

• SWFs with a domestic investment function are being discussed in several
  countries including Bangladesh, Kenya, Myanmar, Mongolia, Mozambique,
  Sierra Leone, Tanzania, and Uganda, to be capitalized from revenues of oil and
  mineral exports




53
Program context/description: Pillar III
•    In parallel with increased allocation by oil or mineral-based SWFs to domestic
     investment, a growing number of EMDEs are establishing Strategic Investment
     Funds (SIFs) funded through fiscal surpluses, asset transfers and/or borrowing

•    SIFs objective: to act as anchor investor for international and domestic
     institutional investors, including private equity and debt funds, in domestic
     projects, in particular for PPP infrastructure projects and SME funds




54
Program context/description: Pillar III
Challenges specific to SWFs

•    SWFs are capitalized by inflows of foreign exchange from oil and mineral sales

•    Key macroeconomic challenges:
        exchange rate appreciation (Dutch disease)
        macroeconomic volatility

•    Need for coordination with overall monetary and fiscal policy

•    Need for optimizing allocation of natural resource surpluses between foreign
     savings and domestic investment

         Guidelines for the design of SIFs
•     Partnering with the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds (ISWF) to further
      develop the Santiago Principles to include principles for domestic investment.

      for the establishment of a Global Infrastructure Resilience Fund (GRIF), with the objective
      of increasing commercial investment in climate resilient infrastructure and SMEs

Program activities
     Sub-regional and country engagements

      At the sub-regional and country levels, the Investment Funds Group
      team supports Regional FM GP and TC GP teams on three business
      lines: (i) development of PE/VC ecosystems; (ii) development of SWFs
      in LICs; and (iii) development of SIFs in low and middle-income
      countries. In each business line, ongoing and planned country
      engagements are selected on the basis of four fundamental criteria:
        • Sub-regional/country demand through CMU
        • Partnership across WBG (IFC, TRE, GPs, CCSAs)
        • Partnership outside WBG (RAS, MDTFs, Multilateral TFs, Bilateral TFs,
          etc..)
        • Line of sight instrument (LSI) towards relevant SDG(s)

Program risks
     The key risk to the program is rapidly growing demand for advisory and project
     support in the investment funds space vs small size of core Investment Fund
     Group (IFG) team in Fin4Dev.

     To mitigate this risk, the team is taking the following measures:
       •   Strengthen the core IFG team through partnerships with senior staff from
           Governance GP (DA assignment) and Energy and Extractives GP (cross-support)
       •   Assign country engagement TTLship to Regional FMGP and TCGP colleagues and
           retain TL and/or co-TTL role only in core IFG team
       •   Build cross-Group, cross-Practice and cross-CCSA task teams based on
           engagement technical and operational scope in particular with IFC Funds Group/SME
           Ventures, TRE, TCGP, SURRGP, Governance GP, Energy and Extractives GP, CC
           CCSA and PPP CCSA
       •   Build strong cadre of senior consultant experts in PE/VC, SWF and SIF spaces to
           contribute to specific advisory and operational engagements




63
Roles of clients and partners
At the global level, critical partnerships are:
     • The Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF), as multi-donor
       forum for building ownership and for supporting the preparation of the global
       review of SIFs and the preparation of guidelines for the design of SIFs.
     • The International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds (ISWF), as
       international standard setter for SWFs governance (Santiago Principles)
     • The Emerging Markets Private Equity Association (EMPEA), as co-manager
       of the PE/VC C4D platform
     • The Fletcher Network for Sovereign Wealth and Global Capital (FNSWGC),
       as co-manager of the SWF C4D platform




64
Roles of clients and partners
At the sub-regional and country level, critical partnerships are:
     •   The Global Fund for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), as multi-donor forum for
         building ownership and funding mobilization for GRIF;

     •   The Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF), as multi-donor forum for
         building ownership and funding mobilization for the SIF business line

     •   The FIRST Initiative, as multi-donor forum for building ownership and funding mobilization
         for the development of PE/VC legal and regulatory frameworks and reforms under the
         PE/VC business line

     •   The European Union Commission, as partner and donor for PE/VC development programs
         in EU candidate countries and in EU Eastern Partnership countries

     •   The UK Department for International Development (DFID), as partner and donor for the
         proposed Caribbean Regional Infrastructure PPP Finance Fund (CRIP3F) and for the
         Kenya SWF/SIF advisory
     •   The Caribbean Development Bank (CDB), as partner in the proposed CRIP3F and in the
         proposed regional diaspora co-investment facility



65
Dissemination and outreach strategy
• The core of the dissemination and outreach strategy for the investment
  fund for development program is the Investment Funds for Development
  Community of Practice (CoP), and its two dedicated C4D platforms co-
  managed and open to outside stakeholders in the investment funds
  space (see Section IV.2.1 above).

• In addition, the IFG core team and regional engagement task team
  leaders and team members will participate actively through speaking and
  panel engagements in selected international forums and conferences, in
  particular the IFSWF Annual Meeting, the EMPEA/IFC Annual
  Conference, and the Fletcher Network Annual Infrastructure Forum.
