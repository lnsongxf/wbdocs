THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW

environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

                    Ghana simplified business start-up by further streamlining
DB2010              registration procedures through the creation of a customer
                    service desk at the one-stop shop.

DB2012              Ghana increased the cost to start a business by 70%.

                    Ghana made starting a business more difficult by requiring

Ghana is a set of specific procedures—the
bureaucratic and legal steps that an entrepreneur
must complete to incorporate and register a new                  Legal form: Private Limited Liability Company

Following is a detailed summary of those procedures,             Start-up Capital: 10 times GNI per capita
along with the associated time and cost. These
procedures are those that apply to a company
matching      the    standard     assumptions      (the
“standardized company”) used by Doing Business in
collecting the data (see the section in this chapter on
what the indicators measure).

      The forms require the following information:

      • Name of company
      • Nature of the business that subscribers intend to engage in
      • Full names of subscribers and shareholders, their addresses,
      percentage shareholdings, occupation, and any directorships in any
      other company
      • Full names of the first directors of the company. A company must
      have a minimum of 2 directors and at least one director must be a
      resident of Ghana at all times, of sound mind, and of legal age (not
      younger than 21)
      • Full name and address of company secretary and auditors (a letter of
      consent to act as auditor is attached)
      • The number of shares that the company is to be registered with and

      incorporate the company, or the standard format that comes with the
      incorporation forms may be adopted.

      For tax purposes, a form is filled at the Registrar-General's Department.
      After the filling of the form, officials of the Ghana Revenue Authority
      assist in the generation of a tax identification number for both the
      company and all the employees of the company to be registered. The
      tax identification number (certificate) is usually obtained by the
      Registrar General's Department on behalf of the incorporated company.
      Four or five copies of the company regulations and Forms 3 and 4 are
      required (auditors, banks, solicitors, company secretaries may each

        Before the approval process commences at the Town and Country

        land where the warehouse will be built belongs to the applicant. In

      Apply for building permit with the Town and Country Planning
      Department

      Once the preliminary approval has been obtained, the architect will
      submit the following to the Town and Country Planning Department:
      - 4 sets of drawings, including the septic tank drawings
      - Fire permit
      - Soil report – not applicable for Doing Business case study
      - Structural Assessment for buildings that are 3 storeys or higher - not
      applicable for Doing Business case study
      - Copy of the title certificate and the form from the Land Commission
      showing correct ownership
      - EPA clearance certificate – for all developments
      - Traffic management report – when applicable (mainly for big
      developments in downtown Accra).
      - Approval of architectural and engineering design

      The TCPD has been decentralized and so the local level in Accra is part
      of the Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA). To start the approval
5     process for the building permit, a technical committee is set up by the    45 days      GHS 1,290
      TCPD, including other officials within the AMA. After the technical
      examination, a recommendation is made to the Statutory Planning
      Committee (SPC). The SPC is an intergovernmental committee made up
      of officials from the TCPD, Works Department, Land Commission Survey
      Department, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Survey
      Department, the Fire Service, and utility companies who meet
      periodically to approve building permits. They are required by law to
      have reviewed the application within 3 months after it is submitted and
      to inform the applicant of their decision.

      The applicant will be informed of the amount of the processing fees
      and the time limit of 3 months starts as soon as the processing fees
      have been paid both for the development permit and the construction
      permit.

      There will be a joint inspection by TCPD and the Works Department
      and each department will issue their own recommendations. BuildCo
      does not need to be present at the inspection.

        Publication of transaction in national weekly newspaper

        The transaction must be published in the national weekly newspaper in
        order to issue Land Title Certificate. The fee for publication is GHC 25 for
        land the size of 0.25 acres or less. Where the Land Certificate is urgently
        required, the applicant has the option to choose what is known as
        “special publication”. In that case, the amount payable is GHC 95.

        above 4 acres, the amount payable is 2% of GHC 25 on every 0.25 acre.
        The current position, however, is that where the size of the land is more
        than 4 acres, the amount payable is a flat rate of GHC 200.

        original of the deed of assignment, having been stamped to show that it
        has been registered, is also returned to the applicant. The Registry keeps
        a duplicate. The folio of the Register is filed and the transaction

Doing Business measures the efficiency of the judicial

The dispute in the case study involves the breach of a

the case from simple debt enforcement. To make the
data comparable across economies, Doing Business
uses several assumptions about the case:
       The seller and buyer are located in the
        economy’s largest business city. For the 11
        economies with a population of more than               The seller requests a pretrial attachment to
