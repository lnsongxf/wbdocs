FOREWORD




Increasing agricultural productivity and stimulating investment in agro-processing is essential to reducing global
poverty and boosting food security. Half of the world’s poor depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. However,
the obstacles to building productive capacity in agribusiness in developing countries are multifaceted, touching on
issues like access to land and water, labor regulations, access to finance, competition policy, commodity pricing,
and risk-sharing. Moreover, private agribusiness companies must be willing to invest in developing countries if
productivity is to increase. Foreign investment, in particular, can provide a valuable jump-start to developing
agribusiness value chains, introducing financial and technical resources unavailable domestically.


The World Bank Group’s Trade and Competitiveness Global Practice works with client governments to boost trade
and investment by creating a better enabling environment for business operations; improve productivity and
competitiveness at the national and industry levels; and, to strengthen innovation systems, with the collective
goal of promoting inclusive and sustainable growth. The Practice has made agribusiness a priority sector, providing
advice to clients on policy and regulatory reforms that can facilitate private investment, while maintaining high
environmental and social standards. However, such policy enhancements often go unnoticed by distant investors
with little knowledge of the reforming country.


In such cases, we also provide assistance to client countries to undertake “investor targeting” initiatives to reach
out and inform potential investors of new opportunities. Typically, a project team identifies the location’s most
competitive agribusiness subsectors and then approaches investors directly to make the case for investment in
those subsectors and to offer information and assistance at every step of their decision-making processes. This
targeted approach has proven to be effective in generating concrete investments for World Bank Group clients in
all developing regions.


This guide presents a well-tested methodology specifically applied to the agribusiness sector, incorporating
key lessons from successful projects in several countries. It includes a step-by-step guide to designing
and implementing investor outreach campaigns, and includes a wide range of practical tools that a project
team can use in constructing their outreach plans. Using the guide, project teams can improve their
effectiveness in generating new investment in even challenging locations, building on work already done
and applying lessons learned.


The online version of this practical handbook will serve as a readily updatable databank of lessons from investor
targeting projects, and an evolving resource in the field of international agribusiness.

                                                          WHAT IS THIS GUIDE?

                                                          WHY IS INVESTOR TARGETING IN AGRIBUSINESS IMPORTANT?




   In 2012, 72 percent of the population of low-income countries lived in rural areas, with agriculture the primary
   source of income.1 Significant poverty reduction and food security depend on agriculture and agribusiness
   achieving substantial growth in jobs, productivity, and income. Agribusiness covers activities that are both
   upstream and downstream from the production of crops and livestock and that frequently have higher
   value addition for an economy. However, many developing countries lack the financial and technical means
   to effectively move into the production of agricultural inputs, such as seeds, machinery, and fertilizer; the
   processing of agricultural outputs for food and industrial inputs; and the provision of critical services, such as
   collection, grading, storage, machinery maintenance and repair, transportation, and marketing.


   As in many sectors, foreign direct investment (FDI) in agribusiness is seen as a potentially transformative
   force for developing countries. It can be a source of capital, jobs, skills, technology, and international market
   knowledge that are unavailable domestically. The right FDI projects may also help to upgrade a country’s
   agricultural practices. They can introduce higher standards and certification for food and labor, and they can
   disseminate innovations such as integrated pest management and geotraceability.


   Successfully promoting FDI into a country is not easy. It is even more challenging to do it in a country with
   limited capacity to mitigate attendant risks, such as land disputes and environmental problems. However,
   most developing countries can find competitive niches in agribusiness, and the Bank Group has successfully
   applied a methodology to help them identify those niches and attract FDI that is both environmentally
   and socially responsible and potentially transformative. For example, Cameroon, Liberia, Madagascar,
   Mali, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, and Tanzania have each benefited in recent years from such
   Bank Group projects.


   This methodology is designed to assist in the planning and implementation of investor targeting
   (“targeting”), a component of investment promotion, which Bank Group experience has shown to be
   an effective short-term method of influencing FDI inflows in some of the most disadvantaged economies. 2
   This is not a substitute for investment climate reform, but rather a complement. And, investment promotion,
   generally, is one private sector development tool among many for strengthening a sector.

THE SPECIAL CHALLENGES OF INVESTOR TARGETING FOR AGRIBUSINESS

WHAT IT TAKES TO SUCCEED IN AN INVESTOR TARGETING PROJECT




     BOX 1. INCREASING FDI INFLOWS: A PRIMER ON TERMINOLOGY AND PRINCIPLES


     Investment. FDI. Investment policy. Investment climate. Investment promotion. Investment promotion
     agency. Investment promotion intermediary. Investor targeting. Investor outreach. Investment facilitation.
     Investor servicing. Investor aftercare. Policy advocacy. These are among the many interrelated and often
     confusing terms thrown about by practitioners in the field generally known as “investment promotion.”
     Many of the people who will use this guide will not be regular practitioners of investment promotion.
     Before proceeding further in this manual, they may find it useful to review some important investment
     promotion terminology.


     When investment promotion practitioners speak of investment, it typically refers to private, productive
     investment. This is a private company establishing facilities and hiring people to produce goods or services
     that are sold in the marketplace. An individual investment may take the form of a manufacturing plant,
     service center, sales office, distribution center, research and development facility, or headquarters, among
     others. It does not refer to liquid portfolio investment. And, it does not refer to public investment or
     international donor funds, although both public and private financial institutions, such as banks,
     governments, and IFC, may provide financing to the private companies that make these investments.


     The source of investment may be domestic or foreign investors, a term which is often used interchangeably
     with “companies.” The global pool of foreign investors is, of course, very much larger than the pool of
     investors based in any one developing country, and they collectively possess all the value chain activities,
     investment capital, skills, technology, and market knowledge that a developing country might aspire to.
     For this reason, foreign direct investment, or FDI, is often seen as an indispensable means
     of catalyzing sector growth and diversification.


     Investment policy, if well-crafted, can enhance the attractiveness of a location by providing a transparent
     and predictable legal and regulatory framework (such as specifying where FDI is permitted and under what
     conditions), improving investor protections (for example, against expropriation, as minority shareholders),
     reducing operating costs through improved infrastructure, and streamlining government procedures (such
     as customs clearance, obtaining permits) to reduce associated costs and risks, and facilitating the full range
     of company operations. More loosely, investment policy can refer to any government policy which affects the
     relative competitiveness of particular sectors. For example, education and immigration policies may increase
     the numbers and skills of available workers. Together, all these factors affecting a location’s attractiveness to
     investors comprise the investment climate.

                                                                          IN AGRIBUSINESS         IMPORTANT?
                                                                                          IMPORTANT?




   However, simply having a good investment climate does not guarantee that a location will capture the
   attention of potential investors, that investors will not have trouble identifying and realizing investment
   opportunities, or that the investment climate cannot be improved further. Investment promotion is an
   umbrella term for all activities designed to make sure that these things happen. Most of these activities fall
   under the heading of one of five typical investment promotion functions: investor targeting, investment
   facilitation, investor servicing, investor aftercare, and policy advocacy.


   Investor targeting (a.k.a., investor outreach and proactive promotion) is proactively reaching out to
   investors identified as being desirable and likely to invest, in order to present them with tailored business
   cases for selecting a given location. Investment facilitation attempts to convert investor interest into
   a decision to invest, through the provision of information and assistance during the site selection process.
   Investor servicing then helps convert that decision into an operational project.


   Even after a company becomes operational, it remains a potential source for new investment, often
   called “reinvestment” when it comes from an existing investor. Identifying potential for reinvestment and
   facilitating its realization is a dimension of investor aftercare.


   In any given location, there will be many institutions, both public and private, that undertake one or more of
   these various investment promotion functions. For example, a sector-specific ministry, such as a Ministry of
   Agriculture, may conduct investor targeting, and an agroprocessors’ association might conduct investment
   facilitation and investor servicing. Any such institution might be described as an investment promotion
   intermediary (IPI). Wanting to ensure that all essential functions are performed in a coherent and strategic
   manner, most governments have designated one body to be its lead investment promotion body. This is
   sometimes an investment regulatory body or a subunit of a ministry, such as commerce, but it is frequently
   a stand-alone investment promotion agency (IPA), which itself is a subcategory of IPI.


   As IPIs are not generally policymakers, their investment climate reform efforts fall into the category of policy
   advocacy, whereby they identify obstacles to competitiveness and support relevant decision-makers and
   stakeholders with the formulation and implementation of solutions.

                                               WHY IS INVESTOR TARGETING IN AGRIBUSINESS IMPORTANT?




   BOX 2. A PRIMER ON AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND THE ROLE OF FOREIGN
          COMPANIES


   The term agribusiness includes agriculture and all the businesses which directly depend on it. These
   businesses may be upstream (i.e. agricultural inputs), downstream (i.e. processing of agricultural outputs),
   or in support services for agriculture.


   Agriculture is the production of crops and rearing of livestock. In their broadest definitions, crops and
   livestock are used to include the products of forestry and fishing. The agricultural inputs needed are
   typically arable land, water, labor, seeds, fertilizer, pesticides and herbicides, equipment, machinery, breeder
   stock, animal feed, and access to natural resources, such as timber and fish. Although arable land, water,
   and labor can be increased to a degree, they are generally viewed as natural endowments and often present
   rural populations in developing countries with their most obvious economic resources. Other agricultural
   inputs may be present in developing countries, but they are often not of the quality needed or broadly
   available, severely hindering productivity and profits. For example, tradi tional seeds may not be high-
   yielding or possess the most marketable characteristics.


   Small companies in developing countries or their neighbors may produce these inputs in significant amounts,
   but foreign companies are often sought to provide the highest quality or most costly inputs, such as
   Monsanto seeds or John Deere combine harvesters. Such companies may limit initial investments in
   a country to a sales office, but this provides the country with greater access to inputs and the company
   with the opportunity to familiarize itself with the market and business environment. Foreign companies may
   eventually establish distribution centers, processing plants, research and development facilities, regional
   headquarters, or shared service centers, supporting the development of higher value-added agribusiness
   industries and, with them, better jobs and higher incomes.


   Support services for agriculture include warehousing, transportation, marketing, research and development,
   farmer training in the application of good agricultural practices (a.k.a. agricultural extension), machine
   operation and leasing, and veterinary services, among others. In more developed markets, many of these
   services are vertically integrated in large agribusiness companies like Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill,
   and Louis Dreyfus. In many developing countries, however, they tend to be highly fragmented, with the
   public sector attempting to fill many gaps. Ministries of agriculture, for example, may provide extension
   services and lead on research and development.
   In fact, the economic, social, and political importance of agriculture in many developing countries has made
   it a major focus of public policy. In terms of sectoral development, this has the useful consequence of
   focusing attention and resources, but it can also politicize the sector. Sound public policy is vital to the

     attraction of foreign companies, as it provides a transparent and predictable legal and regulatory
     framework for sector-critical issues such as access to land and environmental standards. Public agricultural
     policy can also have a major effect on the functioning of markets, for example through trade restrictions,
     regulation of commodity pricing, and financial regulations affecting the availability of financial services,
     such as crop insurance and agricultural loans.


     It is typically a shared goal of the public and private sectors that a country’s agricultural sector shift its
     balance of production and exports away from raw commodities to value-added products. These can include
     a very diverse set of products–including processed foods and beverages, footwear and fashion items,
     furniture, construction materials, rubber hoses and belts, animal feed, biofuels, and industrial oils and
     waxes–for markets as varied as retail consumers, automobile companies, and pharmaceutical companies.


     Countries without experience in these fields lack the capital, technology, skills, market knowledge, and
     international networks needed to effectively produce and market the products. The attraction of foreign
     investors with those resources is seen as one way to accelerate the domestic development of the same.

THE SPECIAL CHALLENGES OF INVESTOR TARGETING FOR AGRIBUSINESS

WHAT IT TAKES TO SUCCEED IN AN INVESTOR TARGETING PROJECT




     BOX 3. AVOIDING ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS: SEVEN PRINCIPLES OF RESPONSIBLE
     AGRICULTURAL INVESTMENT


     Typical E&S risks in agribusiness include labor abuses; occupational health and safety issues; resource
     depletion; environmental degradation; harm to the health, safety, and security of individuals and
     communities; land expropriation and population displacement; loss of biodiversity; threats to indigenous
     peoples; and harm to cultural heritage. An understanding of these risks and how to avoid them gives
     a project leader the opportunity to demonstrate a project’s sustainability. For a brief on environmental
     and social risks in agro-commodity supply chains, see Appendix 2.


     An important guide to avoid E&S risks in agribusiness is the seven Principles for Responsible Agricultural
     Investment (PRAI) developed jointly by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),
     the International Fund for Agricultural Development, the United Nations Conference on Trade and
     Development, and the World Bank Group. These are as follows:

            •	 Principle 1: Existing rights to land and associated natural resources are recognized and respected.
            •	 Principle 2: Investments do not jeopardize food security but rather strengthen it.
            •	 Principle 3: Processes relating to investment in agriculture are transparent, monitored, and ensure
               accountability by all stakeholders, within a proper business, legal, and regulatory environment.
            •	 Principle 4: All those materially affected are consulted, and agreements from consultations are
               recorded and enforced.
            •	 Principle 5: Investors ensure that projects respect the rule of law, reflect industry best practice, are
               viable economically, and result in durable shared value.
            •	 Principle 6: Investments generate desirable social and distributional impacts and do not increase
               vulnerability.
            •	 Principle 7: Environmental impacts of a project are quantified and measures taken to encourage
               sustainable resource use, while minimizing the risk/magnitude of negative impacts and mitigating
               them.


     These principles are embodied in IFC performance standards on environmental and social sustainability
     (see Appendix 4), as well as in the following IFC tools and resources for identifying and managing E&S risk
     in agro-commodity production.

                                               1.4 STAKEHOLDERS AND THEIR ROLES




   To be effective, a targeting campaign should be based on a thorough understanding of where and why
   investment is needed along a location’s value chain, a rough sense of the agribusiness subsectors where
   the location has comparative advantages, market dynamics in those subsectors, the stakeholders in those
   subsectors and the roles they might play in attracting and facilitating investment, and the resources
   available for targeting. The information collected at this stage will allow project leaders and clients to
   define the parameters of a targeting project, including its objectives, activities, monitoring and evaluation
   (M&E) framework, time frame, and budget requirements.


   In making these determinations, proper scoping for a targeting campaign inevitably casts light on
   weaknesses in both the investment climate and investment promotion capacity. In cases where
   short-term remedies are feasible and would significantly enhance the project’s success, the project
   leader may decide to expand the project’s scope to include investment climate reforms and investment
   promotion capacity-building.


   In fact, most Bank Group-supported targeting campaigns will be parts of much larger projects, with
   overlapping objectives, activities, and counterparts. In cases where investment climate reform is likely to be
   a part of the larger project, the scoping phase may benefit from an assessment of the legal and regulatory
   environment for FDI in agribusiness. This would look at factors such as investment incentives, local content
   requirements, entry conditions, import requirements, and access to export markets, among others.


   The steps described below should be integrated with scoping for the larger project, to make more efficient
   use of resources and to engage stakeholders more deeply from the outset.



   1.1	    Defining Viable Investment Promotion

     Efficiently sequencing targeting activities is
     important to minimize the overall timeline
     and produce results within a timeframe that
     is acceptable both to the client and to the
     organization delivering the technical assistance.
     And, one of the most important constraints on
     executing the project is the human resources
     available. Each project, client, and context may call
     for a different team to be deployed, with available
     expertise and manpower being two important
     variables. Levels of effort required can and will vary
     substantially between project situations.
     The enlistment of international and local
     consultants is almost always necessary to fill these
     gaps. Table 2 provides examples of the teams that
     were hired on Bank Group projects for investor
     targeting in agribusiness in Madagascar and
     Sierra Leone.

   This step, also called a “sector scan,” is the process by which the investor targeting team identifies the
   agribusiness subsectors with the balance of investment potential and anticipated development impact that
   makes them the best focus for the targeting campaign. Interviews with local sector stakeholders and
   (sub)sector-specific studies are the primary sources for information by which a long list of subsectors will be
   evaluated and ranked by their level of promise.


   This is basic investment promotion groundwork, which may already be in place before the targeting initiative.
   If so, Step 2 should be a simple validation of those priorities for investor targeting and a double check for
   E&S risk, particularly as it relates to each subsector and the geographic location. Wherever possible, the
   promotion team should avoid duplicating already existing sector studies. Where the priorities are found
   invalid or where this groundwork has not been done, the initiative should proceed with the sector scan in full.


   The full sector scan takes three inputs and processes them into a ranking of subsectors according to
   their promise for attracting investment with the desired impacts. The inputs are a long list of subsectors
   (determined in Step 1); information on the costs, opportunities, and challenges of each subsector; and the
   criteria by which the targeting team will evaluate the subsectors. In many cases, this process will lead to the
   identification of investment climate reforms needed to succeed in investor targeting.

 While much information can be obtained from
 existing subsector reports and interviews of
 stakeholders, some basic supplemental research
 may be needed to begin determining the current
 competitiveness of the location being promoted in
 the products of the subsector. To this end, trade and
 FDI flows are needed for the location being promoted
 and its competing locations, as well as for major
 export markets. The following are useful sources for
 such information globally:

 »» Trade flows: Trade Map (www.trademap.org),
    by products and countries, free to subscribers in
    developing countries.

 »» FDI projects: fDi Markets (www.fdimarkets.org), by

    BOX 4. THE BENEFITS OF BROAD STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT IN THE SECTOR SCAN


    The sector scan is useful for aligning stakeholder objectives, so that they can be mobilized for
    coordinated investment facilitation and advocacy of parallel reforms.


    Stakeholder endorsement of the subsector selection methodology and its results is an important
    output of this phase. A presentation on the methodology and its results should be shared and discussed
    with stakeholders.


    Such stakeholder presentations should include:
         •	 Background: Why investor outreach is needed

         •	 Subsector selection methodology (long-list, criteria, information sources, and so on.)

         •	 Summary of scores and selection results

         •	 Rationale for selection of each chosen subsector

         •	 Next steps (outreach campaign, reforms, and so on.) and requests for support

         •	 Specific project targets, such as the type, number, and value of investments; jobs created; value
            chain improvements; increase in exports; and so on.

    Using client logos and having the client convene validation workshops are useful ways to maximize
    client ownership.


    It should be emphasized that the sector scan is meant to produce priorities for investor outreach.
    It is not meant to replace the sector priorities of any other strategy such as those of ministries or
    development partners.

   While measures to facilitate access to land may
   be important for promoting new investment
   opportunities, they should be taken in accordance
   with the seven principles of responsible agricultural
   investment (see Box 3) and never supersede the
   rights and well-being of a location’s populace.
   Project leaders can get a picture of the Trade and
   Competitiveness Global Practice’s activities related
   to agricultural land in Appendix 3. Several other
   land-related tools are available with this guide,
   including:

   There are three core components to campaign
   preparation: the development of marketing
   messages and materials, setting campaign
   parameters, and securing cooperation from
   partners and stakeholders.




   3.1	    Developing marketing messages
   	       and materials


   The sector scan produced extensive and detailed
   information on the state of various subsectors.
   This was the information by which the targeting
   team decided which subsectors to target. It is also
   the same information by which investors will make
   their location decisions. That knowledge needs to be
   transmitted from the targeting team to potential
   investors through a persuasive marketing message
   and effective promotional materials.


   The information needed is of four types (Figure 2).
   Solid subsector information serves as the foundation
   for an effective marketing message. From this,
   investor-specific needs are identified and matched
   to the solutions that a location has to offer.
   This builds toward proven results from other
   investors who have been satisfied with their
   experiences in the location.


   Table 8 presents further details of the information
   needed and offers sources for the targeting team to
   find them.

   BOX 5. A ROLE FOR INVESTMENT CONFERENCES IN TARGETING CAMPAIGNS


   An investor conference in the location being promoted can be a good way to kick off investor targeting
   campaigns in sectors for which there is already considerable international interest but little available
   information. Agriculture and agribusiness in a newly liberalized, rapidly emerging, or post-conflict
   developing country is likely to garner such interest. An investor conference might consist of two or three
   days of presentations on investment opportunities; discussions with high-level officials on investment
   climate reforms; networking with authorities, suppliers, joint venture partners, and business service
   providers; and a demonstration of new capacity for investment facilitation.


   However, WBG experience has shown investor conferences to have limited success in terms of
   generating real investment leads. This is often because of insufficient preparation to ensure that the
   appropriate decision-makers from the companies most likely to invest will attend and because of
   insufficient follow up to convert interest into action.


   It is possible to make such events successful, as with the Rwanda Tea and Horticulture Investor Forum
   in 2010, which generated a number of investments. However, they require a great deal of planning,
   preparation and follow up in order to get the most out of them, with the majority of the hard work
   going into the preparations (identification of competitive sectors and projects to promote, preparation
   of viable investment propositions, due diligence on investment opportunities, preparation of pitch
   materials, speeches and presentations, targeted identification of potential investors, plus all the
   logistics work, invitations, speakers, etc.) and in follow up (capitalizing on any investor interests
   identified, providing follow up information, encouraging and supporting site visits, etc.). Based on
   experiences in successful investor conferences elsewhere, it is strongly suggested that the investor
   conferences should be planned no less than six months after the planning work commences, and even
   this would be a tight timeline. It is also suggested to develop an active outreach capability after the
   event that experience suggests is most important in bringing in new investors and investment.

                                Stakeholder mobilization is
                                a balancing act. Too little
                                stakeholder involvement
                                and a targeting team may be

                                developing information, tools,

                                It can also give investors
                                the sense that the support
                                they would receive in
                                a location is limited to the
                                support given by the targeting

                                might be slowed by

                                needs a clear strategy,

   Ultimately, it is the responsibility of governments
   and their agencies to exercise care in approving or
   offering incentives to any investment transaction,
   however Bank Group project leaders have

   a responsibility to advise clients on this important
   issue and offer technical solutions. Bank Group
   project teams should urge clients to establish or
   strengthen systems for due diligence, offering
   technical advice on how to do so in conformity with
   international best practice. An effective system for
   due diligence is in the long-term interest of
   all parties.

   The first face-to-face pitch to an investor is arguably
   the most critical single hour of an investor targeting
   campaign. Ninety-nine percent of the effort goes
   into preparing for the meeting–figuring out the
   most competitive subsectors, identifying investors
   that are currently in a position to invest in the
   location, convincing investors to take a meeting,
   preparing a presentation that makes a sound case
   for investment based on the investor’s unique
   interests, and following up with the investors after
   the meeting. Along the way there is room to adjust
   the campaign’s priorities, activities, targets, team,
   and resources. However, the face-to-face meeting
   is typically a “do or die” moment, which hinges
   on sales skills that are not in the typical profile of
   government officials. If investors leave the meeting
   uninspired, they are unlikely to accept another
   meeting. The following are 10 tips for making the
   most of the opportunity:

     1. Go with a small team, as few as two people:                         (e.g. friendly, professional, deferential) to the apparent
     (1) a persuasive presenter that knows the location,                    preference of the investor. Some of these weaknesses
     subsectors, and individual investors as well as anybody,               may need much time to be resolved, but in the short-
     and (2) a note-taker that is capable of substituting                   term a presenter can adjust by playing to her strengths
     for the presenter. With many stakeholders supporting                   and adopting tools to mitigate weaknesses (e.g. cues
     the targeting initiative, there may be a temptation to                 from a partner that one is talking too much, using
     bring their representatives along, forming                             dinner meetings instead of boardroom presentations
     a delegation of half of dozen or even more people.                     when that appeals to the investor).
     While many of these people will be able to answer
     questions that others will not, they will rarely have                  4. Get the investor’s attention and hold it.
     a salesperson’s perspective and the net marginal value                 Following the principles of an effective marketing
     each adds to the team will be low. Too many people                     message, a presenter should open a presentation
     in the delegation may even be counter-productive as                    with a strong statement of the location’s value
     it deters the investor from engaging in conversation.                  proposition, to hook the audience. The presenter should

     many presenters to spend time talking about their                      about the investor, as well as about trends among the
     own organizations and what they do distract from the                   investor’s market, customers, competitors, and goods

     meeting is not about going through a PowerPoint                        an emotional element to any decision, even
     presentation, it is about getting the investor to agree                a business decision. Two executives faced with the
     to visit.                                                              same information may come to different conclusions.

     3. Be self-aware as a speaker. To make an effective                    individual’s role in the company, style of interaction
     pitch, individuals should be aware of their knowledge                  (e.g. personal decision-making style, level of formality),
     limitations and presentational weaknesses. When                        and personal likes and dislikes. The targeting team
     asked something they do not know, they should not                      should use the customer’s language, terminology, and
     try to evade the question but rather acknowledge                       perspective if at all possible when speaking. The pitch

     finding the requested information and sending it to                    rather “What your company is looking for and how
