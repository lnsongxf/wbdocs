SECTION A. PRESENTATION OF THE HEALTH SYSTEM AND HEALTH NEEDS

1.    Health Sector Objectives and Organization

1.       Since the crisis, the health sector has suffered from a lack of strategic leadership. From 2009 to
2014, there were four Ministers of Health appointed, The objectives of the National Health Strategy, which
ended in 2011, was informally extended with no interim strategy put in place. This resulted in a general
loss of direction in the sector and fragmentation of coordination and funding among partners. In the first
year after the elections and the placement of the new Government, the Ministry of Health went through a
period of transition. In March 2014, the Prime Minister was also appointed the Minister of Health. In that
past year, some key developments have taken place including the launch of the development of the new
health sector strategy and the revitalization of the International Health Partnership1 in Madagascar.

2.       As of March 2015, a new Minster of Health and Secretary General of the MOH have been appointed
with the key objectives of re-instilling strategic direction in the sector. The new Health Sector Strategy
(2015-2019) is awaiting final Government validation. There are six strategic axes2 and the estimated budget
needed when prioritizing maternal and child health interventions is estimated to be US$1.4 billion over the
next five years. The Ministry has also explicitly committed to a the development of a Universal Coverage
Strategy by the end calendar year 2015 with the first mission already having taken place. There are
important challenges in the overall budget envelope and the coordination of financing (much of it being
external financing) which should be addressed as they are key drivers to the success of the implementation
these strategies.

3.       The public health sector is organized in a pyramid structure, with four tiers of access to health
services (Figure 1). The system is organized around 112 health districts, which correspond to administrative
units referred to as Fivondronana, each representing approximately 100,000 inhabitants. Health services
can be accessed at four different levels: basic health centers (Centre de Santé de Base: CSB) I and II; district
referral hospitals (Centre Hospitalier de référence de District: CHRD) without surgery and with surgery;
regional referral hospitals (Centre Hospitalier de référence Régionale: CHRR); and university hospitals
(Centres Hospitaliers Universitaires: CHU) including specialized centers. Each health district typically
contains 10 to 25 primary care centers and a hospital. The districts are divided into service areas for



1 Prior to the crisis, in December 2008, the IHP+ Compact had been signed by the Government and 22 development
partners agreeing to overarching principles of coordination as a first step to a pooled financing approach. This was
unable to move forward due to the start of the political crisis in January 2009.
2 a) improving the geographical and financial access of the population to high-quality health interventions; b)
stimulating demand and use of services; c) equitable coverage and quality of health infrastructure; c) participation,
coordinated and efficient government, TFP, Civil Society, the Regional and Local Authorities (CTD) and the
community in the implementation and financing of health interventions; d) decentralization / devolution of the
health system; e) Improving the Health Information System, which requires the acquisition of reliable health data,
prompt and available to all stakeholders, reverse information, analysis of indicators for monitoring and evaluation
of results for the purpose of appropriate decision-making; f) the implementation of high impact interventions to
accelerate the reduction of maternal and infant mortality, reduce the prevalence of major communicable diseases
(HIV / AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis), those of neglected diseases and non-communicable diseases;

community health centers (CSB 1 and CSB 2). CSB1s are managed only by paramedical staff whereas
CSB2s are managed by a doctor and paramedical staff. In 2012, there were 3,074 functional CSBs and 150
CHRDs, including approximately 90 with surgical capacity (categorized as CHRD with surgery).

4.      The bottom 40% of the population access services at the CSB1 and CSBII levels (the population at
     th
the 4 quintile and under in Madagascar are considered poor given the high poverty rates in the country).
That said, almost 70 percent do not seek care when ill due to low quality of services and out-of pocket costs
on medical consumables and services, long geographic distances to health facilities, and drug stock-outs.
Higher level (tertiary care) facilities provide more primary care interventions than any other interventions
and they are only frequented by the richest quintile of the population. Interestingly, most interventions
delivered at that level are primary care interventions which points to an imbalance in the type of facility
and the types of interventions delivered there.

5.       Over the last decade, there has been increasing reliance on the private sector for health
service delivery (Table 1). Private health facilities fall into two categories: not-for-profit, managed by
faith-based groups or NGOs; and the for-profit health clinics, managed by private individuals. All not-for-
profit primary health centers are required to adhere to Ministry of Health (MoH) norms and regulations,
and must integrate their work programs into the district health planning.3 Between 2001 and 2010, the
number of CSB2’s in the private sector doubled and the number of private hospitals (CHD-2) almost tripled.

The private sector has been slowly gaining ground particularly in urban areas - with a consultation rates
among private physicians in these areas increasing from 16 % in 2005 to almost 20% in 2010.4

6.      In 2003, the National Health Accounts (NHA) estimated that public health providers accounted for
67 percent of all providers in terms of total health expenditures, versus 28 percent for private providers (5
percent were unidentified). The 2007 and 2010 NHAs do not separate providers into public and private, but
the number of financing agents indicates that after a relative increase in utilization of the public sector
between 2003 and 2007, the trend reversed in 2010. In addition, according to the 2010 NHA, nearly 58
percent of health expenditures can be attributed to the private financing5. With regards to out-of-pocket
expenditure (OOP) for health, 2013 NHA-lite data indicate that OOP is an 80% share of private financing
and 30% of total health expenditure.

7.       Risk-pooling mechanisms remain largely underdeveloped with the cost of most medical
consumables borne by patients through cost recovery. Though general revenue financing provides an
opportunity for implicit risk pooling and redistribution of resources, government resources are inadequate
to meet all the needs. And while risk pooling mechanisms provide an opportunity for financial protection
and more equitable distribution of resources, these mechanisms remain scarce in Madagascar.
Furthermore, private/voluntary health insurance is limited, as only a minority of the population is willing
and able to afford unsubsidized voluntary insurance given the small formal employment base. However,
international experience with community-based health insurance, which has existed in Madagascar for more
than ten years, suggests that such schemes can form part of a transition to a more universal health care
coverage system. But there are also shortcomings with community-based health insurance due to limited
incomes of community members and voluntary membership, which reduces the size of the risk pool.

2.      Recent trends in health outcomes
8.      Since the start of the political crisis in 2009, key social indicators declined dramatically and
Madagascar is now unlikely to meet any of the health MDGs. Between 2002 to 2008, Madagascar made
considerable progress on the social MDGs, and it seemed likely that the fourth MDG, on under-five

  However, it should be noted that it is not clear whether this increase is directly related to provision of health services
through the private sector or whether households are financing more out-of-pocket expenses in the public sector.

                                                                     Madagascar PER – Health |Section A

mortality, would be achieved—child health improved, and under-five mortality rates declined from 163 per
1,000 live births in 1997 to 72 per 1,000 live birth in 2008/096. Madagascar had also started to tackle some
persistent challenges, such as improving maternal health and reducing stunting among children caused by
chronic malnutrition. Since 2009, however, some key health outcomes have declined sharply; and since
2012, the rate of acute malnutrition in increases in some of the most food insecure regions of country has
risen by more than 50 percent. The prevalence of chronic malnutrition among children under five is one of
the highest in the world—53 percent are stunted7 (short for their age) and 5.8 percent are wasted (too thin
for their height).8 Maternal mortality ratios also have remained relatively high and stagnant over the last
ten years: from 469 per 100,000 live births in 2003 to 478 per 100,000 live births in 2012. In 2010, pregnant
women and children under five bore almost 40 percent of the total disease burden in the country.

9.       Madagascar’s epidemiological profile remains comparable to many low-income countries
with a high communicable disease burden, including neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), with the burden
of disease falling disproportionately on the poor. About 0.49 percent of all TB cases are Multidrug Resistant
TB (MDR-TB). Malaria is not as widespread as in most Sub-Saharan countries and its incidence has
declined over the past few years as a result of prevention activities, but there have been spikes in the number
of cases in recent years. Over the past decade, non-communicable diseases are increasing in the population,
resulting in a dual burden of disease which will tax an already fragile health system.

10.       There are persistently high total fertility (TFR) and population growth rates (4.6 births per
woman and 2.8 percent growth respectively) with significant variations by location and income
quintiles. For example, the TFR for rural areas is almost double that of the capital (5.2 versus 2.7 while
that for the poorest quintile is 2.5 times that of the richest. The percentage of adolescents having given
birth is almost 4 times higher for the poorest quintile than for the richest. Not surprisingly, the contraceptive
prevalence rate (modern methods) for the richest quintile is double that of the poorest and the unmet need
for contraception is 41 percent higher for the poorest quintile than the richest. While there has been a
significant increase in the utilization of family planning (from 18 percent in 2003/04 to 47 percent in 2012),
the significant unmet need and the inequitable availability of family planning services – as well as the non-
health related implications of continued high population growth highlighted – makes this a concerning
issue.


3.      The State of Health Service Delivery: Indicators and Equity
11.     Coverage of essential health services, especially key maternal and child health services, is very
low and has further deteriorated since the crisis. Access to quality prenatal and antenatal care is a
persistent and increasingly serious challenge, with only 38 percent of births taking place in a health center,
and of those, only 44 percent attended by skilled personnel.9 This is lower than the average in the

  The 2012 MDG Survey showed the child mortality rate to be 67 per 1000 live births. With the confidence intervals
noted in the survey, this is about the same rate as 2008/2009.

  Long-Term Anthropometric Study (2012). This is particularly concerning in that stunting compromises human
capital and has long-term negative impacts on productivity and resilience due to irreparable cognitive and physical
deficits.

developing world, where about 58 percent of all deliveries are attended by skilled health providers and more
than 50 percent of births taken place in health centers. Population policies aimed at reducing fertility by
encouraging family planning brought about a 15 percent increase in the use of modern methods of
contraception prior to 2009, but the contraceptive prevalence rate is still very low at 33 percent.

12.      Immunization coverage has also substantially decreased since the crisis. Immunization
coverage is one of the main predictors of the infant mortality rate and also it can be used as a proxy indicator
for the availability of primary health care in a country. According to the Demographic Household Survey
(DHS) 2008/2009, complete immunization coverage for children 12 to 23 months old in 2008 was 62
percent. Comparable data from the MDG survey in 2012 indicates a decrease in complete immunization
coverage to 51.1 percent in just four years. Furthermore, this downward trend is also confirmed by other
country-specific data sources. The regional MICS (2012)10 indicates a decrease in total immunization
coverage to about 33.4 percent in some of the poorest areas of the country. Routine data collected from
health facilities also confirms the drop with one of the greatest decreases seen in coverage of Bacillus
Calmette–Guérin (BCG vaccine for tuberculosis) over the last five years (Figure 2).

13.      Health Service Delivery is highly inequitable in Madagascar. In 2010, pregnant women and
children under five bore almost 40 percent of the total disease burden in the country. Looking at specific
outcomes such as child mortality, the bottom 40% of the population, bears most of the burden (Figure 3).
Similarly, key service delivery indicators such as skilled birth attendance are 40% lower among the poorest
two quintiles as compared to the richest quintile further highlighting the equity issues in accessing and
utilizing care (Figure 4).

   The Madagascar MICS4, funded by the World Bank and UNICEF, was carried in 2012 by the National Institute of Statistics in the southern part
of the country. The survey focused on four southern regions in Madagascar Androy, Anosy, Atsimo Andrefana, and Atsimo Atsinanana with a
representative sample of 2,897 households. The MICS collected data on household members, housing characteristics, information on women
between the age of 15-49 years and children under five.

14.     These trends are further confirmed by an equity analysis using results from the regional 2012 MICS
survey which covered five of the poorest regions in Madagascar shows that that maternal and child health
interventions such as antenatal care and immunization are reaching mostly higher quintiles of the
population.

15.     Inequitable health service delivery has two critical dimensions in the context of Madagascar: a)
affordability and b) accessibility.
         a)Affordability: Poor and unequal health outcomes find their root in disparities in terms of
         household income. Out-of pocket costs for service delivery have risen as greater numbers of
         households are falling deeper into poverty resulting in a population that is more vulnerable and a
         greater risk of falling and staying in poverty by paying for health services. The 2012 MDG Survey
         found that financial barriers and distance are key constraints in accessing quality health care. With
         the exception of the cost of prescriptions, primary care services are delivered free-of-charge at
         facility level, yet in practice, the use of health services also entails high out-of-pocket costs such as
         for supplies, medical consumables, and transportation.



                                                          11
                                                                   Madagascar PER – Health |Section A

        In an effort to address some of the issues around financial barriers in accessing health services, a
        Health Equity Fund was created by the Government to provide drugs free-of charge to the poorest.
        Under the cost-recovery mechanism, called “FANOME”, at the health center level, a small
        percentage of funds (from the sale of drugs) is placed in an equity fund designed to provide free
        access to medicines for the most vulnerable population without adding burden to the health budget.
        By design, its solvency is directly tied to the population’s utili zation rate of health centers. There
        are large variations in the financial sustainability of equity funds, even within a district, and the
        overall coverage is very low. However, financial sustainability is not the biggest challenge to the
        effectiveness of the equity fund; in fact, funds are underutilized because targeting of eligible
        individuals is very difficult and linked to cultural nuances around being targeted as a poor person.
        b) Accessibility: Geographic barriers exist and are likely getting worse. Numerous communities
        are seasonally isolated for months at a time, leaving entire populations – not only the poor – with
        little access to health centers. Even those isolated communities with a health center suffer during
        the rainy season, since referrals to hospitals are impossible, replenishment of drugs is slower, and
        supervisory visits are virtually non-existent. Prior to the crisis, the WHO reported that only 60% of
        the Malagasy population had access to health facilities. By 2013, approximately 856 primary health
        care facilities (CSB1s), most accessed by the poor, had closed down due to the impacts of the crisis.
        In addition, nearly 78 percent do not have the ability to transport patients to hospitals for further
        treatment. The issue challenge geographic access is particularly concerning given the links to
        maternal mortality and morbidity outcomes.
16.      Human Resource Allocation and Organization is also not equitable. According to the NHA
(2010), there are approximately 2 doctors per 10,000 people in Madagascar. There are three times more
doctors in urban areas than in rural areas. In the public sector, the highest concentration of doctors is in
urban centers in Antananarivo province. On average, a public health center in urban area has twelve
employees out of which three are doctors and an additional five are medically trained staff. On the other
hand, public rural centers are staffed on average with only two people of which there may or may not be a
doctor. Efforts to recruit general practitioners and nurses to work in rural areas has had limited success and
there has been a reduction of 50 percent in the number of midwives between 2007 and 20011. In addition,
the ratio of nurses/midwives compared with physicians is very low (range between 1.9-2.0 between 2007
and 2011). Data from the MOH indicate approximately 640 rural health facilities have closed since 2007
due to a lack of personnel. Of the CSBs that are functional, over 30% are not compliant with staff
requirements as set by the Ministry. An added issue is that nearly 50 percent of public health sector staff
is over 50 years old and will retire in less than ten years. Current health sector human resource policies do
not address this future constraint to service delivery.

17.      The quality of health service delivery is low, especially in rural parts of the country. While
there are many services and system components that suffer from poor quality, health service delivery at
primary care levels can be quantified around a few key indicators and these reflect major health system
issues in Madagascar:
         a) Provider performance in compliance with diagnostic procedures is low: Observations of
         consultations found very few medical professionals, 15 percent, followed the correct protocol of
         consultations and recorded all the basic information relating to the children under five. This was
         also true for antenatal care consultations where only 18 percent of medical professionals followed
         consultation protocol.
         b) Supervision and monitoring functions, especially at lower levels, are weak: there is large
         variation in supervision across urban/rural and geographic regions with urban centers better

                                                      12
                                                                        Madagascar PER – Health |Section A

       supervised than rural centers. Level 2 district hospitals are supervised regularly (96 percent), while
       basic health facilities are the least supervised (63 percent).
       c) Limited availability of key supply side inputs: More than 66 percent of health facilities reported
       at least one essential medicine was not available at the time of the health facility survey. The
       duration for essential medical stock-out is as high as ninety days.


                                                   Key Findings
Since the start of the political and economic crisis in 2009, progress made on key health indicators has stagnated
or is being reversed with Madagascar falling off track to achieve the MDGs. The prevalence of chronic
malnutrition among children under five is one of the highest in the world. Maternal mortality ratios also have
remained relatively high and stagnant over the last ten years and the country.

Contextual weaknesses
       Madagascar’s epidemiological profile remains comparable to many low-income countries with a high
        communicable disease burden. Almost 30 percent of all deaths in Madagascar are still attributable to
        preventable and infectious and parasitic diseases
   The system is plagued by inequitable health service delivery. The two critical dimensions are:

        Affordability: As greater numbers of people have fallen into poverty, there have been two likely
        implications on the population: i) the poor are more vulnerable and have a greater risk of falling and
        staying in poverty by paying for health services and ii) less of the population is seeking health services
        due to an inability to pay.
       Accessibility: Numerous communities are seasonally isolated for months at a time, leaving entire
        populations – not only the poor – with little access to health centers. In addition there are major inequities
        in HRH distribution with the greatest negative impact on the poor who access first level primary care
        facilities. An added issue is that nearly 50 percent of public health sector staff is over 50 years old and will
        retire in less than ten years. Current health sector human resource policies do not address this future
        constraint to service delivery.
Structural weaknesses
     The quality of health service delivery is low, especially in rural parts of the country. Critical challenges
        include: (a) weak provider compliance with diagnostic procedures; (b) weak supervision and monitoring
        functions; and (c) lack of availability of key supply-side inputs.
     High-out of pocket costs and scarcity of risk pooling mechanisms make it difficult for the poor to access
        care
Policy implications
There are several short and medium recommendations that Madagascar should consider implementing as a matter
of priority:
   I.     Promote equitable access to health services with a focus on delivering an essential package of high,
          impact maternal and child health and nutrition interventions in rural areas through tailored strategies
          that remove key barriers to access and stimulate demand and utilization of services.
       Address financial barriers to access
          - Remove out-of pocket costs for services at facility level
          - Strengthen risk-pooling and safety-net mechanisms such as the Health Equity Fund, fee exemption
               schemes for services and medicines and community health insurance.

         Address geographic barriers to access
          - Finance existing outreach activities and approaches especially in rural areas. This includes training
             and deploying community health workers and expanding initiatives like Stratagie Avancee which
             bring services into communities. Focusing at this level can promote resilience in service delivery.
          - Prioritize and invest in functionality of first level rural health facilities.
II.       Improve the quality of health services
         Ensure availability of essential commodities and drugs at the primary level, as well as investment in
          upkeep and maintenance of health facilities, especially in rural areas.
         Invest in supervision and monitoring at lower levels. This includes training and capacity building for
          better management.
         Strengthen relevant plans to inform priority actions for improving quality to complement the National
          Health Sector Strategy:
          - Update and implement the National Human Resources Development Plan (short, medium and longer
               term actions)
          - Develop and implement standardized “Norms and Standards” for all types of health facilities at all
               levels
          - Develop and implement a National Quality Plan.

18.     Madagascar spends less on health than three quarters of the SSA LIC countries. Since 1995,
the percentage of Total Health Expenditure (THE) in GDP has remained around 4-5 percent with a slight
downward trend in recent years. On average, Madagascar spent, 4.3 percent of its GDP on health between
2009 and 2012, compared to 4.8 percent in the four years preceding the crisis (2005-2008).12 This was the
reverse of the trend observed in other SSA countries. (Figure 3). In real terms THE per capita expenditure
has not changed since 1995. Looking at the period between 1995 and 1999 THE per capita was US$21. In
the period between 2010 and 2014, Madagascar’s THE per capita was US$20. This is comparable with
other LICs in SSA but far below the regional average of US$8313.

   This section rests on data from the WHOs Global Health Expenditure Data (GHED). Although WHO’s GHED is
based on NHA exercises, there are some notable discrepancies between the two sets of data that could not be explained
but are likely due to differences in the WHO methodology to create internationally comparable data. The GHED
numbers have the advantage of being comparable across countries and require government clearance before
publication.
12
   The national NHA reports present a different picture with THE at 5.6 % of GDP in 2010, up from 4.2% in 2007 and
from 3.2% in 2003. The raw NHA data that was used for the different NHA exercises could not be obtained so the
source of the discrepancy with the WHO data could not be identified.

2.          Total public financing sources and their evolution since 2009


                       Box 1. Methodological Issues: Accounting for External Funding
  Since 2009, the AMP, managed by the GoM (Primature) records actual disbursements from all bilateral and
  multilateral agencies, decentralized cooperation entities from France, and the bulk of international NGOs, including
  direct funding by foundations.

  Although data prior to 2009 are available for government accounts (MoF/SIGFP), they could not be used to identify
  the shares of internal and external financing of public expenditure because significant differences were found
  between on-budget disbursements of foreign aid directed to health and externally financed expenditures in the
  SIGFP for 2009-2013. In fact, hardly any on-budget foreign aid was included in executed expenditure, as revealed
  by the following ratios of disbursed foreign aid marked “on-budget” in the AMP to externally funded expenditures
  in SIGFP:
                                                      2009           2010           2011          2012        2013(a)

      (b)
          Final and initial budget appropriations were equal for the PIP in the SIGFP for health.


19.      Between 2009 and 2013, total public expenditures in health increased due to large off-budget
external support. There are significant constraints in assessing the total amounts of public financing to
health, owning to the poor accounting of external funding in the Integrated Public Finance Management
System (SIGFP) (Box 1). For the purpose of this PER, the total funding directed to health, including
domestic, on-budget and off-budget foreign aid, was reconstituted using alternate government sources.14
The analysis shows that health funding continued to increase after the crisis, by about 16 percent a year
between 2009 and 2013. The sector received exceptionally high amounts of public funding in 2010, owing
to large off-budget external support. Directly resulting in public financing to health going from 2.8 to 3.7
percent of GDP between 2009 and 2013, with a peak at 4.6 percent in 2010 (Table 2).

  Internal resources (RPI) were evaluated using data from SIGFP, while external institutional resources were assessed
using the AMP. In 2006, the MFB introduced SIGFP, a modern computerized integrated financial management system
to process budget execution and accounting operations across all institutions of the government.

20.     In fact, between 2009 and 2013, 80 percent of public funding to the health sector was financed
through external funds (Table 3). On the basis of the data available on the Aid Management Platform
(AMP), it is estimated that the share of external funding in public financing to health varied from 88 percent
in 2010 to 83 percent in 2013. During this period, external funds amounted to US$164 million on average
(Ar 410 billion).

21.      The extremely low share of domestic funding to the sector poses serious concerns in terms of
sustainability, ownership and efficiency of existing resources. Over the last five years, domestic funding
of health increased in amount, but its share in total public funds to the sector remained at around 20 percent.
This is low compared with other countries, and certainly very low compared with other sectors in
Madagascar. For instance, the share of domestic funding in education varied between 75 and 80 percent
over the same period (Figure 5). The over-reliance on external funding is a serious concern for the
sustainability of funding to the sector, especially given the volatility of aid in fragile contexts. It also
potentially raises issues in terms of alignment, harmonization and overall efficiency, given the high volume
of external aid provided off-budget and the absence of alignment around a new health strategy that would
facilitate the alignment and harmonization of funding.

B.2. Government Health Expenditures

     1. General government expenditures allocated to health: international comparisons15


22.      Total Government Health Expenditure to the health sector as a share of GDP decreased
sharply after 2007, but the share of government budget allocated to health remained broadly in line
with regional averages. GoM spent 2.5 percent of GDP and 12.8 percent of its executed budget on health
in 2012, which is roughly on par with averages of SSA and low-income countries (LICs). From 1995 to
2007, the country consistently devoted a larger than average share of its budget to health, and stayed close
to the SSA average in terms of share of GDP. The period after 2007, however, has been marked by a sharp
decrease in health funding as a percentage of GDP, reflecting lower overall government expenditures, and
resulting in health expenditures relative to GDP falling to below the SSA (Figure 6).

15
   Internationally comparable data produced by the WHO give the relative magnitudes of general government
expenditures on health both in percentage of GDP and in percentage of the budget for most countries since 1995. The
figures cover all health expenditures that go through the public administration, including expenditures managed
outside of the MoH. This is the only source of data on general government health expenditure. Indeed, data obtained
from the MoF for health did not include other health expenditures than those in the Health “mission”. However, it is
unclear if externally funded expenditures t hat end up not going through the SIGFP are included in WHO’s G HED
numbers and from the reconstitution performed for this PER, it would appear that it is not the case, leading to
underestimating total funding to health in the WHO data.

2.                     Executed expenditures by the Ministry of Health, recent trends16


23.      Public expenditures for health decreased by 31 percent over 2007-2013, due mainly to a drop
in on-budget external funding channeled to MoH. Total expenditure by the MoH (externally and
internally funded) decreased from 229 billion Ar in 2006 to 158 billion Ar in 2013.17,18 This decrease was
entirely due to the contraction of investment financing from external aid. Even though internally financed
health expenditures, in real terms, nearly doubled over the period, this was not enough to compensate for
the 95 percent drop in externally financed health expenditure (Figure 7). Although, according to
Government accounting, more than half of MoH expenditures had been financed by external grants and
loans in 2006 (before SIGFP was in place), externally financed expenditures dropped to less than 5 percent
in 2013.19

24.     Overall, when looking only at domestic spending, the share of MoH spending in total
government spending has remained the same since 2006. The GoM devoted 6.25 percent of internally
financed expenditures to health in 2013, and this allocation had remained relatively stable, in the 6-8 percent

16
   The raw data was provided by the MFB; it is extracted from the SIGFP for 2009-2013 and reconstituted in the same
format for 2006 and 2008 (when the SIGFP was not operational). Throughout the document, executed expenditures
are taken at the mandatement level, which corresponds to the formal clearance before going for payment to the
treasury. Although they cannot be compared to other countries, these figures have the advantage of relying on primary
data and provide a time consistent series up to and including 2013.
17
   Given the changes in responsibilities of the ministry over time, the figures only include expenses in the programs
related to health (i.e., the social protection and population components of the ministry in 2008 and 2009 are excluded).
This will be the case throughout the report when looking at MoH expenditures.
18
   The figures calculated from government accounts excluding external funding are based on expenditures financed
by RPI. They exclude external grants and loans (most of investment expenditure) but includes budget support (budget
support can be identified in 2006 but was added to RPI for comparability with later years).
19
   The contraction of external funding depicted here probably reflects the overall increase in off-budget external
support, but it may also be the result in inaccuracies in the way externally financed expenditures go (or do not go)
through the SIGFP. Therefore, caution is required when interpreted the apparent drop in MoH- executed expenditures.
                                                                             19

range, since 2006 (Figure 8). This result is robust across the different budget categories, except for the share
of MoH in civil servant wages, which increased from 8.5 to 10 percent of the civil servant wage bill between
2006 and 2010. The stagnating share of health in Government expenditures could be a signal of sluggish
political commitment to health, but since we have been considering executed expenditures rather than
budget appropriations, it could also be the result of weak execution of the budget.

B.3. Budget Execution

 1. Execution rates
25.     Some factors need to be taken into consideration when interpreting execution rates. Normally,
comparing budget appropriations to executed expenditures can be a way to assess planning and governance
capacity at the line ministry level, as well as the general quality of governance in budget management. For
Madagascar, several issues need to be considered before interpreting execution rates. First, executed
expenditures recorded in the SIGFP may not fully account for all realized expenditures. This could lead to
the over- or underestimation of execution rates, depending on the performance of expenditures not recorded
(or recorded differently) in the SIGFP. Second, various blockages in the budget exist that may prevent
ministries from using budgeted funds that would otherwise be committed. These blockages should not
necessarily be attributed to a lack of capacity in terms of budget execution, but rather to the need to improve
overall management of the budget, in particular cash flows.
26.      There is a lack of clarity regarding on the inclusion/exclusion of foreign aid managed by the
Government. Differences between budget appropriations and expenditures could, in large part, be
attributed to the way externally financed investment expenditures are recorded in the government budget.
Disbursements of foreign aid marked on-budget in the Aid Management Platform are much higher than of
externally financed health expenditures in SIGFP (Table 3). This can lead to an underestimation of
execution rates, as some expenditures related to externally funded projects may not be included in the

government accounts at the stage of execution but are still included in budget appropriations.20
Documentation setting out the rules regarding inclusion/exclusion of foreign aid managed by the
Government would be necessary to allow for better tracking of investments and to analyze execution rates
more precisely. This is particularly true of investment expenditures, which, for the most part, are financed
by foreign aid and therefore not fully included in the SIGFP. Therefore, it is important to separate the
current and investment budgets in the analysis of budget execution.

27.      Rules related to the execution of the budget may prevent full execution, especially for non-
wage expenditure; most notably the case for regulation rates imposed by MoF. Operational budgets
financed by internal resources are subject to quarterly regulation rates—a maximum percentage of
appropriations that can be committed by the end of each quarter—the fourth quarter rate normally being
100 percent. Civil servant salaries are subject to a linear regulation, i.e., 25, 50, 75 and 100 percent, but the
quarterly percentages for other expenses in the operational budget, including indemnities, are subject to a
non-linear schedule that can be changed during the year. For 2013 these rates were: 8.8, 52.1, 67.2, and
100 percent. However, at the end of September 2013, the fourth quarter regulation rate was changed to 53
percent (Arrêté 29109/2013). The fluctuations around regulation rates are largely out of the control of the
MOH. This can be due to issues like other government priorities taking precedence or a reduction in the
liquidity of the state’s revenue.



                                         Box 2. Budget Rectification
 Budget allocations within broad categories are generally modified mid-year to accommodate requested transfers of
 credits. A new Finance Law is not necessary if these changes follow certain criteria. Beginning every May, program
 organizers and coordinators can request modifications to the SIGFP to move credits. These requests need to be
 approved by the Ministry of Finance and Budget and published by decree before they are effective in the SIGFP.
 Rules differ depending on whether the transfer is (a) across programs in the same ministry; (b) across programs of
 different ministries; or (c) within programs. The procedure is simplified when changes are within programs,
 although the changes still needs to be published by decree. It is from the Law that, for operational expenses,
 whatever the nature of the modification requested, the total amount in each economic category (indemnities, goods
 and services, transfers) cannot be changed. Regulations and procedures concerning modifications are delineated in

   Another issues identified in the course of this PER is related to the payment of Value Added Taxes (VAT) which
are paid by some externally funded projects and subsequently reimbursed by the Government. It is not clear exactly
where these provisions appear in the budget, but they seem to be included in the SIGFP procedure and provisions, and
need to be made as part of the budget process to pay for these liabilities. Due to lack of predictability regarding the
total amount of these expenditures, there would appear to be some blockages. Unfortunately, the data obtained for
this PER is not sufficient to determine the magnitude of the problem.

 MFB circulaires. Any change across categories requires a rectification of the Finance Law. (Restrictions, however,
 do not apply to externally financed credits, in particular for the investment budget.)
 In years when the Finance Law is not rectified (has happened in all years except 2008 and 2010), there may be
 differences between total appropriations initially granted to a line ministry and final appropriations, but there should
 be no difference by broad category (transfers, goods and services, indemnities) for operational expenditures.
 Based on past budget data—especially the data from 2010—it is clear that broad allocation changes are often made
 to initial budget appropriations. The table below gives the ratio of modified to initial budget appropriations for
 health and for the non-financial general budget. The differences could be due to the reduction in budgetary aid,
 especially since such financing appears as internal financing in the budget, as mentioned above, and cannot be
 identified separately. Because of this issue, caution needs to be used in interpreting execution rates. If international
 budget support is included as domestic financing and may be increased or reduced after the rectification of the
 budget, final appropriations can no longer be used as benchmarks to calculate execution rates, and the health sector
 cannot be identified as a net loser or a net gainer in the budget rectification process overall. Taking the above into
 consideration, the health sector was a net beneficiary in 2006 (but only due to additional external funding), 2009
 and 2013 and a net loser in 2011 and 2012. The magnitude of these gains/losses was small overall, except in 2013,
 when it reached seven percent of the internally financed budget.

28.      On the other hand, budget reallocation and rectification may lead to overestimating the
capacity of the Ministry to execute according to plans (Box 2). The observed effective fungibility
between allocations and expenses across different sub-administrations and across programs is likely to
increase execution rates for total expenditures, but significantly reduce the ability to track expenditures by
function or at the program level. While it may be difficult to appreciate the magnitude of the problem and
its impact on allocation and execution, these issues need to be taken into account when evaluating resource
allocations by function at the executed level.

Execution of the health budget
29.      The budget execution rates of the MoH remain low for non-wage expenditures (Table 4).21
Execution for the internally financed part of the MoH budget was lower than for the overall internally
funded government budget in the last two years (2011-2013). In particular, non-wage current operations
performed poorly. This was likely due to the reduction in the final regulation rate, which limited spending
to half of what was allocated (Box 3), indicating that the restriction was binding for the MoH. In fact, the
MoH requested more in September 2013 but could only obtain a final rate of 53.54 percent. Given the
caveats raised above about the accounting of foreign aid in government accounts, it is not possible with the
information obtained to interpret execution rates for the externally financed investment program.

30.      Execution rates for non-wage recurrent expenditure have not been equal across MoH
programs, especially in 2011 and 2013 (Table 6). Execution for medical supplies and medicines and for
the maternal and child health program has been consistently above 90 percent. There is no clear pattern
across years for the other programs, which had execution rates as low as 53 and 45 percent in primary health
services and specific disease programs, likely indicating that these two areas suffered most from the final
cut in the regulation rate.

2.      Deconcentration of MoH expenditure

31.     The level at which expenditures are administered can impact the overall performance of budget
execution. Importantly, deconcentration of expenditures can improve the efficiency of budget execution,
allowing a closer connection between administrative and operational units. But, increased deconcentration
requires additional capacity at the lower levels, as well as strengthened communication between various
actors along the expenditure chain. Box 3 provides the background necessary to understand how
deconcentration can be measured in government accounts.


              Box 3. Measuring the Deconcentration of Health Expenditure Using SIGFP
 After independence in 1960, Madagascar’s national health system was highly centralized, following the French
 administrative model. The Constitution laid the groundwork for decentralization by outlining a local service delivery
 structure, after which the MoH and other sector ministries began to shift limited decision-making power towards
 lower levels of government. This was not a true decentralization, but rather a deconcentration of spending, given
 that these lower-level structures had little discretion in the allocation and management of resources. Nonetheless, in
 an effort to improve public resource management and strengthen public service delivery, the Government introduced
 22 regions (doing away with 6 provinces) and progressively integrated the administration’s deconcentrated technical
 services under the authority of the regional Chiefs, with the objective of harmonizing all sector activities in each
 region through integrated regional development plans. In 2008, for the first time, resources were allocated to the
 regions, making them responsible for the implementation of a small part of the investment budget.
 The health delivery system is aligned with the country’s administrative structure and includes central, regional and
 district levels. Each level has defined roles and responsibilities. The central level provides strategic direction, defines
 policies in the sector and oversees national coordination of sector activities. The Regional Departments of Health
 coordinate implementation of national health policy in the region, and provide technical assistance to the districts.
 The District Health Authorities provide health services through the district hospitals and health centers.
 Some information can be inferred about deconcentration of public expenditures by looking at the level at which they
 are mandated in government accounts (SIGFP). The following levels of administration relevant to the sector are
 coded in SIGFP: the central level (Ministry), the 6 ex-provinces, the 22 regions, the 113 districts, and the public
 health facilities when they directly manage funds. Regular salaries are paid at the level of the 6 provincial general
 treasuries (plus the central level for MoH personnel), and investment expenditures are 96-99 percent centralized.
 This leaves non-wages expenditures to examine, representing only 20 percent of total MoH expenditures.

32.     The central level managed between 50 and 70 percent of current non-wage expenditures
during the 2006-2013 period, with no clear trend toward de-concentration except at the level of some
operational units. Figure 9 represents the relative weight of different levels of administration in mandating
expenses.22 The figure clearly shows an increase in the share of expenses managed at the operational level.
If we exclude the 2006 data (the lower volume of transfers to public entities in 2006 indicate that transfers
to hospitals may have been included in a different account), the figure does not show a clear trend toward
decentralization, with the share of central level expenditure decreasing between 2008 and 2011 and then
increasing again to reach 57 percent in 2013, a level slightly higher than in 2011. The last two years also
show a reduction in the share of non-wage current expenditures managed at the district level. In addition,
the share of expenses that could potentially be deconcentrated has gone down sharply, from over 20 percent
to 13 percent in 2013.

33.      But, increased deconcentration requires additional capacity at the lower levels, as well as
strengthened communication between various actors along the expenditure chain as illustrated by the results
of a recent rapid assessment on the flow of immunization resources to districts health centers (Box 4).


                          Box 4. Subnational Financing Bottlenecks on Vaccination
In an effort to better understand the financial flows and utilization of funds for immunization from central to
decentralized levels, the Ministry of Health led a rapid assessment exercise in 2014. The aim of the study,
implemented by UNICEF and the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar, was to diagnose the barriers and bottlenecks to
the timely flow, appropriate use, and reliable tracking of financial resources for immunization from the national to
all subnational levels. The main findings and recommendations are summarized in this text box.

Study objectives and coverage
This rapid assessment focuses on four main areas of potential bottlenecks for financial flows:



22
  Operational Units (SOAs) labeled as CH2, CHRR and CHU are considered as management at the health facility
level and assigned to the operational unit level. SOAs labeled CH1 and CSB are included in the district level.

                                                                         Madagascar PER – Health |Section B

(i) the approach seeks to generate information on delays in receipt of Routine Immunization (RI) and health funds at
each sub-national administrative level, relative to the start of the fiscal year
(ii) the assessment of fund diversion by the transferring administrative level is examined, as well as other factors
that reduce the actual amount of funds received by the subnational level compared to the amount of funds expected
by that level, according to its approved health and immunization budgets
(iii) each administrative level is examined to assess the scope and causes for any reallocations of funds planned for
RI spending,
(iv) problems with systems and capacities for accurate tracking of the receipt and use of immunization and health
funds from donors and domestic sources are assessed.

This study selected 10 out of 22 regions in Madagascar. In each region, one ‘strong’ EPI performer district and one
‘weak’ EPI performer district were selected, and within each of the districts four health centers (two ‘strong’ and
two ‘weak’ performers) were selected using DTP3 coverage rates. Given that numerous health centers lack copies
of reports and files, and subsequently, are missing data on the funds allocated to them, only 42 health centers out
of 80 planned were considered for the assessment of financial flows.

Findings
Main results show that the regional and district health teams manage most of the public funding for health that is
allocated to their respective levels. The district is responsible for distributing funding equitably among health
centers. The district considers the type of health center (HC1 or HC2), total catchment population, geographic
accessibility and health center needs in their allocation process.
The regional health team receives funds for operational costs directly into its bank account. The district health team
receives funds for the districts operational costs and the health center operations in their jurisdiction. Health centers
do not have financial management responsibilities. Most disbursements to CSBs (and even to some districts) are
made in cash, as there are no government-approved banks nearby that are authorized to accept and disburse funds
from government accounts. This creates substantial problems with tracking use of funds, and hinders the ability
of managers to ensure compliance with approved health plans and budgets.

The study was able to identify the major sources of immunization funding at the national, regional and district
level. However, financing details at the health center level were difficult to assess due to lack of data, archives or
copies of reports to cite sources. Overall, Madagascar is heavily dependent on partners and donors for immunization
funds with 92% of Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) coming from technical and financial partners. At the
district level, a little more than half (54.73%) of the total funds received by the district are used for immunization
activities of which 24% comes from the state and 61.9% from technical and financial partners. Additionally, for a
good number of districts, the amount received is greater than the amount planned (budgeted) and requested from
partners outside of the activities of the Annual work plan (AWP) (46.8%).

Delays in allocation of funds compared to the schedules of activities were identified and are mostly due to the
multiplicity and cumbersome procedures of donors and complexity of banking procedures. Delays had an impact on
utilization rates, which were lower due to delays in credit allocation. The utilization rate is about 35.1% at the level
of the regional directorate of health and 41.9% at the level of the district. The second and third quarters are the only
periods during which public funds can be used and vaccination activities funded by the government are implemented
during these quarters. Thus, a large part of the public funds are prevented from being utilized in full and on time.
Furthermore, delays caused some implementation bottlenecks at the district and health center level. At the district
level, the date on which information for reports is sent can cause delays in the date on which funds are received. For
health centers, the date funds are received overlapped with the planned date for implementation of activities
causing a delay in activities.

The results also indicated that the number of monitoring and evaluation supervisory visits and financial
management checks vary largely with regional health directorates, districts or health centers, and in some cases are

not sufficient to ensure good management of funds. These oversight activities are generally integrated with other
objectives of a supervisor’s visit, and may benefit from more explicit and systematic attention.

Recommendations
The findings were by the MoH, development partners and health managers from all administrative levels in late
2014. Main results of the review were:
1. Investment in maintaining health system records and archives is important for improving the availability and
    quality of data on financial flows for immunization. This would include making the health centre manager
    accountable for record-keeping. Community surveys can also contribute to validating data on immunization
    financing.
2. Budgetary reviews at every level are necessary for contrasting rates of expenditures between cost centres. In
    some instances, budgetary controls (spending limits) e.g. in the first two trimesters may be warranted.
3. Investment in bottom-up planning would strengthen the approximation of budgets with planned activities.
    Methods for ensuring compliance to activities and timelines of the annual work plans would also limit the
    number of off-budget activities.
4. Coordination between the central government and donors and development partners is essential. The aim is
    to better guarantee timely funding for the implementation of activities contained in the annual work plan of
    districts and CSBs.

This analysis is being used by the government and its partners to identify practical approaches to help prioritize and
overcome major financial bottlenecks that constrain achieving equitable and universal immunization coverage.

                                               Key Findings
Madagascar’s heath sector is not adequately funded and has a very constrained budget envelope, The public
health sector is also largely externally financed with domestic financing very low and unstable.
Level of spending for health
 Madagascar spends now less on health than three quarters of the SSA countries. Since, the percentage of
   Total Health Expenditure (THE) in GDP has been around 4-5 percent with a downward trend in the period
   2009-2012 compared to 2005-2008.
 In real terms THE per capita expenditure has not changed since 1995. Looking at the period between
   1995 and 1999 THE per capita was US$21. In the period between 2010 and 2014, Madagascar’s THE
   per capita was US$20.
 Between 2009 and 2013, 80 percent of public funding to the health sector was financed through external
   funds. However, except for a large off-budget external investment in 2010, overall external financing
   drastically decreased between 2009 and 2012.
 The extremely low share of domestic funding to the sector (20%) is low compared with other countries,
   and certainly very low compared with other sectors in Madagascar. This poses serious concerns for
   sustainability, ownership and efficiency of existing resources.
Budget Execution
   There is lack of clarity between budget appropriations and expenditures due to the different ways in which
    externally financed investment expenditures are recorded in the government budget under the SIGFP and
    the Management Aid Platform.
   Expenditure by the Ministry of Health decreased by 31 percent over 2007-2013, due the contraction of
    investment financing from external resources, channeled through MoH.
   Rules related to the execution of the budget may prevent full execution, especially for non-wage
    expenditure; this is notably the case for regulation rates imposed by MoF. The final yearly cuts in
    regulation rates have negatively impacted the execution rates of some programs more than others, namely
    primary health services and specific disease programs
   Despite some inconsistent improvement over the last four years, the budget execution rates of the MoH
    remain low for non-wage expenditures.
   When looking only at internally financed spending, the share of MoH spending in total government
    spending has stagnated at about 6%-8% since 2006. This result is robust across the different budget
    categories, except for the share of MoH in civil servant wages, which increased from 8.5 to 10 percent
    of the civil servant wage bill between 2006 and 2010.
Lack of de-concentration of resources
   Budget execution is highly centralized. Between 2006-2013, the central level managed between 50 and
    70 percent of current non-wage expenditures with no clear trend toward de-concentration despite a tiered
    management and service delivery system down to primary care level.
   Since 2011, there has been a reduction in the share of non-wage current expenditures managed at the
    district level. In addition, the share of expenses that could potentially be de-concentrated has gone down
    sharply, from over 20 percent to 13 percent in 2013.
Overall efficiency of public spending


                                                      28

 The extremely low share of domestic funding to the sector poses serious concerns in terms of
   sustainability, ownership and efficiency especially given the volatility of aid in fragile contexts. It also
   raises issues in terms of alignment, harmonization and overall efficiency, given the high volume of
   external aid provided off-budget in the absence of current overarching National Health Strategy.
                                             Policy implications
In a context of stagnation and reversal of progress across several key health outcome indicators, additional
public spending on expanding access and utilization of quality health interventions are needed.
Spending more
 The Government needs to better prioritize the health sector in its overall Government budget by increasing
  public financing to the overall sector. These additional resources can come from a combination of
  increased resources in the total budget (given the current low share of health) and increased external
  financing from public and/or private sources.
Executing better
 Existing budgeting tools needs to be strengthened particularly the SIGFP especially with regards to
  including more comprehensive data on external aid, better tracking of investments and precise analysis of
  trends in execution rates across different programs.
 De-concentration of resources to lower levels of management and service delivery should be considered;
  with more autonomy on execution of at least some of the non-wage budget at district and primary care
  levels.
 Execution of regulation rates should be revisited with a specific focus on having a more equal impact
  across programs consistent with a prioritized budget execution strategy by the MOH.
 The impending validation of the New Health Sector Strategy should be seen as a critical opportunity by
  Government to better harmonize financing to the sector under one national plan.
 More harmonized and dynamic budgeting mechanisms should be put in place including participatory
  budgeting with all stakeholders and alignment of budget planning processes with calendar of the Ministry
  of Finance and Budget.

SECTION C. ELEMENTS TO ASSESS THE EFFICIENCY OF MOH EXPENDITURES

C1. Assessing Technical Efficiency through an Analysis of Input Shares



                                      Box 5. Analyzing Input Shares in Health

The production of health requires a combination of inputs (labor, capital, materials and supplies) which are characterized by a
high degree of interdependence. That is, medical staff need medicines, supplies, equipment, health facilities, and training to
“produce” good health; medicines cannot be administered properly without supervision, and so on. The degree of
substitutability is small in the health sector relative to most other sectors. When too much is spent on one input (particularly
wages), other inputs are crowded out. This imbalance impedes efficiency, reduces the quality of care, and threatens the
sustainability of the system. This is why changes in the relative shares of public expenditures going to each input should be
regularly assessed.

Although the perfect input mix likely varies by country because of differing input prices, geographical conditions, and even
cultural traditions, implicit normative benchmarks have emerged from a systematic review of PERs published between 2002
and 2012 (Gaudin and Yazbeck, 2013). The main findings show that than 50-60 percent spent on labor was considered too
much; less than 5 percent on capital and maintenance was considered too little; and less than 30 or 40 percent on materials
(including pharmaceuticals) was considered inadequate to ensure the normal productivity of the other inputs.



34. Expenditures on wages have been increasing, while other operational expenditures and internally
    financed investments have decreased (Box 5). The evolution of expenditures, in constant monetary terms,
    shows a clear decreasing trend for expenditures on all types of inputs except labor, which has been increasing
    in both in real terms and as a share of total expenditures.. This is also true in terms of shares, whether or not
    externally financed expenditures are included (Table 6). The share of regular wages went from 33 to 78 percent
    (between 2006 and 2013) of the overall budget (including both internal and external financing), and from 50 to
    over 80 percent during the same period excluding external financing. Other recurrent expenditures, which
    already received a relatively small share of the budget in 2006, at 22 percent, fell to 15 percent or less of the
    budget in 2013.23 This indicates that Madagascar has clearly moved to an unbalanced situation that is critical in
    terms of both efficiency and sustainability, especially considering the fact that the MoH wage bill has increased
    in terms of shares and in real terms.

35.      Regular salary expenditures in Madagascar have reached levels that are much higher than those
generally observed in less-developed countries. While internationally comparable data are not readily available,
a few points of comparison could be obtained using secondary data sources. Only two other SSA countries could
be identified in past PERs with labor shares above 60 percent: Zanzibar (2003 PER) with 80-85 percent, and Ghana
with about 70 percent (2009 PER)24; most other SSA countries had labor shares around 50 percent or less. Using a
larger and more systematic set of countries, other studies have provided some point of comparison with labor shares
in other income groups and regions. Vujicic et al. (2009) found the average share of wage in government health
spending around 40 percent in Africa for the 2000-2004 period, and the average for high-income countries around
45 percent. These comparisons, however, are based on data prior to 2006. In a more recent PER, a similar trend to
Madagascar was identified in a current study of Zimbabwe, where the share of wages in MoH expenditure reached
80 percent in 2013.25
36.     As a point of comparison, in contrast to the Education sector, non-regular salaries are not a
significant part of the non-wage recurrent budget. While it is not possible to identify all labor costs in the non-
wage recurrent budget, a breakdown of expenditures by account code in SIGFP can help to gauge the magnitude of
these costs. Such a breakdown can also provide important information on the structure of MoH expenditures in
more detailed categories of inputs (Table7). Using further disaggregation of the budget to identify expenditures by

   Ghana was also cited as a case of labor costs crowding out other inputs in Working in Health, World Bank, 2009. Including
additional duty hour allowance, the authors calculated that the wage bill added 90 percent to expenditures as donor funding
contributed solely to non-wage expenditure.
25
   The Zimbabwe study, however, included all labor expenditures, including in recurrent expenditures and transfers.

input across broad categories increases the share of labor by only 3-4 percent. Even if some portion of transfers to
hospitals goes to pay temporary staff, this would not make a large difference to assessing total labor costs, given
that transfers to hospitals do not exceed 5 percent of the budget.26

37. Expenditures on goods and services related to the provision of health care make up a very small share of
    the budget, and over the years this share has decreased considerably, with the cost of most medical
    consumables borne by the patient through cost recovery. Trend data also indicate that maintenance and utility
    costs decreased from 5.5 percent of the budget in 2008 to less than 1 percent in 2013. Fuel and transportation
    costs also declined, from more than 5 percent of the budget in 2008 to 2.3 percent in 2013. The raw data also
    indicate reductions in absolute amounts (by 50 percent in 2013 for maintenance and utility costs, and by 25
    percent for transportation costs), indicating a true reduction in the level of activity. Altogether, combining input
    types across the health budget, it is clear that since 2010, labor expenditures have crowded out expenditures on
    goods and services and investments managed by the MoH (Figure 11). This is apparent looking at the decline
    in key service delivery indicators during the same time period. For example, the prescription satisfaction rate,
    a key indicator for drug availability, declined from 69 percent in 2008 to 58 percent in 2010/11 at the facility
    level and the utilization of basic health centers and prenatal consultations decreased by 20 percent from 2008
    to 2011.

     It is not possible to identify input shares for expenditures paid out of the health facilities own revenues, if any.

38.     The large bias towards salaries in domestic funding is somewhat compensated by substantial inflows
of external aid targeting other aspects of the system, in particular goods and services. However, investment
financed by external aid has dropped considerably, making it difficult to sustain improvement in the quality and
quantity of health services delivered.
39.     In conclusion, although Madagascar was found to do well overall in term of outcomes relative to
expenditures before 2008, the current imbalance in the use of inputs shows that the country is not on track to keep
its advantage, given that the trend since 2009 is not efficient and is unsustainable.


C2. Elements to Assess Allocative Efficiency: Expenditure Analysis by Function



        Box 6. Allocative Efficiency Analysis Using Functional Allocations of Health Expenditures
Allocative efficiency analysis generally examines the types and combinations of goods and services produced in relation to
demand. The term is loosely interpreted here in the sense that consumer preferences and demand are not directly measured.
Instead, the analysis rests on a general appreciation of needs and on well-known characteristics of the different types of health
provision (functions) in terms of their public good (public health activities) and best value-for-money (primary care and
prevention) characteristics.
By affecting parameters such as accessibility and quality, the functional distribution of health expenditures is not just a response
to demand or to need; it also influences the types of services that will be effectively used by individuals. There is some degree
of substitutability between the different kinds of care dispensed at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels or in different
types of facilities, in terms of reaching desired outcomes (i.e., lower mortality and morbidity). Expenditures on prevention, for
example, complement current expenditures on curative care contemporaneously but substitute for future expenditures on
curative care, and are therefore recommended from a sustainability perspective. Finally, while efficiency and equity often
involve a trade-off in other sectors, the two goals tend to be complementary in the health sector. In particular, directing more
resources to primary health care and prevention is usually recommended as both efficiency and equity enhancing. In addition
to looking at functions in terms of health services and levels, analysis of the distribution of expenditures by health priority is
useful to assess allocative efficiency in terms of responding to needs.



                                                                33
                                                                                 Madagascar PER – Health |Section C

The question is whether efforts are placed where they are most needed and where they will have the most effect. The
need to prioritize some health programs against others in the name of allocative efficiency depends on specific conditions in
the country, based on an evaluation of the situation and evolution of major health outcomes, utilization indicators, and
demographic changes.


     1. Data and level of analysis
40.      The ability to determine whether resources are allocated efficiently (Box 6) depends greatly on the ability
to classify expenditures into categories that can be matched to levels of care, health priorities, and other specifically
identified needs such as those of vulnerable populations. The expenditure analysis presented below is guided by
the feasibility of sorting expenditures by these types of functions using the data available. First, a breakdown of
Total Health Expenditures is presented based on National Health Account (NHA) data, to give a picture of the
overall situation. There is some degree of comparability over time and with other countries. This also gives an idea
of the evolution of costs that are borne mostly by households.27
41.     Then, the bulk of the analysis is devoted to government health expenditures measured using: (a) public
expenditures from NHA 2010—-noting that these are 2.3 times larger than total MoH expenditures in SIGFP
(explained below); (b) wage expenditures of MoH based on a compilation of various government data sources and
author’ calculations; and (c) non-wage recurrent and investment expenditures of the MoH, based on SIGFP data.
Specificities about the three types of data sources and the type of analysis they allow are outlined in Box 7.



     Box 7. Contribution of Different Data Sources to Understanding Health Expenditure by Function in
                                                 Madagascar
Different sources of data provide different opportunities to classify expenditures by function in Madagascar. This box lays out
the type of analysis that can be done with each source and for different types of expenditures. Depending on the definition of
health expenditure used, the analysis yields different elements of information that complement each other, to provide an overall
picture of expenditure allocation. The sources presented below are ordered from most comprehensive to most narrow in terms
of the range of expenditures included.
National Health Account: This source encompasses the broadest range of health expenditures. It relies on expenditure
information using external survey questionnaires (and may therefore differ from information obtained from government
accounts). NHA methodology organizes the data into financing schemes and financing agents; total health expenditures include
all financing schemes, public and private. The presentation of the data in matrix form allows identification of the subset of
expenditures using central public administration as a financing scheme (HF). Expenditures under the public financing scheme
exclude social insurance but include all public funds, including off-budget externally financed expenditure. For Madagascar,
this total is 494 billion Ar, compared to on-budget expenditure of 217 billion Ar in SIGFP (see below). In the NHA central
administration HF category: 46 percent of funds go through local governments, 29 percent through NGOs, 21 percent through
the central administration, and 4 percent through international organizations.
MoH expenditures. A direct analysis of MoH expenditure has the potential to reveal trends that cannot be assessed using NHA
data. In particular, one can separate wage and non-wage expenditures and identify the significance of health care provision by
levels of care. Looking at wage and non-wage recurrent expenditures is important for several reasons: (a) the data on non-wage


27
  In particular, it is important to look at total expenditures instead of MoH expenditures when analyzing the evolution of
pharmaceutical costs; these costs have been mostly borne by household in Madagascar since the system of cost recovery was
implemented.
                                                              34
                                                                                   Madagascar PER – Health |Section C

expenditure are from a single source (SIGFP) and present a much higher degree of reliability than do wage allocations based
on approximations from multiple non-official sources; (b) different types of functional classifications are possible with wage
and non-wage expenditures; (c) non-wage recurrent expenditures have a higher degree of flexibility, as they allow a better
appreciation of short-term changes in priorities/political commitment, and can capture short-term variations in level of activity;
and (d) expenditures on salaries largely dominate in Madagascar (close to 80 percent of expenditures in 2013); therefore,
analysing recurrent expenditures as a whole overshadows important information that can be obtained by looking solely at non-
wage recurrent expenditure.
MoH wage expenditures. SIGFP can be used to evaluate the magnitude and evolution of total salaries and identify the share
of salaries going to the central administration. No further analysis by function can be done using SIGFP, given that regular
salaries and social charges (contributions paid by employers) are all included in the general administration program of the
MoH. A reconstruction of salary shares by type of facility and type of personnel was done for 2013, using MoH data on average
salaries by category of personnel combined with number and category of employees by type of facility. Approximations of
salaries for 2006-2013 were obtained using a combination of MoH and MFB information on salary increases and grade changes
over time. No information was available on changes in number of personnel over time. Instead, the salary estimates by function
were corrected using differences with SIGFP totals each year—a method that does not take into account the relative changes
between functions over time. A full description of the methodology and challenges encountered in gathering and reconciling
the data is given in Annex x 3. Given the size of the effort needed to perform such estimations and the limited availability and
reliability of non-SIGFP data, it is important to stress the need to change government accounting practices so that salaries can
be identified by function (program, type of facility) in government accounts.
Non-wage expenditures from SIGFP. SIGFP data on non-wage expenditures can be used to classify expenditures by type of
health services (administrative, curative, preventive) and by levels of care (primary, secondary, tertiary). The exercise requires
an analysis beyond classifications by program provided in the budget, to allow for some comparability with the pre-crisis years
and to widen the range of possible categories. Only very partial information could be obtained in terms of internally financed
expenditures going to different vertical health programs. Maternal and Child Health (MCH) expenses can be identified through
a specific budget program (Suivie et Developpement de la Mere et de l’Enfant -SDME). The data were further analyzed using
the names of administrative units to identify expenditures directed to other health priorities, but the data were not sufficient to
provide a clear picture of these expenditures, especially given the importance of external funding for vertical programs and the
lack of accounting of realized expenditures for externally funded expenses. A separate analysis of the immunization program
was done by UNICEF this type of analysis would need to be done for other programs (immunization, malaria, MCH) to see
whether the prioritization is consistent with the evolution of a broader range of indicators.


2.    Functional allocation of Total Health Expenditures (NHA)
42.      When considering the totality of health expenditures, both public and private, the results of the 2003,
2007 and 2010 NHA exercises reveal that Madagascar does not exhibit the common SSA pattern of over-
spending on in-patient care and under-spending on preventive and public care. In fact, the share of hospital care
decreased while the share of spending on prevention and public health programs increased over the period 2003-
2010 (Table 8). In Madagascar, however, these low levels of spending on curative care are likely a signal of system
failure, in the sense that the majority of the population may just not be seeking care. This is verified by the 2010
EPM findings results, which showed that close to 70 percent of people in Madagascar did not seek care when ill.

43.      In comparison to SSA and other comparable low-income countries, Madagascar devotes a much
lower share of total health expenditures to inpatient care. Although international comparisons are difficult at
this level of disaggregation, some data are available, based on country NHAs in the WHO GHED, regarding the
share of inpatient care in total health expenditure (Table 9). Expenditure on inpatient care is the most expensive
type of care and has the potential to crowd out preventive care, resulting in higher future curative costs. This does
not appear to be happening in Madagascar, where the share of expenditures going to inpatient care is less than 7
percent. This is less than a third of SSA and LIC averages, and well below any individual countries in the
comparison group (based on data availability and proximity). Again, this is likely a reflection of low health-seeking
behavior across all quintiles.

44.     Pharmaceutical costs have also remained stable, at less than 20 percent of total expenditures, and
these costs even decreased in 2013. From a general sustainability perspective, given that pharmaceutical costs
have had a tendency to increase in the rest of the world, this result could be seen as encouraging. But in the case of
Madagascar, given that the recent health facility survey indicates a decrease in utilization as a result of a reduction
in health seeking behavior, this could be concerning. The country’s FANOME system includes a cost recovery
component for essential drugs but the system is currently decapitalized in many parts of the country. In areas where
financing is available through donor funding, the FANOME system has been recapitalized and a fee exemption

3.    Functional allocation of public health expenditures (NHA 2010)
45.      Knowledge of the functional allocation of total health expenditures (THE) is helpful in identifying whether
there are specific gaps in the system as a whole. However, optimal prioritization varies between the public and
private sectors. Higher expenditures on curative care are expected from the private sector, while the public sector
needs to focus on preventive health services, which create the largest positive externalities for the population as a
whole.
46.      The 2010 NHA28 results indicate a distribution of public expenditures that strongly prioritizes
activities with high public good characteristics, as would be expected of the public system. NHA is the only
source of data that can provide an overview of all public health expenditures, including externally financed off-
budget expenditures. According to these data, two thirds of public health expenditures are devoted to preventive
activities, most of which are targeted to specific diseases (Table 10).29 There are some limits to these NHA results;
for example, it is not clear from the report what were included as preventive health services.30 Further, since
expenditure on curative care cannot be broken down by level of care, it is likely that a good number of activities
carried out by primary health care facilities and some administrative costs were included as part of preventative
activities.




28
   Using the matrices created for the NHA 2010, current public health expenditures can be broken down by specific health
services /health programs and to some extent by type of health facility (following the System of Health Accounts OECD - SHA
2011).
29
   Unfortunately, it is not possible to recreate this breakdown for previous years, so trends cannot be analyzed.
30
   The raw data for NHA were not available due to personnel changes combined with accidental losses of electronic files, so
the data are limited to tables and matrices published in the NHA reports.

4.      Functional allocation of Ministry of Health expenditures: wage expenditures
47.     As noted above, given current accounting practices in Madagascar, classifications of salaries into functions
rely on rough estimates. However, with salaries making up 78 percent of executed expenditures of the MoH (85
percent of domestically financed expenditures), salaries need to be considered in order to get a good idea of the
level of effort by type of health service and, in particular, by level of care. Details of the methodology used to
construct salary shares and raw results are presented in Annex 3.

Data sources: MoH, MFB.

48.      Even though 50 percent of the population seeking care go to primary health facilities (CSB1 and
CSB2), these facilities only absorb only 27 percent of wages (Figure 12).31 At the second level of primary health
care facilities (CSB2), staff absorb 23 percent of salaries while they are visited by 40-50 percent of the population
seeking care. There are 1610 functional CSB2s (2013) in the country and they are typically staffed by one doctor,
one midwife and a small number of support personnel. In contrast, basic primary health care centers (CSB1) are
normally staffed by one nurse or midwife and one support staff. There are 875 functional CSB1s (2013), which
represent less than 4 percent of the wage bill and are visited by about 10 percent of people who are sick. Personnel
data by region and type of facility (2013) show that CSB1s are typically understaffed. Only 5 regions had on average
more than 1 staff per functional CSB1, with the highest average in Haute-Matsiatra at 1.43 staff per CSB1.
49.      Total salaries at service delivery levels have remained low since 2006, while central and regional
administrative salaries increased exponentially in the same period. Despite some data limitations, the graph of
salaries by type of facility reveal some important trends of shares in the MoH wage bill for CHUs, and the central
administration vs. other levels of care. (Figure 12).32 33

32
   Changes in staffing per facility type over time could not be obtained, and the evolution of salaries presented here cannot
capture the full variation over time. The only category for which the data on evolution of salaries is not limited is the central
administration. Salaries going to other facilities can only evolve independently because of differences in salary increases over
time and by category of personnel. An estimate of salaries, taking account of changes in the number of facilities at the primary
care level, was tested but did not improve results when compared to totals in SIGFP. The graph in Figure 13 showing the
evolution of salaries since 2006 is virtually unchanged.
33
   The decrease in Central Administration shown for 2009 could be due to a decrease in total salaries recorded in SIGFP.
However, there were some issues in the accounting of salaries for 2009, so the decrease could be due to low data quality in
2009.

b) Allocation of salaries by level of care
50.     In Madagascar, similar to other low-income countries, a great deal of primary health care is provided
outside of primary health care facilities, especially in tertiary hospitals. However, this care is not measured
because of lack of data, so expenses incurred at hospital end up being counted as secondary or tertiary care.34 Our
estimates indicate that 60 percent of activities in university hospitals (CHUs) are at the primary care level, in the
sense that they are dispensed by primary care practitioners.35 In administrative functions, about 40 percent of salaries
(50 percent at the district level) go to PHC/PH personnel.36 The result is also interesting for district hospitals, which
were included in the graph above as primary care hospitals37; in fact, 66 percent of salaries in district hospitals go
to PHC/PH, which is not much different from the share found at the CHU level (Figure 14).



34
   Glick and Razakamanantsoa (2002) report that a substantial amount of primary care is dispensed at the hospital level for
individuals who have access to hospitals, based on evidence in EPM, although they do not quantify the size of primary care
provision.
35
   Each type of occupation was assigned to a level. General practitioners, dentists, midwifes, public health specialists, nutrition
agents and health workers were automatically assigned to the primary care/public health category. Specialized doctors and
specialized paramedical staff were assigned to secondary/tertiary care. Non-specialized paramedical (nurses) and radiologists
were distributed according to the share of public health care staff relative to specialized staff in the facility.
36
    Doctors working in administrative functions who do not dispense or supervise health care are recorded as administrative
personnel.
37
   The personnel data do not distinguish between category 1 and category 2 district hospitals. Category 2 district hospital offer
surgery and may be closer in type of health care provision to regional hospitals that provide primarily secondary care.
                                                                                    40

51.      Administration costs are relatively larger in regional hospitals (24 percent) than in other health care
units, including other hospitals (less than 20 percent in CHU and CHD). In CSB1 and CSB2, it is clear that the
medical/paramedical staff take care of administrative tasks.
52.      Overall, based on a combination of information on type of personnel and type of facility, about 62
percent of salaries go to primary and public health care, a figure that resembles what was found in NHA looking
at the totality of public expenditures. Secondary/tertiary care activities absorb less than 6 percent of the MoH wage
bill while administrative staff absorb about one third (Figure 15).

5.     Allocation of salaries by type of personnel
53. Basic health centers (CSB1) are almost exclusively run by paramedical staff (nurses, midwives and lab
    technicians) with the highest concentration of medical staff salaries in tertiary care facilities (CHUs).
    Classification by type of personnel (medical, paramedical, administrative) allowed an analysis over time based

                                                              41

        on actual changes in number of staff.38 The ratio of paramedical salaries to medical staff salaries is significantly
        lower in CHUs than in other health facilities. Salaries of paramedical staff, make up about 40 percent of the
        wage bill in all other health facilities except the basic health centers (Figure 16).

   The number of personnel by type (medical, paramedical, and administrative) was available from 2000 to 2012. Some
adjustments were done based on facility level data for 2012 and 2013 to match the total numbers (the numbers broken down
by facility type and region underestimated the total number of staff). Average compensation estimates by category were used
to reconstruct total salaries. See Annex 3 for details.

6.    Functional Allocation of Ministry of Health Expenditures: non-wage expenditures

a) Functional classification by budget program, 2010-2013
55.      Program budgeting has the great advantage of facilitating the analysis of expenditures by function, when
programs are chosen to reflect the principal health function by level of care and/or type of services. Expenditures
are separated into: a) Administration and Coordination; b) Basic Health Services; Hospital Health Services; c)
Supply of Medicine and Other Medical Products; d) Disease Prevention and Control; and e) Maternal and Child
Health.40,41 Basic health services are fully assimilated into primary health care, while hospital services include all
in-patient services and are mostly directed to secondary/tertiary health care.42 Data for 2009 are not included to
ensure full comparability, with regard to program structure43 and considering that total non-wage expenditure was
cut in half between 2009 and 2010.

Recurrent non-wage expenditure
56.      Administration and coordination takes the largest share of recurrent non-wage expenditures, more
than PHC, MCH, and public health combined (Figure 18). Using the information available in the SIGFP shows
that administrative expenses constitute about 40 percent of non-wage recurrent expenditure, (with a decrease in 43
in 2010 to 36 percent in 2013). The share going to hospital services stayed relatively constant at around 25 percent.
The share going specifically to primary health care services was significantly reduced from 19 to 11 percent,
although maternal and child health expenditures compensated for the decrease. Grouped together, non-wage
expenditure on primary health care, maternal and child health and public health (which is labelled fight against
specific diseases and includes some primary care), increased from 28 to 32 percent of recurrent expenditure between
2010 and 2013.

   The MCH and Family Planning programs were new programs in 2010. Family planning was merged with the MCH program
in 2012 and 2013.
42
   If the analysis presented above regarding share of salaries can be extended to non-wage expenditures, about half of hospital
services would be directed to primary care services.

   Budget programs in 2009 did not include either the MCH program or family planning.

Investment expenditure
57.      Virtually all investment expenditures go to public health (fight against specific diseases) and primary
care/MCH activities (Figure 19). This is based on the expenditures included in the SIGFP only. A large part of
investment expenditures end up being spent off budget or outside of the MoH accounts and are not accounted for
in this analysis.

58.    Despite large yearly fluctuations, the overall picture on functional allocation of non-wage
expenditures looks no different in 2010 than it did in 2013 (Figure 20). Combining non-wage recurrent and
investment expenditure, PHC/MCH/PH expenditures went from a low of 40 percent in 2010 to 53 percent in 2013,
with a peak of 68 percent in 2011. The same pattern is revealed when looking only at internally financed
expenditures: from 35 percent in 2010 to 41 percent in 2013, with a peak of 47 percent in 2011.

b) Additional information using classifications by administrative unit
59.      It is not possible to compare the results presented above to the pre-crisis period because of changes in the
administrative structure and the delineation of programs, as well as changes in the way that some expenditures were
classified in the budget after 2009. Program delineations also limit the type of classifications possible. To
circumvent these issues, expenditures in the SIGFP were classified using the name of the Operational Activity Unit
(SOA), the account code (type of expense), and current program assignments to identify the type of service, level
of care, and other specific areas of focus.44 Table A3 in Annex 1 lists the classifications that were created. This
alternative classification offers the advantage of being completely independent of other differences in budget
accounting. Further, it is stable over time, so it can be used to confirm data quality and to compare pre- and post-
crisis periods. In addition, this alternative classification provides further disaggregation by type of activity, which
is useful for tracking specific efforts, including in terms of governance, given the weight of administration in current
expenditure.
60.     Non-wage recurrent health expenditure by health service/level of care are close to those reported by
budget program for the combined PHC, MCH and Public Health functions. Results differ somewhat for the other
three functions, with hospital care (secondary and tertiary care) clearly going up since 2010.
61.     Relative to 2006, the weight of administration decreased in non-wage expenditures decreased, while
the shares going to hospital services and to high-impact activities increased. Hospital care gained 10 percentage
points, high-impact activities (PHC MCH, and Public Health) together gained 8 points, while the share of

  About 1,945 different SOAs were identified by combining the data for 2006 and 2008-2013, about half of which were similar
SOAs for different districts or regions. SOAs were manually assigned to the different categories of table x.x3 in view of its
denomination, and when possible matching where expenditure of similar SOAs were classified in the latest budget programs.
Additional identification was performed within some administrative SOAs using PCOP account information. In particular,
hospital transfers were re-coded as secondary and tertiary health services/curative, and pharmacy and medical consumables
were removed from administration when applicable.

62.     Including investment, the evolution of non-wage expenditures is much less stable if we look at yearly
changes since 2008.45 Maternal and child health activities received a boost in 2011, when they made up 28 percent
of non-wage expenditures at the MoH. Excluding wages, the combination of PH, PHC, and MCH activities reached
70 percent in 2011 and since then have remained above 50 percent of the total. (Table 11).

  Expenditures on building of facilities and pre-operating costs (65 percent of non-wage expenditures in 2006) could not be
identified by type of facilities and therefore could not be assigned by level so little can be said about functional allocation for
2006.

63.    A comparison of MoH non-wage expenditures (including foreign-financed investment expenditure) in 2008
and 2013 is shown in Figure 22. It is important to note that that the size of the financing envelope was greatly
reduced from 115 billion Ar in 2008 to only 35 billion Ar. in 2013. This new picture reveals a larger share, albeit
of a much smaller pie, given to primary health care and public health, while expenditures of administrative units
went down and the share going to hospital services went up.

64.      The classification by function/type of activity confirms the steady reduction in administration costs,
mostly to the benefit of curative activities until 2009 and to the benefit of preventive health after 2009 (figures
23 and 24).46 The weight of preventive activities increased significantly (from 7 to 21 percent) from 2009 to 2013,
while the weight of curative activities increased until 2009 (from 16 to 41 percent) and remained stable or decreased
slightly thereafter, to reach 34 percent in 2013.




46
   The definition of administration is different in this classification compared to above, explaining the higher weight. For
example, expenditures of District health services were classified as primary health by levels but as administrative(as opposed
to curative or preventive) by function.

65.     As expected, more variability is found when including investment expenditures. When investment is
included, preventive activities take a larger share, reaching above 40 percent in 2011 and back to a more
representative 27 percent in 2013. Curative activities make up 17-25 percent depending on the year.

c) A partial look at specific allocations (health priorities, target groups, governance)47
66.     Communicable diseases (CDs) and MCH dominate targeted expenditures identifiable by program.
Excluding the investment budget, expenditure on CDs clearly dominate every year, followed by MCH (Figure 25).
Looking at investment, CDs and MCH still make up the bulk of targeted expenditure, although there is much
variation over the years between both programs. There has been some increase in non-communicable diseases
(NCD) program funding, indicating that are starting to gain importance in the investment budget.

d) An attempt to disaggregate external aid by functional category
67.      As highlighted above, external aid is an important component of total public spending on health. While the
lack of systematic recording of external support to the sector makes it difficult to analyze the composition of external
aid, there is substantial evidence pointing to large and continuous support from external partners in providing health
inputs, such as vaccines and other health materials, over recent years. In particular, support from GAVI and the
malaria funds have ensured the provision of essential inputs to the system. However, this support, while largely in
alignment with specific disease control strategies, is generally channeled outside of the MoH. Box 7 summarizes
the findings of a recent case study by UNICEF on financing immunization. As noted above, this type of analysis
needs to be carried out across external financing for health given its large share of the total budget for health.

                                         Box 8. Financing Vaccination in Madagascar
The effective financing of the immunization program relies mainly on predicable and timely funding from external
development partners such as GAVI Alliance grants, UNICEF, WHO, World Bank, with additional support (technical and
resources) provided by other partners such as the development agencies of the UK, USA, French and EU.
The political crisis in 2009 and subsequent macroeconomic constriction. Since the 2009 crisis, authorities have implemented
tight budgetary policies to preserve macroeconomic stability which has severely constrained the available fiscal space of the
government; and in turn, significantly impacted social sector spending, including on immunization services and . This has been
accompanied by a steep fall in vaccination rates: complete immunization coverage for children 12 to 23 months old dropped
from 62 percent in 2008 (DHS 2008/2009) to 51.1 percent in 2012 (ENSOMD 2012/2013).Routine vaccination expenditure
represents 0.11% of GDP. According to data in the annual progress reports, in 2010 there was a total health expenditure on
vaccinations of about US$11.5 million. Out this amount, the Government was responsible for 17%, about $2.2 million.
Between 2010 and 2013, the Government share of financing dropped from 17% to 7%, representing a drop of 10 percentage
points in 4 years.

Over the last four years, the Government share of costs for the vaccination program is low and is declining with most
expenditures being used for the purchase of vaccines, fuel, and payment of salaries.
Currently, over 93% of program resources are provided by technical and financial vaccination partners. Since 1997, the
country’s National Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) has had a budget line for the purchase of routine vaccines. But
with the introduction of new vaccines, the funds allocated fall short of the full costs of procuring routine and new vaccines.
In the context of slow economic recovery current projections do not predict sufficient domestic revenues in the short term
for the Government to meet co-financing obligations of vaccine procurement or to finance expansion of immunization
coverage to achieve objectives of universal and equitable access to save lives and minimize illness from vaccine preventable
diseases. With some traditional partners indicating a progressive reduction in financial support to immunization, the financing
gap for immunization can only be filled over the next few years if increasing domestic resources are combined with additional
financing from existing and new partners. The Government also noted that a draft law on the sustainable financing of
vaccination is under preparation, which would permit the Government to earmark resources for vaccination, thereby securing
funding for specific requirements of vaccine procurement and supply chain management at all levels.
The main recommendations from the immunization financing review include:
-       Capacity building of teams responsible for vaccination at all levels
-       Improved monitoring of EPI expenditures at all levels
-       Strengthened reporting, management and feedback on expenditures at all levels
-       Finalization of the draft law on the sustainable funding of vaccination
-       Strengthened ministry leadership in coordinating interventions
-       Strengthened advocacy around partnership and financing for immunization with all partners

C3. Elements of a Productivity Analysis

68.     The impact of MoH expenditures within the country can be assessed in terms of the number of direct
beneficiaries. The classifications constructed for the functional analysis can be used to shed some light on whether
government expenditures go to services that are most used. The unit costs presented below are based on 2013 salary
expenditures.48 Annual utilization (number of people who visit a given facility over the year) is calculated based
on the 2010 EPM.49
69.      As expected, unit costs increase exponentially as we move up the levels of care. Relative to level 2
health centers (CSB2) that are the most frequently visited, CSB1s (level 1 health centers) cost 30 percent less per
visit, primary hospitals (CHRDs) cost 30 percent more, secondary regional hospitals (CHRR) cost almost three
times more, and tertiary hospitals (CHU), including main hospitals at the province level, cost about 30 times more
(Figure 26).

70.     Expenditures roughly follow utilization patterns up to the CHRR level (Figure 27). Unit costs do not
reveal whether differences are due mostly due to low utilization or high costs, so it is useful to present the
components separately. It is clear that low utilization drives the high unit cost at the CHU level. This result need to
be put in perspective, considering what was found in terms of the provision of primary care in CHU hospitals. It
may make sense to deploy some of the primary care staff in CHUs to facilities that cater to the largest numbers.

   Including other expenditures would not change the interpretation of these results. Similarly, looking at non-wage expenditure
separately using SIGFP data would not be informative, given that expenditures cannot be attributed to the different facilities.

                                                    Key Findings
 Expenditures on labor have been increasing both in real term and in share of total expenditures, while other
 operational expenditures and internally financed investments have decreased. This indicates that Madagascar has
 clearly moved to an unbalanced situation that is concerning in terms of both efficiency and sustainability in delivering
 a sufficient amount of quality health services to the population.
 Economic analysis of public spending
    Regular salary expenditures in Madagascar have reached levels (84% of domestic financing in 2013) that are
     much higher than those generally observed in other low-income countries.
    Expenditures on goods and services related to the provision of health care make up a very small share of the
     budget, with the cost of most medical consumables borne by the patient through cost recovery.
    Since 2010, labor expenditures have crowded out expenditures on goods/services and investments managed by
     the MoH.
    The large bias towards salaries in domestic funding, which is already very restricted (approx. 20% of public
     financing for health) is somewhat compensated by substantial inflows of external aid targeting other aspects of
     the system, in particular goods and services. However, investment financed by external aid has dropped
     considerably, making it very difficult to sustain improvement in the quality and quantity of health services
     delivered.
    Although Madagascar was found to do well overall in term of outcomes relative to expenditures before 2008, the
     current imbalance in the use of inputs shows that the country will likely not keep this advantage, given that the
     trend since 2009 is not technically efficient and is unsustainable.
 Functional Allocation of Total Health Expenditures (Public and Private)
 Madagascar does not exhibit the common SSA pattern of over-spending on in-patient care and under-spending on
 preventive and public care:



                                                              52
                                                                               Madagascar PER – Health |Section C


        o   The share of hospital care decreased while the share of spending on prevention and public health programs
            increased over the period 2003 -2010.
        o   The share of expenditures going to inpatient care is less than 7 percent, which is less than a third of LIC
            averages.
        o   Pharmaceutical costs have also remained stable, at less than 20 percent of total expenditures, and these
            costs even decreased in 2013.
These indicators could be a signal of system failure, in the sense that the majority of the population may just not be
seeking care. The 2010 Household Survey indicates that close to 70 percent of people in Madagascar did not seek care
when ill.
Functional allocation of public health expenditures
 The 2010 NHA results indicate a distribution of public expenditures that strongly prioritizes activities with high
   public good characteristics, as would be expected of the public system.
 Total salaries at service delivery levels have remained low and constant since 2006, while central and regional
   administrative salaries increased exponentially in the same period.
 Primary health care facilities absorb only 27 percent of wages, while 50 percent of the population seeking care go
   to these facilities.
 In Madagascar, similar to other low-income countries, a great deal of primary health care is provided outside of
   primary health care facilities, especially in tertiary hospitals.
Recurrent non-wage expenditure
Administration and coordination takes the largest share of recurrent non-wage expenditures, more than PHC, MCH,
and public health combined.
External aid analysis by functional category
 Lack of systematic recording of external support to the sector makes it difficult to analyze the composition of
   external aid but there is substantial evidence pointing to large and continuous support from external partners in
   providing health inputs, such as vaccines and other health materials, over recent years. However, this support is
   generally channeled outside of the MoH.
 A recent case study on financing vaccination found that routine vaccination expenditure represents only 0.11% of
   GDP. According to data in the annual progress reports, in 2010 there was a total health expenditure on
   vaccinations of about US$11.5 million. Out this amount, the Government was responsible for 17%, about $2.2
   million. Between 2010 and 2013, the Government share of financing dropped from 17% to 7%, representing a
   drop of 10 percentage points in 4 years. There was also a fall in nominal terms. With the dramatic fall in
   immunization rates over the same period, this downward trend is concerning.
 Given the high share of external aid in the total financing of the health sector, the absence of an updated national
   strategy and of as well as fully functioning coordination and alignment mechanisms could be impeding the
   realization of important synergies across sources of financing.
                                                Policy implications
Over time, there is a need to redirect spending on activities and interventions that improve the delivery of quality
health services
Better use of resources to improve service delivery of quality HNP interventions
 In the current budget envelope, there is an urgent need for the Government to address the wage vs. non-wage

 One of the key areas that should be addressed is the exponential expansion of central and regional administrative
   salaries in the last decade when service delivery salaries have not changed in the same time period.
 The Government aim to improve capacity and service delivery at the primary which will require a redistribution
   of the wage bill to ensure that it is in line with the level at which services are being utilized.
 The distribution of non-wage expenditures should be re-balanced to support the delivery of critical public health
  programs.
 Consider the use of output-based approaches compared to the current largely input-based funding methodologies
More informed budgeting

 The Government could consider institutionalizing NHA exercises every two years. . The tool should be adapted
   to Madagascar’s specific system and needs.
 More robust analysis of external aid financing is urgently needed to have a more exact analysis of the budget.

SECTION D. DISTRIBUTIONAL ANALYSIS OF PUBLIC HEALTH EXPENDITURE

D1. Distribution of MoH Expenditures by Region and Type of Residence

71.      While it is not surprising that private expenditures per capita are higher in richer regions, public
expenditures should be expected compensate the difference in spending. Looking at the totality of health
expenditure, however, per capita total current health expenditures are found to be negatively, though
weakly, correlated with poverty rates (corr=-0.39, sig=0.07).50 This section shows that MoH expenditures
are in fact more regressively distributed across regions than total expenditures (excluding investment). It
also shows that national figures hide significant heterogeneity among regions. The analysis first looks at
the per capita distribution of MoH expenditures by province and region, then analyzes the relationship
between per capita expenditures and regional poverty levels. Expenditures directed to primary health care
are examined separately. The last subsection briefly assesses rural/urban differences.

     1. Regional allocations vs population shares
72.     Looking at changes in the distribution over time, Antananarivo alone has been driving the
increase in current MOH health expenditures. The allocation of these expenditures by province appears
to roughly follow population ratios. This can be seen in the significant differences between some provinces,
with Antananarivo benefiting from twice the amount of per capita government spending relative to Toliara
and Fianrantsoa in the south (Figure 28).51

based on EPM 2010.
51
   About one third of the MoH current expenditures are allocated to the central level (up to a peak at 42 percent in
2008), the rest being allocated across provinces. Unfortunately, the analysis cannot include investment because only
a very small part is identified outside of the central level in SIGFP.
                                                                         55

73.     By contrast, at the regional level, salary shares (Table 12) show inequality with respect to
population shares, (Figure 30). There is a clear disadvantage to the region of Vatovavy-Vatovivany.
Analamanga accounts for about 15 percent of the population but for 20 percent of all salary expenditure,
not including central ministry personnel. All other regions receive less than their estimated population
shares, as depicted in Figure 30. Regions that receive significantly less than their population shares are
Androy, Atsimo Atsinana, Sofia, Vatovavy Fitovinany, and Vakinankaratra. An important caveat to this
analysis relative to population sizes is that Madagascar has not had a census for many years, so estimated
per capita distributions may not accurately reflect the situation.

     2. Relationship between current expenditures and poverty by region


74.      The following considers all non-investment expenditures, combining SIGFP and salary data.52
Poverty levels are calculated using the periodic Household Surveys for 2005 and 2010. To increase data
quality, and in particular to smooth issues related to changes in personnel, averages of 2006-2008 current
expenditures are compared to averages for 2009-2013.53
75.      Regions with higher poverty rates received less funding on average. 54,55 The total recurrent per
capita expenditure in health, ordering regions by their 2005 poverty rate in shown in Figure 31. There are
two important caveats to this interpretation: a) per capita expenditures do not include transfers, in particular
the transfers to tertiary hospitals, which represent about 15 percent of total non-wage recurrent expenditure
and are not distributed by region in the government accounts. Given the location of these hospitals,


52
   Salaries make up between 69 and 93 percent of the total, depending on the region and the period considered (the
relative share of salaries is higher in the second period).
53
   Non-wage current expenditures from SIGFP are averaged over 2006 and 2008 for the first period and 2009 to 2013
for the second period. Salaries are averaged over 2006 to 2008 for the first period and 2010-2013 for the second.
54
   The per capita consumption figures do not show the same smoothing out of regions as do poverty rates: per capita
consumption dropped more or less evenly across regions.
55
   Ordering countries by decreasing per capita consumption (in PPP) instead of by poverty rates also shows the
strongest differences when comparing the richest and the poorest regions (Figure A in Annex 1).
                                                          57

including these transfers in the analysis would likely make the unequal distribution more apparent, and b)
these data do not include foreign aid. Given that foreign aid has been specifically directed to the poorer
regions, it could be the case that some domestic funding in these regions has been displaced.
76.     With the exception of Analamanga, the regions that received the highest share of MoH
expenditure also experienced the highest cuts. Two regions with notable changes were Melaky and South
Atsinanana, where poverty significantly increased while per capita expenditure of the MoH decreased by
about one half. Overall, all regions were affected by the decrease in both the range and variance per capita
of MoH expenditures.

77.      Expenditures are strongly negatively correlated to poverty ratios and strongly positively
correlated to per capita consumption, which is a proxy indicator for income. The relationship becomes
slightly more regressive in the later period when using consumption per capita but not using poverty ratios
(Table 13).

78.      The regional distribution presented above is necessarily affected by the geographical location
of tertiary care facilities. Contrary to primary care activities, there is an important trade-off between
efficiency and regional equity for tertiary care facilities because of large economies of scale in activities
that requires expensive capital inputs. In order to get at the notion of equity within the constraints of
feasibility, one needs to concentrate on the provision of primary health care.
79.       The analysis below looks at a snapshot of the situation (rather than its evolution, as above), to
compare the 2013 primary care current expenses per capita to 2010 poverty rates by region. 56 To obtain
total current expenses for primary care, non-investment expenses recorded in the basic health provision
program of SIGFP were added to salary expenses in primary health care centers, primary hospitals, and
district public health services.57 The finding is that salaries largely dominate, with non-salary expenses
accounting for just 3 percent of the total, on average, and no more than 8 percent for a given region. A
second type of analysis was done using salaries only, based on our estimates of primary care provision in
all facilities (not just PHC facilities).
80.      Even when restricting expenditures to the primary health care level, regional distribution is
strongly regressive. Regions with lower poverty rates receive more per capita, while regions with higher
poverty rates receive less (Figure 32). Although there are wide differences in per capita MoH expenditures
in the middle range of poverty rates, differences are marked at the two extremes. The same pattern obtains
when using per capita consumption instead of poverty rates, with higher MoH expenditures per capita in
richer regions (Annex 2, Figure A.1). Correlation coefficients, although slightly lower than before, still
show strong regressivity whether they are calculated against poverty ratios or consumption per capita (Table
14).




56
   Although salaries by function were estimated down to 2006, the estimation could not take account of changes in the
number of personnel by type of facility for 2006-2012. The 2013 estimates have the least margin of error.
57
   The salary breakdowns by facilities group district hospitals of category 1 and 2 (CHD1 and CHD2) in a single
category (CHDR) while the budget programs for 2013 include CHD1 expenses in basic care and CHD2 expenses in
hospital care. The ratios of specialized to non-specialized staff salaries in CHRD by regions are used to estimate the
salaries going to CHD2s, which excluded from the total presented here.

81.     Given the importance of primary care dispensed in tertiary hospitals, as discussed in section
C, the argument for excluding secondary and tertiary care facilities when assessing regional equity needs
to be qualified. Although it is not desirable to increase the number of tertiary care facilities due to
economies of scale, primary care staff in these facilities could be deployed to different facilities at no cost
in terms of efficiency. Moving forward, there needs to be a more rational allocation of primary care staff.
82.      In summary, whether restricting expenditures to primary health care facilities, primary
health care personnel, or including all current expenditures, expenditures of the MoH are
characterized by a strongly regressive regional distribution. It is very likely, especially considering
that the distribution of total health expenditures is less regressive than MoH expenditures, that externally
financed health expenditures not going through government accounts are progressively distributed.
Nevertheless, it is clear that efforts need to be made on the part of the Government to reach poorer regions.
In particular, given that the MoH covers most expenditures on medical personnel salaries, efforts to better
deploy medical staff to poorer regions need to be made. Indeed, given the large weight of salaries in MoH
expenditures, these results are consistent with an unequal distribution of primary health care personnel
across regions.

     3. Rural/urban differences
83.      Given the differences in poverty ratios and consumption per capita between urban and rural areas
(Table 15), it is important to look more closely at rural and semi-rural disadvantaged areas. In order to do
the analysis by type of residence, we used the official delineation of communes into rural and urban
categories according to the 2011 Decree.58 Communes were classified into four levels of urbanization so
as to minimize the “border” effects and avoid over-identifying communes as rural.59 Although salaries
cannot be identified by type of residence, the share of non-wage recurrent expenditure that can be identified
in the data is sufficient to be indicative of the level of activity.60

84. Analysis of expenditure shares by type of residence show that less five percent goes to rural
    communes. Considering that approximately two-thirds of the population live in rural areas, this
    represents a highly unequal distribution of expenditure shares. On average 36 percent going to large
    urban centers, 46 percent to smaller urban areas and 13 percent to the semi-rural or peri-urban areas
    (Figure 33 and Table 16).

D2. Out-of-Pocket Household Expenditures: Do They Impact Regional and Income
Inequalities?

85.     Looking at the size and evolution of household expenditures in a context of increasing poverty, it
is important to gauge the need for the Government to relieve some of the financial burden on poorer
households. The results of this section need to be interpreted in the context of changes in utilization, in
particular whether people tend to seek care when they are sick. The analysis below is based on data from
the 2005 and 2010 Household Surveys and the UN Household Survey on progress towards the Millennium
Development Goals in 2012.

 1.      Distribution of OOP expenditure by income level and region
86.    Households in Madagascar spent less than 1 percent of their budget on health in 2005, just
above 1 percent in 2010, and 1.4 percent in 2012. The distribution of consumption by quintile is given in
                                                        62
                                                                                     Madagascar PER – Health | Section D

Figure 34. In interpreting the data, it is important to note that the poverty level is situated around the
average level of consumption in the fourth quintile (and closer to the high end of the fourth quintile in
2010). In 2005, the distribution of health expenditure as a share of the household budget was slightly
increasing with consumption, except in the middle range. In 2010, however, the distribution changed very
much to the disadvantage of the poorest quintile. In absolute terms, average household expenditure per
person increased 22 percent in the poorest quintile, 19 percent in the top quintile, 9 percent in the fourth,
and 5 percent in the second, while it decreased 5 percent in the third quintile. In 2012, however, the increase
for the poorest quintile slowed to 15 percent, while the average household expenditures increased 18 and
37 percent for the second and third quintiles and over 50 percent for the richest quintile.

87.    Average per capita OOP across regions increases as regional poverty decreases, which is most
noticeable in the richest three regions (Diana, Boeny, Analamanga). Figure 35). The correlation
between OOP spending per capita and poverty rates is negative, statistically significant, and increasing
from 2005 to 2010 (from 0.44 to 0.68). There are, however, large difference between regions as well as
unequal gains and losses between 2005 and 2010.

88.     Four of the six poorest regions experienced larger than average OOP. Some regions in
particular stand out. Androy, which is the second poorest region, had one of the higher OOP rates in the
country in 2005, and despite a decrease in 2010, it still has higher than average OOP per capita. In 2010,
expenditure per capita in Sofia reached the same level as in Analamanga, with the lowest poverty rate.
Menabe had an OOP rate well below expected, given its relative poverty rate in 2005, but fully lost its
advantage in 2010 after its OOP per capita rate more than doubled.
89.     No statistically significant correlation was found between the average OOP burden (share of
OOP in the household budget) and poverty rates. As Figure 36 shows, there are large variations between
regions, and Androy as an important outlier, with a OOP burden much higher than all other regions and the
highest poverty rate in 2010 and in 2012 (94.5 and 96.7 percent).

 2. Relationship between OOP spending and MoH expenditures using regional data
90.      The relationship between MOH recurrent expenditures and OOP per capita is positive
overall (Figure 37). This is mainly due to differences in the richest three and poorest three regions. The
correlation coefficients between average OOP per person and per capita recurrent expenditures of the MoH
by region are positive and increase when comparing 2005 and 2010 (0.42 to 0.59). When looking at average
OOP expenditure as a share of the household budget, however, the relationship is no longer statistically
significant.

 3.     Analysis of “catastrophic” OOP expenditure
91.      The scarcity of risk pooling mechanisms in Madagascar, combined with a cost recovery
system that makes public health care expensive for the poorer quintiles, leaves poor households
especially vulnerable to catastrophic health expenditures. Health expenditures are considered catastrophic
if they force the individual or household to engage in behavior that has long-term negative effects on their
economic well-being. This could involve selling capital assets, heavy borrowing to pay for medical care,
lost wages during an illness, or reducing the consumption of subsistence goods. Following Xu and al.

(2003) and the approach used by the WHO, health expenditure is defined as catastrophic if payments for
health care exceed 40 percent of the household’s non-subsistence expenditure or its capacity to pay.61 62
92.     Few households are subject to catastrophic expenditure, but prevalence increased in all
quintiles between 2005 and 2010, and in the middle class in 2012. The proportion of households with
catastrophic health expenditure is low in Madagascar, affecting less than 2.5 percent of household overall,
with significantly higher prevalence in the highest consumption quintile (up to 4 percent in 2010) and very
low prevalence in the lowest quintiles (Figure 38).63 The results for 2010 show increasing overall
proportions of households with catastrophic OOP spending, but the prevalence is slightly decreasing in

93.     Very low percentages of households with catastrophic expenditures in the poorest quintiles
are usually indicative of “system failure”; i.e., the poor just do not seek care. In Madagascar, the
proportion of people not seeking care when ill is fairly high, an average of 70 percent in 2012, across all


61
   Following the work of Xu and al. (2003), this capacity is defined as the household consumption expenditure
available after basic needs have been met. Given that the poorer the household the higher the share of consumption
devoted to food, the subsistence expenditure is defined as the average of food expenditure of households whose food
share was in the 45th to 55th percentile. Capacity to pay of the ith household is defined as:
                                                CTPi = EXPi – SE45-55i
where SE45-55i corresponds to the average food expenditures of households in the 45 th to 55th percentiles and adjusted
for the size of the ith household. In cases when total expenditure was less than this basic subsistence level, the own
household’s observed food expenditure was used instead.
62
   The World Bank defines catastrophic expenditures as spending 10 percent or more of total expenditure at household
level on health care costs. (Pradhan and Prescott 2002; Ranson 2002; Wagstaff and van Doorslaer 2003)
63
   A recent analysis of catastrophic spending in Zimbabwe (PER) returned similar results, with catastrophic health
expenditures varying from 0.3 percent in the poorest quintile to 1.9 percent in the richest quintile (although the
subsistence income was calculated including some basic clothing and shelter) Catastrophic expenditure can, however,
be very high in some countries where people actually use the health system. In Ukraine, for example, 25 percent of
households in the two lowest quintiles faced catastrophic health spending, but the prevalence decreased in highest
wealth quintiles.

the quintiles. More than 55 percent of the richest households and 65 percent of the poorest do not seek
health care. Low utilization (rather than high cost) is therefore a plausible explanation for the low incidence
of catastrophic expenditure. When looking at people who do not seek care for financial reasons, only the
poorest quintile clearly stands out in 2010, at 25 percent, while the range in the other quintiles is 10 (richest
quintile) to 15 (second and third quintile) (Figure 39).

94.     Catastrophic expenditures may cause 4.5 percent of people in the richest quintile and 3
percent in the fourth quintile to fall below the poverty line. The results above need to be put in
perspective. Nearly 80 percent of the population in Madagascar lives under the poverty line. Most of the
people in the fourth quintile are poor, and the minimum consumption level in the richest quintile is only 9
percent above the poverty line. Therefore, households at the bottom of the fifth and top of the fourth quintile
are most in danger of falling into poverty and may experience negative long-term financial impacts from
catastrophic expenditures (given that the poor have little to lose in terms of assets). In addition, OOP health
expenditures are also impoverishing because they can cause those that are already poor to call deeper into
poverty.


D3. Distribution of MoH Expenditures by Socioeconomic Category of User: Benefit
Incident Analysis

95.     A Benefit Incidence Analysis (BIA) can be carried out using the simple utilization (or usage)
approach, assuming that all individuals using the service receive the same benefits.64 The analysis is based
on (a) decomposing users of public health facilities by income level, and (b) decomposing public health
expenditures by type of health facility.65 For Madagascar, the first part of this process relies on good quality

64
   This is the approach used in Glick and Razakamanantsoa (2002) in their BIA for health and education using 1990
data for Madagascar.
65
   The usage approach assumes that all individuals using the service receive the same benefits. It also assumes that the
quality of health services does not depend on average income levels in the area. Although these assumptions are not
realistic, the approach has the advantage of being less demanding in terms of data quantity and quality. The unit cost
approach to BIA is not be feasible for health given the structure of expenditure accounting.
                                                                     68
                                                                      Madagascar PER – Health | Section D

data from the periodic Household Survey, which provides information on the marginal benefits of
government expenditure and how each segment of the population would benefit from additional spending
directed to different types of facilities. The second part of the BIA depends principally on the ability to
decompose public expenditures by type of facility to match the type of facilities identified in the Household
Survey. As noted in section C2, data are not readily available to break down salaries by type of facility,
but a reconstruction can be done using multiple data sources and approximations using average salaries by
type of personnel (Annex 3).

     1. Marginal benefit of government expenditure by type of facility
96.      Additional spending on CSB1s (basic health centers) is pro-poor. The distribution of benefits
is consistent on the primary level. The distribution of users by quintile of consumption for different types
of facilities in 2005, 2010 and 2012, using Lorenz curves, are shown in figures 40 and 41. Spending on
CSB2s benefited all quintiles approximately equally in 2010 (equality appears to have slightly improved
compared to 2005, likely due to the transformation of CSB1 into CSB2). Inequality becomes apparent at
the CHD level and clearly increases as we move up into levels of care toward CHUs, which are clearly
utilized by the rich. No clear conclusion can be drawn about changes in inequality across 2005, 2010 and
2012, especially at the hospital level, but this could be due to the fact that results are based on much lower
sample sizes in 2005.66 Consistent with the catastrophic expenditure analysis above, the poorest households
in the lowest two quintiles rarely use secondary and tertiary hospitals.

   Results regarding hospital utilization rest on very small unweighted sample sizes. The Household Survey question
on visits to health facilities was asked of respondents who had had a health problem in the previous two weeks, which
is a very short time period to assess hospital usage. A total of only 13 respondents went to a CHU, 30 to a CHRR, and
193 to a CHD in 2005; and a total of 38, 107 and 423 in 2010. These numbers were 58, 117 and 316 in the Development
Goals National Monitoring Survey (ENSOMD) of 2012.

     2. Benefit incidence of MoH expenditure
97.      On average between 2010 and 2013, the MoH spent about 20 billion 2013 Ar. on non-wage
expenditures to basic health and hospital services (based on program budgets), and 67 billion on salaries to
personnel working in health facilities (excluding all administrative units).67 It is important to understand
how much of this money benefited the poor. The goal of the BIA is to estimate benefits across consumption
quintiles in terms of utilization. Given differences in classifications and the fact that wage expenditures are
so large relative to non-wage expenditures (7 times larger in 2013), the analysis is done in two parts: a)
allocating non-wage expenditures by quintile and b) allocating wage expenditures.
98.      The BIA for MOH non-wage expenditures reveals that benefits are found to be regressive
with the average benefits going to individuals in the richest quintile two to four times higher than
those going to individuals in the poorest two quintiles (Table 17). The two poorest quintiles were found
to benefit the least in most cases. The BIA rests on two groups: users of primary health care facilities and
users of hospital facilities.68 Whether we consider CHR users as benefiting from basic health services
(method 1) or hospital services (method 2), and whether we look at 2013 or at average expenditures over
the last four years, benefits are found to be regressive. Results from 2013 are more regressive when users
of CHRs are assumed to benefit from basic health care expenditures rather than hospital-related
expenditures (method 1), given that basic health care expenditures were lower than hospital expenditures
in 2013 (0.8:1 ratio compared to 1.7:1 on average since 2010). In addition, the total benefit was substantially
lower in 2013. Figures 42 and 43 illustrate the regressive nature of MoH non-wage spending. The data



67
  In 2013, the numbers were 11 billion for non-wage expenditures and 73 billion for wages.
68
   Programs in the 2010-2013 budgets group all expenditures for basic health centers (CSB1 and CSB2) and for level
1district hospital into basic health care services, while the Household Survey separates CSB1 and CSB2 but does not
distinguish between district hospitals with and without surgery (CHD1 and CHD2).

indicates that 40-60 percent of these expenditures benefited people living under the poverty line (fourth
quintile and below).

99.    Benefits from MoH wage expenditures on personnel in health facilities (excluding all
personnel in administrative units) show that the richest quintile benefits 3.6 times more than the
poorest quintile, and at least twice as much as households in any other quintile.
100.    Distribution of benefits from all MoH expenditures directed to primary health and hospital
care is pro-rich with the richest quintile benefiting from 40 percent of total expenditures. Focusing
on the distribution of expenditures rather than on actual amounts, benefits can be presented in a Lorenz-
curve type graph that accumulates benefits across quintiles, the 45 degree line being the line of perfect
equality (Figure 44). Although the distribution of wages by facility drives the result, non-wage expenditures
also benefit the rich disproportionately. 69




69
   It would have been interesting to conduct this analysis over two time periods. Unfortunately, the lack of budget programs prior to 2009 does not
allow for reproduction of the analysis of non-wage expenditures. Although wage expenditures could be traced back to 2006, the estimation was
based on strong assumptions that limit the extent to which the allocation of personnel across facilities could change, and this would greatly limit
the interpretation. This exercise, however, should be repeated in the future using these results as benchmarks.

Note: The distribution is based on benefits from utilization by type of facility and expenditures directed to primary and hospital care (for non-wage
expenditure). Method 1 calculates the benefits across quintiles, assuming that CHRs provide basic care services. Method 2 assumes that CHRs
provide all hospital services. The total take the average of method 1 and 2.

101.     CHUs absorb about one third of all MoH expenditures directed to health facilities but are
very sparingly used by the poor, while CSB1s are the only facilities that are primarily used by the
poor. In fact, all other facilities are used by the richest quintile in a greater proportion than their population
share. The distribution of benefits depends greatly on the utilization rates and size of expenditures at the
CHU and CSB1 levels. A few data manipulations reveal that changing the distribution of benefits to be
more equitable is not an easy task. Transferring expenditures from CHUs to CSB1s could reduce the
inequality, although, given the low utilization of health facilities by the poor in Madagascar, it is not feasible
to generate a progressive distribution scenario. Several scenarios were examined and the resulting
distribution of benefits compared to the 2013 benchmark.
                           Scenario 1 – Reallocate general practitioners: Deploy two general practitioners per district from
                           the CHUs to the CSB1s (775 general doctors were employed in CHUs in 2013).

                           Scenario 2 – Increase the number of CSB1s: Add 300 new primary care facilities and staff them
                           with one doctor and one support person (this scenario assumes that the utilization profile stays as
                           for existing CSB1).

                           Scenario 3 – Reallocate CHU staff time to CSB1s: Dispatch one third of the CHU staff each year
                           to provide health care in CSB1 facilities.

                           Scenario 4 – Relocate CSB2 facilities to reach more poor households, and increase staff:
                           Strategically relocate half of the CSB2 facilities so they are closer to poorer segments of the
                                                                         73
                                                                                        Madagascar PER – Health | Section D

                          population (equivalent to allocating half of CSB2 expenditures to CSB1s), and increase the CSB2
                          staff so there is at least one general practitioner per facility (currently 1,190 doctors for 1,620
                          facilities) by deploying the equivalent number of CHU general practitioners to CSB2.

102.     The system clearly needs to improve its ability to reach the poor using some of the resources
currently used to staff tertiary facilities. Figure 45 presents each scenario, given 2013 wage expenditures
and the same utilization profile as above (except for scenario 4). It is obvious that marginal changes to
expenditure allocation would not make a large difference in inequality. Scenarios 1 and 2, which are
strongly equity enhancing in a marginal sense, barely change the overall picture. Scenarios 3 and 4 do make
a difference, reducing inequality by more than half, but are unrealistic to implement without large-scale
structural reforms and economic reforms. A reduction of the share of salaries in MoH expenditures would
also create more opportunities for change.

D4. Assessment of Gender Equality

103.    Overall, there is no discrimination against girls and women in health care. Gender is another
dimension of inequality that has been shown to have important implications for growth relates to the ability
to provide care to girls and women. On average, females visit all levels of health facilities in greater
numbers than men (Figure 46). The CHU result is highest but cannot be compared to the other facilities
because it is based on a much smaller sample.




                                                                          74

104.    The higher overall proportion of females using health centers is explained by the larger
proportion of female who were sick (7-8 percentage points more than males in both surveys). Out of
those who were sick in the two weeks period to the surveys, the same proportion of males and females
sought care, which excludes the reverse possibility of a male bias against seeking care (Table 18).

105.     Overall averages gender differences across consumption quintiles are not significant. Looking
at primary health care facilities for which number of visits are sufficiently large by quintile, the only female
disadvantage is in the second quintile for primary hospitals, but the difference is not large enough to be
significant (Figure 47).

106.    Given these results, and in particular the fact that there is no significant differences in female
advantage by type of facility, an analysis of the distribution of benefits of MoH expenditure would not
yield additional information than what is presented here.



                                                   Key Findings
 Overall, the distribution of public spending is highly inequitable with per capita total health expenditures
 negatively correlated with poverty rates. This has significant implications for the overall health of the population
 especially in the current context of Madagascar where over 80% of the population is living in absolute poverty.
 Distribution of public spending
    Looking at changes in the distribution over time, Antananarivo alone has been driving the increase in current
     expenditures. Expenditures in other provinces have been relatively stable.
    Salary shares have remained stable over time but show some inequality with respect to population shares. Most
     receive less than their estimated population shares.
    Expenditures are strongly negatively correlated to poverty ratios.
    Whether restricting expenditures to primary health care facilities, primary health care personnel, or including
     all current expenditures, expenditures of the MoH are characterized by a strongly regressive regional
     distribution. Regions with lower poverty rates receive more per capita, while regions with higher poverty rates
     receive less.
    With regards to non-wage expenditures, average benefits going to individuals in the richest quintile are two
     to four times higher than those going to individuals in the poorest two quintiles with the two poorest quintiles
     were found to benefit the least in most cases.
    Likewise, benefits from MoH wage expenditures on personnel in health facilities (excluding all personnel in
     administrative units) are also clearly regressively distributed. The richest quintile benefits 3.6 times more than
     the poorest quintile, and at least twice as much as households in any other quintile.
    Non-wage recurrent expenditure shares by type of residence have remained relatively stable with only 13
     percent to semi-rural or peri-urban areas, and less than 5 percent to the rural communes. Considering that
     approximately two-thirds of the population live in rural areas, this represents a highly unequal distribution of
     expenditure shares.

                                                          76
                                                                     Madagascar PER – Health | Section D


Household spending and utilization by quintile
 The scarcity of prepayment mechanisms in Madagascar, combined with a cost recovery system that makes
   public health care expensive for the poor.
 Few households are subject to catastrophic expenditure in Madagascar, but prevalence increased in all quintiles
   between 2005 and 2010, and in the middle class in 2012.
 Very low percentages of households with catastrophic expenditures in the poorest quintiles are usually
   indicative of “system failure”; i.e., the poor just do not seek care. Low utilization (rather than high cost) is
   therefore a plausible explanation for the low incidence of catastrophic expenditure.
 Inequality becomes apparent at the district hospital level (CHD) and clearly increases moving into upper levels
   of care toward regional hospital level (CHU), which are clearly utilized by the rich. Consistent with the
   catastrophic expenditure analysis, the poorest households in the lowest two quintiles rarely use secondary and
   tertiary hospitals.
                                               Policy implications
Given the strong inverse relationship between poverty and good health, the need for publicly provided health
care is greater among the poorer populations. Better equity in the distribution of spending in the health sector
will need to take into consideration better resource allocation and targeting of the population, improvement in
access to health care especially in rural areas and reducing the financial burden on households.
More equitable distribution of resources
In the current context, Madagascar needs to urgently agree on and implement pro-poor strategies to ensure better
equity of health expenditure and health services amongst the population. This includes:
      Redistribution of health expenditure according to geographic distribution of the population to also benefit
         the poor
        Better allocation of existing human resources to be more equitable to the poor. Consider a diagnostic of
         the current human resource system.
        Additional spending on first line health facilities (CSB1s), which are utilized more by the poor and
         maintaining spending on second line health facilities (CSB2s), which benefits all quintiles approximately
         equally. In addition, consider reallocation of CSB2 so they are more accessible to households.
        Reallocate regional hospital staff time to CSB1s and CSB2s.

In this context, an updated census, poverty map and a Demographic Health Survey are needed to help inform
decisions on resource distribution.

Tailor interventions for the poorest quintiles
   This analysis reiterates the need to implement interventions to improve health seeking behavior tailored
    specifically to the poor with mechanisms such as vouchers, conditional/non-conditional cash transfers,
    exemption schemes, non-monetary incentives (e.g. safe delivery kits) and support to the expanding the reach
    of health practitioners and health workers into the community.
   Redesigning existing mechanisms to be more effective such as the Equity Fund and social health insurance
    schemes

Note: The choice of categories is determined and limited by what could be identified in the accounts rather than what
we would like to measure relative to specific needs. In addition, the amounts obtained are not exhaustive of all
expenditures in the specific program (except for the MCH program), because expenditures could be included in some
other general administrative units and therefore not identified by specific target. Some expenditure were identified as
directed to specific target groups (vulnerable people in particular) based on SOA created in 2012 but the amount were
small.

data are done using the region rather than the section code which had salaries of the same regions spread into several
provinces; in the end the difference in method did not produce noticeable differences as the difference in allocations
cancelled out.
