Executive Summary

Introduction

Egypt is a middle income country with a rapidly growing population, high levels of unemployment and a
heavily skewed income distribution. The Government of Egypt (GoE) has placed a high priority on
providing drinking water and sanitation services and is currently implementing 1400 projects and with a
2014/15 budget of LE 4.2 billion (USD 587 million). Most investment over the last 20 years has been on
water supply and this has raised access to safe drinking water from 39% to 93% whereas sanitation
services have lagged and only about 12% of the population in rural areas are connected to piped
sewerage systems with adequate wastewater treatment. Most people in rural areas use traditional
permeable septic tanks which due to the high water table in the Nile Delta lead to sewage in the streets,
the collapse of buildings and very high septage emptying costs. Rural sanitation is therefore now a
major priority of the government particularly in the low lying and densely populated Nile Delta. The GoE
has started implementing major sanitation programs and a major part of the current budget is allocated
to sanitation.

The National Rural Sanitation Program (NRSP) was launched in 2014 with the goal of serving all the rural
population by 2037 and a development objective to “accelerate access to rural sanitation services and to
ensure sustainable service delivery”. It has an estimated cost of LE 100 million (USD 14 billion) and will
cover 4700 villages and 27,000 satellite villages. The initial focus of the NRSP is a program to cover 769
“polluting” villages in 7 governorates that discharge untreated wastewater surface watercourses that
ends at the Al Salam Canal and the Rosetta Branch Canal.

The World Bank Group (WBG) will support the NRSP through the Program for Results (PforR) financing
instrument, where funds are released on achievement of results measured using Disbursement Linked
Indicators (DLIs), rather than on the basis of expenditures. The PforR approach focuses Bank support on
helping governments improve the design and implementation of their programs using country systems
and directly linking achievement of results to the disbursement of Bank funds. The PforR, the Program,
is designed to increase sustainable sanitation services and reduce pollution from wastewater in three of
the seven governorates in the national program, namely Beheria, Sharkia and Dakahlia. The scale of the
Program is defined by the implementation budget of USD 1.1 bn, with USD 550m in phase 1. In addition
there is a proposed USD 3.5 million grant for capacity building Technical Assistance and a transfer of
USD 7m from another WBG project: The Second Integrated Sanitation and Sewerage Infrastructure
Project (ISSIP 2) for establishing the a Program Management Unit (PMU) and associated services. The
Government of Egypt (GoE) is currently funding water and sanitation projects through the National
Organization for Potable Water and Sanitary Drainage (NOPWASD) where the majority of funds are
being spent on sanitation in secondary cities and rural areas. For the 3 governorates the current

planning for sanitation expenditures is LE 966 million (USD 130 million) which indicates a co-financing of
sanitation infrastructure of just over 25%.

This document, the Environmental and Social Systems Assessment (ESSA), has been prepared by the
Bank team, according to the requirements of WBG Operational Policy OP9.00 for PforR financing for
adequately manage the environmental and social effects of the program. The ESSA aims at reviewing
the capacity of existing government systems to plan and implement effective measures for
environmental and social impact management and to determining if any measures would be required to
strengthen them.

The Bank’s assessment team used various approaches to review the environment and social systems
that are relevant to the program. It included review of legislation and guidelines, existing WSC
procedures and relevant documentation, review of similar projects, field visits to existing sanitation
facilities in the Program area and analysis of different effects.

The preparation of the ESSA involved a series of consultation activities that targeted wide range of
stakeholders related to the sanitation sector. In addition to the consultation with the HCWW and the
WSCs, number of consultations was arranged with local stakeholder in the villages where the program is
going to be implemented including villagers. Consultation activities were also extended to number of
the communities that are served with formal sanitation system and selected unserved communities. The
team also conducted a number of transact walks and short semi-structured interviews with key
informants from the visited villages.

Program Description

The Program Development Objectives (PDO) are strengthening institutions for increasing access and
improving rural sanitation services in three participating governorates in Egypt. The PDO level outcomes
include (i) increased access demonstrated by number of people provided with access to “improved
sanitation facilities” under the project; (ii) annual performance assessment plans designed and
implemented; and (iii) strengthened institutional arrangements demonstrated by the adoption of a new
National Rural Sanitation Strategy.

The Program will be implemented over a period of 5 years and will focus on achieving 3 main result
areas:

    -   Improved sanitation access (rehabilitated, extended, and new facilities): This results area
        encompasses the planning, design and construction of new sanitation facilities, including new
        networks to maximize the capacity of existing WWTPs or extended existing WWTPs that will
        connect an additional 833,300 people to piped sanitation systems that have effective
        wastewater treatment. In order to ensure that increased access supported through this Results
        Area is linked to more sustainable service delivery, the Program will put in place a system of

                                                                                                        9
           Performance Based Capital Grants (PBCG) from the Central Government to the WSCs to support
           priority rural sanitation investments identified through the Five Year Plans and included in the
           Annual Capital Investment Plan of the WSCs
      -    Improved Operational Systems and Practices of WSCs: The rationale for this result area is to
           ensure the sustainability of the sanitation investments and the provision of a long term high
           quality sanitation service to the beneficiaries. The activities under this result area include
           improving investment planning, operations and maintenance as well as service delivery through
           the compensation and reward mechanisms built into annual performance assessments (APA).
           APAs will be designed and implemented on a transparent and predictable basis centered on a
           formula taking into account of four key dimensions: Operational; Financial; Institutional; and
           Stakeholder engagement.
      -    Strengthened National Sector Framework: The rationale for this result area is that the WSCs do
           not operate in a vacuum and there are several activities that are critical to ensuring the long
           term sustainability of the Program which need to be addressed at national level by the PMU and
           others. The activities in this result area include development of a tariff structure for water and
           sanitation services that would enable cost recovery; (ii) the formulation of a revised and
           strengthened National Rural Sanitation Strategy and the creation of a Central Unit (i.e. the PMU)
           which will be responsible for the coordination of the National Rural Sanitation Program and
           implementation of the Strategy; and (iii) finalization of the standard operating procedures for
           land acquisition.. The DLIs relevant to the results are illustrated in the following table.

 To serve the NRSP, MHUUC have set up a Program Management Unit (NRSP-PMU). The PMU will be the
 formal implementing agency for the PforR but with day to day implementation delegated to the WSCs.
 The PforR activities will be carried out by a number of executing agents. The main executing agency will
 be the WSCs (through PIUs) who will be responsible for result area 1 (sanitation access); the WSCs and
 HCWW will both act as executing agencies for result area 2 (operational improvements) and, the
 MHUUC and others will act as executing agencies for result area 3 (enabling environment).

 A Program Management Consultancy Firm (PMCF) will be attached to the PMU to assist in carrying out
 its preparation, oversight, coordination and reporting tasks. WSC Implementation Support Consultants
 (ISC) will be attached to a PIU in each of the three WSCs to assist the WSCs in carrying out construction
 planning and management and to improve their performance in this area.

 The PMU will support the WSCs to measure progress using M&E system and will collate the results to
 assess progress in achieving the DLIs. Once satisfied with the accuracy of the reporting, the PMU will
 present evidence of the DLI achievement to an Independent Verification Agency (IVA), which is tasked
 with verifying the results.

 Description of the Existing Environmental and Social Management System

                                                                                                                           11
In general the local legislation, policies and guidelines sufficiently addresses the environmental and
social issues associated with the Program, with few gaps. In terms of complying with those standards
and integrating them in the procedures of HCWW/WSCs, there are many gaps. The limited institutional
capacity is one of the main drawback in the existing procedures of HCWW/WSCs as many of the
required environmental and social measures were carried out by NOPWASD which left the HCWW/WSCs
with limited practical experience in those areas. Also some issues, such as sludge handling and HSE
issues, require resources that are not readily available in WSCs. Description of the current procedures
and correspondent gaps in complying with national legislation, policies and guidelines are discussed
below.

Environmental Assessment

Environmental assessment for projects is included in the Law 4/1994 modified by Law 9/2009 or “ The
Law for the Environment”, which is the main legislation regulating environmental protection in Egypt, it
is being regulated by The Ministry of State for Environmental Affairs (MSEA) and its executive agency the
Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA). Since the effectiveness of the Law in 1994 significant
improvements have been introduced to the environmental legal system following the gained experience
through implementing the law in the past 20 years. According to Law 4/1994 the Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA) is a licensing requirement for development projects that are likely to cause impacts to
the environment. The existing EIA Guidelines (modified in 2009) include detailed requirements for the
EIA process, including social assessment and consultation, and is compatible with the WBG
environmental assessment requirements. The Guidelines are even more stringent than many other
international environmental assessment regulations as it consider any sanitation project to be from the
highest assessment category, which is not the conclusion reached by the ESSA team as later indicated.

Regarding the procedures of environmental assessment, the EIA preparation and fulfillment of the EEAA
requirements is well defined in the Guidelines. Also The EIA approval is well integrated in the licensing
system for new projects, especially the sanitation projects.

For the sanitation sector, NOPWASD used to take the lead for undertaking EIAs as it is responsible for
the new investments. Therefore, the WSCs have limited capacity in environmental assessment and
keeping Environmental Register in compliancy with Law 4/1994. This gap has been addressed in the PAP.

Effluent Standards

The Nile Protection Law 48/1982 is the main legislation regulating water quality in the River Nile, its two
branches, canals, drains and groundwater aquifers. Although the effluent standards in Law 48/1982 are
not highly stringent if compared to effluent standards in other countries, the application context in
Egypt shows that it is actually very demanding, mainly due to the large uncovered areas with sanitation
services and the amount of investments needed to connect those areas to secondary treatment with
disinfection.


                                                                                                        12
Most of the WWTPs in the Program areas are complying with Law 48/1982 standards of effluent quality.
This is usually verified at the WWTP level through taking daily samples from the influent, effluent and
different points at the treatment stream, and when some water quality issues arise there would be
direct coordination to improve the operation at the problem area to return to the standards. Usually
such plants meet the effluent quality standards except for few exceptional cases where some
operational problems arise.

On the other hand, there are some WWTPs that are known for being non-compliant with the effluent
standards for different factors. The common reason for this is that those WWTPs require investments
for major repairs or extensions to provide sufficient treatment. Some of the overloaded WWTPs, which
face operational problems, tend to bypass the discharges in excess to its effective capacity to the drain.
This is not a documented procedure or a technical recommendation, but some WWTP managers tend to
do that for keeping their effluent quality to the extent possible, especially that the bypass line, or the
discharge outfall to the drain is not monitored, but inspection bodies usually take effluent samples from
the effluent collection point after chlorination. Furthermore, some WSCs connect villages to PSs which
are not connected to WWTPs due to lack of funding for constructing force mains, so these PSs discharge
untreated sewage to drains. This is defined as “negative discharge” and is one of the shortcomings that
are addressed by the PAP.

Handling of Sludge

The handling of sludge generated at WWTPs is regulated through Law 93/1962 and the Executive
Regulations by Decree 44/2000. According to the Law if the dried sludge is to be used as organic
fertilizers it should meet certain standards otherwise it should be landfilled or safely incinerated.

These standards are generally equivalent with international sludge standards, however, in terms of
application, WSCs do not monitor the sludge quality as required by Law 93/1962 and Decree 44/2000,
before selling it as fertilizer. This has been addressed in the PAP.

Management of Sewerage Networks

Connecting households, and other commercial industrial facilities, to the sewerage networks is
controlled under Law 93/1962 and Decree 44/2000. The Law provides standards for the wastewater
parameters (that could be accepted in the network), so that industries and commercial establishments
generating high load wastewater should install pretreatment units for their wastewater before
discharging to the sewer. These standards are frequently monitored and inspected for industrial
establishments, but usually frequently inspected for commercial establishments and rarely inspected for
animal barns and farm slurry, which is most relevant to the rural areas covered by the program.

The design and operation of networks and pump stations are regulated through the Engineering Codes
issued by Decrees 286/1990 and 268/1997 respectively. The Codes provides the standards that should

                                                                                                       13
be applied during design, construction and operation of networks and PSs to avoid blockage, seepage,
structural collapse, hydraulic and electromechanical malfunctioning … etc. Private networks are not
allowed except after having licensing from the regulatory authority and after fulfilling the requirement
of the Engineering Codes, however, some villages still build private networks by self-initiatives that ends
at watercourses. It is very difficult for regulating bodies to prevent these private networks.

Handling of Septage

The discharge of septage evacuated from individual septic tanks and cesspits to freshwater canals or
drains is not allowed according to Law 48/1982, but, In terms of application, the implementation of
these conditions showed little success due to difficulty of enforcement. Usually the septage is removed
from cesspits in unserved areas by local contractors using tankers, and then they discharge the septage
in the nearest location in an agriculture drain or even in freshwater canals. Furthermore, most of the
WSCs do not allow for receiving septage in their sewers and WWTPs, as there is no system in place to
allow for regulating the receiving of septage. WSCs would usually be unwilling to accept septage with
high organic loads that would add to the shock loads received in WWTPs and may affect their
performance and the quality of the final effluent. The lack of an official system to handle septage,
although helps in reducing shock loads at WWTPs level, risks attaining the objectives of sanitation
projects on surface water quality, as the unregulated small scale septage discharges to surface water will
continue to be one of the major pressures on water quality. Accordingly on site sanitation, including
official septage management system that would serve remote and satellite villages, would be included in
the Result Areas of the Program, this system will be identified during the feasibility studies for each
governorate.

Handling of Hazardous Substances

The handling procedures of hazardous substances and wastes are included in Law 4/1994 with adequate
level of details. The handling of chorine cylinders, which is the most common hazardous substances
handled within WWTPs, is further detailed in the Engineering Code for Wastewater Treatment Plants
(Decree 169/1997). Also the Engineering Codes for fire protection include sufficient measures for
safeguarding against fire risks, however, in terms of application some of the facilities designs do not
follow these safeguards and sometimes safety issues arise during operation. The PAP includes measures
to overcome this issue through including H&S standards in the ToRs for the design works and allowing
H&S staff to review and verify the designs.

Solid Waste Management

Solid waste is usually accumulated in screens of WWTPs and PSs as well as removed from grit removal
chambers, this separated solid waste should be adequately handled by the facilities. Solid waste
management is regulated by specific articles of Law 4/1994, in addition to the General Cleansing Law


                                                                                                        14
38/1967. In terms of application, WSCs usually do not adequately collect and dispose of solid wastes at
licensed site. This gap has been addressed in the PAP.




                                                                                                    15
Health and Safety

The Labor Law (Law 12/2003) is the main legislation regulating H&S issues, the Law comprises a Chapter
on working environment and health and safety issues, and also includes a comprehensive annex on the
safety standards to minimize physical, dynamic, biological and chemical risks. Following the Law
standards would minimize occupational health and safety risks. In terms of application, the H&S
departments in WSCs do not have sufficient manpower to audit and follow-up the adherence of
sanitation facilities to H&S standards. Also many construction contractors do not usually comply with
H&S requirements and close supervision is required to ensure construction safety. This gap has been
addressed in the PAP.

Cultural Heritage

Law 117/1983 has been issued for protection of antiquities and culturally valuable sites. Being one of
the richest countries of the World with antiquities from ancient civilizations, the GoE gives the Law high
importance and weight. The Law includes stipulations for structural protection of known and unknown
antiquities through certain procedures for chance finds. The stipulations of the Law would adequately
safeguard against negative impacts during construction phase of the Program interventions, and the
Antiquity Authorities are closely inspecting the protection of registered sites.

Land tenure and Related Laws to Land Expropriation in Egypt

There are three main forms of land ownership in Egypt: public or state land (in Arabic Amlak Amiriya),
private land (in Arabic Mulk horr), and waqf land (land held as a trust/endowment for religious or
charitable purposes). Article 33 of the 2014 Constitution provides that “the State shall protect
ownership with its three types: the public, the private and the cooperative.” Article 35 of the
Constitution further provides that “private properties shall be protected, and the right to inheritance
thereto is secured”. According to the Constitution (Article 63), all types of involuntary relocation using
force or excessive violence is banned and whoever violating this article will be brought to court"

Law 10 of 1990 concerning the Expropriation of Ownership for Public Interest was issued to regulate the
cases where private land is needed for public interest projects. In addition, expropriation of property is
further regulated by Law 59 of 1979 concerning the Establishment of New Urban Communities and Law
3 of 1982 concerning Urban Planning. The term “public interest” in the context of expropriation has
been defined in Article 2 of Law 10/1990. Water supply and sewage projects are among the projects
identified by this article. Other laws and decrees added to the list of projects stipulated under article 2
of Law 10/1990.

Law 10/1990 has described the expropriation procedures starting with a declaration of public interest
pursuant to a Presidential Decree accompanied with a memorandum on the required project and a
complete plan for the project and its buildings (Law 59/1979 and Law 3/1982 provide that the Prime

                                                                                                        16
Minister issues the decree). The decree and the accompanying memorandum must be published in the
Official Gazette. A copy for the public is placed in the main offices of the concerned local government
unit. A number of operational steps take place afterwards until the land is acquired.

On the central level, the governmental agency in charge of the implementation of the expropriation acts
issued for public interest is the Egyptian General Authority for Land Survey (“ESA”), except for projects
handled by other entities pursuant to a law to be issued in this respect. As mentioned above, ESA is
charged with the formation of the expropriation and compensation committees. Usually the executing
body could be other Ministries (e.g., Ministry of Housing) or Governorate. Accordingly, this executing
agency would be responsible for paying the compensation to affected groups through ESA or under its
supervision, offering alternative resettlement options, and implementing the resettlement project. On
the local level, several local departments and directorates should be involved in the resettlement
program depending on the type of program to be implemented and the nature of land ownership.

Although Law 10/1990 does not clearly specify lessees as entitled to compensation, they implicitly fall
within the group of “right holders” referred to in the law. It is clear, however, that lessees may not have
recourse against the landlord for termination of their lease agreements as a result of the expropriation
act. Another important issue that has not been addressed in Egyptian law, is the right of squatters to be
compensated in cases of displacement or resettlement. The Egyptian legislation framework has not
recognized the rights of squatters). However, the Egyptian experiences in dealing with this issue has
shown the fact that due to the political pressure and the social dimension, the government has been
forced to provide an alternative for those groups of households whether in terms of alternative shelter,
cash liquidity or other types of in-kind compensation (e.g. jobs).




                                                                                                        17
Land acquisition procedures:

When a rural sanitation project is being planned and land is needed, priority is usually given to obtaining
land through state owned land as an avoidance strategy to prevent negative resettlement impacts on
population. In case of unavailability of state owned land, there are four other different approaches to
obtain the land for pumping stations and WWTPs, including i) voluntary land donation, ii) community
contribution which is a very common approach for pumping station; iii) willing buyer-willing seller;
and iv) acquiring land by using eminent domain. The WSCs are not heavily involved in the process of
finalizing land purchase (willing buyer willing seller approach) for pumping stations and waste water
treatment plants (WWPTs) because the part relates to investment for sanitation project is officially
mandated to National Organization for Potable Water and Sanitary Drainage (NOPWASD). There is no
legal obstacle for the WSCs to complete the process of acquiring land through both purchase and
donations, the lack of resources for the WSCs usually limit their chances in land acquisition, specifically
the purchase part. Accepting donated land or land obtained through community contribution for
pumping station is a more common area for the involvement of the WSCs compared to the purchase for
WWTP. The Properties Department under the Legal Department within WSC is responsible for the land
purchase (in the scarce cases of the WSCs’ involvement in land purchase) and also for accepting donated
land or land obtained through community land contribution for pumping stations. For WWTPs, the lands
are obtained mainly through willing buyer-willing seller approach. WSCs are reluctant to use eminent
domain to acquire land as it may take longer time.

Decrees and procedures for regulating households’ connection fees

As per law27 year 1978 regulating public resources for water and sanitation, covering the cost of the
households’ connection is the responsibility of the beneficiary. According to the WSCs, the exact amount
that each household is requested to pay depends on the distance of the house from the main force, the
number of houses participating in the communal inspection chambers and the amount of works and
material associated with each item. It is roughly estimated that each household should pay and average
of EGP 1300 to EGP 1500 to get the building connected to the public sanitation network once a project is
completed in the area. This connection fees get higher in some cases to reach EGP 3000.

Procedures for engaging with communities

Previously, HCWW was not heavily involved in planning and preparation of rural sanitation projects. The
formal role of the HCWW and the WSCs is more about O&M. No structured mechanism is followed to
carry out communities’ needs assessment for sanitation projects or to engage the communities in the
planning of the projects. In the cases when private land for pumping stations or WWTP is needed, the
WSCs play a role of more technical and legal nature in this regard. The social aspects related to land are
not very much taken into consideration. During projects construction (specifically the construction of
the networks), the WSCs play a supervisory role over the contractors. The monitoring of the
construction process has technical orientation nature. The social issue that may arise (e.g. damage in
                                                                                                        18
structures) are handled through a reactive approach. There is no local grievance system and systematic
methods for consultations with local communities during construction. During project operation and
maintenance, the HCWW and the WSCs have number of key mandates that involve community
engagement in the project operations and maintenance. Awareness raising, measuring community
satisfaction (which serve in projects’ monitoring) and handling grievance mechanisms are the key
relevant fronts for community engagement during projects’ operation. Water projects are significantly
over dominating the scope of work for these departments.

Procedures for Grievances Redress

The Hotline is one of the key formal grievance channels and the one which is meant, by design, to be the
single official channel. The HCWW is working to strengthen the Hotline system including the call centers
within the WSCs and is aiming, through this strengthening, to enable this channel to be the single official
uptake modality. However, in practice, most complaints are still being communicated through other
informal channels including verbally to laboratory staff, maintenance service staff, security, commercial
personnel or media. There is no strict documentation and record for the complaints received through
these informal channels.

Program Environmental and Social Benefits, Risks and Impacts

Screening of Category A-type interventions

The PforR instrument should not be used to finance activities that are likely to have significant adverse
environmental impacts that are sensitive, diverse, or unprecedented. These impacts may affect an area
broader than the sites or facilities subject to physical works. This definition is believed to be inapplicable
to Program interventions. Within the context in Egypt, the largest WWTP within the Program boundaries
is 30,000 m3/d which explicitly small compared to many large WWTPs in the country with capacities
reaching 2 Mm3/d. Previous experience with WBG projects shows that sewerage interventions are
classified as Category B projects, and also projects that involves relatively small WWPTs, such as the
ones that are included in the Program, are classified as Category B. It is worth noting that there are a
number of WWTPs, such as Gharb El Mansoura WWTP currently under construction with capacity
185,000 m3/d, is part of the government program but is not part of the PforR. There will be measures in
the PAP to ensure that DLI1 and DLI2 are not measured against connections to this WWTP so that the
boundaries of the PforR are clearly verified during implementation.

Risk screening against OP9.00 Core Principals

A preliminary risk assessment has been carried out using the Environmental and Social Risk Screening
Format included in OP 9.00, and the likely environmental and social effects have been addressed.
Regarding the context, the Program will be implemented in rural areas with health, economic and
psychological pressures and polluted watercourses in the downstream of the Nile, so the interventions
are expected to effectively address these geographic shortcomings. No sensitive habitats are located
                                                                                                   19
within the Program areas and the risk on culturally valuable sites is low. In terms of sustainability, the
Program is expected to enhance the sustainability of watercourses through enhancing their quality, the
sustainability of agriculture lands through alleviating the rising groundwater table problems and
improving the quality of irrigation water. In terms of institutional complexity, the environmental and
social issues will be handled through different bodies under the umbrella of MoHUUC and the system is
expected to operate without complexity. Regarding the institutional capacity, although is currently
limited, the PAP measures identify measures for improving the capacity. There are no governance or
corruption risks associated with the environmental aspects of the Program. The overall environmental
risks have been rated as medium and the overall social risks have been rated as substantial.

Environmental Benefits, risks and impacts

The overall impact of the Program is expected to be positive. The Program will allow for adequately
discharging and treating considerable amount of sewage according to the standards of Law 48/1982,
which was, prior to the Program, being inadequately collected and discharged to watercourses.

The environmental benefits are providing adequate treatment to about 90,000 m3/day used to be
inadequately discharged to watercourses, improving health conditions to the Program beneficiaries,
help in alleviating the rising groundwater table problem, and including septage management as part of
the interventions.

The overall environmental risks are medium, however, some individual risks are rated substantial. The
main environmental risks are: risks of improper handling of sludge (substantial), risk of improper
handling of solid wastes separated at WWTPS and PSs (medium), risks of discharging noncomplying
effluent (medium), risks to the safety of workers and neighbors of WWTPs from handling chlorine, diesel
and lab chemicals (medium), risks of sewerage blockage/leakage during operation especially private
networks (medium), risks on structural integrity of structures during dewatering operations (medium)
and risks of improper handling of chance find culturally valuable objects (low). Also the limited
institutional capacity of the WSCs poses substantial risk on the program implementation.

The main environmental impacts are: changing land use at the footprints of PSs and WWTPs, temporary
impacts during construction and impacts on receiving waters from compliant effluent and on lands from
sludge and solid waste. These impacts are considered of low significance.

Social Benefits, risks and impacts

The implementation of the Program will help in elevating the negative impacts through providing the
sanitation service which is very highly demanded by the poor rural communities of the targeted
Governorates. There are number of benefits and positive returns that the Program is expected to help
local communities to attain. Most important benefits include:

    1. Economic saving on the household level:
                                                                                                       20
    2.   Health and safety benefits
    3.   Creating an enabling environment for community development at village level
    4.   Enhanced level of public hygiene awareness
    5.   Special return and benefits for women and children

The project will entail land acquisition for constructing the pumping stations and the WWTP. If not
handled carefully, land acquisition might result in serious impacts on individuals of land owners and land
users. At this stage, since the technical design of the program is premature, it is difficult to know the
exact amount of land that will be needed and consequently, it is also difficult to estimate the number of
land owners and land users who would be affected from the land transaction process. The severity of
the impact of land taking depends on number of factors and case by case analysis will need to be carried
out by the WSCs before the Program implementation to define the magnitude of the impacts, the
affected persons and the methods to mitigate the impacts. The main Land related risks identified are:

    1. Limited capacities of the WSCs to manage land issues
    2. Potential delay in the time scheduled as a result of land acquisition
    3. Lack of a consistent and transparent approach in managing land related issues
    4. Livelihoods risk related to lands
    5. Potential emerging disputes over the land that has been acquired before the start of the
       Program
    6. Poor management to the temporary impacts related to land:

The following are the key non-land related risks identified:

    1.   Risk of damages associated to the construction activities
    2.   Non-land based livelihoods risks
    3.   Weak sense of demand for and/ acceptance and readiness for projects in certain communities
    4.   Risk of social tensions as a result of exclusion of certain villages
    5.   Risk related to affordability of poor households
    6.   Potential escalation for unresolved community concerns/complaints

On the impacts side, the construction phase is expected to generate number of local job opportunities
to the villagers who could be engaged with the contractors in various activities associated to the
construction phase. In the meantime, number of negative impacts might result from the construction
phase of the project. This most importantly include:

        Temporary impacts on land including the temporary use of land for construction camps and
         materials’ storage and the potential damage for crops.
        Permanent land acquisition and potential implication on an livelihoods of an average of the rural
         families
        Inconvenience to the local communities and potential implication on the local activities within
         the villages, including distracting local business

                                                                                                       21
      Health and safety risks on workers and local residents within the project site

During the Program operation, numerous benefits and positive impacts are anticipated. Returns entail
benefits on health, economics of the households, enhanced level of awareness and special benefits to
women and children.

Program Capacity and Performance Assessment and Gap Identification

Performance of WSCs with regard to the legal and regulatory framework on environmental aspects

The main gaps could be summarized as follows:
    - There are no clear guidelines that controls the management of septage.
    - Similar to the above issue, although there is legal prohibition to establish private sewers that
       discharge to watercourses, no enforcement mechanisms or alternative solutions to those
       networks. Those networks achieve important benefit for the villages where they serve, however,
       the legal framework and technical guidelines do not allow for a sound solution for those
       networks. The Program design would allow for connecting those networks with due diligence
       assessment of their conditions, through the ISC, and take feasible measures to improve their
       condition.
    - There are no explicit standards for land contamination. Also no explicit requirements for
       ensuring secondary containment of hazardous substance storage tanks that covers 110% of the
       storage capacity, and for taking adequate measures during filling the tanks. This gap would be
       bridged through including such requirements in the ToRs of site-specific ESIAs which would be
       prepared/supervised by the WSCs.

In terms of implementation of and compliance with the laws/standards, there are some weaknesses and
gaps in the system including:

   -   The strict punishment of non-compliant WWTPs operators sometimes gives opposite results, as
       they tend to bypass portion of the received influent for meeting the effluent standards.
   -   The “negative discharge” by PSs, although done as a last resort in absence of sufficient finance,
       there should be assessment to the advantages and disadvantages for starting the connections
       without having enough resources to discharge the collected wastewater in a WWTP
   -   Most of WWTPs do not keep a documented environmental register that is being frequently
       updated according to the requirements of Law 4/1994.
   -   Most of WWTPs do not handle sludge, solid waste removed by screens, or removed grit
       according to the law requirements. This need to be improved as indicated later in the PAP
   -   The Safety procedures need to be improved and integrated within the procedures for design,
       construction and operations of networks and WWTPs.

Performance of WSCs with regard to the legal and regulatory framework on land acquisition

                                                                                                     22
The existing laws and regulation have a number of positive sides in dealing with land acquisition. This
most importantly include provisions related to compensation, sharing information with the affected
persons, rights of affected persons to appeal and provisions related to the temporary damage and
associated compensation. In reviewing the legal and regulatory framework against the international
best practices, a number of gaps related to the following areas were identified:

       Consultation with affected individuals:
       Identification of entitled categories:
       Absence of proactive local level mechanism for handling grievance
       Land Valuation Process
       Replacement Cost
       Performance of WSCs with regard to the legal and regulatory framework on grievance
        mechanism:

Adequacy of institutional arrangements and capacity on land acquisition

The analysis of the existing institutional arrangement and capacity for handling land acquisition issues
showed a number of shortfalls and gaps that need to be addressed to allow for a more standardized,
approach for land acquisition. This most importantly includes the fact of the dominant nature of the
technical and legal orientation in handling land acquisition in a way that comes on the cost of managing
the social issues related to land. This could be attributed to number of factors including the relative
limited capacities of the WSCs (particularly in finalizing willing buyer willing seller process due to lack of
resources), shortage in human resources. The absence of the inter-agencies coordination role to
facilitate the process of obtaining approvals is resulting in huge delay in the process of finalizing land
acquisition.

Adequacy of institutional arrangements for handling community engagement issues:

The conducted institutional assessment for handling community engagement showed that existing
resources and mechanisms for managing community engagement has a number of strengths that
include availability of teams for awareness and communication on the Governorate level, teams are
working under agreed upon annual work plan, a monitoring and evaluation system for the performance
of the WSCs is in place, there is a number of community based monitoring techniques (e.g. surveys) and
solid awareness and communication guidelines exist and are applied.

In the meantime, a number of institutional gaps were identified. Those could be summarized in:

       Limitations in the mandates of the WSCs scope (e.g. absence of planning, design and
        construction) from the current mandates and accordingly limitations in the WSCs capacity to
        handle community engagement related to these stages.
       Shortage in human resources and lack of staff representation on the Markaz and village level
       High staff turnover rate
                                                                                                     23
       Lack of monitoring system to measure the impacts and the efficiency of the implemented
        community based activities including the awareness
       Lack of resources for logistical support
       Inconsistency in the capacities of the assigned teams

Adequacy of institutional arrangements for handling grievance redress:

The following are the main identified gaps related to the existing grievance mechanism, specifically the
Hotline:

       Deficiencies in the mode of operation due to lack of automation for the system
       The informal channels including the direct complaints to technicians are still more largely used
        than the Hotline.
       Problem in the monitoring system since monitoring is done only on selected cases because the
        HCWW does not have full access to all the calls due to database shortfalls.
       Time interval for resolving the complaints is not clearly communicated with the complainers.
       The dominant orientation to the operation and maintenance and the absence of focus on
        grievance related to projects planning, design and construction.

Recommended Actions to Address Identified Risks and Gaps

Actions to address identified Environmental Risks and Gaps

The institutional support for managing the environmental aspects of the PAP will be as follows:

    -   The main implementation responsibility of the PAP will be on the PIUs who should recruit an
        environmental specialist on full-time basis. The 3 environmental specialists at the PIUs will be
        supported by an Environmental Specialist at the PMU level, who is expected to be recruited with
        sufficient environmental assessment and management experience (10+ years of experience).
        Also the Environmental Specialist of the HCWW will provide support in reviewing the ESIAs and
        giving insight about the bottlenecks usually confronted in other projects and how to overcome
        them.
    -   The ISC would support the environmental specialists of the PIUs on implementation and
        supervision of site-specific ESMPs. The WSCs would take advantage for the ISC role in
        construction supervision to overlook the environmental management of construction
        contractors.
    -   The Quality Sectors in the 3 WSCs should either introduce a new Department for Sludge Quality
        or add the sludge quality to the mandate of the Effluent Quality Department. The WSCs should
        procure sufficient laboratory equipment in the labs of WWTPs and the central labs at each WSC
        to analyze sludge.



                                                                                                     24
   -   The Occupational Health and Safety Department should add the following responsibilities to its
       mandate reviewing designs of new WWTPs and PS and ensure that sufficient H&S measures are
       taken, following up the adherence of WWTP and PSs staff to the H&S site specific measures.
   -   The Operation Sector should prepare a documented O&M manual specific for each WWTP
       including the environmental measures included as recommended by the environmental
       specialists and should ensure that WWTP managers adhere to such manuals.

The PIUs should assess the achievement of DLIs based on the WWTPs within the borders of the
Program, other clusters from the national program, especially clusters that include relatively large
WWTPs, which might be considered as Category A, should be excluded from the assessment.

The following measures are proposed for minimizing environmental risks and mitigating environmental
impacts:

   -   The PIUs, with support from the PMU and HCWW, should initiate the ESIA process for new
       clusters through preparing ToRs for the ESIAs putting sufficient weight to the covering the issues
       identified in this ESSA and the site specific issues. There should be robust system for following
       up the implementation of site specific ESMP measures.
   -   Sludge analysis should be included in the regular operations of the Quality Sector in WSCs. In
       case the sludge is complying with the standards it could be sold to contractors on condition that
       the contractor would be responsible for making farmers aware of the application rate of sludge,
       this responsibility should be reflected as an article in the contract. In case the sludge is not
       complying with the standards, it should be transferred to an adequate disposal site.
   -   The Operation Sector for each WWTP should prepare and O&M manual specific to each WWTPs
       that includes standard procedures on normal conditions as well as on emergency conditions.
       The manuals should include measures for reporting bypass incidents, adequate handling of solid
       waste, and measures for ensuring effluent quality.
   -   The new Code of rural sanitation should have measures for putting rural shock loads into
       consideration when designing the WWTPs.
   -   The ISCs should provide sufficient site supervision on contractors during excavation works to
       report on any chance finds of culturally valuable objects. The ISCs should also ensure that H&S
       issues are adequately managed during construction and that dewatering operations are
       controlled.
   -   The Occupational Health and Safety Department should provide needs assessment for existing
       PSs and WWTPs to improve the health and safety standards. The Department should review
       designs of new facilities and provide comments as needed. The Department should conduct
       quarterly inspection for each WWTP and PS to ensure compliance with H&S standards.
   -   Connecting PSs that are negatively discharging to drains and private networks should be
       calculated among the results of DLI1 which will promote the environmental benefits of the


                                                                                                      25
    Program. In caste of connecting private networks the ISC should assess their conditions and
    identify necessary measures to improve its quality to prevent/minimize clogging and leakage.
-   The PMU and HCWW should establish dialogue with MWRI and MoH regarding the possible
    modifications of Law 48/1982. This would help in making the PMU technically and financially
    prepared for any future modifications of the Law.

Implementation support

Training and capacity building will be key prerequisites to enable the assigned teams to carry out their
responsibilities as stipulated in their ToRs. The following are the main areas of support for the Program
Implementation:

For land Acquisition

The “Standards Operational Procedures” should be the applications related to land acquisition. The
implementation support in this regard will entail:

       Providing guidance and support to the PMU and the WSCs in the preparation of the ToRs for the
        responsibilities of the team and the preparation of the ToRs for the SOP and the Procedural
        Guidelines for Community Engagement.
       Provide training to the WSCs teams working in land acquisition1.

Initially proposed topics of training for the teams working in land acquisition:

       International policies and best practices related to resettlement
       Legal and social aspects associated to resettlement
       Preparing of resettlement assessments and action plans
       Monitoring the land acquisition and resettlement impacts

For community engagement

The “Procedural Guidelines for Community Engagement” will set the core for the work of the
community engagement team. The implementation support in this regard will entail:

       Provide assistance in development of the “Procedural Guidelines for Community Engagement”
        Support the WSCs in strengthening the GRM system
       Provide assistance to WSCs to strengthen their monitoring and evaluation system in terms of

1 Introduction

1.1 Background


Egypt is a middle income country with a rapidly growing population, high levels of unemployment and a
heavily skewed income distribution. Economic growth has averaged a relatively low 2% p.a. since 1980
and the economy has suffered in recent years due to the effects of the Arab Spring. Despite rapid
urbanization over recent years, over 50% of the population is rural: villages range from small satellite
villages of under 500 people to large urbanized villages of over 10,000 people. Agriculture, one of the
mainstays of the economy, relies on irrigation from the Nile and water resource management and the
protection of water quality is therefore a significant issue for the country.

The Government of Egypt (GoE) has placed a high priority on providing drinking water and sanitation
services and is currently implementing 1400 projects and with a 2014/15 budget of LE 4.2 billion (USD
587 million). Most investment over the last 20 years has been on water supply and this has raised access
to safe drinking water from 39% to 93% whereas sanitation services have lagged and only about 12% of
the population in rural areas are connected to piped sewerage systems with adequate wastewater
treatment. Most people in rural areas use traditional permeable septic tanks which due to the high
water table in the Nile Delta lead to sewage in the streets, the collapse of buildings and very high
septage emptying costs. Rural sanitation is therefore now a major priority of the government
particularly in the low lying and densely populated Nile Delta. The GoE has started implementing major
sanitation programs and a major part of the current budget is allocated to sanitation. In addition, there
are several major donor funded rural sanitation programs with total budgets of nearly USD 500 million.

1.2 The National Program

The National Rural Sanitation Program (NRSP) was launched in 2014 with the goal of serving all the rural
population by 2037 and a development objective to “accelerate access to rural sanitation services and to
ensure sustainable service delivery”. It has an estimated cost of LE 100 million (USD 14 billion) and will
cover 4700 villages and 27,000 satellite villages. The initial focus of the NRSP is a program to cover 769
“polluting” villages in 7 governorates that discharge untreated wastewater surface watercourses that
ends at the Al Salam Canal and the Rosetta Branch Canal2. The seven governorates are: Sharkiya,
Dakhalia, Damietta, Giza, Menoufya, Gharbiya and Beheira. This initial program, which does not cover all
settlements in the seven governorates but just the villages close to the two canals aims, to:
    -   Provide sanitation services to the target villages with associated health and service provision
        benefits.


2
 The main drains that are discharging to Rosetta Brach are El Tahrir Drain, Tala Drain, Sibl Drain and Rahawy
Drain, while the main drains that discharge to El Salam Canal are are El Serw Drain and Hadous Drain
                                                                                                                30
    -      Reduce pollution in the two irrigation canals - reducing untreated wastewater discharge into the
           Al Salam canal will reduce the fresh water mix needed for the planned irrigation extension in the
           Sinai as well as having wider environmental and health benefits.


The NRSP is informed by The National Rural Sanitation Strategy developed in 2008, Development
Policies, Water and Waste Water Sector in Egypt developed in 2010 and the national and governorate
rural sanitation master plans. The figure below illustrates the geographic coverage of the initiate stage
of the NRSP in the watershed of Rosetta Branch and El Salam Canal.

1.3 The PforR Boundaries


The World Bank Group (WBG) will support the NRSP through the Program for Results (PforR) financing
instrument, where funds are released on achievement of results measured using Disbursement Linked
Indicators (DLIs), rather than on the basis of expenditures. The PforR approach focuses Bank support on
helping governments improve the design and implementation of their programs using country systems
and directly linking achievement of results to the disbursement of Bank funds.

The PforR, the Program, is designed to increase sustainable sanitation services and reduce pollution
from wastewater in three of the seven governorates in the national program, namely Beheria, Sharkia
and Dakahlia. The scale of the Program is defined by the implementation budget of USD 1.1 bn, with
USD 550m in phase 1. In order to ensure the sustainability of the Program infrastructure investments,
the Program is designed to promote Water and Sanitation Companies (WSC) to become more
operationally and financially sound and also addresses some national level constraints such as tariff
levels.

The Table below shows the outline of the NRSP and an indicative outline of the PforR based on a first
application of program level selection criteria. The nominal program assumes an average construction
cost of USD 550/capita (using current populations to calculate per capita costs). In addition 9% is added
to cover the cost of design, construction supervision, land purchase i.e. a total unit cost of USD
600/capita which allows 500,000,000/600 = 833,300 people to be served. The actual content of the
PforR work will be developed during the project preparation using project level selection criteria.

The Program will be funded by a USD 1.1 billion loan from the WBG split into two equal phases. In
addition there is a proposed USD 3.5 million grant for capacity building Technical Assistance and a
transfer of USD 7m from another WBG project: The Second Integrated Sanitation and Sewerage
Infrastructure Project (ISSIP 2) for establishing the a Program Management Unit (PMU) and associated
services. This assessment deals with the first phase of the Program which has a total budget of USD 550
million. The Government of Egypt (GoE) is currently funding water and sanitation projects through the
National Organization for Potable Water And Sanitary Drainage (NOPWASD) where the majority of funds
are being spent on sanitation in secondary cities and rural areas. At current rates the estimated funding
over the 5 year period is over USD 2.5 billion. For the 3 governorates the current planning for sanitation
expenditures is about USD 400 million which indicates a co-financing of sanitation infrastructure of just
over 22%.

1.4 Objectives of the ESSA


This document, the Environmental and Social Systems Assessment (ESSA), has been prepared by the
Bank team, according to the requirements of WBG Operational Policy OP9.00 for PforR financing for
adequately manage the environmental and social effects of the program.

The ESSA aims at reviewing the capacity of existing government systems to plan and implement
effective measures for environmental and social impact management and to determining if any
measures would be required to strengthen them. The specific objectives of the ESSA is to:

    -   Identify potential environmental and social benefits, risks and impacts applicable to the program
        interventions
    -   Review the policy and legal framework related to management of environmental and social
        impacts of the program interventions
    -   Assess the institutional capacity for environmental and social management system within the
        program system
    -   Assess the program system performance with respect to the core principals of the PforR
        instrument and identify gaps
    -   Describe actions to be taken to fill the gaps that will input to the program action plan
    -   Describe the consultation process for the preparation and implementation of the program

1.5 Methodology of the ESSA
1.5.1   Screening of Environmental and Social Effects According to O.P 9.00 Tool


A preliminary risk assessment has been carried out using the Environmental and Social Risk Screening
Format included in OP 9.00, and the likely environmental and social effects have been addressed.
Regarding the context, the Program will be implemented in rural areas with health, economic and
psychological pressures and polluted watercourses in the downstream of the Nile, so the interventions
are expected to effectively address these geographic shortcomings. No sensitive habitats are located
within the Program areas and the risk on culturally valuable sites is low. In terms of sustainability, the
Program is expected to enhance the sustainability of watercourses through enhancing their quality, the
sustainability of agriculture lands through alleviating the rising groundwater table problems and
improving the quality of irrigation water. In terms of institutional complexity, the environmental and
social issues will be handled through different bodies under the umbrella of MoHUUC and the system is
expected to operate without complexity. Regarding the institutional capacity, although is currently

                                                                                                       34
limited, the PAP measures identify measures for improving the capacity. There are no governance or
corruption risks associated with the environmental aspects of the Program. The overall environmental
risks have been rated as medium and the overall social risks have been rated as substantial. More details
are given later in Chapter 4.

1.5.2    Timeline and Approach to Consultations

The Bank’s assessment team used various approaches to review the environment and social systems
that are relevant to the program. It included review of legislation and guidelines, existing WSC
procedures and relevant documentation, review of similar projects, field visits to existing sanitation
facilities in the Program area and analysis of different effects.
The preparation of the ESSA involved a series of consultation activities that targeted wide range of
stakeholders related to the sanitation sector. In addition to the consultation with the HCWW and the
WSCs which took the form of meetings in Cairo and the concerned Governorates/Markazes, number of
consultations was arranged with local stakeholder in the villages where the program is going to be
implemented including villagers. Consultation activities were also extended to number of the
communities that are served with formal sanitation system and selected unserved communities.
Consultation with local communities and village-level stakeholders were conducted through focus group
discussions and semi-structured interviews. To ensure convenience to the local communities and allow
for participation from women, village- level consultations took place in the villages with the Bank team
reaching out to the targeted served and unserved communities. Consultations took place in
communities’ events halls, omda’s house, Local Governorate units…etc). The team also conducted a
number of transact walks and short semi-structured interviews with key informants from the visited
villages.

1.5.3   Summary of the main consultation activities

A) Consultation Activities During the Preparation of the ESSA

    1. Consultative meetings with the HCWW and the WSCs

The ESSA team had a number of meetings and small workshops with relevant concerned departments
from the HWCC and the three WSCs in the targeted Governorates. On the level of the HCWW, the team
met with General Department for Public Awareness and Customer Service, the Legal Department and


                                                                                                               37
the PIUs of rural sanitation Bank-financed projects. On the level of the WSCs, the team consulted the
members of:

       The Public Relations and the Awareness raising Department
       The teams of the Costumers Service Department
       The Properties Department
       The Hotline Department
       Sanitation Sector
       Quality Sector
       Occupational Health and Safety Department

A total of around 40 staff from the HCWW and the WSCs were consulted to collect information about:

    1. The current system, resources and mechanisms for acquiring land, community engagement,
       handling grievance and complaints, effluent quality control, sludge and septage handling
       systems, Health and Safety (H&S) procedures and interaction with other stakeholders
    2. The shortfalls in the existing systems
    3. The proposed actions and recommendations to improve the existing system

     1. Consultative meetings with community members and other stakeholders from the served
         communities
The team met with local community members and stakeholders within the served communities as
follows:

    1- Santimay village, Dakahlya. A total of 18 community members of men and women, CDAs and
       community leaders (Sheikh Balad, Omdas, religious leaders) participated
    2- Kom El Nasr village4, Behaira. A total 17 community members of men and women, CDAs and
       community leaders participated
    3- El Zankalon village, Sharkia. A total of 4 community members of men participated.

The consultation with community members and local stakeholders helped the team to get better
understanding for the following:

    1- The impacts of the implemented projects on the households’ level (domestic activities, health,
       households’ expenditure…etc)
    2- Households’ contributions to get the project implemented
    3- How grievances are currently being handled
    4- The main recommendations from local stakeholders’ perspective for better planning for the
       rural sanitation projects


4
 Although the village was introduced to the team by the WSC as “served” because the treatment plant and the
pumping stations are completed, the meeting revealed that the households do not have connection to the service
yet.
                                                                                                            38
   5- Land related issues including how the process of land acquisition was managed, impacts of land
      acquisition and how the process could be improved

     2. Consultative meetings with community members and other stakeholders from the unserved
         communities
The team met with local community members and stakeholders within the unserved communities as
follows:
     1- Kafr Noaman, Dakahlia. A total of 18 community members of men and women, CDAs,
         agriculture associations and community leaders Sheikh Balad, Omdas, religious leaders)
         participated.
     2- Kom Hellini, Sharkia. A total of 14 community members of men and women, CDAs, agriculture
         associations and community leaders Sheikh Balad, Omdas, religious leaders) participated.

The consultation with community members and local stakeholders helped the team to get better
understanding for the following:

   1-    The current situation and the strategies for handling sanitation issues on the households and
        village level
   2-   The impact of this situation on the households level (including expenditure, health, impacts on
        women, children and elderlies…etc)
   3-   Willingness to contribute for new sanitation projects, including contribution with land
   4-    Key recommendations for engaging with local communities along the various projects stages
   5-   Land related issues including availability of land for pumping stations and treatment plants,
        willingness of local communities to contribute with land and the potential anticipated impacts
        related to land acquisition

B) Field Observations and transact walks

The team conducted a number of field visits and walks including informal interactions with villagers to
record observations and listen to communities’ description and diagnosis for the sewage problem within
the villages. Community members played a leading role in guiding the walks and advising on the places
to visit. The following are the key sites visited in the villages:

       Pumping station in Sentimai, Dakahlya
       Grave yard adjacent to highly populated residential areas in Kom El Nasr, Dakahlya
       Models of poor households of the village Kom El Nasr, Dakahlya
       Streets and commercial areas in El Zankalon village, Sharkia
       Street, households and un-operational pumping station in Kom Hellinin, Sharkia
       WWTPs of Kom Hamada, Sahragt and El Qenayat



                                                                                                    39
C) Verification activities

In addition to the consolation activities to prepare the ESSA, a number of verification sessions were
conducted with the PMU, the HCWW and the WSCs to verify the main findings of the ESSA including the
impacts, risks, gaps and the measures needed to prepare the PAP.

The first verification session was conducted on Feb 26 with the team of the Public Awareness and
Customer Service Department in HCWW to verify the findings related to community engagement and
Hotline dimensions. A second session was conducted on March 23 with the PMU, HCWW and WSCs
(departments of Public relations, properties, health and safety and labs). The findings from these
verification activities were incorporated in this draft of the ESSA.




                                                                                                  40
D) Consultation Activities After Drafting the ESSA

After drafting the ESSA, 3 consultation events were conducted in the 3 targeted Governorates. The
consultations took place between April 21 to April 23, 2015. The WSCs supported in the preparation of
the consultation events. They prepared invitations and distributed along with Arabic Executive Summary
of the ESSA. They also hosted the events in their premises. As indicted in Table 2 above, around 160
participants attended the 3 consultations, with representation from women (40 participants) and
significant participation from youth. The main categories of the participants included:

   -   Relevant Department in the WSCs (Public Relations and Awareness, Hot line, Properties, Labs
       and Quality Control, Health and Safety, Sludge Management)
   -   Same departments from the HCWW
   -   Representation from the Local Governorate Units (LGU)
   -   Representatives from CDAs and other local level institutes (youth centers, awkaf…etc)
   -   Directorates of Irrigation
   -   Directorates of Health
   -   Directorates of Agriculture
   -   Directorates of Labor and Manpower
   -   Environmental Management Unit in the Governorate
   -   Cleansing and Solid waste Management Unit in the Governorate
   -   Regional Branch Offices of EEAA (in Zakazik, Mansoura and Damanhour)
   -   Antiquity Inspection Unit
   -   Directorate of social solidarity
   -   Representatives of local communities
   -   Universities of Zakazik, Mansoura and Damanhour

The consultation session were managed in a highly participatory and interactive manner. Arabic
presentation was delivered on the key environmental and social findings of the ESSA. This was followed
by open discussions when the participants were encouraged to give their feedback about the ESSA
findings. Comments were carefully recorder and reflected, where possible, in the revised version of the
ESSA. Comments sheets were also distributed to participants who wished to leave comments in writing.
Annex 5 includes details about the received comments, which could be mainly summarized in the
following:

Environmental Comments:

      The private networks cause many operational problems. Rehabilitation of such networks could
       be an option to connect these communities
      Receiving septage should be accounted for in the design of the projects (so that WWTPs
       can receive high loads of septage). Some of the WSCs are already accepting septage, and this
       need to be expanded so as to have good geographic coverage.
                                                                                                    41
       Representatives from the Antiquity Authority indicated that the Authority can participate in
        protecting the antiquity sites during the design phase through clearing sites selected, and during
        construction through providing site supervision by the Authority to sensitive sites.
       There should be dialogue between the WSC, Directories of Health, Irrigation and Health
        to give WWTPs that are overloaded grace periods for compliance.
       The exclusion of Gharb El Mansoura WWTP (originally was 135,000 and now 185,000
        m3/d after reviewing the plans) should be only for the WWTP, while the networks
        ending at this WWTP should not be excluded as the networks are separate from the
        relatively large WWTP. Including these villages, which are located near the Nile, will
        maximize the benefits of the Program5.
       H&S requirements are very important, but the main obstacles towards full compliance with such
        requirements are the budget and the awareness/training of workers. Providing the budget and
        capacity building for H&S are key factors.
       WWTPs which are located in or near residential settlements should be given priority to
        improve their performance
       Noncompliant sludge should be disposed in hazardous waste landfill, but there are no
        such landfill in the Governorate. It might be beneficial to have such site in the
        Governorate
       The handling of hazardous materials and hazardous waste (include used containers of
        chlorine) should be included in the Register of WWTPs
       There should be capacity building for the environmental staff in the EMU (along with
        WSCs staff) among the Program activities
       One of the University representatives recommended to raise the risk on structures from
        dewatering operations to medium according to their practical experience6.
       Control on industrial discharges to the network (through monitoring for Law 93) is very
        important in controlling the quality of the sludge and the quality of final effluent
       Using existing capacities of WWTPs should consider the increase of population from
        existing served communities
       There should be consideration for establishing fertilizers plant from WWTPs sludge.
       The existing WWTP are overloaded and under maintained and in many cases need
        urgent renovation.
       In private networks, sometimes the level of water supply pipes are lower than sewerage
        gravity networks, which elevates the risk of drinking water contamination

  This comment has been carefully assessed by the ESSA team and the RSA, it was concluded that it is important to
exclude such large WWTPs and their networks to keep the boundaries of the Program
6
  This comment has been addressed in modified versions of the ESSA
                                                                                                               42
    Social Comments:

   Law enforcement is critical to minimize the risk for the major violations of the illegal dumping on
    agricultural drains.
   The readiness of the communities should be taken into consideration. Communities with readily
    available land and designed facilities should be given priority. This is important for the Program
    credibility.
   The Program is excellent and highly needed. However, there is still a long way to go in terms of
    raising the awareness of local communities to mobilize local resources to contribute/finance
    rural sanitation projects.
   Land is a critical challenge. The idea of signing MoU among ministries is very good but it will
    need to be supplemented with actions like a “one stop shop” or a “Higher Committee” to be in
    charge of coordinating all the approvals on fast track.
   Governors should be key partners in signing the Land MoU.
   Community participation is a critical part of the program. If not done probably, the implications
    will go beyond not meeting a DLI. Other DLIs (including those related to the service delivery and
    the review of the tariff structure) will not be met without community participation.
   The awareness departments have serious challenge related to the limitations in human
    resources working in community mobilization.
   It would be beneficial to the Program if the land price is included in capital cost. This would
    mitigate potential risk related to limitation of resources.
   Upper Egypt WSCs have good experience (Sohag Governorate) for making connections fees
    affordable to poor households. The Program should be benefiting from this experience in
    designing the pro-poor strategy.
   More critical role for the media in awareness raising should be played on the national level
    particularly since the Program is a priority for the Government.
   There is difference between the scope of the awareness as carried out now by the WSCs and the
    level of community engagement and community participation that the program is aiming for.
    This shift will require capacity building
   To launch a revolving loan for targeting poor households, the Program may need to seek grants
    from different donors.
   The role of different actors including NGOs, Youth centers and worship establishments is very
    important in mobilizing communities.

2 Program Description
2.1 Program Development Objectives

Strengthening institutions for increasing access and improving rural sanitation services in three
participating governorates. The PDO level outcomes include (i) increased access demonstrated by
number of people provided with access to “improved sanitation facilities” under the project; (ii) annual
performance assessment plans designed and implemented; and (iii) strengthened institutional
arrangements demonstrated by the adoption of a new National Rural Sanitation Strategy.

2.2 Program Scope and Interventions

The Program will be implemented over a period of 5 years and will focus on achieving 3 main result
areas: Improved sanitation access (rehabilitated, extended, and new facilities), improved operational
systems and practices of WSCs and strengthened national Sector Framework. Each of the result areas
will include the following activities.

           2.2.1   Result Area 1: Improved Sanitation Access (rehabilitated, extended, and
                   new facilities)

The Program is structured to incentivize the provision of access to sanitation to about 833,300 people
living in the three governorates of Daqahliya, Sharqiya, and Beheira, with each governorate serviced by
a separate WSC. Improved access is determined by a connection to a sewer network that is linked to a
wastewater treatment facility meeting Egyptian treatment standards, or to any other acceptable
sanitation solution (including decentralized treatment facilities). The Program targets 167,000 new
connections, or approximately 833,300 people, living in a specified geographic area which covers about
200 priority villages which routinely dump their sewerage into the Nile River system, as well as the
satellite villages around them.

The Program will include free household connections, and supports a Pro-Poor strategy. The cost
related to individual household connections (except for internal plumbing) is included in the unit cost of
connection, and therefore provided free of charge to households. This is justified because of the
positive economic externalities related to providing sanitation services: the more households that
connect to proper sanitation systems, the greater the positive externalities, or the lower the negative
externalities of having unsanitary neighbors (see Economic Justification in Technical Assessment). Free
household connections are also justified in terms of being pro-poor: it has been repeatedly
demonstrated throughout the world that subsidies for access are more pro-poor than consumption-
based subsidies. Further, the Program provides additional incentives to the WSCs to reach out to
“satellites”, areas generally on the distant outskirts of the main villages, as these satellites are on
average poorer and have been excluded from services in the past.



                                                                                                       44
In order to ensure that increased access supported through this Results Area is linked to more
sustainable service delivery, the Program will put in place a system of Performance Based Capital Grants
(PBCG) from the Central Government to the WSCs to support priority rural sanitation investments
identified through the Five Year Plans and included in the Annual Capital Investment Plan of the WSCs. It
should be noted that the introduction of the PBCG system would be a key contribution of this program
as it would promote a culture of transparency and accountability in the fiscal transfers system.

The performance-based capital grants will be allocated to the WSCs on a per capita basis and will be
determined by the ability of the WSC to meet the performance standards set by the MHUUC and
measured through a set of Minimum Conditions (MCs) and performance targets with increasing level of
ambition throughout implementation of the Program. The Program will start with a base grant allocation
for the first two years that will be available to the WSCs upon the satisfaction of the Minimum
Conditions. From the third year onwards, in addition to the base grant, a performance-based top-up
grant will be provided to the WSCs. The performance-based capital grants will be programmed into the
National budget annually and structured as unconditional fiscal transfers that will flow from the National
budget into the annual budget of the WSCs, which the WSCs can use to finance the investment projects
prioritized in their annual capital investment plans. In case any of the WSCs would not receive the
performance top-up, it would be reallocated into the total grant pool available to the WSCs for
investment (related to Results Area 1). Performance targets would include operational, financial,
institutional and stakeholders’ engagement indicators.

           2.2.2   Result Area 2: Improved Operational Systems and Practices of WSCs

Participating WSCs will be explicitly incentivized to improve investment planning, operations and
maintenance as well as service delivery through the compensation and reward mechanisms built into
annual performance assessments (APA). APAs will be designed and implemented on a transparent and
predictable basis centered on a formula taking into account of four key dimensions: Operational;
Financial; Institutional; and Stakeholder engagement. These performance standards will relate to
measures demonstrating performance including for example:

   Operational: comprising of indicators measuring: (1) Non Revenue Water (2) percentage of
    functioning WWTP in compliance with the Egyptian law and standards (3) Septage management
   Financial: comprising of : (1) Operating ratio (2) Collection Efficiency
   Institutional: addressing areas such as (1) Efficient Procurement Processes (2) Implementation of
    Environmental and Social Safeguard measures
   Stakeholder Engagement: addressing areas including (1) Communication and engagement with
    Citizens in WSC processes (2) Effective Grievance Handling measures

By introducing concrete indicators on operation and maintenance of the systems, as well as on
stakeholder engagement, the Program intends to address key issues that currently undermine
performance of the WSCs. Moreover, it should be highlighted that the GoE has agreed to allocate
significant resources to strengthen these dimensions in the proposed service delivery model. By
strengthening the overall capacity of the WSCs to ensure effective operation and maintenance, the


                                                                                                       45
sustainability of all investments, including those directly financed through the Program, will be
enhanced.

Cost recovery will be one of the critical factors in determining the performance score of the respective
WSC. The performance improvements put in place as well as the APA score will help support and
incentivize each WSC to improve efficiency and reduce costs. Because the Program is structured as
results-based, therefore not prescribing any specific technology (although following Egyptian standards),
it is expected that unit costs should eventually decrease. And because the Program places the
investment planning responsibility with the WSCs, it is expected that the WSCs, HCWW and the MHUUC
will strive for more cost efficient solutions that would bring operating costs down by better aligning
investment choices with feasible and efficient operating procedures.

Accountability to citizens will form a critical pillar of the APA “formula” described above, and of
performance improvements supported more broadly through the Program. Citizen engagement
through beneficiary feedback surveys, awareness campaigns, strengthened communications systems of
WSCs, and the development of a strategy for serving the poor are all integral to the Program. They are
incorporated either directly through results-based incentives, required measures, or through capacity
building programs. Engaging and including women will be an important element within the stakeholder
engagement activities. Women play a key role in setting and shaping health and sanitation attitudes in
the household, and therefore women must be at the center for any citizen engagement strategy to be
successful.

Centralized organizations, such as the HCWW, will provide necessary guidance, technical and advisory
support to WSCs to design and implement performance improvement action plans (PIAP) for addressing
managerial and operational gaps and weaknesses, and thereby enable the WSCs to achieve better
scores on their annual performance assessment. The PIAPs would include measures to improve
performance across the areas described above (i.e. operational, financial, institutional and stakeholders
engagement). In line with their role as the holding company of WSCs in Egypt, the HCWW will
coordinate the Program support for strengthening institutional capacities and improving institutional
performance of WSCs. The HCWW and the three WSCs will identify gaps and weaknesses in the existing
systems and processes of the WSCs with a focus on the areas measured under the annual performance
assessment. Based on these assessments, HCWW and the WSCs will work together to prepare
performance improvement action plans (PIAPs) to enable each WSC to address these gaps and
weaknesses so that the WSCs can achieve the threshold scores in the annual performance assessments.
HCWW will also provide implementation and advisory support, as necessary, to the WSCs to execute the
performance improvement action plans. The Egypt Water Regulatory Authority (EWRA) is expected to
play a critical role in the assessment of the WSCs performance, which will be strengthened given its
appointment as the Program’s Independent Verification Agent (IVA). The Water and Sanitation Program
(WSP)7 support to EWRA will provide specific technical and financial resources for publication of WSCs
performance and establishment of a national benchmarking system that will ensure that the citizen
engagement dimension of the Program will be enhanced in the participating WSCs.

           2.2.3    Result Area 3: Strengthened National Sector Framework

MHUUC will coordinate the Program activities for strengthening the enabling environment that will
allow for more efficient and accountable rural sanitation service delivery and lend more fluidly to future
scaling-up. This includes: (i) development of a tariff structure for water and sanitation services that
would enable cost recovery; (ii) the formulation of a revised and strengthened National Rural Sanitation
Strategy and the creation of a Central Unit (i.e. the PMU) which will be responsible for the coordination
of the National Rural Sanitation Program and implementation of the Strategy; and (iii) finalization of the
standard operating procedures for land acquisition. These measures are critical elements for the long-
term sustainability of the sector. A series of consultations and citizen engagement will help embed
these institutional changes more firmly into the sector. The PforR Program being implemented in the
three governorates will in particular rely on these institutional changes to support the deeper changes in
service delivery mechanisms being implemented. These broader institutional reforms and national
strategy developments will in turn enable replicability and scalability of the new service delivery
mechanisms being piloted by the Program.

The MHUUC will also undertake or commission relevant policy and analytical studies to inform the policy
making process in the sector. Support will also be provided to the EWRA to enhance its capacity to build
and sustain an effective regulatory and oversight framework. Additionally, support will be provided to
oversight agencies such as the Central Auditing Organization of Egypt, to conduct regular and timely
financial audits of WSCs as well as to carry out performance audits of the Program under their mandate.
The WSP will be carrying out a Public Expenditure Review (PER) in coordination with the Program. The
findings of the PER will inform the broader sector policy dialogue within the Government as well as
between the Government and the development partners in terms of policy choices and financing
sustainability in the sector. With the decision of the Government to move to a more decentralized
model of service delivery, these policy and regulatory initiatives will set the stage for providing a strong
enabling framework for empowering the WSCs to become efficient and accountable service delivery
institutions. This will also clarify the current overlap of institutional roles and responsibilities that act as
a deterrent to clear institutional accountabilities.

2.3 Institutional Set-up

To serve the NRSP, MHUUC have set up a Program Management Unit (NRSP-PMU).                           The main
responsibilities of the PMU will be:

-   to prepare, oversee and report on the NRSP;
-   to coordinate, monitor and report on external support to the NRSP and World Bank financed PforR,
-   to spearhead consolidation of the sector reforms.

The PMU will be the formal implementing agency for the PforR but with day to day implementation
delegated to the WSCs. The PforR activities will be carried out by a number of executing agents. The
main executing agency will be the WSCs (through PIUs) who will be responsible for result area 1
(sanitation access); the WSCs and HCWW will both act as executing agencies for result area 2
(operational improvements) and, the MHUUC and others will act as executing agencies for result area 3
(enabling environment). The principle of subsidiarity will apply; meaning that all those functions that can
                                                                                                         47
 be done better or as well at a lower level will be undertaken at the lower level. The PMU will be
 supported by A Program Management Consultancy Firm (PMCF) will be attached to the PMU to assist in
 carrying out its preparation, oversight, coordination and reporting tasks. WSC Implementation Support
 Consultants (ISC) will be attached to a PIU in each of the three WSCs to assist the WSCs in carrying out
 construction planning and management and to improve their performance in this area. The ISCs
 attached to each WSC will be responsible for:
 -    Feasibility level and detailed design
 -    Tendering and procurement support services for all relevant works ( contractors, construction
      supervision services and time limited operator services where relevant)
 -    Construction supervision services
 -    Endorsement and confirmation of adherence to contract conditions for invoices of all relevant
      works (contractors, construction supervision services and time limited operator services where
      relevant)
 -    Follow-up the implementation of ESIAs measures during the projects implementation

 The structure and staffing of the PIU will depend on the preferences of the WSC. Some have indicated a
 preference for seconding specialist staff from the sanitation and other sections e.g. legal; others have
 indicated that they prefer to staff the PIU with project managers in charge of a batch of projects with
 access to legal and other specialist inputs within the WSCs. The structure of the PIU in each WSC will be
 one of the PAP actions and will be based on a standard but dependent on the circumstances and
 preferences of the WSC.
 The PMU will support the WSCs to measure progress using M&E system and will collate the results to
 assess progress in achieving the DLIs. The results across the Program region will be aggregated as the
 basis for meeting the DLIs. Once satisfied with the accuracy of the reporting, the PMU will present
 evidence of the DLI achievement to an Independent Verification Agency (IVA), which is tasked with
 verifying the results. In order to validate the disbursement request submitted by the PMU, the
 Independent Verification Agency will verify all DLI target indicators through both a desk review and
 physical inspection.

3 Description of the Existing Environmental and Social Management
  System

3.1 Policy and Legislation

In general the local legislation, policies and guidelines sufficiently addresses the environmental and
social issues associated with the Program, with few gaps as identified in the following sections.

           3.1.1   Environmental Assessment

Environmental assessment for projects is included in the Law 4/1994 modified by Law 9/2009 or “The
Law for the Environment”, which is the main legislation regulating environmental protection in Egypt, it
is being regulated by The Ministry of State for Environmental Affairs (MSEA) and its executive agency the
Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA). Since the effectiveness of the Law in 1994 significant
improvements have been introduced to the environmental legal system following the gained experience
through implementing the law in the past 20 years.

The Country Environmental Analysis (CEA) report for Egypt, issued by the WBG in 2005, indicates that,
historically, the enforcement of environmental laws in Egypt was not very successful mainly due to
fragmentation among regulatory institutions, licensing agencies, police authorities . . . etc. The CEA
further clarifies that since 2003, there have been substantial efforts to improve this situation as “Major
institutional and organizational reforms have taken place within the Environment and Surface Water
Police of the Ministry of Interior. The Central Department for Environmental Inspection & Environmental
Compliance in EEAA was further strengthened. Periodic monitoring and inspections are made by this
directorate, especially for controlling air emissions and waste water discharges. Furthermore, the
preparation of environmental registers and compliance action plans has increased as a result of the
continued monitoring of the various commercial and industrial establishments”.

According to Law 4/1994 the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is a licensing requirement for
development projects that are likely to cause impacts to the environment. EEAA has issued Guidelines
for preparing EIAs in 2005, these Guidelines have been modified in 2009, and is currently being reviewed
for another possible modification.

The CEA indicates that the features of the Egyptian EIA system are generally compatible with the
corresponding features of World Bank Operational Policies (OP 4.01), but with few gaps regarding the
preparation and follow up of the Environment Management Plans (EMP), the consultation, disclosure
and dissemination of the EIA reports, however, the CEA mentioned that Since 2004, there have been
serious efforts by EEAA to improve the EIA information dissemination through the design of an EIA
database. After 2005, when the CEA was issued, there have been significant improvements in the EIA
systems that have, to a great extent, bridged those gaps. The requirements for consultation and
dissemination of EIA reports have been officially added to the EIA requirements in the new Guidelines
                                                                                                   50
issued by EEAA in 2009. These Guidelines have been made with support from the WB and in compliance
with its general requirements. The social aspects have been also integrated in the new Guidelines, the
definition of EIA according to the Guidelines reads: “EIA process is the systematic examination of
consequences of a proposed project, aiming to prevent, reduce or mitigate negative impacts on the
environment, natural resources, health and social elements as well as capitalize on positive impacts of
the project”, the social aspects are integrated in the Guidelines through the EIA screening process,
description of baseline conditions, assessment of impacts, analysis of alternatives and preparation of
management plans.

Currently the EIA guidelines classifies projects into the classifications according to their expected
impacts:

    -   Class C, which includes the higher impacts projects (equivalent to Category A according to WBG
        classification) requiring full-fledged EIA. According to the 2009 Guidelines, WWTPs and
        sewerage networks are among this category.
    -   Form B projects, requiring Form B EIA with less level of details that Class C EIA
    -   Form A projects, requiring From A EIA with less requirements than above
    -   Special Condition projects, which do not require EIA but will be licensed given that the project
        developer will comply with certain standard requirements
    -   Projects that are not subject to the EIA and environmental licensing system

The classification of all wastewater facilities (treatment and networks) among the highest impacts class
was introduced in 2009 Guidelines. In the older Guidelines of EIA, only WWTPs of more than 1,000,000
Population Equivalent (PE) were classified as the highest category, while WWTPs from 1,000 to
1,000,000 PE were classified as B, and WWTPs less than 1,000 PE were classified as A (the least
category).

It is worth noting that classifying all sanitation facilities among the highest assessment category is more
stringent than the requirements in many other environmental assessment legislation/standards,
including the WBG safeguard policies as discussed in further details in Chapter 4. Most of environmental
assessment screening of projects depends on subjective evaluation of the project impacts based on its
size, location, zone of influence, sensitivity of receptors … etc. However, some countries are using
quantitative criteria showing some threshold size of projects that trigger mandatory comprehensive
environmental assessment. The table below shows the screening criteria used in the environmental
assessment legislations of some countries.




                                                                                                        51

It is worth noting that the Bank’s team met with MSEA officials responsible for EIA system during the
preparation of this ESSA, and knew that the EIA Guidelines and the EIA screening criteria are currently
under review by MSEA/EEAA, including the screening criteria for sanitation projects.

Regarding the procedures of environmental assessment, the EIA preparation and fulfillment of the EEAA
requirements is well defined in the Guidelines. Also The EIA approval is well integrated in the licensing
system for new projects, especially the sanitation projects.

             3.1.2   Effluent Standards

The Nile Protection Law 48/1982 is the main legislation regulating water quality in the River Nile, its two
branches, canals, drains and groundwater aquifers. The Law sets certain standards for ambient water
quality in freshwater bodies, drains that are discharging to freshwater bodies and effluents that are
discharged (from WWTPs, industrial and tourist facilities) to freshwater bodies and drains.

The Law prohibits the discharge of WWTPs effluent to freshwater bodies and only allows it to be
discharged to drains if it meets the standards shown in the table below.

Table  4: Effluent Standards for WWTPs discharging to drains under Law 48/1982 according to the
latest modifications in 2013

The law also stipulates that treated effluent should be disinfected by chlorination, where the remaining
free chlorine in the effluent should be between 0.5-1 mg/l.

The Law has been modified many times since its issue, the latest modifications were in 2009 and 2013
(which is the current version). In the 2009 version, nutrients (total nitrogen and total phosphorous) were
added to the standards where the maximum limit for total nitrogen was 10 mg/l and that of
phosphorous was 2 mg/l, while the 2013 modifications have removed those nutrient standards but
indicated in Article 54 that within 2 years from the activation of the latest modifications, total nitrogen,
total phosphorous, ammonia and Ascaris Eggs will be reviewed. The Law is regulated mainly by Ministry
of Water Resources and Irrigation (MWRI), while effluent samples are taken, according to the Law, by
MoH.

Although the effluent standards in Law 48/1982 are not highly stringent if compared to effluent
standards in other countries, as indicated in the table below, the application context in Egypt shows that
it is actually very demanding, mainly due to the large uncovered areas with sanitation services and the
amount of investments needed to connected those areas to secondary treatment with disinfection. Also
some WWTPs which are overloaded require further investments to meet the effluent standards set by
the law through capacity extensions. Within this context, the introduction of nutrients standards in
2009, and is currently under review, would have required many improvements in the existing WWTPs to
allow for nutrients removal which would have required extra investments.

The existing watercourses suffer from many pressures from untreated sewage discharge (from
uncovered areas with sanitation), solid wastes, agriculture wastes and industrial wastes, which has
contributed to having low surface water quality and many of those watercourses do not comply with the
ambient water quality standards of Law 48/1982, and some drains have deteriorating water quality even
lower than the effluent standards of WWTPs. Accordingly, complying with the existing effluent
standards is reducing pressures on existing drains as significant amounts of pollutants are removed by
WWTPs to comply with the law. Making the effluent standards stricter may, theoretically, yield
environmental benefits in terms of more pollutants removal, but practically it would lead to a situation
where many WWTPs might be uncompliant unless they receive additional funds for treatment capacity,

                                                                                                      55
or else they might bypass portion of the influent to keep the standards, which might lead to a
cumulative negative impact on surface water quality.

           3.1.3   Handling of Sludge

The handling of sludge generated at WWTPs is regulated through Law 93/1962 and the Executive
Regulations by Decree 44/2000. According to the Law sludge should be stabilized through aerobic,
anaerobic, thermal treatment, addition of lime, co-composting with solid waste or laying in drying beds
for 6 months. The laying of sludge in drying beds should be done in 15-cm layers with maximum of 3
layers, the drying beds should be adequately isolated from the subsurface soil and groundwater. If the
dried sludge is to be used as organic fertilizers it should meet the standards shown in the table below,
otherwise it should be landfilled or safely incinerated.

Table 6: Sludge standards that should be met before utilization as fertilizer

The Law puts further limitations on the sludge distributer/user when he applies the sludge, including
limitations for the lands that will receive the sludge, the crops that will be cultivated, the
transportation/handling procedures and the rate of application according to soil type (8-14
m3/feddan/year for thick soil, 10-16m3/feddan/year for medium soil and 12-20 m3/feddan/year for light
soil).

The above standards are generally equivalent, and more stringent in some parameters, with the sludge
standards set in the US Environmental Protection Agency8, however, the application of such standards
by the WSCs has many gaps as indicated later.

              3.1.4   Management of Sewerage Networks

Connecting households, and other commercial industrial facilities, to the sewerage networks is
controlled under Law 93/1962 and Decree 44/2000. The Law stipulates that the final inspection
chamber of sewage at the household should be adequately designed and leveled to smoothly convey
the sewage discharge to the sewer at the road. Commercial and industrial units (including car services
facilities, bakeries, mills, animal barns and other facilities that produce non-regular wastewaters) should
install solids settlement and/or oil separation chambers before discharging to the public sewer. The Law
provides standards for the wastewater parameters (as indicated in the table below) that could be
accepted in the network, so that industries and commercial establishments generating high load
wastewater should install pretreatment units for their wastewater before discharging to the sewer.

minutes)


The design and operation of networks and pump stations are regulated through the Engineering Codes
issued by Decrees 286/1990 and 268/1997 respectively. The Codes provides the standards that should
be applied during design, construction and operation of networks and PSs to avoid blockage, seepage,
structural collapse, hydraulic and electromechanical malfunctioning … etc. Private networks are not
allowed except after having licensing from the regulatory authority and after fulfilling the requirement
of the Engineering Codes.

            3.1.5   Handling of Septage

The discharge of septage evacuated from individual septic tanks and cesspits to freshwater canals or
drains is not allowed according to Law 48/1982. Also the discharge of septage to land is not allowed
according to the General Cleansing Law 38/1967, and it should, according to the Law, disposed in
locations identified by the Local Authority. In terms of application, the implementation of these
conditions showed little success due to difficulty of enforcement.

            3.1.6   Handling of Hazardous Substances

The handling procedures of hazardous substances and wastes are included in Law 4/1994 with adequate
level of details. These procedures includes identification, segregation, labeling, documentation,
monitoring and emergency response. Such procedures are generally in conformity with the
requirements of the Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) of the WBG (General EHS Guidelines)
according to General International Industry Practice (GIIP).
The handling of liquid fuels, usually stored at WWTPs and PSs for back-up generators and also used
during construction, is generally regulated by Law 4/1994 which stipulates that the storage should be
according to adequate engineering requirements but does not specifically demand having an impervious
secondary containment of 110% of storage tank volume as required in EHS Guidelines.

The handling of chorine cylinders, which is the most common hazardous substances handled within
WWTPs, is further detailed in the Engineering Code for Wastewater Treatment Plants (Decree
169/1997), the Code includes design specifications and operational guidelines for handling chlorine
cylinders that consider minimizing the risk and adequate response to emergencies. Law 4/1994 (Annex
8) gives detailed thresholds for allowable concentrations of certain chemicals in the work environment,
where the maximum threshold for chorine is 0.5 ppm for 8 hours of exposure and 1 ppm for short
exposure (15 minutes). This is the same limits given by the US Occupational Safety and Health Act
(OSHA) but it is worth noting that the permissible exposure level according to the US National Institute
for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is 0.5 ppm for maximum exposure of 15 minutes.
                                                                                                      58
               3.1.7    Solid Waste Management

Solid waste is usually accumulated in screens of WWTPs and PSs as well as removed from grit removal
chambers, this separated solid waste should be adequately handled by the facilities. Solid waste
management is regulated by specific articles of Law 4/1994, in addition to the General Cleansing Law
38/1967. Both laws require waste generators to place their waste in allocated locations identified by the
local authority. This is consistent with the EHS Guidelines which require management of the waste in a
way which is consistent with the waste characteristics and conforming to local regulations, however, the
EHS Guidelines give examples for the suitable facilities for waste disposal as engineered landfills,
composting plants, safe incinerators or bioremediation sites. This is not usually available in the Egyptian
context especially in rural areas, however, best available technologies should be employed to ensure
safe disposal of solid waste. Usually available option in rural areas is to safely collect, transport and
dispose the waste in site approved by the local authority. Although sometimes this site could be an open
dumpsite, but this is the available method of disposal that would cause least environmental impacts.

               3.1.8    Air Quality

Ambient air quality standards of Law 4/1994, according to the latest modifications of 2012, includes
acceptable limits for SO2, CO, NO2, O3, PM, PM10, PM2.5, Pb and NH3. The WBG General EHS Guidelines9
include guideline values for all these parameters, while CO, Pb and NH3 regulated in Law 4/1994 are not
included in the EHS Guidelines. The Law 4/1994 limits generally meets with the interim targets of the
EHS Guidelines10, with few exceptions, while it is much less stringent than the guideline values. This gap
is not expected to be triggered, as the Program interventions have very little effects on the ambient
concentrations of the parameters included in EHS guidelines, as the sources of fuel combustion will only
be temporary during construction and operation.
For air emission from point sources Law 4/1994 provides certain standards for height of stacks as well as
allowable limits for PM, CO, SO2 and NOx. Stack height standards of Law 4/1994 is relating to the height
of adjacent structures, while it is not using the GIIP equation used in the EHS guidelines, the stack height
requirements in Law 4/1994 could be more stringent as it requires height of 2.5 times the height of
adjacent buildings with minimum height of 18 meters. The Law 4/1994 limits for PM and NO2 meet, or
more stringent than, the EHS Guidelines limits.

It is worth noting that there are no specific regulations for odor control, and the allowable ambient
concentration of ammonia (120 µg/m3), however, the detection and recognition thresholds of ammonia
are much less concentrations. Therefore the regulation of odors mainly depends on complaints of
neighboring areas of wastewater facilities and the documentation of those complaints in Environmental


9
     Which are also the WHO ambient air quality guidelines
10
     The interim targets are considering stepped approach for achieving the guideline targets.
                                                                                                         59
Register as required by Law 4/1994. Also the Ministry of Health (MoH) has introduced a condition that
WWTPs should be at least 500 meters from the nearest official settlements to safeguards against odor
and vermin impacts (Decree 27/1997).

           3.1.9   Noise

Law 4/1994 includes standards for ambient noise during night and day, in addition to standards of
occupational noise and correspondent exposure periods. The ambient noise standards are matching
with the correspondent EHS Guidelines, but the later includes additional requirement that noise caused
by an activity should not raise the background noise by more than 3 dB. The Program interventions are
not associated with noisy equipment during operation as most pumps and blowers are indoors and
usually no major noise impacts are detected at the boundaries of wastewater treatment facilities.
For the occupational noise, the maximum noise allowed by Law 4/1994 is 90 dBA for 8 hours only for
establishments that have been licensed before 2011, which is slightly higher than the maximum
occupational noise indicated in the EHS Guidelines 85 dBA for hours. However, such gap is not expected
triggered by the Program interventions because usually workshops at WWTPs or PSs only includes minor
works that do not extend for many continuous hours.

           3.1.10 Health and Safety

The Labor Law (Law 12/2003) is the main legislation regulating H&S issues, the Law comprises a Chapter
on working environment and health and safety issues, and also includes a comprehensive annex on the
safety standards to minimize physical, dynamic, biological and chemical risks.
The physical risks identified by the Law includes heat stress, cold conditions, noise and vibrations, light
intensity, explosion, radiation and pressure. The noise standards, which are the same limits stipulated in
Law 4/1994. The light illumination standards are given in the law for different types of work, and they
are more stringent than the minimum illumination limits given in EHS Guidelines. Other physical risks
indicated in the Law has little relevance to the Program.

The dynamic risks are related to moving objects and collision risks. The Law provides details of the
required precautions to be taken during construction and demolition activities, especially the safety
requirements for working at heights, scaffoldings, stairs, elevators, demolition works, excavation works
and access to work sites. Electric risks are also considered in the Law among the dynamic risks, and
there are requirements to ensure adequate insulation of live electric conductors and instruments. The
Law includes stipulations for safe working environment for construction labor, including providing safe
working conditions against dynamic risks and necessary PPE.

Biological risks are related to working in areas exposed to pathogens. The Law identified certain
requirements for safeguarding against getting infected, these requirements include having a system for
safe handling of food in designated areas within the establishment, regular vaccination for the workers
against correspondent pathogens, provide adequate PPE, carryout adequate cleaning and
housekeeping, provide facilities for personal hygiene, provide healthcare and first aid equipment and

                                                                                                        60
provide training. The Law also stipulates that establishments where workers that are handling unclean
materials, that may contaminate their cloths and bodies, should be provided with areas for washing and
changing their contaminated cloth before they leave.

Chemical risks are related to the exposure to harmful chemicals, where the most relevant chemical to
wastewater facilities is chlorine, which has been discussed earlier.

The Law also comprise stipulations for regulated establishments for taking measures to protect against
fire risks, and should abide to the requirements of Civil Defense Department, including installing fire
detectors and adequate extinguishing equipment. Furthermore, The National Housing and Building
Research (NHBRC) has issued the Egyptian Code for protecting structures from fire in four parts detailing
the requirements that should be taken during design, finishing and operation of different buildings to
safeguard against fire risks. The Code has been prepared, as indicated in its introduction, according to
international standards such as the US National Fire Protection Association and the British Standards.

The Law also requires regulated establishments to prepare emergency plans, tools for preventing
accidents and handling casualties in emergencies. The Law gives comprehensive standards that would
minimize occupational health and safety risks.

           3.1.11 Natural Habitats

Natural habitats are regulated in Egypt by Law 102/1983, where 28 areas have been declared as
protected areas in addition to 144 islands along the River Nile. The Law restricts the establishment of
structures, roads, agriculture, industrial or commercial activities unless a permit is granted from the
competent administrative authority. None of the protected areas are located within the Program
boundaries.
In addition to the protected areas regulated by Law 102/1983, EEAA has identified 34 areas as important
birds areas, some of them are coinciding with the protected areas and some are not. The identification
of important birds’ areas is meant to be guidance for planning authorities, including EEAA in clearing
EIAs, for taking measures for protecting birds, especially rare and endangered ones. Lake Manzala is the
only bird important area located within the Program geographic boundaries, and it is known for being
route of migratory birds during autumn.

           3.1.12 Cultural Heritage

Law 117/1983 has been issued for protection of antiquities and culturally valuable sites. Being one of
the richest countries of the World with antiquities from ancient civilizations, the GoE gives the Law high
importance and weight.
The Law defines antiquities as "each structure or movable object produced by different civilizations".
The definition includes productions of arts, science, literature and religions from ancient ages up to 100
years ago. The definition also includes human corpses, and species, which have remained from the
ancient ages. All discovered antiquities are registered by Decrees of the Minister of Antiquities. The Law
                                                                                                         61
includes stipulations for structural protection of known and unknown antiquities through certain
procedures for chance finds. The stipulations of the Law would adequately safeguard against negative
impacts during construction phase of the Program interventions, and the Antiquity Authorities are
closely inspecting the protection of registered sites.

           3.1.13 Land tenure and Related Laws to Land Expropriation in Egypt

    A. Land Tenure

There are three main forms of land ownership in Egypt:
    Public or State land (in Arabic Amlak Amiriya), which is divided into the State’s public domain
        that cannot be alienated and the State’s private domain, which can be alienated generally
        through sale, lease, Takhssiss (i.e. transfer of ownership conditional on meeting certain criteria,
        such as keeping the land use unchanged and paying the remaining instalments of the land price)
        or through Haq Intifaa (i.e. usufruct);
    Private land (in Arabic Mulk horr), which may be alienated/transferred freely; and
    Waqf land (land held as a trust/endowment for religious or charitable purposes), which is often
        subject to covenants on transfer or use, and which is typically transferred through leasehold or
        usufruct.

    B. Egyptian Constitution

The Egyptian Constitution recognizes three main types of ownership. Article 33 of the 2014 Constitution
provides that “the State shall protect ownership with its three types: the public, the private and the
cooperative.”

Article 35 of the Constitution further provides that “private properties shall be protected, and the right
to inheritance thereto is secured. It is not permissible to impose guardianship there on except in the
cases defined by Law and by virtue of a court judgment. Expropriation shall be allowed only in the public
interest and for its benefits, and against fair compensation to be paid in advance according to the Law.”

According to the Constitution (Article 63), all types of involuntary relocation using force or excessive
violence is banned and whoever violating this article will be brought to court" According to this article, it
is understood that amicable procedures for the private property expropriation is guarantee by law. The
competent jurisdiction shall be entitled to take cognizance of the lawsuits raised by individuals against
the administration for appropriate compensations.

    C. Other relevant laws and regulations

As mentioned above, the Constitution prohibits the expropriation of private property except for public
interest against compensation determined pursuant to the law. Law 10 of 1990 concerning the
Expropriation of Ownership for Public Interest was issued to reflect this constitutional mandate. In
                                                                                                   62
addition, expropriation of property is further regulated by Law 59 of 1979 concerning the Establishment
of New Urban Communities and Law 3 of 1982 concerning Urban Planning.

The term “public interest” in the context of expropriation has been defined in Article 2 of Law 10/1990.
The Article specifies the acts that are considered for public interest. These include:

       Constructing, widening, improving, or extending roads, streets, or squares, or the construction
        of new districts.
       Water supply and sewage projects.
       Irrigation and drainages projects.
       Energy projects.
       Construction or improvement of bridges, cross roads for railway and tunnels,
       Transportation and telecommunication projects.
       Urban planning purposes and improvements to public utilities.
       Other acts considered as acts for public interests mentioned in other laws.

In addition, other laws have also added some acts which are as follows:

       Law 3 of 1982 concerning Urban Planning added to the foregoing list acts aiming at the
        establishment of green areas and public parking.
       Prime Ministerial Decree No. 160 of 1991 added to the list the establishment of governmental
        educational buildings.
       Prime Ministerial Decree No. 2166 of 1994 further added fishery farms established by ministries,
        governmental departments, local government units, and public authorities.

Article 2 of law 10, 1990 delegates the Cabinet of Ministers to add other acts to the foregoing list.
Expropriation may not be limited to those land or buildings directly subjected to the previous acts but it
could include also any other neighboring properties that are deemed useful for the acts.
Law No. 3, 1982 for Physical Planning, in its Sixth chapter concerning District Renewal (this also applies
for slums' redevelopment or resettlement projects) has obliged the concerned local body entitled to
renewal to first plan and prepare the proposed relocation sites where the occupants of the original area
under renewal or redevelopment, would be resettled. The concerned local body should first prepare
these relocation sites to be suitable for housing and proceeding different activities of the relocates prior
to their transfer to the new site.

Article 40 of this law stated that it is not allowed to commence with the resettlement before at least one
month from officially notifying the affected groups with their new destination. Any occupant, who
would be subjected to the resettlement and receives a new housing unit, has the right to complain of its
unsuitability within 15 days of receiving the notification to a specialized committee formulated by the
concerned Governor. The committee should reach its decision concerning the complaint within a
maximum one month period. However, the right to complaint does not include the location of the new
resettlement site, rather it is only limited to the unit itself.
                                                                                                          63
    D. Expropriation Procedures

Law 10/1990 has described the expropriation procedures as follows:-
The procedures start with a declaration of public interest pursuant to a Presidential Decree
accompanied with a memorandum on the required project and a complete plan for the project and its
buildings (Law 59/1979 and Law 3/1982 provide that the Prime Minister issues the decree). The decree
and the accompanying memorandum must be published in the Official Gazette. A copy for the public is
placed in the main offices of the concerned local government unit. Based on that, the operational steps
go as follows:

       The entity requesting the expropriation of the ownership of a real property for public interest
        (“Expropriating Entity”) submits a memorandum with the request to the President or the Prime
        Minister (if a delegation of authority by the President is granted). The Egyptian General
        Authority for Land Survey (“ESA”) has been defined as the Expropriation Entity, except for
        projects handled by other entities pursuant to a law to be issued in this respect.
       The memorandum would explain the reasons for the request, stating the compensation to be
        offered to the concerned owner of the property, together with evidence that the compensation
        amount has been issued in the form of a bank check in favor of Egyptian General Authority for
        Land Survey (ESA).
       The compensation is usually determined in accordance to the prevailing price for land
        surrounding the expropriated land (the market price). These prices are taken from recorded
        contracts in the Real Estate & Authentication Offices. However, usually this entails a crucial
        problem that always faces such expropriation projects, as these prices are, in most cases, not
        real, since the parties to the contracts usually state lower prices in order to reduce charges and
        fees decided on the basis of data recorded in the contracts. Also it should be noted that the
        representatives of ESA are assumed to be experts in evaluating land prices.
       If approved, the President or the Prime Minister would issue the required decree declaring the
        property in question appropriated in the public interest and authorizing taking the property
        pursuant to direct enforcement procedures by the Expropriating Entity.
       Once the authorizing decree is published, the concerned Expropriating Entity is authorized to
        enter into the property in question in the case of long-term projects and after giving notice of its
        intention to do so for other projects. The objective of such immediate authorization is to
        conduct necessary technical and survey operations, position landmarks, and obtain information
        on the property.
       The Expropriating Entity shall communicate the authorizing decree to ESA, together with the
        information on the project to be executed and a drawing of the full project and the real
        property needed in order to take procedures for expropriating the property in question.
       According to Article 3 of the Executive Regulation of Law 10, a committee will be formed to
        determine the properties required for the public interest. The committee is to be composed of:

                                                                                                         64
            o    A representative of ESA;
            o    A representative of the local government unit within which jurisdiction the project is
                 located;
            o The treasurer of the local area in question.
       The committee shall declare its activities to the public 15 days prior to the commencement of its
        works.
       The land survey department shall verify the information collected by the committee referred to
        in the preceding paragraph by comparing such information with that found in the official
        records.
       The General Department for Appraisal within ESA shall inspect the property of the project in
        question, examine and complete the appraisal maps and lists of transactions concerning the
        property within the area of the project. It shall also prepare a consultative report with the
        estimated compensation for consideration by the Compensation Estimation Committee within
        ESA.
       After depositing the compensation amount by the Expropriating Entity within ESA—the
        concerned local office—lists of all real properties and facilities being identified shall be
        prepared, their areas, location, description, names of their owners, and holders of property
        rights therein, their addresses, and the compensation determined by the Compensation
        Estimation Committee.
       ESA shall thereafter officially notify the property owners, other concerned parties and the
        Expropriating Entity with the dates on which the lists prepared in accordance with the preceding
        paragraph shall be presented to them, at least 1 week prior to such presentation. These lists will
        be posted for a period of 1 month in the offices of the concerned local government unit and
        shall also be published in the Official Gazette and two widespread daily newspapers.
       Owners of the properties and holders of rights therein shall be officially notified with an
        evacuation request within a period not to exceed 5 months from the date of their notification.
       The holders of rights include: owners of beneficiary rights, using rights, housing rights,
        mortgaging rights, concession rights, the right holders
       Court of Cassation decisions have resolved that rights holders are those who hold rights on the
        tenement and that; accordingly, the holders of leasing rights are regarded as right holders since
        they are holders of personal rights.
       Article (26) of Law 577 of 1954 states, “All the real suits shall not stop the procedures of the
        expropriation and shall not stop its results. The rights of the right holders are transferred to the
        compensation.”

    E. Institutional Arrangements

On the central level, the governmental agency in charge of the implementation of the expropriation acts
issued for public interest is the Egyptian General Authority for Land Survey (“ESA”), except for projects
                                                                                                         65
handled by other entities pursuant to a law to be issued in this respect. As mentioned above, ESA is
charged with the formation of the expropriation and compensation committees.

Usually the executing body could be other Ministries (e.g., Ministry of Housing) or Governorate.
Accordingly, this executing agency would be responsible for paying the compensation to affected groups
through ESA or under its supervision, offering alternative resettlement options, and implementing the
resettlement project.

On the local level, several local departments and directorates should be involved in the resettlement
program depending on the type of program to be implemented and the nature of land ownership:

      Directorate of Housing and Infrastructure, this department is to be responsible for setting the
       alternative resettlement options for the affected group and participate in all operational
       procedures concerning defining compensation and setting improvement actions within informal
       settlements.
      Department of Physical Planning, this department is to be responsible for preparing the
       detailed plans for areas subjected to resettlement and provide all detailed maps and documents
       required to define the affected groups (e.g., roads right-of-ways, Set-backs,..)
      Department of Amlak, is to be responsible for providing all required documents for ownerships
       or tenure status within the affected areas with all attached historical documents for those
       properties that show the different transactions of the properties.
      Department of Land Surveying is the main responsible body for defining the size, area ad
       locations of different ownerships to be affected by the resettlement. It is also responsible for
       defining the compensation mechanisms and values in cooperation with ESA and other relevant
       local bodies.
      Department of Social Affairs is to be responsible in some cases for conducting all field surveys
       required to define the affected groups, their socio-economic status, and affordability level, their
       preference against different resettlement options and compensations mechanisms. Another
       major role to be played by this department is to mitigate the negative impact of resettlement
       whether during or after resettlement, through preparing rehabilitation programs for those
       affected group, and monitoring the impact of the process.
      Department of Legal Affairs, to deal with legal issues related to tenure and ownerships and
       resolve dispute between different involved parties
      Head of District (Local Governorate Unit) where the resettlement project takes place, to
       manage the overall project

    F. Issue of Tenants and Squatters
Although Law 10/1990 does not clearly specify lessees as entitled to compensation, however, lessees
implicitly fall within the group of “right holders” referred to in the law.


                                                                                                       66
It is clear, however, that lessees may not have recourse against the landlord for termination of their
lease agreements as a result of the expropriation act.

Another important issue that has not been addressed in Egyptian law, is the right of squatters to be
compensated in cases of displacement or resettlement. The Egyptian legislation framework has not
recognized the rights of squatters whether squatting took place on State private land (where adverse
possession applies after 15 years of peaceful visible and uninterrupted possession) versus those of State
public land (where no adverse possession applies irrespective of time). However, the Egyptian
experiences in dealing with this issue has shown the fact that due to the political pressure and the social
dimension, the government has been forced to provide an alternative for those groups of households
whether in terms of alternative shelter, cash liquidity or other types of in-kind compensation (e.g. jobs).

           3.1.14 Decrees and procedures for regulating households’ connection fees

As per law27 year 1978 regulating public resources for water and sanitation, covering the cost of the
households’ connection is the responsibility of the beneficiary. According to the WSCs, the exact amount
that each household is requested to pay depends on the distance of the house from the main force, the
number of houses participating in the communal inspection chambers and the amount of works and
material associated with each item. It is roughly estimated that each household should pay and average
of EGP 1300 to EGP 1500 to get the building connected to the public sanitation network once a project is
completed in the area. This connection fees get higher in some cases to reach EGP 3000. This should be
covering the cost of the engineering measurements by the WSC, installation of inspection chamber,
installation of the communal chamber (normally 2 to 3 houses get connected to the chamber) and the
associated labor. The measurements and the supervision of works are mandated to the WSCs’ technical
department. If the contractor does not carry out the works for the households’ connection, the
beneficiary has to provide the labor needed for this process.

3.2 HCWW/WSCs Environmental and Social Management Procedures

Although the legislation, policies and guidelines covering environmental and social issues sufficiently
capture the issues, with few gaps as identified above, in terms of management procedures to comply
with those standards, many improvements need to be introduced. The limited institutional capacity is
one of the main drawback in the existing procedures of HCWW/WSCs as many of the required
environmental and social measures were carried out by NOPWASD which left the HCWW/WSCs with
limited practical experience in those areas. Also some issues, such as sludge handling and HSE issues,
require resources that are not readily available in WSCs. Description of the current procedures and
correspondent gaps in complying with national legislation, policies and guidelines are discussed below.




                                                                                                        67
           3.2.1   Organizational Set-up for managing the environmental and social issues

    A) Environmental Issues

The management of the environmental issues related to the sector is usually carried out by different
departments in WCSs. The effluent quality in WWTPs is supervised by the General Department for
Sewage Effluent Quality and Environmental Affairs, which is under the Quality Sector as indicated in the
Figure 3. The H&S issues are managed through the General Department for Occupational Health and
Safety under the Chairman as indicated in




                                                                                                      68

    B) Social Issues

Social Issues related to the sanitation projects, more specifically, handling land, engaging with
communities (e.g. consultations with communities and awareness raising) and handling grievance, are
done through number of departments on the level of the HCWW and the WSCs.

    1- Departments in charge of issues related to land acquisition:

The Properties Department within the WSCs is the key department in charge of assets and properties
management and supervising the actions and procedures related to the WSC properties. This also
includes taking actions and coordinating with the Legal Department to acquire land for various projects
and ensuring that the acquired land is protected against any illegal occupancies or uses. The Properties
Department reports in some cases to the General Department for Administrative Affairs under the
Human Resources and Administrative Sector within the WSC (e.g. in Behaira Governorate). In other
cases, it reports to the Legal Department of the WSC (e.g. Dakahlya Governorate).

Job description of the Properties Department

The Properties Department in the WSCs has number of mandates relate to defining, supervising and
protecting the WSC’s assets including buildings and other structures. The Department’s responsibilities
include the following main key relevant responsibilities to land acquisition:



                                                                                                                             70
        Follow up on the procedures for allocating new structures for the companies to establish new
         projects.
        Follow up on the WSC’s land along with the authorized maps and take all administrative and
         legal actions to prevent violation against this land in coordination with the Legal Department.
        Coordinate with relevant department to update the WSC land property database regularly
        Maintain records and maps related to the WSC properties.
         Update the WSC property database

The job description of WSCs does not explicitly include the responsibility of land acquisition, although
they have the legal mandate of land acquisition for the construction of WWTPs, pumping stations and
sewage networks. As indicted in several sections, the WCSs role starts after the investment is completed
by NOPWASD. This is the reason why the roles related to land acquisition and handling land is not of
substantive weight for the Properties Department.

     2- Department in charge of community engagement:

As currently taking place, the responsibility of engaging with communities is fragmented among number
of departments within the WSCs. The General Department for Public Relations and Awareness 11 is one
of the main departments in charge of engaging with the customers through surveys, awareness raising
campaigns and other reaching out activities. Public relations work including arranging events and
coordinating with media is still a core mandate for this department.
Apart from this institutionally formal mechanism as part of the WSCs, Rural Sanitation Units (RSUs) were
created in Governorates where Bank-financed projects are operating, namely Sharkia and Behaira. RSUs
members are usually seconded from their original departments (e.g. the Sanitation Department or the
Public Relations and Awareness Department). Teams of the RSUs are mandated to ensure various
measures are in place including mechanisms for consultations with local communities, designing
grievance mechanisms…etc. The RSUs indicted that one key difference between the responsibilities of
the RSU and the other concerned department (e.g. the Public Relations and Awareness Department)
under the WSCs is that the RSUs mandates include engaging with local communities before the start of
the sanitation projects.

Job description of the Public Relations and Awareness Department

The analysis of the mandates of the “Public Relations and Awareness Department”-across the targeted
WSCs revealed that the announced job description for the departments and its mapped staff is not
consistent across the WSCs. While the orientation of the job description of certain departments was
more on public relations aspects (e.g. Dakahlya WSC), other WSCs’ job description involved more


11
  The name “General Department Public Relations and Awareness” is used in this report to refer to the
department within the WSCs which is mandated with community engagement and awareness. The name of the
department varies from one WSC to the other. The most common name for the department is the “ General
Department Public Relations and Awareness” which is being used here in this assessmen t.
                                                                                                           71
awareness and community mobilization activities. However, this discrepancy between the formal job
description is not actually reflected on the actual work plan of the WSCs. There is generally big
consistency in the type of activities and the objectives of various Public Relations and Awareness
Departments as will be elaborated below. According to the consulted staff within the WSCs, the Public
Relations and Awareness Department used to focus on the functions of public relations tasks12 until they
received guidance from the HCWW requesting attention to be given to the awareness component.
However, in practical terms, the public relations tasks are still given priority because they are handled as
corporate image.

Box 1: Sample of the job description of the Public Relations and Awareness Departments (selected
tasks related to water and sanitation from Behaira Governorate)

        Ongoing awareness to bring behavioral change
        Carry out customers satisfaction surveys
        Communicate with various stakeholders including religious institutions, schools, agricultural
         associations, youth centers, and clubs to raise the awareness about sanitation issues
        Highlight successful models for sanitation in villages and present it to citizens and societies for
         implementation.
        Conduct field visits in an attempt to change the environmental behaviors of citizens and clarify
         the impact of sanitation on general health
        Identify the sources of pollution, and spread awareness to limit their impact.
        Spread awareness through seminars, publications, audio and audio-visual media, and conduct
         visits to WWTP and pubbing stations.
        Conduct surveys inside the company to identify employees’ needs, and the problems they face
        Run awareness sessions for the company staff to educate them about the Company’s mission
         and policy.
        Develop a database showing the number of families and population, and prepare statistics
         related to the areas served with sanitation services by the Company, and those implemented
         through community contributions, as well as the areas without any sanitation services.

Reporting lines for the Public Relations and Awareness Department
The teams of the General Department for Public Relations and Awareness on the WSC level are working
together to cover the dual nature of activities, namely public relations and awareness raising, that they
are handling without clear division of responsibilities. The same teams report to two separate lines
within the HCWW. For the public relations aspects, they report to the General Department for Public
Relations and Media which in turn reports directly to the Chairman. Public relations aspects are also
being reported on daily basis to the WSCs’ Chairmen. In the meantime, the part related to awareness
raising within the WSCs is being reported to the General Department of Public Awareness and
Customers’ Service of the HCWW which in turn reports to the Performance Upgrade Sector. In very

12
 Examples on these tasks include arranging workshops and various events, connecting with
media …etc
                                                                                                           72
practical terms, public relations responsibilities always overweight the awareness responsibilities due to
the link to the corporate image and the fact that public relations issues are reported directly to the top
managerial level within the WSCs and the HCWW.

    3- Department in charge of grievance mechanism:

There is a number of channels for receiving complaints related to the water and wastewater services.
The Hotline “125” was established in 2004 to be the key channel that is meant to streamline grievance
from various sources. In practice, there are other operational channels including the Customers Service,
laboratory staff, maintenance service staff, WSCs receptions, and commercial personnel who also
received complaints and grievance without being strictly documented. Moreover, other channels like
media, Governors’ Offices, Prime Minister Office receive various types of complaints related to different
sectors. Phased improvements are being introduced on the Hotline to enhance the service, allow for
better monitoring and supervision, systemize and unify the hotline work across all WSCs. Because each
of WSCs have been in charge of financing its own improvements (e.g. introducing database, connecting
to the HCWW database, etc), the progress in the improvements is not moving on fast pace because it is
largely dependent on the financial capabilities and the capacity of the WSCs which are not consistent.

There are also the “Customers Service Centers” which are located on the level of all branches
(Markazes) in all the Governorates. A total of 400 centers operate across the country with over 5000
staff. Although the Hotline is reachable by all customers across the country, the “Customers Service
Centers” are the only official mechanism on the Markaz level that allow direct interaction with the
teams of the WSCs and the Branches. The Centers receive different types of complaints but their core
operation objective is more oriented to issues related to billing and connecting new customers
(subscription). The centers’ operation mode is widely on manual basis and no automated service is
functioning in the centers yet.

Reporting line for the Hotline (Key grievance mechanism)

The department in charge of receiving complaints formally on the level of the WSCs is the Citizens’
Service and Hotline Department. A total of 600 staff who are employed in Call Centers across Egypt
operating through 115 seats/lines across the 25 WSCs. The Department reports to the Department of
Public Awareness and Customers’ Service on the HCWW level where 9 staff at the HCWW Public
Awareness and Customers’ Service Department are dedicated to the monitoring of the Call Centers. On
a daily basis, WSCs send reports to the HCWW documenting the number of grievances received, the
actions taken to handle and progress in resolving the complaints. They also send sample of the recorded
calls. There are 2 kind of monitoring checks that are carried out on daily basis by the Public Awareness
and Customers Service Department at the HCWW:

       Quality of Hotline service / Customer’s quality of service survey: 10% of the customers who
        called the hotline are called back to check with them the quality of service they received and if

                                                                                                       73
         their complaints was resolved. Water quality type complaints are usually given higher priority in
         the check process with 50% of the calls related to water quality are being checked on daily basis.
        Quality of calls/ Calls review: 10% of the recorded calls that are sent to the HCWW are checked
         for the quality of service offered by the hotline operator. Emails are sent to the operators with
         feedbacks from the HCWW copying the other WSCs to share lessons and feedbacks

The HCWW produces regular reports on the types of complaints received and this report is used to
inform the decision makers.

The following is the main criteria that the HCWW General Department of Public Awareness and
Customers’ Service is using to monitor the performance of the Citizens’ Service and Hotline Department
within the WSCs:

        Feedback of the customers during the call
        Regularity in sending reports to the HCWW
        Quality of service through the recorded calls
        Modernizing the call center
        Receiving calls 24 hours
        Responsiveness to the complaints13
        Obtaining recognized certificate
        The records of the host company about the number of completed calls against the number of
         unanswered or busy calls.

Centers. Those specifically include technical assistance, supporting in branding and in unifying the look
of the centers and building database and automating their system.

    4- EWRA (the key authority for monitoring the performance of the HCWW/WSCs)

   The Egyptian water and Wastewater Regulatory Agency has been established pursuant to the
   presidential Decree No. 136/2004, it is considered as independent legal entity subordinate to the
   Minister of Housing, Utilities and Urban Development . According to the presidential Decree; some of
   EWRA responsibilities are as follows:
        Regulate, follow-up and audit everything related to drinking water and wastewater activities
         for all customers, either that performed by governmental projects or projects that commit to
         other authorities by the country in this field according to Laws or drinking water and
         wastewater units that established by the private projects in a manner enable and encourage
         these projects to a achieve the highest level of performance which ensure service sustainability
         in required quality and efficiency and provide the service to customers in satisfactory and
         affordable manner.
        Assuring that purification, desalination, transportation, distribution and sale activities of
         drinking water and activities of collecting, treating and safe discharging of wastewater and
         industrial discharge that performed by governmental authorities and the authorities that the
         country commit to privilege work in this field are according to law, and assuring that drinking
         water and wastewater units that established by private projects are performed according to
         laws and regulations applied in A.R.E, especially that concerning quality and environment
         protection.
        Auditing consumption, purification, desalination, transportation, distribution of drinking water
         plans and collecting, treating and safe discharging of wastewater and industrial discharge
         plans, periodically, including necessary investments to insure the availability of these plans to
         achieve the country’s policy in this field.

Despite the critical importance of monitoring the the environmental and social impacts and risks related
to the construction of new projects, currently EWRA does not have any mandates in this regard.
Environmental and social impacts and risks related to the construction is not also within the mandates
of EWRA. It is not also within their supervision scope of EWRA over the WSCs to monitor the
performance of the WSCs in handling environmental and social impacts and risks.

           3.2.2   Environmental Licensing and Follow-up Procedures

The preparation of EIAs for sanitation projects is currently being supervised by NOPWASD as it is
responsible for the new investments. Under the ISSIP 1 and 2, the PIU and RSUs in the HCWW and WSCs

                                                                                                       75
respectively took the lead for recruiting consultants to carry out the EIAs and follow up the licensing
procedures of EEAA, however, the main supervision on those EIAs were done centrally by the HCWW
with relatively limited contribution from WSCs.
The WSCs currently do not have institution set-up for initiating and following up ESIAs, except for the
RSUs established under ISSIP 1 and 2 (in Behaira and Sharkia).

The approval process by EEAA is well integrated in the licensing system, and usually they grant the
approval if the EIA is compatible with the requirements of the EIA Guidelines, and after securing the
approval of other concerned ministries, such as the MoH approval after fulfilling the 500-meter buffer
zone between residential areas and WWTPs, the approval Ministry of Agriculture, Civil Defense
Department, Antiquities Authority and the Local Authority. EEAA approval will only be granted if the EIA
demonstrated that the project facilities will comply with applicable laws and regulations, and if there are
site specific issues EEAA grants a conditional approval on implementing adequate measures to manage
those issues. The EEAA approval usually emphasizes on the importance of having an updated
environmental register for the facility.

EEAA Regional Branch Offices carry out inspections to operating WWTPs to check their compliance with
environmental legislation. Usually the inspection focuses on taking samples from the final effluent
(which is being done by many other bodies as indicated later) and making observations regarding
nuisance and noise. According to the visits carried out by the Bank’s team during the preparation of this
ESSA, each WWTP receives an inspection from EEAA every one year.

It was noticed by the Bank’s team during the visits that many WWTPs are not keeping a consolidated
environmental register, which is one of the gaps that would be addressed in the PAP.

           3.2.3   Land Acquisition Procedures

A. Land Acquisition Approaches
Generally speaking, when a rural sanitation project is being planned and land is needed, and in order to
avoid the implication of resettlement and the associated costs, avoidance strategy is followed through
giving the option of obtaining state owned land a priority as a favorable option. In case of unavailability
of state owned land, there are four other different approaches to obtain the land for pumping stations
and WWTPs, including i) voluntary land donation, ii) community contribution which is a very common
approach for pumping station; iii) willing buyer-willing seller; and iv) acquiring land by using eminent
domain. The WSCs are not heavily involved in the process of finalizing land purchase (willing buyer
willing seller approach) for pumping stations and waste water treatment plants (WWPTs) because the
part relates to investment for sanitation project is officially mandated to National Organization for
Potable Water and Sanitary Drainage (NOPWASD). Although there is no legal obstacles for the WSCs to
complete the process of acquiring land through both purchase and donations, the lack of resources for
the WSCs usually limit their chances in land acquisition, specifically the purchase part. Accepting

                                                                                                        76
donated land or land obtained through community contribution for pumping station is a more common
area for the involvement of the WSCs compared to the purchase for WWTP.

The Properties Department under the Legal Department within WSC is responsible for the land purchase
(in the scarce cases of the WSCs’ involvement in land purchase) and for accepting donated land or land
obtained through community land contribution for pumping stations. If the land for pumping stations
cannot be obtained through community contribution in a few cases, it will be obtained through willing
buyer-willing seller approach. For WWTPs, the lands are obtained mainly through willing buyer-willing
seller approach. WSCs are reluctant to use eminent domain to acquire land as it may take longer time.

B. Land Acquisition Procedures16

1) Voluntary Land Donation

In certain cases, land owners (specifically well-off owners) are willing to donate their own land for the
various components of the projects. The following are generally the key steps that are normally taken
for voluntary land donation:

Step 1. Identify land donor. When WSC decides to implement a sanitation scheme in a village, the WSC
reach out to communities using various tools that may involve engaging CDAs, the LGUs, community
leaders or putting advertisement on local newspaper to call for land owners to willingly donate their
land for the project.

Step 2. Identify the site for pumping station based on technical criteria. When WSC receives a few
offers from the willing sellers, they will assign technical consultant to identify the most technically
feasible site for the pumping station based on the technical criteria. When the donation approach is
used, the power of choice is, by definition, one key prerequisite. Several locations are usually identified
and if the land of the person who is willing to donate proves to be compatible technically, the process of
donation moves forward.

Step 3. Reach agreement with land donor. A person (or a group) come to offer to donate his/their land
for the project with no monetary return. The only return for the donor in this case is to get connected to
the project. The person who donates the land is normally a well off person and the amount of land he
offers constitutes only small share of his land holding. The person who donates the land may also has a
non-land based sources of income.




16
  The procedures listed on the ESSA are for the various land acquisition approaches are not based on official
documentation but rather the discussion with the WSCs. There is a possibility that individual variances in the
procedures exist between one WSC and the other. The illustration of this section is made to the best of the ESSA’s
team understanding.
                                                                                                               77
Step 4. Sign an initial agreement with the land donor. Once the site of pumping station is identified by
technical consultant, WSC will, through LGU, sign an initial agreement with land owner to use the land
for the pumping station.

Step 5. Obtaining various approvals. When the pumping station land is obtained through voluntary land
donation, as explained above, it is usually the responsibility of the Local Governorate Unit (LGU) to
secure the approvals.

Step 6. Transfer the land title. The donor goes to the Notary Department to issue a waiver that state his
donation for the land for the interest of the LGU. A “Donation Contract” is being signed between the
landowner (who voluntarily donated his land) and the LGU. The LGU then transfers ownership of the
land to the WSC by following the relevant legal procedures.

ii) Community Contribution

This is a very common approach for acquiring pumping stations. However, some cases were also
introduced for WWTP. Few differences in the procedures for land donation exist among Governorates.
However, the following are generally the key steps that are normally taken for community land
donation.

Step 1. Identify land willing sellers17. When WSC decides to implement a sanitation scheme in a village,
the WSC reach out to communities using various tools that may involve engaging CDAs, the LGUs, and
community leaders or putting advertisement on local newspaper to call for land owners to willingly sell
their land

Step 2. Identify the site for pumping station based on technical criteria. When WSC receives a few
offers from the willing sellers, they will assign technical consultant to identify the most technically
feasible site for the pumping station based on the technical criteria.

Step 3. Reach agreement with landowner on the land selling (called in the contract “donation”) price.
Led by one of the trustworthy delegated figures (Omda, religious leader…etc.), the project village will
negotiate with the land owner on the land price. The price of the land is informally valuated according to
the prevailing prices in the area and the requested value is communicated with local communities
through a community trustworthy figure.

Step 3: Collecting the shares of households ‘contribution: Through a community-led process, the
average share of household is calculated along with any special arrangement to exempt poor

17
  The word “seller“ is being used here under community contribution because the process actually involve selling
land by an individual/few individuals to the village community at large. Community members here are the real
donors (contributors) who provided cash to secure the land. In the contract (which is the official documentation of
the process), the person (s) who sold the land is regarded as the “donor” and the community members are not
mentioned formally.
                                                                                                                78
households18. A trustworthy figure within the community is being charged as the key channel 19 for the
collection of the donations from households. The whole process including money collection, following
up and documentation is being managed through local communities and largely through the community
channel that was identified and delegated to lead the process. The WSC is generally not involved in this
process.

Step 4. Sign an initial agreement with the land owner. Once the site of pumping station is identified by
technical consultant, WSC will, through LGU, sign an initial agreement with land owner to use the land
for the pumping station.

Step 5. Obtaining various approvals. When the pumping station land is obtained through community
contribution, as explained above, it is usually the responsibility of the Local Governorate Unit (LGU) to
secure approvals.

Step 6. Transfer the land title. The donor (who is a seller to the community in this case) goes to the
Notary Department to issue a waiver that state his donation for the land for the interest of the LGU. A
“Donation Contract” is being signed between the landowner (who sold his land to local communities)
and the LGU. The LGU then transfers ownership of the land to the WSC by following the relevant legal
procedures.

iii) Willing buyer-willing seller approach20

Step 1. Identify WWTP sites. WSC assigns the design consultant to nominate appropriate sites for the
WWTP based on the technical criteria and in coordination with the Governorate Local Unit (LGU) as
representing government authority and other community representatives.

Step 2. Obtain initial interest from the landowners to sell the land for the project use. When the WWTP
nominated sites are identified, WSC in collaboration with LGU communicate with the landowner(s) to
get their initial interest in selling their land voluntarily for construction of the WWTP. This step helps in
screening out the sites whose owners are not willing to sell. During this stage, land owners also state
roughly the price they expect to obtain from selling their land. The received rough financial offers, along
with the technical specifications of the land allow the WSC to prioritize their preferences among the
various assigned plots.

18
   As part of villages social solidarity, exempting poor households from paying is a very common arrangement in
most of the villages.
19
   This channel is very much dependent on the local context within the villages. While some of the examined cases
depended fully on natural leaders like Omdas who manage the process through mutually trusted word of mouth,
other villages have done the money collection through a CDA that opened a special bank account for this purpose
and collect contributions against payment receipts.
20
   This approach is mainly used for WWTPs and it is largely done by NOPWASD as per their legal mandates. WSCs
can still follow the same procedures to purchase land for WWTP but the case is that they now rarely do because of
limitation in resources. The above describes the willing buyer willing seller general procedures.
                                                                                                              79
Step 3. Signing a “Coordination Contract”: A coordination contract is being signed between the land
owners of the selected best offer and the WSC.

Step 4. Determine the purchase price of the land. A Committee is formed by the Chairman of the
HCWW (or NOPWASD if it is the agency that will purchase). The committee is composed from various
relevant authorities (surveying department, technical department in WSC, representative from the LGU,
etc) to determine the price of the land. The purchase price is usually determined based on the prevailing
market price of the land in the project area.

Step 5. Get approval from line ministries. While the Committee is determining the purchase price, the
WSC (or NOPWASD if it is the agency that will purchase) starts getting all approvals from relevant line
ministries for changing the land use. Normally, it needs to get approval from three ministries (Ministry
of Agriculture, Ministry of Environment, and Ministry of Health). The WSC (or NOPWASD if it is the
agency that will purchase) needs to send request to these three ministries. To provide approvals, these
ministries will check the selected land in terms of their own criteria and in terms of the impacts of the
selected site on their facilities and infrastructure within the site.

Step 6. Negotiate with the landowner(s). Once the price is determined by the Committee and the
approvals are obtained from line ministries, the WSC (or NOPWASD if it is the agency that will purchase)
informs the landowners the price determined by the Committee. If the landowner(s) agree with the
price, it will proceed to next step. If not, another location will need to be identified starting from Step 1.

Step 7. Purchasing the land. Once the agreement is reached with the landowner(s) on the purchase
price, the land price is being paid directly to the landowner.

Step 8. Transfer the land title. Land title is transferred to the WSC (or NOPWASD if it is the agency that
will purchase) through following the legal steps. The payment is made to the landowners based on the
agreed purchasing price, and process the legal procedures to transfer the land to the WSC. Payment
could be made on installments depending on the agreement with the landowners.




                                                                                                           80
iv) Acquiring land by using eminent domain

The process of acquiring land by using eminent domain is mainly based on the Law 10 regulating “the
Expropriation of Real Estates for Public Interest” issued in 1990. According to the law, water and
sanitation projects are classified among public interest projects.

Eminent domain will be used to acquire the land when mutual agreement cannot be reached with the
landowner(s) on the purchasing price. In such case, the Governor will: a) issue a land expropriation
decree based on the maps received from the Surveying Agency (affiliates to the Ministry of Water
Resources and ; b) deposit the money to an escrow account based on the value determined by the High
Committee (with the leadership of the land acquisition department under the Surveying Authority) ; c)
issue a permit to WSC to have access to the land and to start the construction. This step is made after
the Notary Department issue an official contract that replaces the name of the owner with the name of
the WSC.

In such case, the landowner(s) can appeal through the court. Then WSC is obliged to pay the
landowner(s) the value determined by the court even if the value is higher than what has been
previously determined by the High Committee.

           3.2.4   Procedures for Connecting Sewers

As indicted above, the households’ connection is the responsibility of the beneficiary (household). The
WSC carry out the “measurement” associated to the household’s connection. WSC collects the fees of
the measurements and provide the needed material to the beneficiary. WSC also provide direct
supervision on the workers who install the household connection to ensure they are following the
technical requirements.
The households’ connection fees are normally paid directly to the WSCs in cash. In dealing with poor
households who cannot afford to pay the full amount in cash, it was observed that each WSC is handling
this aspect as seen appropriate. While Sharkia is offering installment scheme to all interested
beneficiaries, Behaira WSC mentioned that they do not apply this and the only instalment mechanism
they offer if through the Housing and Development Bank which top up some interest on the
beneficiaries. Dakahlya WSCs indicated that they cooperate with CDAs and community leaders to
identify the cases that need support and they offer them instalments. According to the meetings with
the WSCs, the choice of offering installment to beneficiaries on the water bill is always available to the
WSCs but it is their decision to choose to apply it.

Some villages which are not connected to a public sewer, construct, through local initiatives, a private
sewerage networks that usually end at an agricultural drain. Such networks are not legally licensed and
usually do not conform with adequate engineering specifications, therefore, WSCs do not usually favor
connecting such private networks to their system as they are subject to many operational problems,
such as blockage and leakages.


                                                                                                       81
           3.2.5    Procedures for O&M Affecting Water Quality

WSCs work to comply with effluent standards through two main strategies: 1) the control of discharges
received in the network eliminating high loads and 2) the operation control of the WWTPs.
In terms protecting the network, the wastewater standards stipulated in Law 93/1962 (Table 7) are
frequently monitored and inspected for industrial establishments, especially in industrial cities and for
those industries which covey their wastewaters to the sewerage networks via tankers. This inspection is
usually not carried out frequently for commercial establishments and rarely done for animal barns and
farm slurry, which is most relevant to the rural areas covered by the program. The shock loads from
animal barns are reported to be one of the reasons for reducing WWTPs efficiency in rural areas, this is
usually managed through maneuvering the influent among parallel lines to distribute the load and to
operate idle treatment capacities (in WWTPs with extra design capacity). The regulation of such shock
loads through inspection on upstream waste generators is very difficult to accomplish, as such
generators are typically households with annexed small barns.

Most of the WWTPs in the Program areas are complying with Law 48/1982 standards of effluent quality.
This is usually verified at the WWTP level through taking daily samples from the influent, effluent and
different points at the treatment stream, and when some water quality issues arise there would be
direct coordination to improve the operation at the problem area to return to the standards. Usually
such plants meet the effluent quality standards except for few exceptional cases where some
operational problems arise.

On the other hand, there are some WWTPs that are known for being non-compliant with the effluent
standards for different factors. The common reason for this is that those WWTPs require investments
for major repairs or extensions to provide sufficient treatment. Table 9 illustrates the number of WWTPs
in the above categories in WSCs and the Number of WWTPs that will be included in the NRSP. Annex 1,
includes further details about the technologies, discharges, receiving drains and additional discharges
through the Program interventions.

the standards


Effluent quality is regularly monitored, in addition to the self-monitoring my WWTPs, by MoH as
stipulated in Law 48/1982. Usually each WWTP receives inspection visit from MoH every three months.
When identifying non-compliance, in some cases the MoH open dialogue with WSCs to overcome this, in
other cases the MoH initiate litigations against the manager of the WWTPs who would face accusations
and may end up paying fines or even face imprisonment. Furthermore, effluent quality is monitored by
EWRA on an annual basis, and by EEAA also as indicated earlier.

Some of the overloaded WWTPs, which face operational problems, tend to bypass the discharges in
excess to its effective capacity to the drain. This is not a documented procedure or a technical
recommendation, but some WWTP managers tend to do that for keeping their effluent quality to the
extent possible, especially that the bypass line, or the discharge outfall to the drain is not monitored,
but inspection bodies usually take effluent samples from the effluent collection point after chlorination.

Furthermore, some WSCs connect villages to PSs which are not connected to WWTPs due to lack of
funding for constructing force mains, so these PSs discharge untreated sewage to drains. This is defined
as “negative discharge” and is one of the shortcomings that are expected to be addressed by the PAP.

In terms of monitoring ambient water quality, usually the National Water Research Center (NWRC)
through its Drainage Research Institute (DRI) for monitoring drains’ water quality and the Nile Research
Institute (NRI) for monitoring the Nile and freshwater canals.

It is worth noting that most of the agriculture drains, especially in the Delta Region, face significant
environmental pressures from different sources, including discharge of septage, wastewaters from
illegal private networks, industrial wastewaters, domestic solid wastes that usually accumulates on the
banks of canals and drains due to lack of collection system in most rural areas, and agriculture drains
loaded with remains agrochemicals. According to baseline surveys carried out under the ISSIP in the past
two years, water quality in all monitored drains exceeds the ambient water quality standards for drains
that could be mixed with freshwaters. For example the ambient BOD and COD standards are 10 and 15

                                                                                                       83
ppm respectively, BOD and COD in some monitored drains under the ISSIP reached about 70 and 300
respectively.

           3.2.6   Procedures for the Management of Septage

Usually the septage is removed from cesspits in unserved areas by local contractors using tankers, and
then they discharge the septage in the nearest location in an agriculture drain or even in freshwater
canals. Although such conduct is not allowed according to Law 48/1982 and Law 38/1967, the
monitoring and enforcement on a large number of tankers is very difficult and sometimes impossible.
Furthermore, most of the WSCs do not allow for receiving septage in their sewers and WWTPs, as there
is no system in place to allow for regulating the receiving of septage. WSCs would usually be unwilling to
accept septage with high organic loads that would add to the shock loads received in WWTPs and may
affect their performance and the quality of the final effluent. However, some WSCs, such as Dakahlia,
allow for receiving domestic and industrial wastewater from plants not covered by the sewerage
services, against a certain fee (L.E. 70/m3 in Dakahlia).

The lack of an official system to handle septage, although helps in reducing shock loads at WWTPs level,
risks attaining the objectives of sanitation projects on surface water quality, as the unregulated small
scale septage discharges to surface water will continue to be one of the major pressures on water
quality. Accordingly on site sanitation, including official septage management system that would serve
remote and satellite villages, would be included in Result Areas of the Program, this system will be
identified during the feasibility studies for each governorate.

           3.2.7   Procedures for the Management of Sludge

The sludge is collected in drying beds of WWTPs, stays for 6 month for stabilization by drying and
exposure to sun. Afterwards, the sludge is sold to organic fertilizers contractors who usually distributed
in new reclaimed lands east and west of the Nile valley. The selling of sludge is carried out through
tendering process by the WSCs, the winning contractor signs the contract with WSCs and pays the price,
and then he arranges to collect the sludge from the WWTP identified by the WSC

The Quality Sector and laboratories, either in WSCs or in WWTPs, do not monitor the sludge quality as
required by Law 93/1962 and Decree 44/2000, accordingly the WCSs do not check the adequacy of
selling the sludge. The contracts with sludge contractors usually include a general requirement about
the safe use of sludge indicating that it is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure this. The sludge
handling in WWTPs is one of the gaps that are later addressed in the PAP.

           3.2.8   Procedures for engaging with communities

Along the life cycle of a rural sanitation project, interaction with local communities takes place during
different phases using different approaches. The following section briefly presents the existing
procedures and mechanisms to engage with communities along various stages of the project. More
details are presented under sections 5.1.3. and 5.2.3 on the procedures and capacity assessment.


                                                                                                         84
     Procedures for engaging with communities in the preparation and planning stage:
Previously, HCWW was not heavily involved in planning and preparation of rural sanitation projects. The
formal role of the HCWW and the WSCs is more about O&M. No structured mechanism is followed to
carry out communities’ needs assessment for sanitation projects. Decisions on implementing projects in
certain villages largely depend on the severity of the problem in the village which is manifested either
through high levels of pollutions, complaints and requests from the villagers communicated through
various channels, most importantly media. There is no mechanism also to engage the communities in
the planning of the projects and in deciding on the appropriate technology.

In the cases when private land for pumping stations or treatment plants need to be acquired, interaction
with land owners (in cases of willing buyer-willing seller) or the land donors or land owners and a larger
spectrum of local communities (in case of the community contribution or voluntary land donation) is
done by the WSCs as explained above. However, the WSCs play a role of more technical and legal nature
in this regard. The social aspects related to land are not very much taken into consideration. In the cases
of community donation, the role of WSCs is minimal and the process is heavily delegated to
communities with trivial supervision or follow up from the WSCs.

      Procedures for engaging with communities during project construction
During projects construction (specifically the construction of the networks), the WSCs play a supervisory
role over the contractors. Through their teams and supervision consultants, the WSCs have the role of
supervising of the work related to extending networks. The implementation of measures to address the
environmental and social is the responsibility of the WSCs. Under the Bank financed projects, the
implementation of the ESMP was the responsibility of the WSCs (specifically the RSUs). In Governorates
without RSUs, it was strongly observed that the monitoring of the construction process has technical
orientation nature. The social issue that may arise (e.g. damage in structures) is left for the contractor to
handle. There is also a tendency to handle the social impacts related to construction through a reactive
approach. The absence of local grievance system and systematic methods for consultations with local
communities result in high probability for unresolved complaints. Although the departments of the
Public Relations and Awareness Raising have a role to play with the water and wastewater customers,
this role does not cover engaging with communities during the construction phase.
      During project operation and maintenance

As will be elaborated below in more details, the HCWW and the concerned departments within the
WSCs have number of key mandates that involve community engagement in the project operations and
maintenance. Awareness raising, measuring community satisfaction and handling grievance mechanisms
are the key relevant fronts for community engagement during projects’ operation. These functions are
not limited to the sanitation projects. The water supply and the associated topics are actually over
dominating the attention and the scope of work of the WSCs as will be elaborated in more details
below.


                                                                                                          85
     Project monitoring
Part of the activities that are conducted during project operation, some activities feed into the
monitoring of the project. Most important of these activities are the community satisfaction survey and
the awareness campaigns. The assessment of the procedures, however, showed that the process of
monitoring of the performance of these activities is largely done on the basis of measuring the
completion of the activities to assess the performance of the Public Relations and Awareness Raising
Department teams of the WSCs. The impacts of these activities on the beneficiaries/customers (e.g.
change in knowledge and level of awareness) or weather the findings of the activities have informed the
decision making process are not measured systematically.

              3.2.9   Procedures for Handling H&S Risks

WSCs have H&S Departments within its organizational charts, as indicated above. The human resources
and equipment available for these departments, although varies between different WSCs, usually need
to be improved for minimizing the risks.
Although the Engineering Codes for WWPTs and for fire protection include sufficient measures for
safeguarding against chlorine leakage and fire risks, some of the facilities designs do not follow these
safeguards and sometimes safety issues arise during operation such as: not complying with having
disposal basin for chlorine bottles, not allowing for mechanical handling of those bottles, not having
enough space for access of fire trucks … etc. Interviewed H&S personnel are aware of these
shortcomings, but usually they are not intervening during the design phase, which is usually done by
NOPWASD, and during the operation changing the design would be rather difficult. The PAP in Chapter 6
includes measures to overcome this issue through including H&S standards in the ToRs for the design
works and allowing H&S staff to review and verify the designs.

On the procedural level, WWTPs seldom receives inspections from Ministry of Manpower and
Employment, and this may negatively reflect on the degree of compliance with H&S standards of Law
12/2003. This is more magnified during construction phase, as the H&S culture among local contractors
is usually poor with little legal monitoring and enforcement. These issues are addressed in the PAP.

              3.2.10 Procedures for Grievances Redress

As explained above under section 3.2.1, the Hotline is one of the key formal grievance channels and the
one which is meant, by design, to be the single official channel. The HCWW is working to strengthen the
Hotline system including the call centers within the WSCs and is aiming, through this strengthening, to
enable this channel to be the single official uptake modality. However, in practice, most complaints23 are
still being communicated through other informal channels including verbally to laboratory staff,
maintenance service staff, security, commercial personnel or media. There is no strict documentation
and record for the complaints received through these informal channels.
Box 2 below briefly presents the procedures followed as part of Hotline system:


23
     Estimated by the WSCs to be around 65%
                                                                                                       86
Box 2: Summary of the Hotline procedures
    Through the Citizens’ Service and Hotline Department within the WSCs, complaints are received
        using various modalities. The Hotline (phone calls) is the main and most common modalities.
        The department also receives complaints through fax, in writing, emails and verbal.
    Grievances are grouped into drinking water and wastewater. The drinking water is sub-
        categorized to 24 categories of complaints. The wastewater is sub-categorized into 16 types of
        complaints, most importantly, overflow, main force break, stealing sewers cover, requesting a
        vacuum tank, query related to sanitation, asphalt cracks, complain from a driver, leakage, illegal
        connection to the network, pollution and unserved areas. Each sub-category takes an
        identification code. Normally, water quality complaints.
    Complaints then are being diverted for the relevant department (e.g. maintenance, sanitation,
        water networks billing… etc.) to be technically handled.
    There is specified time interval for handling each type of complaints. The Hotline team is
        internally aware of it (e.g. 4 hours for breakages, 24 hours for pollution, 2 days for commercial
        complaints… etc.). However, the teams indicated that due to lots of technical challenges, these
        intervals are not fully adhered to. Accordingly, they do not share this information with the
        complainers and they only promise to resolve the case as soon as possible.
    All calls are being recorded for quality control
    For the tracking purpose, the complaints that are received through the phone calls, the
        complaints tracking number is the phone number and/or the complainer ID. For complaints that
        are received via other modalities, a tracking number for the complaint is shared with the
        complainer.
    Complainers are called back by the Citizens’ Service and Hotline Department to ensure the
        complaint is resolved. Sample of the complainers are called back by the Awareness Raising and
        Customers’ Service Department of the HCWW.
    Monitoring is done by the HCWW General Department of Public Awareness and Customers’
        Service as indicted above.

4 Program Environmental and Social Benefits, Risks and Impacts

This section presents the assessment of environmental and social benefits, risks and impacts of the
Program. An assessment of the Program interventions has been carried out to exclude any Category “A”
type interventions (according to the requirements of OP 9.00), a screening of the Program risks against
the core principals of OP 9.00 is presented, and an identification of different environmental and social
effects has been provided.

4.1 Screening of Category “A” - Type Interventions

The Program interventions include construction of sewerage networks for connecting unserved villages,
PSs, force mains and few new wastewater treatment plants. The Program boundaries, as described
earlier in Chapter 2, are limited to networks and relatively small scale WWTPs.

According to OP. 4.01 a proposed project is classified as Category A if it is likely to have “significant
adverse environmental impacts that are sensitive, diverse, or unprecedented. These impacts may affect
an area broader than the sites or facilities subject to physical works”. This definition is believed to be
inapplicable to Program interventions due to the following reasons:

Significance of impacts:

The magnitude/consequence of impacts is proportional to the scale of the project and type of impacts.
The impacts of sewerage networks and pump stations are usually small scale and site specific. Most of
these impacts are only temporary during the construction phase and could be prevented through
mitigation measures that are usually locally available. Although the Egyptian EIA Guidelines classify
sewerage works among the projects with the highest significance, as indicated earlier in Chapter 3, the
common practice of WBG projects is that construction of sewerage networks are not classified among
the highly significant projects considering their limited type of impacts. This is illustrated in Table 10
showing examples of operating WBG sanitation projects, where all projects that only involve sewerage
networks are classified as “B” indicating relatively low significance of impacts.

For WWTPs, the significance of their impacts is usually proportional to their size. Large WWTPs are
usually associated with impacts that largely exceeds their footprint. For example if one of the large
WWTPs faced operational problem that required bypassing the influent for a certain period, large
stretch in the downstream direction of the receiving water will be affected, while in small WWTPs
usually the affected stretch is rather short and the oxygen rebuilds in the watercourse within this
stretch. Similarly if an operation problem occurred in a large WWTP and odor was generated, the
affected area will be much larger compared to a small WWTP.



                                                                                                       88
Within the context in Egypt, the capacity of the WWTPs under the Program is relatively small. The
largest WWTP within the Program boundaries is 30,000 m3/day as further illustrated in Annexes 1 and
2. If compared to other large WWTPs in the country (such as El Gabal El Asfar more than 2 Mm3/day,
Abo Rawash 400,000 m3/d, Zenien 330,000 m3/d, Alexandria West 550,000 m3/d, Alexandria East
690,000 m3/d … etc.) the scale of WWTPs under the Program is explicitly small. Figure 5 below
illustrates this comparison.

Figure 5: Comparison between large and small WWTPs in Egypt




Large WWTP in Cairo – 2 Mm3/d                             Typical WWTP in the Program area (less than
                                                          30,000 m3/d)

Table 10 below shows that, according to the procedures of the WBG, some projects involving
construction/extension of WWTPs are considered as Category B, and some others are considered as
Category A. The latter projects involve relatively large WWTPs (145,000 and 480,000 m3/d capacity),
relatively large sludge digestion facility (150 t/d) or rehabilitation of a 30 ha lake. Other projects
presented in the Table below involves construction of new WWTPs with capacities reaching 30,000
m3/d and 37,000 PE were classified, in terms of size and significance of impacts, as Category B.

It is worth noting that there are a number of WWTPs, such as Gharb El Mansoura WWTP currently under
construction with capacity 135,000 m3/d (later the design modified to be 185,000 m3/d), is part of the
NRSP but is not part of the PforR. There will be measures in the PAP to ensure that DLI1 and DLI2 are
not measured against connections to this WWTP so that the boundaries of the PforR are clearly verified
during implementation.

Sensitivity of impacts:

An impact is defined sensitive, according to OP 4.01, if it may be irreversible (e.g., lead to loss of a major
natural habitat) or raise issues covered by OD 4.20, Indigenous Peoples; OP 4.04, Natural Habitats; OP
4.11, Safeguarding Cultural Property in Bank-Financed Projects or OP 4.12, Involuntary Resettlement.
None of the expected impacts are considered irreversible, even though in the unlikely event that
quantities of noncompliant effluent were discharged to a drain the impact would still be reversible and
the drain will self-purify the organic load after the returning the effluent back to compliance.

None of the Program interventions are located in a natural habitat site, cause impacts to indigenous
people or located near a known culturally valuable site24 that would make impacts on any project
classified as “sensitive”.

The project will entail land acquisition for constructing the pumping stations and the WWTP. The
examination of the current practices and procedures related to land acquisition revealed some gaps in
consultation with land owners and users, the methods of information sharing, the monitoring and
documentation practices and the approach of handling complaints related to land. If not handled
carefully, land acquisition might result in serious impacts on individuals of land owners and land users.
The PAP will include establishing a “diligent and inclusive system for land acquisition”. The application of
this system will ensure that affected individuals are meaningfully consulted and that the international
policies and best practices are followed in acquiring land.

Diversity of impacts:

The impacts of sanitation projects, without additional components, are mainly on water quality in
receiving bodies. Other impacts to air quality, noise, flora and fauna, health and safety, land and other
environmental and social receptors are relatively minor. Therefore, the impacts could be regarded as
non-diverse if the project is not associated with other activities.

Precedence of Impacts:



24
  Although Sharkia Governorate is rich of antiquity sites, and that locations of new WWTPs are not yet defined,
Law 117/1983 stipulates that any antiquity site should have a sufficient buffer zone surrounding it and no
development could take place at this zone. The Antiquity Authority is sufficiently empowered to implement the
Law as indicated in Chapter 3
                                                                                                                  91
There are plenty of sanitation projects operating and under construction in the Program area, therefore
none of the Program interventions would cause unprecedented impacts.

Impacts area of influence:

Usually the area of influence of small scale WWTPs are only limited to the footprint of the project. The
area of influence could slightly cross the borders of the WWTP fence if some operational problems
caused, such as:

    -   generation of odors affecting neighboring sites
    -   non-compliant effluent was discharged causing organic load in the receiving drain reducing
        dissolved oxygen for a limited distance downstream
    -   Accidental leakage of hazardous substances (such as chlorine or diesel) affecting limited
        neighboring areas

All the above are risks that, if materialized, will only cause temporary effect that could be mitigated and
reversed after overcoming the subject operational problem.

According to the above assessment, the Program interventions are not considered as Category A-type
projects, and accordingly the PforR instrument could be applied.

4.2 Risks Screening against OP.9.00 Core Principals

A preliminary risk assessment has been carried out using the Environmental and Social Risk Screening
Format included in OP 9.0, the assessment is highlighted in the table below.

                        There are some environmental risks and impacts, the main ones
                        are:                                                                Number of potential negative impacts were

                        - Change of landuse at the footprints of PSs and WWTPs              related to land acquisition and the implications on

                    The risks of environmental effects are generally medium risks,
                    except for the sludge handling risk which could be rated as
                    substantial, taking the existing situation into consideration.
                    According to the system assessment and gap identification a
                    PAP has been proposed to mitigate the above risks and
                    minimize them.

                    Surface watercourses at the Program area suffer from high
                    pollution pressures, accordingly the program will positively

                 (for HS issues). The HCWW Environmental Department is                    However, the current mandates of the WSCs are
                 providing support to the WSCs, and the newly established PMU             largely focusing on operation and maintenance.
                 will also provide support to the PMU especially in the                   WSCs have limitations in capacity when it comes to
                 preparation of ESIAs. All these bodies are within the MoHUUC             issues related to land acquisition, consultation,
                 and the system used to operate without complexity, and adding            grievance handling… etc.
                 the PMU is not expected to add a complexity layer, but rather a
                 technical support through the environmental expert of the PMU.

                 The institutional capacity of the WSCs is limited with regards to
                 preparing ESIAs as it was usually prepared through NOPWASD
                 (and the HCWW for ISSIP governorates). There are also some
                 capacity limitations in available staff and equipment to monitor
                 environmental performance of operation as indicated earlier in
                 Chapter 3. The PAP includes measures to strengthen the
                 capacity of the WSCs to bridge the gaps in the current system
                 through support of PMU, HCWW, PMCF and ISC.

                 The institutional risk, given the existing conditions, is substantial,
                 but the PAP measures, detailed in Chapter 6, are designed to
                 minimize those risks

Reputational and          There are no governance or corruption risks associated with the
Political Risks Context   environmental aspects of the Program. The rural sanitation is
                          known to be a priority, and there is no known environmental
                          controversy about the government program and setting its initial
                          stage in the 3 governorates.

                          The only political environmental risk is the possibility of
                          modifying the effluent standards and make it more stringent,
                          which might require review of the WWTPs under the Program
                          and improve them to comply with more stringent legal
                          requirements. The risk is considered medium, and the PAP
                          includes measures to establish strong contacts with other
                          ministries and regulatory authorities to have good preparation
                          prior to any proposed legal requirements.

4.3 Environmental Benefits, Risks and Impacts

            4.3.1   Environmental Benefits

The Program will result in many environmental benefits, as the sanitation sector by-definition help in
keeping healthy environment and improved living conditions. The government program is mainly meant
to help in improving freshwater quality in two of the important watercourses in the Delta region, Rashid
Branch and El Salam Canal, through alleviating one of the important environmental pressures on those
water courses which is uncontrolled disposal of sewage. The program will provide sanitation services to
about 900,000 capita in the three governorates. Wastewater generated by the Program beneficiaries is
either collected in cesspits that leach to the ground with frequent collection by tankers that discharge to
nearby canals and drains, collected by gravity networks that ends to pump stations that negatively
discharge25 to drains, or collected in private networks that also discharge to watercourses. More details
about un-served villages in the Program areas are given in Annex 3.
The main environmental benefits of the Program include:

     -   Providing adequate wastewater treatment to about 90,000 m3/day26 of wastewater that used
         to be uncontrollably discharged in freshwater canals, drains, lakes and open lands. This
         treatment is expected to remove 53 tons/day of BOD used to be discharged to the
         environment27.
     -   Prevent the inappropriate process of “negative discharge” of untreated sewage directly from
         PSs to drains. The program is expected to connect villages which are currently negatively
         discharging directly to drains. Also the Program will help in solving the compliance issues with
         the effluent standards and the subsequent bypass of untreated sewage in overloaded WWTPs.
     -   Improving health conditions for the Program beneficiaries. The poor sanitation in these villages
         usually lead to many health risks such as waterborne diseases and vector transmitted diseases.
     -   Help in preventing the rising groundwater table caused by leaching of sewage from impervious
         cesspits. The rising water table leads to many problems in the rural environment such as
         affecting efficiency of agriculture drainage and soil fertility, affecting stability of shallow
         foundation buildings and causing unhealthy ponds of stagnant water in depressions and low
         elevation lands.
     -   The Program includes a component for septage management, which is a result indicator that is
         not a DLI, which will extend the environmental benefits to small remote hamlets that are
         unfeasible to be connected to WWTPs. In addition to the direct benefits of preventing

   Negative discharge refers to collection of sewage in a pump station that is not connected to a WWTP and
discharge directly to drains. The negative discharge is reported to be mainly in Dakahlia Governorate.

   Assuming wastewater generation of 100 l/c/d as per the Egyptian Engineering Code for wastewater treatment
27
   Assuming BOD generation of 65 g/c/d (according to the Egyptian Code) and treatment efficiency of 91% to
comply with Law 48/1982 standards
                                                                                                               98
       appreciable quantities of septage from being inadequately discharged to the environment, this
       system could serve as demonstration for large similar areas in the country.
   -   The PAP, described later in this ESSA, includes measures to improve the existing system in terms
       of sludge handling, handling of solid wastes, handling of hazardous substances, improving
       safety, monitoring and documentation. This improvements could also serve as demonstrations
       to be followed by other WSCs.

          4.3.2   Environmental Risks

The following environmental risks have been identified:

   -   Risks on land resources receiving sludge and solid wastes separated at PSs and WWTPs screens
       and grit removal chambers. Currently there are no sludge analysis being carried out to check its
       suitability for use in agriculture, and also there are no current systems for adequate collection
       and disposal of solid waste. The PAP introduces measures to initiate the effective compliance
       with sludge handling standards, and the requirements for adequate solid waste management.
       Any leakage risks in violation of the PAP would be minimum if adequate monitoring and
       followed up system is in place.
   -   Risks of poor operation of PSs and WWTPs leading to inadequate effluent quality. The overall
       impact on surface water quality is expected to be positive as the non-compliance incidents, if
       happened, are not expected to have more discharges than the estimated 53 tons BOD/day that
       are currently being discharged to the environment. However, there are some risks that some
       individual WWTPs could have operational problems that affects the final effluent quality
       standards and reducing the program benefits in correspondent areas. The main factors for
       possible non-compliance are:
            o Overloading WWTPs above their design capacities and leading to either non-compliance
                or to bypassing excess influent to avoid non-compliance
            o Shock loads resulting from strong organic wastewater from animal slurries and septage
                received from remote areas
            o Inappropriate operation by WWTP staff due to lack of maintenance or lack of trained
                personnel

       The above issues have been taken into account in the PAP design.

   -   Hygiene and occupational health risks. Although the PAP includes measures to significantly
       improve the H&S performance in existing facilities and in construction sites, there are still risks
       of resistance to change among workers in construction and operation of difference facilities. The
       institutional strengthening and monitoring measures under the PAP are designed to minimize
       such risks.


                                                                                                       99
    -   Risks on physical culture resources, especially in Sharkia Governorate that is rich of such sites,
        during the construction phase. As indicated earlier, the existing supervision system is effective
        which makes this risk quite minimal. The monitoring and follow up measures of the PAP will
        further reduce such risks.
    -   Risks on the stability of shallow foundation structures during the construction of sewers lines
        and PSs. The main risk would arise from dewatering operations that could cause differential
        settlements for those foundations. Also the dewatering operations could lead to inundating
        lands receiving the dewatering discharges. The designs and construction supervision of the ISC
        should make sure that such issues are adequately handled as indicated in the PAP.
    -   Risks of sewers blocking or leaking during operation. Such risks would be minimized if the
        design, construction and operation of such sewers are according to the engineering standards
        which would be enhanced through the support of the ISCs as indicated in the program design
        and emphasized in the PAP. The risk would be higher in case of connecting private networks that
        are usually not designed and constructed according to the engineering standards. Because the
        environmental risk of leaving these networks continue to discharge untreated sewage to drains
        is much higher than the correspondent risks of connecting them and suffer from blockages
        during operation (which will happen anyway) it is recommended in the PAP that the Program
        should consider connecting those private networks and carrying out, in case they are connected,
        technical assessment of their status by the ISC and identify measures to improve these networks
        and bring them to compliance with engineering standards.

Generally, the above risks are not significant, site specific and could be mitigated and reversed. Again
the PAP discussed later in this ESSA includes measures to mitigate these risks during the Program
implementation.

           4.3.3   Environmental Impacts

The following are the main environmental impacts of the Program:
    - Temporary impacts during construction including noise, emissions from machinery exhaust, dust
        generation during earthworks, access difficulties in villages’ streets and handling/disposal of
        construction waste. Besides being temporary and minor impacts, usually the benefits expected
        by beneficiaries make them highly tolerant with such temporary impacts. The PAP includes
        requirements for the ISC to ensure that the contractors are complying with the requirements of
        the site-specific ESIAs developed for each cluster.
    - Changing landuse over the footprint of the Program interventions. Most of the available lands in
        the Program areas are agriculture lands, putting PSs and WWTPs will affect the fertility of those
        lands and will reduce the green cover and its benefits of carbon uptake. The benefits of the
        Program are believed to overweigh the loss of this area, however, the PAP includes
        requirements for PS and WWTP designers to minimize landuse as feasibility could be attained.


                                                                                                      100
     -   Impacts on disposal sites receiving wastes generated from the project facilities, such as
         screenings wastes, grit, other garbage generated during the construction and operation of these
         facilities. The impacts are expected to be minor as the contribution of such waste volume to the
         domestic solid wastes received at these sites is relatively low. The absence of engineered
         landfills in the Program areas is an environmental issue nationwide and the environmental
         problems at the existing disposal sites cannot be related to the Program interventions. The
         disposal of solid wastes at uncontrolled disposal sites that are licensed by Local Authorities is
         believed to be the most suitable option for the Program facilities. Also discharging effluents to
         existing drains will add, even if the effluent is compliant, to the pollution loads received at these
         drains, but this loads could be regarded as negligible considering the current status of drains in
         the Program areas, which suffer from significant pollution loads as indicated earlier.

The above impacts are minor and the Program benefits highly overweigh them. The PAP includes
measures to mitigate such impacts.

4.4 Social Benefits, Risks and Impacts

            4.4.1    Social benefits

Brief overview on the current situation and its implications
As part of preparing the ESSA, and as explained above under section 1.5, number of consultation
activities were conducted to give more insight on the rural sanitation issues including communities
benefits from being connected, the problems posed by the absence of appropriate sanitation system
and the anticipated risks and impacts of the project.

In very general terms, there was very large consensus among the various stakeholders on the pressing
need for the program and the large social, economic and health benefits anticipated from improving the
sanitation system. Particularly in delta region, the absence of appropriate rural sanitation systems
associated with the high underground water table are creating serious health and environment hazard
on individuals and properties.

Currently the large segments of unserved local communities28 are using number of survival strategies to
try to cope with the implications of absence of sewage system. Those strategies include, but are not
limited to, constructing community networks29, connecting illegally to dispose sewage to agriculture
drainage, raising the ground level of houses during construction, frequent emptying of septic tanks,


28
   83 % of the rural population of Dakahlya is unserved, 80% in Sharkia and 70 % in Behaira
29
   Community networks are illegally constructed as an alternative sanitation model. This type of networks does not
include any level of treatment and largely allows houses (specifically those adjacent to the drains) to get rid of
their sewage directly in the drain. This type of network is usually of very poor quality and low technical standards.
It generates a lot or problems to the communities including frequent blockages and overflow.
                                                                                                                 101
reducing the amount of water disposed of in the septic tank by using alternative methods for disposing
certain types of waste water (e.g. throwing the washing and domestic activities water in the street),
abandoning the ground floors in houses, and carrying out frequent maintenance and renovation
activities to remedy the spillages and cracks occurring on the walls of structures.

Community members were highly vocal in spelling out the negative implications that they are currently
encountering as a result of the poor sewage systems. The following are the main raised negative impacts
of the current situation:

        Financial load encountered by the household to cope with the problem. This mainly includes:
          The frequent need for emptying septic tanks: The amount that each household pays for
             emptying septic tanks largely depends on the size of the tank, the number of family
             members it serves and the level of the house in relation to the ground level. It was
             estimated that each household is paying an average of EGP 120: 150. 30 The amount paid
             also depends on the width of the street, distance of the house from the main street and the
             number of households that order the septic tank evacuation vehicle. 31
          The frequent and escalated need for repairs and maintenance for the structures: The
             unserved communities largely emphasized the negative impacts on the walls of their houses
             and the various social service institutions within the villages (e.g. schools, youth centers,
             health units). Repairs for the structures need to be done each year. It is estimated that each
             square meter of walls requires around EGP 30 – 40 to complete its repairs. This includes
             removing the external layers of the walls, drying the leakage through using chemicals and
             drying machines, and fixing new external layers to the walls. The floors of the ground level
             also need annual repairs.
          Costs associated to health problems: Communities associated certain diseases like diarrhea
             for children to the inappropriate sanitation system. It was challenging for mothers to specify
             exact incidents and cash spend in such health treatment. Communities in served areas also
             indicted that the incidence of certain pollution-related diseases still occur because there are
             other problems like the poor solid waste collection and disposal services.
          Reducing the value and life time of the various structures: reducing the value of land and
             structures was mentioned to be one key issue resulting from the lack of sanitation, high
             depreciation and safety threats on the structures.

        Health and physical risks due to the frequent overflow on the streets, malodorous and the
         leakages inside houses: Children and elderlies were mentioned to be more exposed to these
         risks.



30
   The average cost per load is EGP 25 – 30 and it was estimated that each septic tank needs to be emptied twice a
month and each time requires around 2 loads.
31
   Normally, the vacuuming vehicle serves between 20 to 30 households in one transfer load. If the vacuuming
vehicle is order by less number of households, the charge is usually higher than normal.
                                                                                                              102
                        “Layers of the leaked wall fell on my kids while they were asleep”
                                      A lady from Kafr El Noaman, Dakahlya

      Clashes among neighbors and escalated social tensions in the villages: The disposal of waste
       water on the street is perceived to be a key reason for accidents and clashes among neighbors
       particularly in winter.

                 “We used to fight every day with our neighbors before the sanitation project”
                                    A man from El Zankalon village, Sharkia

      Additional domestic load on women: Managing the amounts of water that is disposed into the
       septic tanks and working to rationalize these amounts using other mechanisms (e.g. disposal on
       streets) add large work load on women as part of their domestic activities.

      More serious implications on the poor households. Well-off houses are managing the
       mentioned costs with difficulty. The wider majority of poorer households in the villages are
       much more vulnerable to the associated costs as well as the safety and health hazards because
       they cannot afford to pay for the different mentioned items.

      Negative physiological and wellbeing implications resulting from the unhealthy and distressful
       living environment: The absence of sanitation is contributing to unhealthy less appealing
       environment inside the villages that is affecting the daily life of villagers on different fronts
       including psychologically.

          “In the village grave yard, we have a pump that sucks ground water and it is operating every
          day. Without that, we find water inside the burial slots. We had to build a second level to be
         alternatively used in burying. We know this is not right but what else can we do. ….. I asked my
                                    husband not to bury me here when I die…”

                                     A lady from Kafr El Noaman, Dakahlya

Potential Benefits of the Program

The implementation of the Program will help in elevating the negative impacts through providing the
sanitation service which is very highly demanded by the poor rural communities of the targeted
Governorates. There are number of benefits and positive returns that the Program is expected to help
local communities to attain. Most important benefits include:
    6. Economic saving on the household level: As explained above, significant budget on the
        household level is being dedicated to emptying tanks, repairing structures and covering cost of
        health care treatment. The economic benefits of increasing property value (land and structures)
        and the savings on the households’ expenditure are expected to far overweigh the households’
                                                                                                      103
           contributions to the project (e.g. contribution to land, the households connection fees and the
           surcharge on the water consumption).
     7.    Health and safety benefits: The Program will contribute to better environment and better living
           condition which will positively imply on the health of the family members particularly on the
           vulnerable groups like the children. Villages are suffering from unsafe and unhygienic conditions
           as a result of the absence of sanitary sewage disposal system As explained above, the safety of
           houses and structures is threatened so is the safety of individuals. Improving the sanitation
           system will eliminate this risk. Improved rural sanitation will also reduce the current threat of
           pollution for drains and waterways that is being encountered as a result of lack of control over
           the discharge of human waste. Improving the quality of water in drains will have positive
           impacts on health, quality of water and quality of crops32.
     8.    Creating an enabling environment for community development at village level: The improved
           conditions within the villages will boost the sense of wellbeing of the villagers and will
           contribute to minimizing the cases of outmigration and stimulate other development activities
           in the village.
     9.    Enhanced level of public hygiene awareness: To attain reduction in health risk as a result of
           project, hygiene and awareness campaigns are essential to bring about the desired change in
           practices and to attain the positive impacts. The implementation of such campaigns will result in
           improving the level of local communities’ knowledge and awareness related to the public
           hygiene, water and wastewater related issues
     10.   Special return and benefits for women and children: Women are among the key community
           groups to gain substantial benefits from the project. Key benefits for women include time
           saving, reduced domestic work and improved and more hygienic management for the
           household activities. Children, specifically below 5 years, are more vulnerable and exposed to
           the health of implication of the unsanitary conditions of the villages. They are more likely to
           suffer from diarrhea, skin diseases, eyes diseases and other water relation. This category will
           benefit from less exposure to these health risks.

   The various consultations conducted as part of the ESSA indicted that the quality of water in the agriculture
drains is drastically deteriorating as a result of the random discharge of various pollutants including human waste.
With seasonal water shortage in canals, and in order for farmers to rescue their crops, they are sometimes obliged
to irrigate using water from the drains.
                                                                                                                104
            4.4.2    Social Risks

The project will entail land acquisition for constructing the pumping stations and the WWTP. If not
handled carefully, land acquisition might result in serious impacts on individuals of land owners and land
users. At this stage, since the technical design of the program is premature, it is difficult to know the
exact amount of land that will be needed and consequently, it is also difficult to estimate the number of
land owners and land users who would be affected from the land transaction process. It is usually the
case that an average of around 16000 m2 is needed for establishing a WWTP and 450 m2 is needed for
the pumping stations33. For the extension of existing WWTP, the amount of land needed will be
determined on case by case basis. Some extensions will not require land and will only entail adding
equipment. The severity of the impact of land taking depends on the percentage amount of the land to
be taken compared to the total amount of land that the farmers own/use, whether the main source of
income of the affected person is land-based and if the affected person will be able (through
compensation and the other types of support that could be provided) to restore his income to the level
before the Program. Land shares and land holdings in Egypt are generally characterized by unequal
distributions. Share of less than 5 feddans represents 88% of the number of land holdings in Egypt and
40% of the total owned agriculture area in Egypt. Shares of more than 50 feddans do not exceed 1.5% of
the total number of land holdings and two fifths of the total owned agriculture area in Egypt34. It should
be noted that land holdings are generally fragmented and this is the case in the Delta. The case will be
likely that each of the privately owned land for a pumping station will be owned by one farmer, while
the privately owned land for WWTP could be owned by one farmer or more. Apart from the land
owners, tenants might be using the land through different types of contractual arrangements with the
owners35. Case by case analysis will need to be carried out by the WSCs before the Program
implementation as will be elaborated on more details below.

        Land related risks

Limited capacities of the WSCs to manage land issues: The WSCs do not have sufficient experience and
capacity to manage land acquisition and the associated social impacts. Land acquisition, as explained
above, is not a core responsibility for the Properties Department which is currently handling the land
issues in the cases where the WSCs are charged with the land acquisition responsibility.

Potential delay in the time scheduled as a result of land acquisition: Securing land has proved to be a
key bottleneck for the majority of the infrastructure projects. Sanitations projects are not exception
from the challenge and risk of securing land. As indicted above, the process of land acquisition for the
treatment plants and the pumping stations goes through lengthy steps that usually take longer than

33
   These estimates are drawing upon the experience in previous projects

   According to the conducted consultations, the most dominant type of agriculture land lease contracts is for the
duration of one year renewable.
                                                                                                                105
expected. Project’s timely implementation could be jeopardized in the cases if securing the land takes
long time.

Lack of a consistent and transparent approach in managing land related issues: The process of land
acquisition through willing buyer willing seller or community contribution approaches entails some
practices that lack consistency and transparency. For instance, there is lack of meaningful consultation
with people affected when the land is acquired through mandatory procedures by following relevant
laws and regulations in Egypt. The process tended to be of unilateral nature and this weakens the sense
of credibility to the individuals who are affected by land acquisition. When land is acquired through
community contribution and despite the positive arrangement of the community led process for land
donation and the fact that it reflects real demand for the project, the process is not transparently
defined in the official contract for the land transaction. The individuals who are defined in the contract
as “donors” are actually “sellers”. The review of model contracts also showed some concerns on how
the conditions within the contracts are phrased.

The poor documentation of the donation process under the community contribution approach is
another risk on the project credibility. Even with the minimal role of the WSCs in the process because it
is community-led, the project credibility could be easily questioned if the appropriate measures are not
carefully taken to organize the donation process. There is also lack of clarity over the actual steps and
procedures that are taken to acquire land. This could be attributed to limitation in the information
sharing process.

Livelihoods risk related to lands: On the livelihoods dimension, there is also the risk that certain land
owners and users might get impoverished as a result of the land taking process. Apart from the official
owners of the land, there might be other groups that could be making a living out of the land both
legally (formal tenants) or illegally (informal tenants or squatters). These categories are sometimes
invisible in the land transaction process and their rights and the impacts on them are not counted for.
Although the common practice of the WCSs is to tackle such cases through contractual article that
imposes on all the responsibility on the official land seller, this practice is still risky and may result in
leaving serious social and economic implications on the individuals and families without legal titles.

Potential emerging disputes over the land that has been acquired before the start of the Program:

Based on experience of past practice, pending disputes might exist for the land already acquired. In the
cases where land acquisition was completed before the Program starts, some risks related to drawbacks
in land transaction may emerge (e.g. problems in the valuation of land, multiples owners, illegal users,
delay in paying payments, coercion….etc.).

Poor management to the temporary impacts related to land: Extending sanitation pipelines and
networks, setting construction camps are potential activities that likely result in temporary disturbance
to the use of land (e.g. occupying land temporarily) or damage to land-based assets (e.g. damaging

                                                                                                         106
crops). The common practice of the WSCs is to assign the responsibility of handling such impacts to the
contractors. In several cases, the poor quality of the contractors’ performance along with weak
supervision from the WSC side increase the potential risk of leaving affected persons from these impacts
without fair compensation.

       Risk of damages associated to the construction activities

The operations of digging machinery in narrow streets of villages may result in substantial risk to the
fragile houses and other structures. As the case for temporary impacts related to land, the process is
heavily delegated to contractors to handle. In the cases where the measures are not explicitly indicted
in the contract and in cases of weaknesses in the supervisory role over the contactor, the potential risk
from such cases may escalate.

       Non-land based livelihoods risks

Currently the septic tanks vacuuming service is largely operated by the informal and civil sectors within
the villages. This includes individuals working as freelance operators and/or CDAs that offer the service.
It is expected that after the operation of the project, the need for the vacuuming service will become
obsolete. The livelihoods of the current operators might be negatively affected as a result of decreased
demand on the service. The previous experience with other villages that get connected suggests that
those individuals did not encounter drastic negative impacts because the vacuum vehicles were being
upgraded to be used for other purposes (e.g. for agriculture purposes).

       Weak sense of demand for and/ acceptance and readiness for projects in certain communities

As clearly indicted in the assessment above, having a hygienic sanitation system in the rural areas of the
targeted Governorates seemed to be a high demand and a pressing priority for the villagers. Despite the
fact that this is usually the case in most of the rural areas in the Delta Region, the previous experience
showed that this should not be treated as a uniform generalized assumption over all the villages. The
sense of demand for the improved system is largely dependent on how the villagers are currently
managing the current status, what cost and other troubles does it entail for them. In certain cases,
villagers are not sensing the severity of the problem because the price and problems encountered are
limited. For instance, in the cases where the community networks are functioning well, villagers do not
care too much about the pollution of the drains, specifically because they are not fined for polluting the
drain. In such case, the immediate demand on the project and accordingly the sense of ownership might
be weak for the following reasons:

    1. The limited current expenditure of households is encountering to run their informal system,
    2. The limited level of awareness about the health and environmental implications of discharging
       in the drains and absence of linkages between the pollution and the negative health impacts on
       the households’ level,

                                                                                                      107
    3. Lack of law enforcement in fining violating households,
    4. Potential high startup (including land cost in case of community donation and the cost of
       households connection) and/or operation cost (specifically in case of decentralized model) to
       convert to a legal proper sanitation system under the project.

In the meantime, the nature of the communities including their size and remoteness from the sanitation
facilitates (e.g. the WWTP) are technically determining factors for which technology could be applied. In
certain cases, small and unconventional decentralized schemes are the only feasible option to connect
some remote communities. The scope of the communities’ contributions and their role in the projects’
management is determined based on the selected technology. In certain decentralized schemes, the
role of the local communities and the local CDAs goes far beyond the convention model of being
“service recipient” to more of operators to the service. The cost of operation and maintenance in the
decentralized schemes is higher than the standard cost paid by customers for the conventional
networks. In such cases, the role of early consultations and engagement with the communities is of
critical importance to ensure that the proposed technology will work. There is a big risk that certain
technologies might not be accepted by communities for multiple reasons. Local communities need to be
aware of the details related to the rationale of selecting the technologies, the cost that they will bear,
the benefits of the project compared to the current situation and their role in operating the system.
Communities should have a say in the design and operation model of these schemes to avoid the risk of
weak acceptance and low participation.

Moreover, for the communities that would be served through decentralized schemes, certain level of
capacity is always needed to ensure the success and sustainability of these schemes. This capacity
includes the existence of CDAs/NGOs with the technical and financial capabilities to operate and
maintain the project as well as clarity in the specific roles and responsibilities of each local stakeholder,
including communities (i.e., their obligation to pay, O&M, etc.). This kind of prerequisite is not available
for every community. The risk of limited capacities to manage decentralized schemes may pose serious
threat to the success and sustainability of these schemes.

Handling the project through a “one model fits all approach” may pose a real risk because the nature of
the communities to be served, their current story without a sanitation system, their economic level,
their demand and affordability are all changing factors from one community to the other. Top-down
approach in planning and the lack of engagement with the villagers may lead to a weakened sense of
ownership to the projects. One key lesson learned from pervious rural sanitation projects is that the
absence of sense of buy-in and ownership normally results in serious challenges in implementation.

       Risk of social tensions as a result of exclusion of certain villages

For multiple technical and financial reasons, certain villages might be left behind without benefiting
from the project. The risk emerges if the excluded villages are located nearby other villages that will be
receiving the service. Leaving villages behind may create a sense of alienation, marginalization and
                                                                                                         108
discrimination against the local residents of these villages. The previous experience demonstrated the
risk of leaving communities behind and the how his risk might escalate to create social unrest and to
affect the targeted villages (e.g. by preventing the contractors from work). Weak communication with
those unserved communities, including communicating the selection criteria, contributes to a deeper
sense of anger. The risk in such cases expanded to affect the time schedule of the contractors working
on the ground in other villages and resulted in drastic delay in the project delivery.

       Risk related to affordability of poor households

Affordability of poor households to the connection fee, land and maintenance cost is one key potential
challenge. In most of the villages, land for the pumping stations is acquired through community
donation mechanisms as explained above. In villages with supportive community leaders and CDAs, it is
largely the case that poor households’ contribution to the land is cross subsidized by the rest of better
off households. This is not a structured mechanism for contribution but rather a community initiated
arrangement within the frame of social solidarity. In certain villages, poor households are not supported
and they are not able to contribute to the project. The same inconsistency applies to the payment
arrangement for the households’ connection fees. The discussion with the WSCs revealed that some
WSCs do not have any mechanism for handling the cases of households that cannot afford the
households connection. Other WSCs cooperate with the CDAs and community leaders to get
information about the poor cases and support them through zero interest installment mechanism. In the
meantime, some WSCs are making the zero interest installment schemes available universally and they
collect the installment for the connection fees on the water bill to all the interested households. The
discrepancies between the level of attention given by various Governorates to the support of poor
households is a risk that may lead to inability of poor households in certain areas to access the service.

It is worth here noting that the HCWW has previously imitated a pro poor mechanism to handle the
same challenge of weak affordability to the connection fees for the water connection. An internal
memorandum was issued by the HCWW and was sent to all WSC stipulating the reduced cost of
installing the connection. The application of the system of the reduced fees included involvement from
the CDAs who provide information on poor households through social surveys.

Another relevant initiative is the revolving loan program that UNICEF is carrying out in cooperating with
WSCs in Upper Egypt to connect water to the poor households. As part of the initiative, a unit is being
established inside the WSC to handle the revolving fund.

The HCWW and the WSCs strongly believe the pro poor mechanism to be established for the Program
should benefit and build on the existing initiatives.

       Potential escalation for unresolved community concerns/complaints

In all the previously identified risks, one key threat that crosscuts in various issues is the absence of
appropriate consultation system and local level grievance to handle any potential emerging impact or
                                                                                                      109
risk that may emerge on the ground (e.g. damage to houses, complaints related to land issues) before
they escalate. This is specifically true during the design and constructions phases. The current existing
mechanisms for handling grievances and complaints, as elaborated under section 3.2.1 and 3.2.10 tend
to be more oriented to the operational aspects of the running systems rather than the aspects related to
planning, design and constructions of new projects.

           4.4.3   Social impacts

Potential impacts during construction

The construction phase is expected to generate number of local job opportunities to the villagers who
could be engaged with the contractors in various activities associated to the construction phase. This is
specifically applicable to the low skills jobs related to construction. In the meantime, number of negative
impacts might result from the construction phase of the project. This most importantly include:

       Temporary impacts on land including the temporary use of land for construction camps and
        materials’ storage and the potential associated damage such as crops damage during pipelines
        expansion and. As explained earlier in this section, the exact magnitude of this impact and the
        number of potentially affected individuals is difficult to be determined at this stage.
       Permanent land acquisition and potential implication on livelihoods to number of rural
        individuals and families. As explained earlier in this section, the exact magnitude of this impact
        and the number of potentially affected individuals is difficult to be determined at this stage.
       Inconvenience to the local communities and potential implication on the local activities within
        the villages, including distracting local business
       Health and safety risks on workers and local residents within the project site
       Potential damage for fragile structures during construction works

Potential impacts during operation

As elaborated under section 4.2.1 above, numerous benefits and positive impacts are anticipated from
the operation of rural sanitation projects. Returns entail benefits on health, economics of the
households, enhanced level of awareness and special benefits to women and children.

In the meantime, number of social risks were identified above under section 4.2.2. A sound and inclusive
design to the project, an accountable system to engage and consult with local communities and a
diligent system for handling land related issues are key guarantee for successful project implementation.
Those risks should be handled carefully through the actions and indictors as part of the Project Action
Plan (PAP).

5 Program Capacity and Performance Assessment and Gap
  Identification

5.1       Performance of WSCs with regard to legal and regulatory framework

              5.1.1   Performance of WSCs with regard to the legal and regulatory framework
                      on environmental aspects

The environmental laws and standards are believed to sufficiently address the environmental risks and
impacts of the sanitation sector in Egypt and they meet international standards and the WBG EHS
Guidelines with few gaps as indicated earlier in Chapter 3. The main gaps could be summarized as
follows:
     - There are no clear guidelines that controls the management of septage. Although there is legal
         prohibition for the discharge to watercourses, the difficulty to enforce such prohibition and the
         absence of practically available other options make this legal requirement ineffective. The
         Program design includes a result indicator for Septage management that should provide
         incentives for septage tankers to evacuate the septage at the sewerage system, and also should
         allow for more effective inspection on illegal discharges to watercourses.
     - Similar to the above issue, although there is legal prohibition to establish private sewers that
         discharge to watercourses, no enforcement mechanisms or alternative solutions to those
         networks. Those networks achieve important benefit for the villages where they serve, however,
         the legal framework and technical guidelines do not allow for a sound solution for those
         networks. The Program design would allow for connecting those networks with due diligence
         assessment of their conditions, through the ISC, and take feasible measures to improve their
         condition.
     - There are no explicit standards for land contamination. Also no explicit requirements for
         ensuring secondary containment of hazardous substance storage tanks that covers 110% of the
         storage capacity, and for taking adequate measures during filling the tanks. This gap would be
         bridged through including such requirements in the ToRs of site-specific ESIAs which would be
         prepared/supervised by the WSCs.

In terms of implementation of and compliance with the laws/standards, there are some weaknesses and
gaps in the system including:

      -    The strict punishment of non-compliant WWTPs operators sometimes gives opposite results, as
           they tend to bypass portion of the received influent for meeting the effluent standards.
      -    The “negative discharge” by PSs, although done as a last resort in absence of sufficient finance,
           there should be assessment to the advantages and disadvantages for starting the connections
           without having enough resources to discharge the collected wastewater in a WWTP

                                                                                                         111
   -   Most of WWTPs do not keep a documented environmental register that is being frequently
       updated according to the requirements of Law 4/1994.
   -   Most of WWTPs do not handle sludge, solid waste removed by screens, or removed grit
       according to the law requirements. This need to be improved as indicated later in the PAP
   -   The Safety procedures need to be improved and integrated within the procedures for design,
       construction and operations of networks and WWTPs.

The above gaps have been considered in the design of the PAP to ensure consistency with the core
principals of the PforR operational policy OP 9.00.

          5.1.2   Performance of WSCs with regard to the legal and regulatory framework
                  on land acquisition

The analysis of the current procedures and regulatory framework related to land revealed the existing
laws and regulation have a number of positive sides in dealing with land acquisition. This most
importantly include provisions related to compensation, sharing information with the affected persons,
rights of affected persons to appeal and provisions related to the temporary damage and associated
compensation.

In reviewing the legal and regulatory framework against the international best practices, a number of
gaps were identified, most importantly:

      Consultation with affected individuals: The legal and regulatory framework applied does not
       stipulate clear provisions for the consultation with project affected persons and does not
       indicate any rights for the affected persons in selecting appropriate, technically and
       economically feasible resettlement alternatives and compensation alternatives. There is also no
       stipulation about the inclusivity of the consultation process (gender, disabled, youth…etc)
      Identification of entitled categories: In terms of entitled persons and the entitlements, some
       groups of those who could potentially be affected are not explicitly indicted. Those groups of
       squatters, formal and informal tenants are among the groups that could encounter some
       serious social and economic implications as a result of the land acquisition process without
       having legal entitlement to compensation. In the meantime, the Egyptian legal framework for
       handling land acquisition does not stipulate any special attention, consideration or special
       measure to be taken towards the vulnerable groups (e.g. individuals below poverty line,
       landless, femakle headed households, elderlies, handicapped…etc).
      Absence of proactive local level mechanism for handling grievance: As stipulated in the
       relevant laws, project affected persons have the right to object and appeal. However, the stated
       options for handling grievance are through the court. There is no mention for local modality to
       proactively handle complaints to minimize the cases that escalate to the court.



                                                                                                   112
         Land Valuation Process: The relevant law to land acquisition stipulates the market price and the
          committees to be formed for the valuation process. However, the valuation process of land
          might entail some inconsistency because of absence of strong formal land market in Egypt.
         Replacement Cost: The legal framework does not indicate that the valuation of land and
          affected assets should consider the replacement cost

             5.1.3   Performance of WSCs with regard to the legal and regulatory framework
                     on community engagement

The Public Relations and Awareness Department in each of the WSC is operating against an annual work
plan that they develop under the supervision and guidance of the General Department of Public
Awareness and Customers’ Service in the HCWW. The work plan is meant to include all the activities
that the department will be doing during the year to tackle specifically the awareness raising part of
their responsibilities. The annual plan that is discussed among the teams of the same department in all
the WSCs and the HCWW. The plan is approved by the HCWW chairman before the WSC takes the
responsibility of implementing it. The work plans of various WSCs are almost uniform. Boxes 5.1 and 5.2

The reviewed work plans showed that number of key sub-activities have strong linkage to the sanitation
projects, most importantly:

     Raising the awareness (with special learning and experience sharing activities directed to schools)
     Providing septic tank vacuuming service to the households
     Contribution to the removal of the illegal (stolen) connections
     Carrying out community surveys for monitoring the water and sanitation service
     Cooperate with CDAs/NGOs in serving communities with untraditional sanitation service
     Cooperate with wide range of governmental offices (e.g. irrigation authority, health, education,
      agriculture…etc) and CSOs (e.g. women representatives,
     Carry out surveys related the Customers Service center and follow up on the complaints from the
      hotline
     Prepare awareness material
     Carry out cross learning among the WSCs


The annual work plans are being revisited and discussed with the General Department of Public
Awareness and Customers’ Service at the HCWW on a semiannual meeting. Some modifications may
take place and get clearance from the HCWW as per the actual need.




36
  Illegal connections (stolen connections) entail the informal water and wastewater connections that some
community members install to the governmental network. Through these connections, the installed household get
the service without being officially charged.
                                                                                                         114
Monitoring system for annual work plan

According to the discussion with the HCWW General Department of Public Awareness and Customers’
Service, the performance of Public Relations and Awareness Department is assessed based on the
successful completion of the annual work plans. This is evaluated based on the following performance
criteria. These criteria involve the following:

        The ratio of completed activities against the planned
        Regularity in sending monthly reports to the HCWW
        The geographic range and spread of the activities
        Number of participants from the public service members against the number of water
         subscribers
        Ration of completed community survey questionnaires against the number of water subscribers
        Ration of completed company staff survey questionnaires against the targeted number
        The feedback of the focal point form the targeted entities (e.g. youth centers, CDAs…etc)37

The analysis if the work plans, the monitoring process along with the consultations with the WSCs
revealed a number of gaps in both the procedures as well as the institutional arrangements. This will be
analyzed in more details under section 5.2.3 below.

            5.1.4    Performance of WSCs with regard to the legal and regulatory framework
                     on grievance mechanism:

As elaborated in details above under section 3.2.9, the official grievance handling mechanisms are
mainly the Hotline for the various types of complaints related to the operation and maintenance for the
water and wastewater projects and the Customer Service Centers for the issues related to billing and
subscriptions.

37
   This criterion has been recently introduced as one of the verification monitoring tool. The WSC is now being
asked to collect the contacts information of focal points for each of the awareness activities. As part of measuring
the performance, the HCWW is using a verification method to ensure that the activities were successfully and
efficiently completed. HCWW connect to the sessions’ beneficiaries and external focal points (e.g. CDAs) to assess
the quality of the completion of the activities.

                                                                                                               115
With regard to the up and running mechanisms, more specifically the Hotline, the following are the main
identified gaps:

          Because the system is not fully automated and technology is not being utilized to the maximum,
           there are still deficiencies in the mode of operation in the Hotline with around 50% of the calls
           made in 2014 receiving a busy line signal.
          Despite the very large popularity of the Hotline service across the country, the informal channels
           including the direct complaints to technicians are still more largely used than the Hotline. This
           could be attributed to the following reasons: 1) some cultural and perceptional issues that
           makes customers believe that the face to face communication might be more efficient than the
           call, 2) the lack of efficiency of the hotline due to operational challenges (e.g. busy line,
           unanswered calls..etc) as mentioned above, 3) The face to face complaints, particularly those
           which are communicated to the maintenance teams are quicker responded to.
          The weakness in the system functionality is leading to problem in the monitoring system. The
           monitoring is done only on selected cases because the HCWW does not have full access to all
           the calls due to database shortfalls.
          Time interval for resolving the complaints is not clearly communicated with the complainers. By
           design, the system has specific time duration to resolve each type of the problems/complaints.
           However, this duration of time is usually exceeded and it is never clearly communicated with the
           complainers.
          A key shortfall related to the existing mechanism is the dominant orientation to the operation
           and maintenance. Grievance related to projects planning, design and construction are not
           handled through the existing mechanism (e.g. issue related to potential construction impacts
           like damage on land or houses and issue related to land acquisition).

5.2       Adequacy of institutional arrangements and capacity

              5.2.1   Adequacy of institutional arrangements and capacity on environmental
                      aspects

The environmental planning for the rural sanitation sector, including preparing ESIAs, is mainly the
responsibility of NOPWASD as it is mandated for the capital investments. Therefore, the capacity within
the WSCs for carrying out or administering the preparation of ESIAs by consultants is limited. In the
governorates where ISSIP and ISSIP2 are implemented, the preparation of ESIAs was leaded by the
HCWW and the environmental personnel in its Project Implementation Unit, and the involvement of the
WSCs was mainly during the implementation and follow-up of the ESMP measures.

On the operational side, the existing institutional arrangements at the WSCs level comprise within the
organizational structure the Sector of Quality Control, Labs and Environment ,mainly responsible for
effluent quality and labs) and the General Department for Occupational Health and Safety, which is
                                                                                                         116
responsible for H&S issues. None of the two departments have on their mandate environmental
management of sanitation facilities38. The institutional weaknesses of the existing system in WSCs could
be summarized as follows:

     -   There are no mandates or capacities at the WSCs level for preparing ESIAs, whether directly for
         small project or through administering recruitment of consultants for larger projects, and follow
         up their environmental requirements. This has been addressed in the Program design through
         having an environmental specialist at each of the Program Implementation Units at the WSCs
         level, supported by an Environmental Specialist at the PMU level and the already existing
         Environmental Specialists of the HCWW. The ISCs will also support the WSCs in implementing
         ESMP measures and ensure including them in construction and operation of the Program
         facilities.
     -   The Quality Sector focus on effluent quality and does not have sufficient equipment and trained
         personnel for collecting and analyzing samples of mature sludge. This is one of the main
         recommendations of the PAP, which includes providing sufficient investments and creating a
         new Department for Sludge Quality.
     -   The Occupational Health and Safety Department does not have mandate to review PS and
         WWTPs designs to ensure implementation of the H&S design measures. The Department also
         does not have sufficient manpower to follow-up H&S measures at all sanitary facilities within its
         domain. The above weaknesses are addressed through the PAP by including H&S review of the
         designs prepared by the ISC along with providing necessary modifications to existing WWTPs to
         improve its H&S condition. Also providing sufficient staff to frequently inspect H&S conditions at
         PSs and WWTPs is one of the PAP measures.
     -   The operation of WWTPs is not carried out according to standard procedures that take
         environmental aspects of the operation into consideration. The operation is carried out under
         the supervision of the Operation Sector, and currently the main focus, as mentioned earlier, is
         meeting the effluent standards. However, the handling of hazardous substances, handling of
         wastes, monitoring of bypass and documenting safety incidents are not included in the standard
         procedures. The PAP requires inclusion of such measures in a standard documented O&M
         manual for each WWTP.

It is worth noting that currently the HCWW has started with WSCs, with support from the German
International Cooperation GIZ, certification system for WWTPs according to the Technical Sustainable
Management (TSM) which is a Quality Management System that aims at the development of Water and
Wastewater to reach conformity to the Egyptian regulations, codes, laws and management
requirements in fields of human resources, occupational health and safety, operation, maintenance and
quality assurance. Improvement of WWTPs to comply with TSM would improve its general performance

38
   It is worth noting that environmental management of ISSIP and ISSIP2 was done through a special institutional
arrangement in the Project Implementation Unit and the Rural Sanitation Units in the WSCs, and not through the
existing structure of the WSCs
                                                                                                              117
against certain KPIs, and adding the environmental management dimension to this would be required
under the PAP as further indicated in Chapter 6.

           5.2.2   Adequacy of institutional arrangements and capacity on land acquisition

The analysis of the existing institutional arrangement and capacity for handling land acquisition issues
showed a number of shortfalls and gaps that need to be addressed to allow for an enhanced and
transparent system in dealing with land acquisition. The following are the main identified gaps:

      Land issues are being largely managed through a technical and legal orientation. The Properties
       Department which is currently mandated with the land issue is one of the legal offices within
       the WSC. The department which is interacting with the local communities and have mandates
       for handling social aspects does not have a role to play in the process of land acquisition
       (including consultations with affected individuals).
      There is substantial lack of capacity in dealing with the social impacts related to land
       acquisition. This includes, but is not limited to, lack of experience dealing with complaints
       related to land; do not have any knowledge of the potential adverse impacts of land acquisition
       on people’s income and livelihood; do not have any skills to carry out consultation with land
       owners.
      Absence of the inter-agencies coordination role to facilitate the process of obtaining approvals.
      Shortage in human resources to handle land acquisition issues in a more diligent and
       transparent manner
      Absence of institutional responsibilities and mandates for local level grievance to handle land
       related complaints and concerns.

           5.2.3   Adequacy of institutional arrangements and capacity on community
                   engagement

The conducted institutional assessment for handling community engagement showed that existing
resources and mechanisms for managing community engagement has a number of strengths that could
be summarized as follows:
     Availability of teams to handle the issues related to community awareness and communication
       on the Governorate level.
     The activities of the Public Relations and Awareness Department on the WSCs level is conducted
       based on an agreed upon annual work plan.
     There is a monitoring and evaluation system for the performance of the WSCs . HCWW
       evaluates the performance against the work plan in annual basis and rank the WCSs.
     There is a number of community based monitoring techniques for measuring the satisfaction
       with the service, the problems encountered by customers and the efficiently of the awareness
       and grievance systems (e.g. surveys).


                                                                                                    118
       Availability of awareness and communication guidelines and good quality materials that are
        used by the staff.

In the meantime, a number of institutional gaps were identified. These gaps concern with the mandates,
accountability, the amount and capacities of exiting manpower and the resources available for them.
The following section presents the main identified and analyzed gaps.

       Limitations in the mandates of the WSCs scope and the WSCs capacity

The HCWW and the affiliate WSCs are specifically mandated with the operation and maintenance.
Currently the role of the WSCs in the needs assessment, design, planning and construction of the rural
sanitation projects is very limited. Apart from the cases where land is donated for the pumping stations
and the WSCs get engaged in the process, no actual interface with local village residents starts until the
project is up and running on the ground. Even in the cases of land donation, the Department of Public
Relations and Awareness Raising does not involve in issues related to land.

       Community engagement tends to be defined by WSCs as raising the awareness of the
        communities rather than engaging with them in the process of decision making. In the
        meantime, water supply and water rationalization are priority scope areas to the WSCs that far
        overweight sanitation. No structured uniform mechanism is in place for the WSCs to engage
        with poor households to facilitate their access to households’ connections or to get
        communities views on the design and planning of certain sanitation project. Shortage in human
        resources and lack of staff representation on the Markaz and village level
       In addition to the lack of comprehensiveness for the scope of work of the Public Relations and
        Awareness Department, the conducted assessment revealed a significant shortage in the
        available human resources on the WSCs level. While the number of staff in Dakahlya is 6 team
        members, only 2 staff members are in charge in Sharkia. In the meantime, the interviewed WSCs
        members expressed concern about the fact that no support teams are available on the Markaz
        (where the WSCs branches exist) or the village level. This shortage in human resources is
        affecting the capacity and scope of outreach to rural areas. High staff turnover rate

Because the awareness raising and the tasks related to community engagement are perceived to be of
lower profile, the department generally witnesses high turnover rate with more interest from the staff
to join other departments closer to management.

       Lack of monitoring system to measure the impacts and the efficiency of the implemented
        community based activities including the awareness

The current monitoring system that the HCWW is applying is very much oriented to monitoring the
completion of activities rather than measuring their impacts on the communities. For instance, the
current method for monitoring the awareness raising is through completing the planned activities and
not measuring their impacts on the targeted communities.

       Lack of resources for logistical support
                                                                                                      119
The lack of resources for the needed logistical and administrative support is one of the key common
challenges among all the WSCs, with some slight exception in the case of Behaira WSC. Members of the
WSCs mentioned the challenges they face due to the lack of supportive equipment like laptops and
cameras and how this is implying on their ability to work.

       Inconsistency in the capacities of the assigned teams

There is inconsistency between the level of capacities among the three Governorates. While number of
the assigned staff has good technical and communication capacity, other staff members are not equality
qualified. In very general terms, the capacities needed to carry out community engagement in its large
terms seemed to be absent. There is significant limitation in knowledge related to community
consultation, handling and mitigating social impacts, handling grievance and handling land acquisition
issues.

           5.2.4   Adequacy of institutional arrangements and capacity on grievance redress
                   mechanism

This is elaborated in details under section 5.1.4 above




                                                                                                  120
6 Recommended Actions to Address Identified Risks and Gaps


6.1 Actions to address identified Environmental Risks and Gaps


The measures and actions recommended in this Chapter have been identified according to
risks, impacts of the Program and the gaps identified in the existing system.

           6.1.1   Implementation support for environmental aspects

The institutional support for managing the environmental aspects of the PAP will be as follows:
    - The main implementation responsibility of the PAP will be on the Program Implementation Unit
        (PIU) who should recruit an environmental specialist on full-time basis. The PIU environmental
        specialist in each WSC will be responsible for the environmental assessment of the interventions
        at each Program cluster, for following up the implementation of ESMPs, for ensuring the actions
        taken by other departments are done on timely manner, and for preparing Environmental
        Registers, progress reports and implementing monitoring measures. The 3 environmental
        specialists at the PIUs will be supported by:
             o An Environmental Specialist at the PMU level, who is expected to be recruited with
                 sufficient environmental assessment and management experience (10+ years of
                 experience) to support and build the capacity of the PIUs. It is expected that during the
                 first stages of the Program the PMU environmental specialist will have major role in the
                 ESIA process through providing PIUs with ToRs, templates, helping in contracting ESIA
                 consultants, following-up the approvals of EEAA, responding to different comments so
                 as the quality of the ESIAs would adequately address the site specific environmental
                 risks. The role of the PMU environmental specialist is expected be more towards a
                 supervisory role with the advancing of the Program as the PIUs would have gained the
                 experience to handle ESIAs towards the end of the Program.
             o The Environmental Specialist of the HCWW, who will also provide support in reviewing
                 the ESIAs and giving insight about the bottlenecks usually confronted in other projects
                 and how to overcome them. The Environmental Specialist of HCWW is already onboard
                 and worked with long list of similar projects implemented through the HCWW.
    - The ISC would support the environmental specialists of the PIUs on implementation and
        supervision of site-specific ESMPs. The WSCs would take advantage for the ISC role in
        construction supervision to overlook the environmental management of construction
        contractors.
    - The Quality Sectors in the 3 WSCs should either introduce a new Department for Sludge Quality
        or add the sludge quality to the mandate of the Effluent Quality Department. The WSCs should
                                                                                                      121
       procure sufficient laboratory equipment in the labs of WWTPs and the central labs at each WSC
       to analyze sludge. Sludge analysis should be done once the sludge maturation period is
       completed (6 months) at each WWTP with the report sent to the central lab to identify the
       suitability for sludge sale, and the selling of sludge will be done at the WSCs accordingly. It
       should be noted that the contracts for sludge selling, if analysis proven its suitability, should
       include the restrictions for sludge application as indicated in Decree 44/2000.
   -   The Occupational Health and Safety Department should add the following responsibilities to its
       mandate:
           o Reviewing designs of new WWTPs and PS and ensure that sufficient H&S measures are
                taken
           o Following up the adherence of WWTP and PSs staff to the H&S site specific measures.
                An inspection report should be prepared for each facility on a quarterly basis. In order to
                sufficiently implement this it is expected that more H&S staff would be recruited to
                comply with this.
   -   The Operation Sector should prepare a documented O&M manual specific for each WWTP
       including the environmental measures included as recommended by the environmental
       specialists and should ensure that WWTP managers adhere to such manuals


          6.1.2   Exclusion of high risk activities (Category A-Type Investments)


The Program interventions are limited to sewerage networks and small scale WWTPs, maximum of
30,000 m3/d, as indicated earlier. No Category A-type interventions are included within the Program.
However, the NRSP interventions in the 3 governorates include construction or extension of 3 relatively
large WWTP, which could be regarded as Category A-type intervention due to their size as follows:

   -   Gharb El Mansoura WWTP, which is currently under construction, with design capacity of
       135,000 m3/d. The WWTP will serve at its first stage 5 villages in Dakahlia Cluster 41 with total
       current population of about 60,000.
   -   Kafr Abo Naser WWTP, also under construction, with design capacity of 88,000 m3/d. The
       WWTP will serve at its first stage 10 villages in Dakahlia Cluster 32 with total current population
       of about 70,000.
   -   Aslougy WWTP, which is currently operating with capacity 80,000 m3 and NRSP would introduce
       expansions additional 50,000 m3/d. The expansion will serve at its first stage 2 villages in Sharkia
       Cluster 36 with total current population of about 40,000.

These WWTPs are not included in the PforR Program, and their completion is not required to achieve
the Program PDO nor the DLIs. It would be required to maintain the borders between the government
program (NRSP) and the PforR Program through:


                                                                                                       122
     -   The PMU and PIUs in Dakahlia and Sharkia WSCs should make sure that the interventions of
         networks, PSs and WWTPs in the 3 above clusters are not included in the aggregation of results
         for DLI1
     -   The IVA should include in its verification criteria ensuring that interventions in the above
         clusters should not be counted in the measurements of the DLIs

            6.1.3   Program Action Plan for environmental aspects

The following measures are proposed for minimizing environmental risks and mitigating environmental
impacts:
   - The PIUs, with support from the PMU and HCWW, should initiate the ESIA process for new
        clusters through preparing ToRs for the ESIAs putting sufficient weight to the covering the issues
        identified in this ESSA and the site specific issues39. The ESIAs should be approved by EEAA prior
        to initiating any civil works at the project level. The site specific ESMP measures should be
        included in the construction contracts and WWTP manuals. The ISC should supervise the
        implementation of such measures and prepare progress reports.
   - Sludge analysis should be included in the regular operations of the Quality Sector in WSCs. The
        analysis should be carried out for each batch of matured sludge against the standards of Decree
        44/2000. In case the sludge is complying with the standards it could be sold to contractors on
        condition that the contractor would be responsible for making farmers aware of the application
        rate of sludge, this responsibility should be reflected as an article in the contract. In case the
        sludge is not complying with the standards, it should be transferred to an adequate disposal
        site.
   - The Operation Sector for each WWTP should prepare and O&M manual specific to each WWTPs
        that includes standard procedures on normal conditions as well as on emergency conditions.
        The manuals should include the following measures. PIU environmental specialist, should
        frequently monitor the adherence to this manual:
             o Bypass discharges should be measured and recorded in the Environmental Register of
                 the WWTPs. The PIU should make sure to supervise this through observing the bypass
                 line during site visits and compare records of discharges of PSs against received
                 discharges measured at WWTPs
             o Solid waste separated from screens and grit chamber should be collected at a certain
                 location of the WWTPs and transferred on daily basis to disposal sites identified by the
                 Local Authority. The PIU should follow up through site visits the implementation of this
                 measure
   - The new Code of rural sanitation should have measures for putting rural shock loads into
        consideration when designing the WWTPs. The Code should address common shock loads from

39
  The ToRs of Site specific ESIAs should address risks on land quality and requirements for secondary containment
of hazardous substances tanks as these were identified gaps in the legal system
                                                                                                             123
       septage and animal slurry in rural areas. The Code should also provide technologies for
       minimizing land requirements for PS and WWTPs in the Delta area. The Code shall be developed
       by the NHBRC with close coordination from the PMU. The ISC should consider those factors in
       designing new PSs and WWTPs.
   -   The ISCs should provide sufficient site supervision on contractors during excavation works to
       report on any chance finds of culturally valuable objects.
   -   The Occupational Health and Safety Department should provide needs assessment for existing
       PSs and WWTPs to improve the health and safety standards. The Department should review
       designs of new facilities and provide comments as needed. The Department should conduct
       quarterly inspection for each WWTP and PS to ensure compliance with H&S standards.
   -   The ISC should review the compliance of construction contractors with health and safety
       requirements and include in site supervision progress reports any observations. Also the
       adherence of contractors to the ESMP measures for minimizing temporary construction impacts
       should be included.
   -   The ISC should ensure that dewatering operations do not affect the structures in neighboring
       areas and that it is not discharged in land. Site supervision progress reports should include any
       relevant observations.
   -   Connecting PSs that are negatively discharging to drains and private networks should be
       calculated among the results of DLI1, which will promote the environmental benefits of the
       Program. In caste of connecting private networks the ISC should assess their conditions and
       identify necessary measures to improve its quality to prevent/minimize clogging and leakage.

The PMU and HCWW should establish dialogue with MWRI and MoH regarding the possible
modifications of Law 48/1982. This would help in making the PMU technically and financially prepared
for any future modifications of the Law.

6.2 Actions to address identified Social risks and gaps


To address the previously identified social risks, the design of the program will need to take into
consideration the number of measures indicted below. The enhancement of the institutional capacities
should involve assigning the needed human resources, training them and equip them with the tools
needed for them to implement a monitor these measures. As per the design of the DLIs and the PAP, the
capacity enhancement will adopt and incremental approach that allows the teams in charge to move
with the identified measures and actions into actual implementation. The action to address the
identified risks will entail both procedural and executive dimension and institutional dimension. They
will largely revolve around two main dimensions: i) land acquisition and 2) community engagement.

One key crosscutting dimension to the proposed actions is women inclusion. As indicted in the analysis
of the ESSA above, women are critical player who are specifically encountering harsh implications from

                                                                                                    124
the absence of appropriate rural sanitation system. Women inclusion and engagement are key
prerequisite for the success and sustainability of the Program. Measures should be designed in a
manner to ensure that women (as well as other marginalized groups) are getting equitable access to the
project benefits and are not specifically encountering negative impacts. This will be highlighted in
respective section below.

The key proposed measures could be summarized in the following:

           6.2.1 Develop a standardized, approach for land acquisition

     1) Establish an inclusive Standards Operational Procedures (SOP)
      Prepare an inclusive Standards Operational Procedures (SOP) for the different
        approaches and procedures for acquiring land. The SOP should be prepared within the
        framework of the key principles of the international policies and best practices.

Box 6.1: Basic content for the “Standards Operational Procedures”40
Key contents for the Standards Operational Procedures:
    i. Regulating laws
   ii. Approaches for land acquisition
 iii. Proposed Improved Procedures
  iv. Principles:
       Entitlements
       Valuation of compensation
       Consultation with affected individuals
       Information disclosure
       Grievance mechanism
       Inclusion of vulnerable groups (including women, elders, landless…etc)
   v. Planning the resettlement process
  vi. Documentation process
 vii. Monitoring the impacts related to land acquisition
       Tools
       Reporting
viii. ToRs and performance indicators for the “Land Acquisition Officer”
  ix.   Key Executive steps for finalizing land acquisition process (including the checklists and
        forms to be used, steps to be followed…etc)

As indicted under the consultation discussion and the various sections of the ESSA, there is a
strong recognition among the teams of the WSCs for land as a bottleneck and clear openness

40
  The content is not inclusive and will be developed further as part more comprehensive ToRs to be developed for
the Guidelines preparation with guidance from the Bank.
                                                                                                            125
for adopting a streamlined and strengthened approach in acquiring land. Commitment to the
WSCs application for the SOP should be ensured. This could be attained through the following:
     Ongoing consultation during the preparation of the SOP will strengthen the sense of
       ownership and ensure that the proposed procedures are technically doable.
     Wide dissemination to the SOP and building the capacity on the tools for its application
       should be assured.
     The SOP should be clearly reflected in the responsibilities (ToRs) of the assigned teams
       to ensure that the stipulated procedures are actually followed.
     Linkages between the application of to the SOP and the performance of the WSCs
       teams.

   2) Streamline the process of land acquisition approvals among various ministries

      Develop Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Ministry and different
       entities in charge of provision of the land approvals. These entities include the line-
       ministries as well as the concerned Governorate and LGUs. This MoU should work as an
       umbrella agreement to set forth the cooperation among the various entities to ensure
       securing approvals on fast track basis and work to prevent any potential delay in the
       process of land acquisition. The MoU should stipulate any needed measures to be taken
       (e.g. establishing higher committee or Governorate level committee) to ensure close
       coordination for timely delivery.

   3) Handling potential risk related to the land that was acquired before the start of the
      Program:

      Post verification/review to be conducted by the WSCs for the land acquisition cases that
       were completed before the Program starts to ensure that the process of land
       transaction was completed satisfactorily (e.g. documentation, compensation value,
       entitled groups, full payment paid…etc)




                                                                                           126
     4) Strengthen the capacity of WSCs to manage land acquisition

        Assign staff to work in each of the Governorates to fill in the function of “Land
         Acquisition Officer”41. The role of those assigned members should not be of pure legal
         nature but rather a combination of social and legal background to ensure sufficient
         consideration for the social impacts related to land acquisition. A Senior Land
         Acquisition Officer should be also assigned within the PMU on the central level to
         ensure close coordination with the assigned Governorates staff. If the Social Officer
         assigned has good knowledge and experience about land acquisition, he/she might be
         assigned the land responsibilities in cooperation with the legal/properties department.
         The land acquisition team should be coordinating closely with the Legal and Properties
         Departments team with the objective of addressing the social implication related to land
         and ensuring the various principles as per the SOP are addressed. Training and capacity
         building should be provided to this team as indicted below.

Box 6.2: Preliminary responsibilities for the Land Acquisition Officers42
On the level of the PMU

The Senior Land Acquisition Officer on the PMU level should be in charge of the land file on the program
level. He/She should work in designing a progressive work plan that carefully harmonize between the
project implementation schedule and the land acquisition requirements in a timely manner. Based on
the MoU, he/she should play a key role in flagging issues to the central committee to avoid any potential
delay in the project implementation as a result of land acquisition. The Senior Land Acquisition Officer
should work closely with the Land Acquisition Officers on the WSC level to ensure the diligent
implementation for the land acquisition process as per the SOP. The Senior Land Acquisition Officer
should report to the Head of the PMU

On the WSC level

The Land Acquisition Officer on the WSC should be charged with the daily responsibility of consultation
and commination with the affected groups as a result of land acquisition. The Land Acquisition Officer
should work to fulfill all the resettlement principles that will be stipulated in the Guidelines. He should
coordinate and harmonize activities closely with the Community Engagement teams. He/She should

41
   Assigning a team on the PMU and the WSCs to be fully in charge of “land acquisition” (to work with the legal
team) is an optimal scenario. If human resources for this purpose are not available, these mandates should be
handled by the community engagement teams.
42
   Those are not inclusive ToRs for the land acquisition officer. Comprehensive ToRs will need to be prepared with
guidance from the Bank. It is also possible to revise the existing ToRs of the Properties Department to ensure that
the proposed responsibilities are included.
                                                                                                                127
report to the Senior Land Acquisition Officer on the PMU level.


           6.2.2    Strengthening the system of community engagement

6.2.2.1   Strengthening the institutional setup and the procedures to address community
          engagement and social risks

As examined on Chapter 5 above, the process of community engagement currently entail large number
of shortfalls that could majorly attributed to the limitation in scope, mandates and human capacities. As
the case with the land acquisition, a number of measures will need to be taken to strengthen the system
of community engagement.
     1) Developing comprehensive “Procedural Guidelines for Community Engagement”

The “Procedural Guidelines for Community Engagement” should be setting the foundation for the teams
who will be assigned to carry out the community engagement in an inclusive and comprehensive
manner. The Guidelines should cover the various stages of the project starting from the assessment and
preparation, passing through design and construction until project implementation, operation and
evaluation. The Guidelines should include full set of guiding tools, sheets and checklists that the
community engagement teams should be using. They should provide clear guidance to the teams
working in community engagement on how to address the vulnerability issues, including how to engage
women and how to strengthen communities’ ownership to the projects as a prerequisite for project
success and sustainability. The Guidelines will also work as a protocol manual that give guidance on how
to design and implement field work in a culturally sensitive manner.

Box 6.3: Basic content for the “Procedural Guidelines for Community Engagement”43
   i. The process of social risk identification and mitigation
  ii. Project preparation
      Participatory needs assessment
      Willingness to pay and affordability surveys
      Willingness to contribute (e.g. land and cash)
      Designing and implementing a pro-poor strategy
      Consultation with land owners and land users
      Preparation of the relevant ToRs for ESIA
      Support the preparation of baseline surveys
 iii. Project design
      Community mobilization for participatory design
      Review and provide input to the ESIAs

43
  The content is not inclusive and will be developed further as part more comprehensive ToRs to be developed for
the Guidelines preparation under guidance from the Bank.
                                                                                                            128
 iv.       Project Construction
          Implementation of the social management plan including:
               Consultation with various stakeholders including affected individuals
               Monitoring the mitigation measures
               Establish and operate local level grievance mechanism
               Maintain records of the construction process, impacts and complaints handling.
               Carry out awareness raising
 v.        Project operation
          Implementation of the social management plan

          ToRs for the Senior Community Engagement Officer on the PMU level
          ToRs for the Community Engagement Officer on the WSCs level
          ToRs for the Community Engagement Focal Point at the branch-level
  ix.      Performance Based Evaluation for the Community Engagement teams


Annexes: This should include all the templates, checklists, guiding documents



       2) Assign the appropriate human resources for community engagement:

Currently the department with closest relevance to the responsibilities related to community
engagement is the Public Relations and Awareness Raising Department and the Hotline
Department within the WSCs. However, the scope of responsibilities of these departments is
currently narrower than their anticipated role in the Program. As shown in Table 6.1 below,
there are certain mandates that are not within the current scope of the WSCs and other
mandates that will need to be strengthened as part of the new program.




                                                                                            129
Table 13: WSCs new mandates and the existing mandates that need strengthening

Areas that are outside the current mandates Areas that are within the current mandates but
(need to be added)                          will need strengthening

       Communities need assessment                         Assessing community satisfaction
       Willingness to pay and contribute                   Awareness raising
       Participatory planning and design                   Designing and implementing action plans
       Identification and handling social risks            Grievance redress mechanism
       Construction        phase     (consultation,        Performance monitoring
        assessing and mitigating the impacts
        related to construction)
       Grievance redress mechanism to cover the
        construction and land related issues
       Monitoring project benefits on local
        communities
       Monitoring the impacts of awareness
        raising      activities (e.g. change in
        knowledge, behaviors and attitudes)


It is recommended that the human resources within both the PMU and the WSCs are strengthened to
ensure diligent consideration for the various community engagement aspects and to work proactively to
address the social risks along the various stages of the project. As the case for the teams to manage
land acquisition, it is recommended to assign a Senior Community Engagement Officer on the level of
the PMU on the central level to ensure close coordination with the assigned Governorates staff.
On the WSCs level, teams of Community Engagement Officers should be assigned. Due to the
relevance of the scope of this position and the exiting teams under the department of Public Relations
and Awareness Raising, it is recommended that nomination of the Community Engagement Officers
consider the existing human resources within the WSCs. However, a review for the previous
performance along with the relevance of the existing staff qualifications and experience to carry out the
new mandates should be carried out to make decisions on the members to be selected.

One of the key gaps that the new institutional setup should seek to bridge is the absence of staff to
manage community related issues on the level of the Markazes/WSCs branches. It is recommended that
branch-level Community Engagement Focal Point are assigned to take case of the day to day
consultation and commination with local communities as well as the affected persons from the land
acquisition.

The Scope of work and TORs of the teams to be assigned for the community engagement should be
developed as part of the preparation of the Procedural Guidelines for Community Engagement. The
assigned teams should be capable and competent to carry out all the tasks related to community
                                                                                                     130
engagement and mitigating social risks on different levels and along different stages of the project. Most
importantly, the teams should be working proactively to address the risks identified through this social
assessment by adopting the measures that are stated in this Chapter of the ESSA. The teams should be
also working to identify any other potential social risks that might emerge along the project life cycle. It
is worth mentioning that for all the measures stated under section 6.2.2.2 to section 6.2.2.7 below, the
community engagement teams should play a key leading role to implement.

Box 6.4 below presents a very preliminary idea about the key responsibilities of the community
engagement teams on the level of the PMU, WSC and branches.

Box 6.4: Preliminary responsibilities for the community engagement teams 44
On the PMU level

The Senior Community Engagement Officer on the PMU level should be responsible for the overall
performance of the Program in terms of community related activities and managing social risks
associated with the Program. With the WSCs team, he/she should design the overall community
engagement and the risks mitigation strategy and follow up closely in its implementation. He/she should
monitor and evaluate the performance of the community engagement teams on the WSCs level. The
Senior Community Engagement Officer should work closely with the Senior Land Acquisition Officer to
develop joint plans that incorporate the land related impacts along with diligent and proactive measures
to handle.

The Senior Community Engagement Officer should report to the Head of the PMU.

On the WSC level

The Community Engagement Officer should be assigned on the WSCs level. They should be working
together as a team and with their respective officers on the branch level to execute the strategy related
to community engagement and mitigation of social risks. Their work is field based with majority of time
expected to be spent in the targeted villages to carry out the various activities. They should be providing
direct day to day support to the focal points in the Braches. The Community Engagement Officer reports
to the Senior Community Engagement Officer on the PMU level.

On Branch level

Community Engagement Focal Point is based on the WSC Branch (Markaz) level. He/She works under
the direct supervision of the Community Engagement Officer of the WSC. The Focal Point should be
following up on the actual issues with villagers on daily basis. He/She should be working against monthly
work plan that is developed with the WSC. In the meantime, the Focal Points should alert against any

44
  Those are not inclusive ToRs for the land acquisition officer. Comprehensive ToRs will need to be prepared with
guidance from the Bank
                                                                                                              131
potential emerging social risks and contribute to setting strategies to address them. The Focal Point
reports to the Community Engagement Officer on the WSC level.


6.2.2.2 Addressing the risk of damages associated to the construction activities

This potential risk could be addressed through the following proactive measures:

      Early consultation with various community groups including the potentially vulnerable
       households.
      Ensure the ToRs of the ESIA are stipulating this type of potential social risk and ensure that the
       ESIA gives the due attention to it in the analysis.
      Design environmental and social management plan (ESMP) that set forth measures that obliges
       the contractor to take precautionary measure to avoid this risk
      Maintain consultation during the project construction
      Close monitoring to the work of the contractors
      Design and operate a local level grievance mechanism to handle potential complaints




                                                                                                     132
6.2.2.3 Addressing the risk of weak sense of demand for and ownership towards the projects
        in certain communities

This potential risk could be addressed through the following proactive measures:

      Early consultation with targeted community to assess the need for the project.
      Work to demonstrate to the local communities the anticipated returns from the project
       including health benefits.
      Engage strongly with rural women to raised their awareness and build their sense of ownership.
      Highlight other issues related to pollution and the unsustainability and unreliability of the
       current illegal services.
      Initiate coordination with other relevant stakeholders including the Ministry of water and
       irrigation and NGOs to mobilize for the illegal sewage dumping.

6.2.2.4 Addressing the risk of low acceptance and readiness for the proposed technology


This potential risk could be addressed through the following proactive measures:

      Close collaboration with the design consultant to enable the community engagement officers to
       deliver clear and comprehensive idea to the community members on the project technical
       details, households connection cost and the role that will be played by communities and the
       CDAs in operation and maintenance
      Early consultation with targeted community to assess the need for the project, willingness to
       pay, affordability and their capacity to manage a decentralized system.
      Enhance the level of ownership to the project through community mobilization and
       implementing participatory assessment
      Facilitate the delivery of the needed capacity building to enable the local communities and/or
       CDAs to operate and maintain the project in sustainable terms.


6.2.2.5 Addressing the risk of social tensions as a result of exclusion of certain villages


This potential risk could be addressed through the following proactive measures:

      Avoiding this potential risk during the clustering of the villages in the design of the project.
      In case where the exclusion of certain villages is inevitable, it is recommended to facilitate the
       access of these communities to any alternative sanitation model (on site models).
      In all cases, consultation activities should be also targeting and inclusive to these communities.
      Transparent sharing of information should be ensured

                                                                                                       133
       Design and operate a local level grievance mechanism to handle potential complaints

6.2.2.6 Addressing the risk related to affordability of poor households


This potential risk could be addressed through the following proactive measures:

       A pro-poor strategy for supporting the poor households will be prepared. This will include a
        comprehensive analysis for the potential locally appropriate forms of assistance to poor
        households should be developed based on actual assessment on the level of each Governorate.
       The analysis should engage with key stakeholders on the Governorate and villages level
        including but not limited to, CDAs, Directorate of Social Solidarity, natural leaders, the targeted
        beneficiaries form poor households …etc.
       The different options should be examined along with the pros and cons of each in the specific
        villages context.
       A set of Alternatives should be reached in consultation with stakeholders and should be
        announced transparently.
       The criteria for the selection of the households to receive special assistance should be
        announced clearly and transparently on the village level
       Design and operate a local level grievance mechanism to handle potential complaints

The following presents a basic analysis for the scenarios that could be considered along with their pros
and cons:

4. Targeted installment         If done efficiently, it will mean       There is a possibility that some

   mechanisms – e.g.             service.
   submitting papers,
   social surveys to be
   conducted…etc)


The above scenarios should be elaborated and examined against the local conditions to make sure the
selected scenario suits the conditions in each Governorate. In the meantime, the method for targeting
the poor households (in the scenarios where this is needed) should be carefully designed to combine
between simplicity and efficiency. It is unfavorable to put additional pressure on the poor households to
complete and submit large amount of documents to prove that they are entitled to assistance. The
associated administrative costs related to applying the targeting mechanism as well as the needed
human resources should be taken into consideration in designing the targeting mechanism. It is strongly
recommended to resort to community-based mechanisms (e.g. village level committees, community
leaders, CDAs, .etc) to participate in the targeting process and to help in verifying the information and
confirm illegibility. It is critical to ensure that the community-based mechanism is representative for the
various sub groups within the village to avoid any exclusion. The designed strategy should be built on
existing mechanisms (e.g. UNICEF mechanism) and the lessons learnt from them.

Transparent sharing of information should be ensured through:



                                                                                                           135
    1) Transparent announcement for the whole process including a) the support scenario that will be
       applied, b) the criteria for selecting the poor households, c) the required documents (if any) and
       d) the community-based mechanism that will be supporting.
    2) A grievance mechanism should be operating efficiently to receive various complaints. People
       should be given the right to claim and prove eligibility and timely transparent response should
       be provided to them.

6.2.2.7 Strengthened grievance mechanism to accommodate various issues

As elaborated in details on Chapter 5, the current Hotline system has its own limitations, including but
not limited to, the lack of automation and limitation in applying technology, lack of standardized process
and procedures, absence of clarity on the time interval need for handling different types of complaints
and preference of informal intake channels versus formal ones. In the meantime, the ESSA identified the
limitation in the scope of the Hotline and the focus on the operation and maintenance as a key gap.
Currently, the types of social risks identified above are not being handled through the Hotline, neither
do they have another grievance channel to resort to. As shown under sections 6.2.2 and all the sub
section above, designing and operating a local level grievance mechanism to handle potential
complaints was introduced as one key crosscutting measure to address multiple social risks.
The Hotline system should be improved through better use for technology, strengthening the registry
and tracking system and enabling complainants to appeal if their complaints are not satisfactorily
resolved. In the meantime, for handling the social risks related to land, poor households’ connection
fees and the impacts of the construction work as elaborated above in this chapter, a local level
mechanism will need to be designed on the village level to handle these issues. The merit of having a
local mechanism versus having these complaints channeled through the Hotline is the fact that these
issues are largely generated on the grassroots level and it is better to ensure they are handled promptly
on the local level instead of leaving them to get through a universal inefficient system which is already
overloaded with large complaints influx related to operation and maintenance. It is recommended that
diversion protocol is being established between the Hotline and the local grievance mechanism to
ensure that a) complaints received through the local mechanisms are also reported inside the Hotline
system and b) in case complaints related to the Program are received through the Hotline, they should
be promptly diverted to the local level grievance mechanism. It is also strongly recommended to ensure
that women are having smooth and equitable access to the designed grievance system and that their
complaints are fairly handled.

In the design of the local level grievance, the following are key principles that should be taken into
consideration:

   Multiple uptake location with clear organizational structure for grievances handling
   Clear system for sorting, processing, prioritization and referral
   Acknowledgement through provision of receipts and tracking numbers
                                                                                                      136
   Timely provision of progress updates to complainants and feedback
   Timely and efficient verification, investigation and Action
   Monitoring and evaluation trough operating good tracking system, analysis for the complaints
    including status and develop regular reports.

The following section wraps up the actions related to social aspects that should be included in
the PAP:

Institutional Issues

       Assign the appropriate human resources for handling land acquisition
         Develop ToRs for the Senior land acquisition officer on the central level and the land
            acquisition officer on the level of the WSC and obtain the Bank approval
         Assign the land acquisition teams
       Assign the appropriate human resources for community engagement and handling
        social risk


                                                                                                   137
 Develop ToRs for the Senior Community Engagement officer on the central level, the
  Community Engagement officer on the level of the WSC and the Focal Points on the
  Markaz/branch level.
 Assign the community engagement teams




                                                                                138
Enhance the performance evaluation system

        Establish performance based monitoring system to evaluate the teams that will be
         assigned.
        Establish strong reporting mechanism that allow for bottom up flow of information and
         allow decisions to be made accordingly

           6.2.3   Implementation support for social aspects

Training and capacity building will be key prerequisites to enable the assigned teams to carry
out their responsibilities as stipulated in their ToRs. The following are the main areas of support
for the Program Implementation:

For land Acquisition

The “Standards Operational Procedures” should be the applications related to land acquisition.
The implementation support in this regard will entail:

        Providing guidance and support to the PMU and the WSCs in the preparation of the
         ToRs for the responsibilities of the team and the preparation of the ToRs for the SOP
         and the Procedural Guidelines for Community Engagement.
        Provide training to the WSCs teams working in land acquisition45.

Initially proposed topics of training for the teams working in land acquisition:

        International policies and best practices related to resettlement
        Legal and social aspects associated to resettlement
        Preparing of resettlement assessments and action plans
        Monitoring the land acquisition and resettlement impacts

For community engagement

The “Procedural Guidelines for Community Engagement” will set the core for the work of the
community engagement team. The implementation support in this regard will entail:


45
  Training should be initiated once the teams are assigned in order to enable them to carry out
their tasks in a sound diligent and socially sensitive manner


                                                                                               139
      Provide assistance in development of the “Procedural Guidelines for Community
       Engagement”
       Support the WSCs in strengthening the GRM system
      Provide assistance to WSCs to strengthen their monitoring and evaluation system in
       terms of the service feedbacks
      Provide training to the teams of the WSCs and relevant stakeholders on community
       engagement related aspects

Initially proposed topics of training for the teams working in community engagement:

      Social assessments
      Social risk assessment
      Participatory planning approaches
      Monitoring consultants and contractors

Crosscutting modules to all the teams:

      Consultation and engagement with affected persons
      Information sharing and Disclosure
      Grievance redress mechanisms
      Monitoring and evaluation
      Report Writing

In the meantime, it is essential as part of the capacity building process of the assigned staff and
the implementation support to provide the needed logistical support to enable them to carry
out their mandated and perform the tasks that will be requested from them. Logistical support
will involve office-based facilities as well as the needed facilities for frequent field visits to carry
out consultation and interact directly with the various affected groups and individuals.

    Summary of key comments from the Public Consultations on the ESSA Draft Findings

                                        April 21:23, 2015

Summary of key comments from Sharkia consultation on the draft ESSA- Tuesday April 21,
2015:

Magdy El Hossary – EEAA RBO:
   Bahr El Bakar Drain is also a priority area as it discharges to Lake Manzala, I recommend
      expanding the Program coverage
   There are pilot project in Borg El Arab that used innovative technologies in wastewater
      treatment, I recommend benefiting from this experience.


Hamdy Masoud – Central Labs Sharkia WSC
   Installing units to separate oil and grease is an important factor for meeting the effluent
     standards.
   Designing the networks is an important factor in receiving a better quality influent


Eng. Shaker – Deputy Chairman of WSC
    The private networks cause many operational problems. Rehabilitation of such networks
       could be an option to connect these communities
    Receiving septage should be accounted for in the design of the projects

Abas Farouk- Antiquities Department
    Antiquities issues and the sites of cultural heritage value is critical here in Sharkia. We
       strongly advice that The Directorate of Antiquities in informed early on with the project
       locations and the areas of work. We will ensure that an Antiquities Inspector is available
       on site in all sensitive areas. We have the resources for that.

Eman Hassan – Head of the Environmental Health Department
   Law enforcement is critical to minimize the risk for the major violations of the illegal
      dumping on agricultural drains. Although we have laws, the actual enforcement and the
      tools to enforce are not in place.

Eng. Zakaria - Head of ISSIP 2 RSU
    Will ESIA be prepared for the projects under the new program?
    To avoid getting into the challenge of resources limitations to finance land through
       willing buyer willing seller approach, it would be highly beneficial if the Program allowed
       resources for the purpose of purchasing land. We are anticipating the capital cost
                                                                                              168
       needed for land for WWTP to range between 5:7% of the capital investment (Eng.
       Zakaria was also quoting Eng. Ezzat- Dakahlia Chairman during previous event).

Zyad- Social Officer of ISSIP 2 RSU
    We need the design of the program to carefully note that the RSU has been going
       through a lengthy and demanding process to build trust with local communities under
       ISSIP 2. As a result of a constructive process for community mobilization, we managed to
       secure land for treatment plants and pumping stations for 9 villages under ISSIP 2 Phase
       2, mostly through community contributions. As part of restructuring ISSIP 2 phase 2,
       these villages will not be served. 4 of them went to the sanitation program (PforR) while
       5 are now left behind. We have concerns on the implications of this on our credibility
       in front of the communities. We are also concerned that this may create a sense of
       mistrust that may imply on the whole program. The PforR should consider ways to serve
       these villages, specifically since they are located geographically close to targeted on.

Dr. Ekhlas El Desouki – Head of the Health Care waste in the Directorate of Health
     The Program is excellent and highly needed but we believe we can do better in terms of
       raising the awareness of local communities to mobilize local resources to
       contribute/finance rural sanitation projects.

Dr. Samia Asal - National Council for Women
     The problem of drains pollution (through the disposal of the septic tanks vacuuming)
       should be immediately tackled even through intermediate solutions like collective large
       septic tanks or disposal to existing WWTP.

Moamen- IWSP PIU
   Land is a critical challenge that we are also facing in the IWSP. The idea of signing MoU
     among ministries is very good but it will need follow up actions like a “one stop shop” or
     a “Higher Committee” to be in charge of coordinating all the approvals on fast track.

Nevine Abdel Rahman – The Head of the Awareness Raising Department HCWW
    Community participation is a critical part of the program. If not done probably, the
      implications will not be on the DLI 4 but rather on all the other DLIs including those
      related to the service delivery and the review of the tariff structure.
    We do not have currently a role in handling the impacts related to construction and
      land but the teams of the awareness raising are the closest to carry out these jobs under
      the Program
    We have a serious challenge related to the limitations in human resources working in
      community mobilization and awareness raising. We acknowledge the gaps identified by
      the ESSA.

                                                                                            169
      It would be greatly beneficial to set KPI related to community engagement, quality of
       community services and complaints systems (e.g. ISO for the customers service centers
       and the Hotline) and we can incorporate it within our annual work plan and set target
       related to the capacity building in the this regard. We have good annual budget for
       training and will be highly beneficial if we included in the awareness raising training
       more topics related to handling land issues and addressing other social risks.
      The institutional setup within the WSC to handle the program is also a key prerequisite
       for the program success and delivery.

Summary of key comments from Dakahlya consultation on the draft ESSA- Wednesday April
22, 2015:


Eng. Ezzat El Sayyad – Chairman of Dakahlia WSC:
    There should be dialogue between the WSC, Directories of Health, Irrigation and Health
       to give WWTPs that are overloaded grace periods for compliance.
    The exclusion of Gharb El Mansoura WWTP (originally was 135,000 and now 185,000
       m3/d after reviewing the plans) should be only for the WWTP, while the networks
       ending at this WWTP should not be excluded as the networks are separate from the
       relatively large WWTP. Including these villages, which are located near the Nile, will
       maximize the benefits of the Program.
    The WSC has conducted gap analysis study for the H&S requirements, the study
       concluded that the H&S tools needed to comply with main H&S requirements is L.E. 8
       millions. The WSC is ready to take measures for complying with H&S requirements but
       there are no financial resources available to take these measures, and it would be a
       good opportunity if the Program could support financing these requirements.
    Some PSs in Dakahlia are already receiving septage and this could be expanded. This
       could not be offered for free for private contractors as some of them are getting a fee of
       L.E. 70/truck load.
    The land prices are not included in existing cost estimate of projects, this land prices
       would be 5-7% from the total project cost and including it within the Program cost
       would mitigate potential future risk (if it is left to our resources) .
    Large part of the land challenge is about coordination with the concerned authorities.
       Governors should be included in the MoU.
    We had a good experience in Sohag Governorate for making connections fees
       affordable to poor households, through making a revolving fund available with long
       term repayment conditions in cooperation with UNICEF. I worked closely in this
       successful program. We can adapt a similar model and the Program may consider
       dedicating a portion from the loan to start a revolving loan for this purpose.


                                                                                             170
Ms. Rasha – Social Specialist HCWW:
    Raising the labor awareness is a key requirement for improving the H&S performance.
      The equipment are also not available
    More critical role for the media should be played on the national level particularly since
      the Program is a priority for the Government.

Eng. Mohammad Ragab – Dakahlia WSC:
    We need to rationalize the use of the Program finance and improve the financial
      efficiency of the construction and operation of projects. There should be emphasis on
      the improvement of WSCs operation efficiency and the WSCs should target minimum
      unit cost per each household connection.
    There are a number of technologies that could be employed in WWTPs that have less
      operation costs, and the existing technologies that are usually employed are usually
      associated with high operation costs

Dr. Hisham – EEAA Regional Branch Office
     WWTPs which are located in or near residential settlements should be given priority to
       improve their performance

Mr. Atef El Kanany – Head of Environmental Management Unit (EMU) in Dakahlia
Governorate
    Noncompliant sludge should be disposed in hazardous waste landfill, but there are no
       such landfill in the Governorate. It might be beneficial to have such site in the
       Governorate
    The handling of hazardous materials and hazardous waste (include used containers of
       chlorine) should be included in the Register of WWTPs
    There should be capacity building for the environmental staff in the EMU (along with
       WSCs staff) among the Program activities

Dr. Hisham – Mansoura University
     I recommend raising the risk on structural stability during dewatering operations
       (especially for PSs) from low to medium as we, in the University, receive many cases of
       differential settlement incidents
     Control on industrial discharges to the network (through monitoring for Law 93) is very
       important in controlling the quality of the sludge and the quality of final effluent
     Using existing capacities of WWTPs should consider the increase of population from
       existing served communities




                                                                                            171
Representatives of Antiquities Authorities
    There are a number of hills that are identified to include antiquity sites in the
      Governorate. The site licensing is not granted except after approval of Antiquity
      Authority.
    In wastewater projects that are located in sites likely to include antiquities the Authority
      provides supervision on construction sites by their Staff and they have done so near a
      hill in Tema El Amdid

Dr. Magdy Aasar – Environmental and Social Specialist HCWW
     Industrial wastewater could be an important source of revenue to WSCs
     Including networks of large WWTPs (such as Gharb El Mansoura) will maximize the
      environmental benefits of the Program
     There is difference between the scope of the awareness as carried out now by the WSCs
      and the level of community engagement and community participation that the program
      is aiming for. We had experience in ISSIP project and we observed that the more we
      invested in community engagement, the smoother the projects moved ahead with
      strengthened level of ownership that was reflected in various aspects including
      acquiring land.
     To launch a revolving loan for targeting poor households, we may need to seek grants
      from different donors.

Mr. Amr – Awareness Department HCWW
    There should be consideration for establishing fertilizers plant from WWTPs sludge.

Mr Sameh and Wael – Awkaf Directorate
    The role of worship establishments is very important in awareness raising due to the
      credibility and closeness to local communities.

Mr. Adel – Sandoub CDA
    The role of NGOs and Youth centers are very important in awareness raising

Ms. Nevine, Public Relation and Awareness Raising, Dakahlya WSC
    In preparing the guidelines related to the community participation, we need to take into
      consideration the manuals that we prepared for engaging with NGOs.
Summary of key comments from Behaira consultation on the draft ESSA- Thursday April 23,
2015:

Eng. Khaled- Behaira WSC Chairman
    We should have more and more of these collective and consultative events as the
       Program evolves.

                                                                                             172
      We have models (under ISSIP) where the resistance and objections are converted to
       large and strong acceptance and support to the project.


Ms. Samia Soliman- The Secretary of the Women National Council
    The supervision of the actual construction work should be greatly improved than the
      case now. The WSC should play better role in supervising the contractors.
    If the community networks/sewers are to be incorporated in the Program, the quality of
      the networks of these sewers should be carefully examined because in many cases they
      are not compatible technically.
    As a community member, I have observation on 125 Hotline. The line is always busy.

Samir Mohammad – Kafr El Dawar LGU

      Implementation should be done on fast track basis and the changes in the senior level of
       managers and leaders should be dealt with as a potential threat.

Omaima El Garhy – Public Relations Department
   Engagement and close coordination with LGUs greatly help in addressing problems in a
     proactive manner
   In private networks, sometimes the level of water supply pipes are lower than sewerage
     gravity networks, which elevates the risk of drinking water contamination


Khaled Mohammad – Resident in Kafr El Dawar and employee in the LGU
    The existing WWTP are overloaded and under maintained and in many cases need
       urgent renovation.

Dr. Amal Fouda- Directorate of health

The technical criteria for the land selection is always a critical factor that narrows down the
land options. In many cases, communities think they have land available but the land is not
technically compatible.




                                                                                                  173
