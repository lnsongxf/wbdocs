Overview
Highlights
 From 2004 to 2012, Zambia experienced a combination of good economic policies and
 high rates of growth not seen since the early years after its independence. While growth
 was mainly driven by rising copper prices, other factors contributed to Zambia’s ability
 to take advantage of this growth. The international debt relief programs in 2004–2005
 almost eliminated public debt and provided the fiscal space for selective, high-priority
 investments and expanded social programs. The privatization of the copper mines
 brought new investment in rehabilitation and expansion of production.
 The period also saw a substantial expansion of primary education and progress in
 dealing with the most pervasive public health problems. These positive developments
 set the stage for Zambia to tackle its pervasive poverty. In practice, however, sustained
 growth over the period has led to little poverty reduction, especially in rural areas of the
 country.
 The Bank Group and other donors provided critical support at the beginning of the
 evaluation period, when Zambia’s debt level became unsustainable.
 The Bank provided substantial support for capacity development and better functioning
 institutions.
 The Bank’s efforts to strengthen public administration and improve governance met with
 some partial successes in enhanced audit and procurement capacity, and the
 achievement of Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative compliance. However,
 despite nearly a decade of implementation, the Integrated Financial Management
 Information Systems (IFMIS), is still only partially operational. Further, the Zambian
 government has not followed through on its positive discourse regarding
 decentralization of government authority.
 The Bank Group contributions to promoting economic diversification and attracting
 private investment in the nonmineral sector and small and medium enterprises have
 been limited. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has provided support to the
 financial sector, but its efforts to support real sector development have been slow to get
 off the ground.
 In recent years, the Bank has increased its emphasis on support for agriculture, focusing
 on linking smallholders with larger commercial producers. However, the Bank’s efforts
 in agriculture appear diffuse and ineffective, and have not been based on a well-
 articulated sector strategy underpinned by extensive analytical work.
 Taking into consideration the assessment of Bank Group relevance and effectiveness, the
 evaluation rates the Bank contribution to outcomes as moderately unsatisfactory. It has
 the following five recommendations for the Bank Group.

OVERVIEW


     Help the authorities prepare for potential copper price volatility by jointly exploring
      alternative scenarios and appropriate arrangements for sound fiscal management and
      monitoring over the medium-term, as well as developing contingency plans;
     Focus governance and institutional strengthening support on building government
      capacity for the efficient use of fiscal resources including IFMIS implementation,
      decentralization, and the leveraging of Bank interventions at the project level ( for
      example, through requiring IFMIS and decentralized decision making for Bank-
      supported projects) to make progress;
     Work with the transport, power and health ministries to develop a portfolio of
      priority projects for managing implementation and strengthening capacity. Bring the
      IFC and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) into the sector
      dialogue and explore potential collaboration;
     Carry out sector analysis and put in place a strategy for Bank support for agriculture,
      using potential synergies from the Bank, IFC, and MIGA with the latter two
      institutions in particular playing a larger role. Ongoing projects should be recast and
      integrated into the strategy; and
     Addressing rural poverty should be a more central part not just of Bank strategy
       documents, but also of the Bank’s operational program. While there are poverty-
       related interventions in agriculture and health, the Bank needs to develop a strategic
       approach in this area, looking at various options by which to have an impact on rural
       poverty in the medium-term.

1. Country Context and Purpose of the
Evaluation
In the past decade, Zambia has seen rapid growth driven by higher copper prices
and earlier progress on debt relief and privatization. It has started to enjoy access to
private capital and has been reducing its aid dependency. Zambia attained lower-
middle-income country status in 2012.

From independence in 1964 to the early 1990s, Zambia pursued a policy of
channeling copper earnings into the development of highly protected state
enterprises. At the time of its independence, the Zambian economy was extremely
concentrated around the single sector of copper mining. The mining sector
accounted for some 45 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), nearly 90 percent of
exports, 65 percent of public revenues and the bulk of formal sector employment,
other than public services. The collapse of world copper prices in the mid-1970s
caused a significant adverse shock on the Zambian economy. The government
responded by increasing external borrowing, imposing pervasive controls over an
array of factor and product markets, and implemented widespread nationalization
of productive assets outside of the mining sector. However, the economy remained
concentrated in copper mining and continued to stagnate.

The economic reforms initiated in early 1990s were designed to liberalize the
economy and privatize the state-owned enterprises, particularly the copper mines.
With declining copper prices, the national company, Zambia Consolidated Copper
Mining, did not have the resources needed to undertake the investments needed to
maintain levels of copper production, resulting in a steady decline in output. Mines
were saddled with excess labor and bore responsibility for expenditures on housing,
education, health, and pensions for its mineworkers. The consequence, by the end of
the 1990s, was a need for subsidies of more than $500,000 a day. In this context, a
comprehensive privatization program was implemented with support from the
International Monetary Fund and the International Development Association.

The reforms in the 1990s set the stage for the negotiation of a major debt relief
package through the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. Zambia
was among the most heavily indebted countries in Africa before 2005. The low
copper prices and rise in oil prices in the 1970s lay at the origins of the sharp
increase in its debt. By the end of the 1990s, debt payments exceeded expenditures
on human development. Even with exceptional growth, Zambia would have been
unable to repay its debt. Negotiations for HIPC relief started in 2003 and Zambia


                                                                                           1

COUNTRY CONTEXT AND PURPOSE OF THE EVALUATION
achieved the completion point in 2005, securing the second largest volume of debt
relief after Nicaragua. This resulted in the reduction of its debt by 55 percent. At the
same time, Zambia received a 100 percent debt relief from the International
Development Association (IDA) and the International Monetary Fund, as part of the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, as well as from several bilateral donors. As a
result, the external debt-to-GDP ratio fell from 86 percent in 2005 to 9 percent in
2006, creating significant fiscal space for other purposes.

A substantial increase in copper prices beginning in 2004 led to accelerated growth
and increased economic stability, even in the midst of the global financial crisis in
2008-09. Over 2005-12, Zambia’s GDP per capita increased by on average 3.4 percent
annually and reached $1,095 in 2012—compared to 1.8 percent and $382 in the early
2000s. Zambia was among the 10 fastest growing Sub-Saharan African economies in
2012, attaining lower middle-income country status by the end of the period. Annual
inflation rates declined from about 30 percent in 2000 to 7.2 percent in 2011. Investor
confidence has improved considerably, as evidenced by the successful issue of the
$750 million euro bond in 2012. The fiscal deficit declined from 6 percent of GDP in
2004 to 4 percent in 2011. Debt, both internal and external, has been kept at
manageable levels since the HIPC debt relief.

Despite the rapid growth in recent years, Zambia faces significant challenges with
regard to persistent poverty. Poverty incidence, particularly in the rural areas,
remains high. Rural poverty at 74 percent is more than double the level in urban
areas (35 percent). Income distribution is highly unequal, with the Gini coefficient at
0.65 in 2013. The poverty headcount has increased as GDP per capita grew 12
percent, from $1,222 to $1,370 (Figure 1.1). In addition, the urban-rural gap in the
access to and the quality of public services such as safe water, sanitation, nutrition
and primary schooling is stark. Expanding the coverage of infrastructure services
and broad based rural development supported by competitive agriculture—the
largest source of employment in rural areas—is crucial to reducing the gap. Zambia
is also lagging on a number of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), particularly
those related to extreme poverty and maternal and child mortality.

Regarding human development, Zambia was ranked 163 out of 187 countries in the
2012 United Nations Development Programme’s Human Development Index, which
is below the Sub-Saharan Africa average. Adult life expectancy at below 50 years old
lags behind comparator countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Significant progress was
made in primary education enrollment, but improving learning outcomes remains a
challenge: adult literacy rates remain at much lower rates than in neighboring
countries.

In addition, governance and anti-corruption remains a significant issue for Zambia.
While political stability is high, as evidenced in the peaceful transfer of power in the
2011 presidential election, corruption remains a serious issue. The country ranked 83
out of 177 countries in the 2013 Transparency International Corruption Perception
Index. According to the World Bank’s governance indicators, Zambia scores high on
political stability, but only fair on voice and accountability, regulatory quality, and
rule of law. Regarding control of corruption and government effectiveness, Zambia
scores very low. The Zambian Auditor General’s reports have indicated misuse and
misappropriation of public resources. Countries such as Malawi, Rwanda, South
Africa, Tanzania, and Uganda are all ranked higher than Zambia in terms of control
of corruption, and, of these countries, only Malawi is rated worse than Zambia with
regard to government effectiveness.

A crucial challenge for Zambia is its extremely high dependency on natural
resources. As copper exports and foreign direct investment to the mining industry
play a critical role in determining Zambia’s economic trajectory, the country is
highly vulnerable to the effects of copper price volatility, making macroeconomic
and fiscal management extremely challenging. To reduce the impact of copper price
volatility, diversification of the economy away from the mining sector is a high
priority.

The development of nonresource sectors, such as agriculture and infrastructure, is
vital for the benefits from copper-driven growth to be shared with a wider segment
of the population. Agriculture is the primary source of income and employment in
rural areas—areas which have largely been left out of the copper boom. The
strengthening of infrastructure, such as roads and power, and improvement in the

environment for doing business would support economic activities and
entrepreneurship across the country and contribute to broad-based growth. With
strong economic growth in recent years, Zambia is better positioned now than ever
before to make effective investments to advance the diversification agenda.


Country Assistance Strategies, FY04–13
The main focus of the Bank Group country strategies in Zambia in the past decade
has been to align lending and nonlending activities with Zambia’s transition from a
low-income to a lower-middle-income country. Bank assistance during the period of
this evaluation was guided by two country assistance strategies (CASs) for FY04–07
and FY08–11 as well as a country partnership strategy (CPS) for FY13–16. The CASs
for FY04-07 and FY08-12 are the strategies only for IDA. The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) were
not formal participants of the early CASs, but their plans and activities are noted in
both documents. As such, their activities are reviewed within the framework of
Bank Group program trying to achieve outcomes as defined in the CASs during the
evaluation period. The FY13–16 CPS is a joint strategy of IDA, IFC, and MIGA.

The FY04-07 CAS was prepared against a growing realization of the unsustainability
of the policy and institutional frameworks in Zambia. A heavy debt burden, weak
institutional capacity, ineffective spending, and the human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic posed
considerable challenges for poverty reduction efforts. Over the preceding decade,
there had been little progress toward the achievement of the MDGs.

The national policy imperative driving the CAS design was the requirement for
reaching the completion point of the enhanced HIPC Debt initiative. In early 2002,
Zambia finalized and adopted a full Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) that
was aligned with the commitments for a series of measures and reforms to reach the
HIPC completion point. The FY04–07 CAS was designed to align with the PRSP and
the Transitional National Development Plan. The CAS had three strategic priority
areas including: (i) a diversified and export-oriented economy; (ii) improved lives
and protection of the vulnerable; and (iii) an efficiently and effectively managed
public sector. Zambia reached the HIPC completion point in April 2005, resulting in
a significant improvement in the external debt situation.

The FY08–11 CAS emphasized improving the macroeconomic situation, and
strengthening competitiveness and productivity as the core strategy. Support for
improved management of fiscal resources, and investments in infrastructure to

                                           COUNTRY CONTEXT AND PURPOSE OF THE EVALUATION
improve connectivity and integration were expected to serve as the key vehicles for
increased competitiveness. Macroeconomic and expenditure management;
infrastructure development; institutional capacity enhancement; and social sector
development were the key instruments to operationalize these goals.

The key theme of the ongoing CPS (FY13–16) is to support objectives relevant to a
country that displays both low-income and middle-income characteristics. The main
objectives pursued in the CPS include reducing poverty and the vulnerability of the
poor; improving competitiveness and infrastructure for growth and employment;
and improving governance and strengthening economic management.

The review by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) of the CAS Completion
Reports (CASCRs) rated the achievement of outcomes for both CASs as moderately
unsatisfactory. The IEG reviews recognize strong economic growth during the two
CAS periods. However, the reviews emphasize that much of the fast growth was
due to exogenous factors, such as the strong performance of international copper
prices—which did not translate into commensurate poverty reduction, particularly
in the rural areas. The self-assessment of CAS outcomes—the CASCR—for these two
CAS periods calls for simplification of project design, and the effective use of
partnerships to leverage resources. Three lessons from the FY08 CAS period include
the need for greater realism in setting CAS objectives, a sound results framework,
and an incremental approach to addressing policy and institutional issues. The
performance of Bank Group interventions during this period are described in
appendix A.


Coordination with Cooperating Partners
Zambia has a highly structured framework for aid coordination, in which the Bank
Group plays an important role. The Joint Assistance Strategy for Zambia II (2011–
2015) designates the roles of 15 cooperating partners in 17 sectors. Typically, three
lead partners are selected for each sector, subsector or thematic area. They act as the
focal contact points and facilitator for dialogue with the government. Among the
three lead partners, one donor acts as the lead. The Bank has been the leading
partner or part of the troika in a number of sectors in which it is active.1

This framework provides a useful forum for information sharing, but the need to
enhance the value of donor support is growing. This framework has helped
cooperating partners avoid overlapping efforts through regular information sharing.
However, the scope and quality of collaborative work varies across sectors and
themes. An example of substantive collaboration is in the agriculture sector, in



                                                                                          5
CHAPTER 1
COUNTRY CONTEXT AND PURPOSE OF THE EVALUATION
which concerned donors took a unified approach regarding the need to reform
government policy on agricultural subsidies and emergency reserves. However,
opportunities for candid discussion to enhance the quality of each partner’s
interventions appear to be rare. Increasing the value-add of support is a key
challenge for traditional donors, including IDA, as Zambia quickly moves away
from reliance on external development assistance (Figure 1.2). Economic growth, the
emergence of new donors, and growing opportunities to tap into the international
financial markets have all led to decreased reliance on traditional donors.

Evaluation Objectives and Report Structure
This country program evaluation (CPE) evaluates World Bank Group operations in
Zambia from FY04 through FY13. The Bank Group covers IDA or the Bank, the
International Finance Corporation, and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee
Agency. The period reviewed was covered by two completed country strategies, one
for FY04–07 and the other for FY08–11, as well as part of the ongoing Country
Partnership Strategy FY13–16 (see appendix B for methodology).

This report is part of the cluster CPE for natural resource-rich developing countries
that covers Bolivia, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia in addition to Zambia. The CPEs in
this clustered report assess whether the Bank Group assistance supported relevant
objectives; the extent to which these objectives were achieved effectively and
efficiently; and the institutional development impact and sustainability of the Bank

Group's interventions. It will also make recommendations for future Bank Group
programs in the four countries reviewed based on lessons of experience.

To maintain consistency across the analyses for four countries, each CPE follows a
similar organizing framework. This is based on a set of challenges that arise from
high dependency on natural resources. These areas are consistent with Zambia’s
core development challenges, as indicated above. The common set of challenges that
guide this Clustered CPE are indicated below. In addition, each CPE reviews Bank
Group operations in the two cross-cutting themes of gender and environment, as
incorporated in the country program.

       Maintaining macroeconomic and fiscal stabilities;
       Improving governance and institutions for the effective use of resources;
       Enhancing economic diversification and growth in nonresource sectors; and
       Promoting human capital development and poverty reduction.

This report has seven chapters including this introductory chapter. Chapter 2
summarizes the Bank Group strategies and examines trends and patterns related to
its operations in Zambia during the evaluation period. Chapters 3 to 6 assess the
relevance and effectiveness of these operations for the four themes described above.
The concluding chapter draws lessons and recommendations for the Bank Group’s
future engagement in Zambia.


1The Bank is a leading partner in six areas of the Joint Assistance Strategy for Zambia II.
These areas include energy, transport, water and sanitation, tourism, environment and
natural resources, and macroeconomics. Active partners delegate “voice” to the lead
partners, but remain involved in discussion. Background partners have delegated full
authority to lead (or active) partners, including sector dialogue and their funding in the
sector.

2. Maintaining Macroeconomic and Fiscal
Stability
For purposes of comparative analysis of these resource-rich countries, Pillar 1 covers
activities related to addressing risks to macroeconomic and fiscal sustainability
posed by short-term volatility and medium-term cycle of natural resource prices. It
covers the link between intergenerational sustainability of the resources, savings and
investment, and fiscal sustainability, including management of price volatility risk.
A second level of issues includes the composition of spending and ways to transfer
the resource revenues to the private economy; and securing a sustainable extraction
rate for the country’s natural resource by adopting a supportive regulatory regime,
an incentive framework, and relevant tax policies and administration. Not all of
these issues are relevant to the particular countries, so coverage is partial in each
case.

During the 1990s and until the privatization of the copper mines in 2000, the mineral
sector was a drain rather than a contributory factor for Zambia’s fiscal resources.
This was a function of low copper prices, low productivity in the mines due to weak
management, the lack of investment on maintenance and rehabilitation, and the
costs borne directly by the mines for social services provided to the miners and their
families. Privatization and the subsequent rise in copper prices reversed this trend,
but the contracts entered into with the new private owners to induce them to take
over the mines meant that only a very small share of the profits went to the
Treasury. Thus for much of the period, many of the questions related to the use of
resource revenues had little relevance. Instead, the key question asked was whether
the Bank could have done more to assist the government in maximizing revenues
from the mineral sector.

Starting in 2010, the impact of mineral revenues became more substantial. New
mines came on-stream under arrangements that were more favorable from a fiscal
perspective. The privatized mines were no longer able to take advantage of
provisions such as the carry forward of losses, given the sustained profitability of
their operations. In particular, the government was able to borrow on favorable
terms on the basis of future copper revenues. As a consequence, in more recent
years, questions relating to the role of the Bank in helping Zambia to manage these
resources in a fiscally sustainable way have become more relevant.

Context
Rising copper prices, output and exploration in Zambia have enabled high rates of
economic growth in recent years (Figure 2.1), outperforming most other resource-
rich and Sub-Saharan African countries. Natural resources were responsible for
most of the economic growth in Zambia, with their share in gross domestic product
(GDP) rising from 4 percent to 27 percent over the period of 2000–2011. High copper
prices in the recent decade have attracted substantial foreign direct investment (FDI)
to the mining industry, which has driven much of the growth in GDP and exports.
Compared to the average 6.7 percent share of FDI in GDP of resource-rich countries,
Zambia attracted 7.9 percent of GDP over the period of 2005–2011. Other sectors
such as financial institutions, trade, real estate activities and communication also
experienced an inflow of FDI.

Zambia began the period under review (2004–2014) with the most promising fiscal
situation in decades. First, the privatization of the mines and some of the other state-
owned enterprises had the potential to stop the persistent hemorrhage of resources
in the form of operating subsidies. Second, steps were under way with support from
the Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) to deal with the arrears of the
utilities and pension system. Third, the country was moving slowly but steadily
toward the Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative completion point which,
given the high levels of external debt, would provide the fiscal space for much-
needed public investment and expansion of social programs.

However, the development benefits of the growing mining sector remain relatively
low. The major channels through which the mineral sector can contribute to

CHAPTER 2
MAINTAINING MACROECONOMIC AND FISCAL STABILITIES
inclusive growth and poverty reduction are job creation, economic spillovers, and
public revenues from extraction, which can then be invested in sustainable
development. However, Zambia’s mining sector employs just 1.3 percent of the
labor force nationwide. Economic spillovers from mining are minimal, given the
nature of production which is primarily exported as smelted copper, though with
increasing exports of copper cables to South Africa in recent years. Mining taxes
accounted for less than 2 percent of GDP, and 8 percent of total tax revenues in
2009–2010—far below international standards. While worldwide resource taxes tend
to be about 25-40 percent of exports for major resource-rich developing countries,
they amount to only 3–5 percent in Zambia.


 Box 2.1. Why are Zambia’s Mineral Tax Revenues So Low?
 The contracts with the private mining companies negotiated at the end of a very long
 cycle of declining copper prices allowed, among other things, 100 percent tax write-offs
 for investments and carry forward of losses. Regular corporate profit rates were applied
 to the balance. Net mineral revenues were actually even lower, if one factors in the low
 negotiated price at which electricity is supplied to the mines. All this was embodied in a
 stability contract that did not allow for any changes for 15 years. Since the government
 reversal of the proposed unilateral rate changes of 2008–2009, the Bank and the
 International Monetary Fund have focused their support on helping the Zambian
 government collect more tax under the existing rules. In the past two years, the Bank,
 together with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, have been
 providing support to the Zambian Revenue Authority to build capacity on international
 transfer pricing issues.


Low mineral tax ratios are the result of the Development Agreements signed during
privatization. When the government entered into negotiation to privatize the copper
sector between 1997 and 2000, the outlook for copper prices was extremely bleak.
Given that the copper sector was the major source of fiscal deficit, the government
had to agree to a generous package of incentives in order to reach a deal (see box 2.1
and appendix D). The mines were subject to the regular Zambian profit tax, but
there was no variable tax based on the size of earnings, nor a windfall profits tax as
is common with mining contracts. As a result, when copper prices rose steadily after
2004—against expectations—there was no commensurate increase in the Zambian
government’s revenues. During the period of the privatization negotiations, the
Bank and the International Finance Corporation provided a financial adviser to
assist the government in the negotiations, but there was no fiscal advice provided.

The government’s decision at the time to proceed with the privatization even with a
generous package for investors can be justified, given the economic and fiscal status

                                          MAINTAINING MACROECONOMIC AND FISCAL STABILITIES
of the Zambian economy and the widely shared expectation that low copper prices
would continue for some time. However, with the benefit of hindsight, this
experience highlights the importance of ensuring that the country obtains support
from high quality expertise in various areas in addition to financial analysis—for
example in taxation arrangements and fiscal regimes—at the negotiation stage of
mineral contracts/privatization.

The Zambian government attempted to modify the Development Agreements by
adopting new tax regulations in 2008 and 2009. These changes would have followed
international practices and increased the effective tax rate to 47 percent of pre-tax
profit (World Bank 2011c). Following resistance from the mining companies, these
regulations were withdrawn for existing mines, though their application to new
mines has produced a modest increase in tax revenues.

With a peaceful political transition and the increase in copper revenues starting in
2011, Zambia was able to secure international market financing on favorable terms.
Government revenues from copper averaged around 5 percent of GDP between 2011
and 2013. The strong copper prices combined with a generally positive perception of
the country’s steady growth and political stability after the peaceful transition of
power in the 2011 elections, allowed Zambia to raise $750 million in the market at a
rate of 5.375 percent in September 2012.1 These trends allowed for resources to be
channeled into increased capital expenditures (up from 3 to 4 percent in 2009-11 to 6
to 7 percent of GDP in 2012 and 2013).

However, recent government decisions demonstrate that macro-stability remains a
significant risk. There were positive fiscal steps taken in reducing subsidies on fuel,
fertilizer and maize in 2012 and 2013. However, this was more than offset by the
decision to increase government salaries by 45 percent, with the increase skewed
toward the lower salary levels.2 In the short run, this has raised the budget deficit
from around 3 percent of GDP to around 7 percent. Although there is a commitment
on the part of the responsible officials to bring this down steadily over time to the 3
percent level, the situation remains vulnerable to political considerations.
Meanwhile, a new $1 billion market borrowing in April 2014 required a much
higher interest rate of 8.625 percent, reflecting both less market willingness to take
on emerging market debt and the deterioration of Zambia’s own fiscal situation.
While the annual interest burden remains reasonable, Zambia has to make a
repayment of $750 million in 2022, and $1 billion in 2024. Substantial new public
infrastructure investment is taking place, but the procedures for preparation,
appraisal and management of investment projects have been questioned by various
World Bank analyses.

Bank Strategy
From active support for better macroeconomic and fiscal management at the start of
the review period, the Bank has gradually phased down its strategic focus. This can
be seen in Table 2.1 (see table E.1 in appendix E for more detail).

        The Bank strategy in the macroeconomic area during the FY04-07 period was
         broad. It aimed at assisting the government in managing its resources more
         efficiently and effectively, and in particular at reducing domestic borrowing
         and government arrears. The targeted outcomes were as follows:
        Reduced domestic borrowing requirements from 3 percent of GDP in 2003 to
         less than 1 percent annually. This was substantially achieved. Domestic
         borrowing was reduced from 3 percent to 1.3 percent in 2007.
        Reduced arrears of the government, including parastatals, from 2 percent of
         GDP in 2003 to zero. Government arrears only declined from 2 percent to 1.7
         percent and the resolution of state-owned enterprises was only partially
         accomplished.
        Credible and predictable budget preparation and execution. There were
         partial improvements here, most notably the preparation of the Medium-
         Term Expenditure Framework and a move to Activity-Based Budgeting.
        Resolution of state-owned financial institutions. The Bank provided
         assistance in close collaboration with the IMF in supporting the proposed
         privatization of the remaining state-owned financial institutions. This was
         only partially achieved. The government proved unwilling to privatize the
         largest state bank, the Zambia National Commercial Bank and since this had
         been a trigger for HIPC completion, the Bank and the IMF agreed to a waiver.

                                           MAINTAINING MACROECONOMIC AND FISCAL STABILITIES
The Bank strategy in the macroeconomic area during the FY08–12 period was to
participate in the multi-donor effort. The Bank was part of the multi-donor group
that provided budget support to Zambia. The size of the Bank’s contribution to
budget support was small. The country partnership strategy (CPS) acknowledged
that it would be impossible to attribute macro-stability to the Bank’s contribution.
The Bank’s objectives in the macro-area were defined as broad topics. There was one
rather specific indicator defined within each topic, but no obvious results chain runs
from the indicator to the topic. The broad topics included:

      Macro-stability. The Bank proposed to support the government in putting
       into place guidelines for the use of additional resource flows from mining.
       The Bank’s particular focus was on the creation of a sovereign wealth fund
       that could have been used in the event that there was a substantial increase in
       tax revenues from mining. This reflects the government’s intention at the time
       to put in place a windfall profit tax and unilaterally abrogate the stability
       agreements with the mines. As noted, this was subsequently reversed by the
       government, so that revenues from mining expanded only modestly. In the
       meantime, the Bank supported training and study tours for Zambian officials
       to countries where such sovereign funds were in operation. (The Country
       Partnership Strategy Completion Report uses the provision of this training to
       justify a “partially achieved” rating for this indicator).
      Public expenditure allocation. The indicator was defined as real increases
       from 2007 levels in the allocations to pro-poor sectors, including agriculture,
       tourism and rural infrastructure. In the Country Assistance Strategy
       Completion Report (CASCR), this is defined not just as a real increase in
       amounts, but in each sector as a share of GDP. In practice, there was a
       reduction for tourism, a virtually unchanged share for agriculture, and a very
       large increase for infrastructure. The CASCR, does not separate rural
       infrastructure from the total, so it is unclear to what extent this met the
       criterion. It is also difficult to define public agricultural investment in Zambia
       as pro-poor, as the focus of this investment was support for medium- and
       large-scale commercial farming. The “fully achieved” rating in the CASCR is
       generous based on available information.
      Better fiscal reporting. The indicator is defined as the inclusion in the budget
       of information on donor funding and the expenditures of quasi-fiscal
       institutions, such as the Bank of Zambia, the pension fund, and state-owned
       enterprises. Here, there seems to have been genuine forward movement
       supported by the Bank’s credit for a public sector management project.

The Bank strategy did not define any macroeconomic and fiscal objectives during
the FY13–16 period. This seems to reflect the Bank’s projection that current


                                                                                        13
CHAPTER 2
MAINTAINING MACROECONOMIC AND FISCAL STABILITIES
expenditures would remain fairly stable as a percentage of GDP, while the growth
in mineral revenues would be used mainly for increasing capital investment along
with the $750 million that Zambia had raised in the international capital market at
the time. The focus was therefore not so much on the overall availability of
resources, but on the capacity to use these resources efficiently. The CPS emphasized
efficiency of resource use and increased allocations to pro-poor sectors to address
the slow pace of poverty reduction. As it turned out, current expenditures did not
remain stable after the President decided to increase government salaries by an
average of 45 percent.


The Bank Program
Bank support for macro-fiscal management was designed to assist the government
in reducing its budget deficit to modest levels consistent with growth and
sustainable levels of debt. The Bank worked closely with the Fund in this area. The
instruments used by the Bank were, first, a series of budget support operations, and,
second, an intensive program of analytic work. In the earlier years of the review
period, reforms were supported under the Economic Management and Growth
Credit (FY05) and Second Economic Management and Growth Credit (SEMGC,
FY08) projects. The first of these was intended to support HIPC completion. After
the achievement of HIPC, the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) was
implemented, which left the International Development Association with very
limited resources for new funding and resulted in a token amount of support in the
SEMGC credit. This credit was intended to consolidate the steps undertaken as part
of the HIPC and MDRI agreements.

The Bank’s objectives were to support the attainment of broad macroeconomic
stability in large part through reducing arrears and improving the financial viability
of the utilities and the pension system. These objectives were substantially achieved.
The major areas of achievements are as follows.

        The government maintained a satisfactory macroeconomic framework in
         agreement with the IMF.
        The Cabinet issued a decision to empower utilities and insurance companies
         to treat government institutions as any other client.
        The government made arrangements with each of the relevant utility and
         insurance companies to eliminate the stock of arrears over time.
        The Accountant General instructed accounting officers to pay their utility and
         insurance bills on time.

                                         MAINTAINING MACROECONOMIC AND FISCAL STABILITIES
      The Ministry of Finance and National Planning adopted a restructuring plan
       for payment of the government’s arrears to the utility and insurance
       companies.

As a result of these measures, domestic borrowing declined to 1.9 percent of GDP,
and the government arrears were reduced to 1.2 percent of GDP at the end of 2005
(World Bank 2006). In the area of pensions, a series of measures were undertaken
that substantially restructured the system and partially enhanced its financial
viability, though follow up measures were still required in the subsequent budget
support operations.3

In 2009, there was a shift to multi-donor support for fiscal and governance
objectives, and the Bank sought to play a leading role in providing this support. The
Bank provided three Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) for Zambia in
2010, 2011 and 2012 as part of the program of multi-donor budget support. There
were issues regarding the positioning of these PRSCs in relation to the Performance
Assessment Framework (PAF), jointly agreed to between the government and the
Poverty Reduction Budget Support cooperating partners. The 33 PAF indicators
were a subset of the monitoring and evaluation framework of the government’s
Fifth National Development Plan. The large number of indicators reflected the
interests of individual donors in providing additional leverage in the specific areas
of their support to Zambia. While the PAF served as a basis for dialogue among
development partners, it also included areas pertaining to weak government
ownership.

This multi-donor effort appears to have had limited impact in supporting fiscal
stability objectives. The absence of a focused program with a limited number of
indicators appears to have contributed to this lack of progress. The government
score for the number of PAF indicators achieved has declined steadily since 2005.
The large number of indicators was a source of considerable frustration to the Bank,
which wanted the PAF to focus on a few key indicators. In 2009, when the PAF was
finally consolidated down to 19 indicators (and later to 14), a disconnect emerged
between the triggers agreed between the Bank and the government for the PRSCs,
and the list included in the donor- supported PAF. The Bank was determined,
however, to include indicators relating to operations of the Zambia Electric Supply
Corporation (ZESCO), including cost recovery issues that were of lesser interest to
other donors. The Implementation Completion and Results Report attributes this
disconnect in part to a lack of continuity in Bank staffing during the review period.
The weak record of the PRSCs, as well as the availability of more revenues from
mining, and funding from the market, has raised serious questions concerning the
role of donor budget support in the future.4

CHAPTER 2
MAINTAINING MACROECONOMIC AND FISCAL STABILITIES
In recent years, the Bank appears to have made a significant contribution to the
reduction of inefficient public expenditures. The Bank has focused on the need to
increase the economic viability of ZESCO and to reduce the subsidies for fuel, maize
and fertilizer, which were seen as having a limited impact on productivity and
adverse distributional effects. The maize subsidy had the effect of shifting resources
away from other, potentially more profitable, crops. The Bank’s policy dialogue and
investment lending appear to have contributed to the significant increase in
electricity tariffs between 2009 and 2011, which enabled ZESCO to realize an
operating profit. In addition, the steady analysis and dissemination by the Bank on
such topics as the adverse distributional impacts of subsidies on energy, fertilizer
and maize, and the potential for increasing mining revenues, among others, has
clearly helped contribute to a broad understanding of these issues (see appendix C
for the list of analytic and advisory activities during the period). In addition, it
probably had a role in recent subsidy reforms.

There is stronger interest in the Bank’s analytic work than had appeared from earlier
assessments. An assessment carried out by the Bank in 2004 found very little impact
from the Bank’s sizeable investment in economic and sector work. There was a
general lack of interest on the part of government officials. In this evaluation, the
Independent Evaluation Group found a significant change in this regard. Indeed,
there was a general appreciation of the quality and value of Bank analytic work,
particularly among middle-level government officials.

A series of policy notes produced for the new administration in 2011 provided in-
depth analysis of several important topics.5 These included a study on revenues
from mining and a political economy analysis that, among other things, warned
against industrial policy approaches to diversification and repeating the experience
of creating parastatals in the 1970s and 80s. The note on enhancing the quality of
public investment in Zambia laid out a set of requirements for efficient public
investment, which could well be an important basis for future Bank support in this
area.

A new series of semiannual Country Economic Briefs is a very useful innovation.
Along with the IMF Article IV consultation document, this has become the
instrument of choice to which officials, academics and Zambia’s growing group of
think-tanks and civil society organizations turn to obtain objective analysis of the
current economic situation. The special topics taken up in each brief, such as
employment, also provide a useful instrument for disseminating Bank analytic
work.

                                        MAINTAINING MACROECONOMIC AND FISCAL STABILITIES

Assessment and Lessons
The Bank and the IMF successfully exploited the leverage provided by the HIPC and
MDRI to help the government make progress on privatization and fiscal
management, laying the foundation for fiscal sustainability. The reductions in debt
servicing through the HIPC and MDRI agreements created substantial fiscal space
and allowed the government to increase support for infrastructure in particular. The
successful mining privatization combined with surging copper prices set the stage
for new investment and the most prolonged period of growth since the 1970s. Given
the vested interests and political risks, it would have been very difficult for the
government to achieve this without the involvement of the Bank and the IMF, as
well as the impetus provided by HIPC completion. This combination of actions,
which set the stage for subsequent growth, is a significant achievement of the Bank
and IMF in their engagement with Zambia.

Subsequent to HIPC completion and MDRI, the Bank shifted the main focus of its
program away from fiscal sustainability issues. This seemed an appropriate
response at the particular historical moment at which the FY08–11 Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) was prepared. The key structural problems appeared to
have been dealt with, and the ongoing responsibility for fiscal stability and
sustainability rested mainly with the IMF and the multi-donor budget support
dialogue. The Bank’s comparative advantage lay in improved public sector
management and supporting pro-poor expenditures and investments. The
performance in these areas is assessed in the other pillars of the evaluation.

Could the Bank have done more to help the government increase its revenues from
the mining sector? In a country like Zambia, given the high poverty levels and poor
state of economic infrastructure, there is huge pressure on the government to
expand social expenditures and infrastructure investments. Increasing copper prices
have led to higher GDP per capita. As a consequence, some donors are withdrawing
from Zambia, thereby resulting in stagnant or declining official development
assistance. It is understandable that this combination of events would lead the
government to try to renegotiate its agreements with the copper mines. The Bank
had two options during the first part of the review period: first, to support the
renegotiation of the mining contracts or, second, to support the Zambians in
maximizing revenue collection within the limits of the existing contracts.

The Bank had a difficult time developing an agreed approach on whether to support
a unilateral change in privatization contracts to increase the government’s revenue
share. The Bank shares some responsibility for the contracts negotiated with the
privatized mines. These contracts did not include a provision for capturing windfall


                                                                                     17
CHAPTER 2
MAINTAINING MACROECONOMIC AND FISCAL STABILITIES
profits in the event of a rise in copper prices. The focus was on stopping the outflow
of government resources to the mines and the upside potential was not looked at
closely. Subsequently when the government introduced new legislation to abrogate
the agreements with the mining companies in 2008, the Bank found itself in a very
difficult situation. On the one hand, the change was clearly to the advantage of the
Zambian fiscal outlook. On the other hand, the credibility of the Zambian
government in promoting FDI and a positive investment climate could be damaged
by such unilateral action. There were strong sentiments on both sides of this issue in
the Bank.

However, the Bank could have done more to support enhanced revenue generation
within the existing agreements. While, on balance, the evaluation team is
sympathetic to the general constraints which the Bank faced in this area, in our view
it could have made an earlier start on the agenda which is now being undertaken to
strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Finance to analyze the company accounts
and identify transfer pricing and inappropriate use of write-offs and depreciation
allowances. This could have been done much earlier as a matter of urgency.

Should the Bank have done more to help the government increase its revenues from
the mining sector? The answer to this question rests on whether additional resources
would have been used efficiently. Those who argue against putting additional
resources in the government’s hands point to the use of the resources borrowed
from the capital market on projects that were often poorly appraised and seem
politically motivated, or in contributing to a possible bubble of construction projects
in the main towns. It is difficult to argue that additional tax revenue would have
found its way into worthwhile and productive public expenditure and investments.
On the other hand, it can be argued that leaving these resources in the hands of the
mining companies meant that a large portion of resource revenues were lost to the
Zambian economy, given the limited spillover of mineral earnings. On balance, this
evaluation is of the view that the Bank should support honest and efficient tax
collection provided that tax rates are set at levels that are appropriate for the
continuing development of the private sector, regardless of its views on the
appropriateness of expenditures. The efficiency of expenditures needs to be
addressed simultaneously of course, but it should not be used as an argument
against efficient resource mobilization.

Both the relevance and the effectiveness of the Bank’s contribution to outcomes in
Pillar 1 are rated moderately satisfactory. The Bank’s focus in supporting fiscal
stability has been in such areas as the closure or sale of loss-making public
enterprises, reducing arrears to the pension system, raising inadequate levels of



18
                                                                                CHAPTER 2
                                           MAINTAINING MACROECONOMIC AND FISCAL STABILITIES
electricity tariffs, and reducing inefficient and regressive subsidies for fuel, maize,
and fertilizer. There has been considerable success in all these areas.

Bank support in Pillar 1 areas has employed a wide variety of instruments including
HIPC and MDRI completion, investment and policy loans, and strong analytic work.
Subsequent to the initial impact of HIPC completion, there was a steady
improvement in the overall fiscal balance between 2005 and 2012. The continuing
dialogue between the government, the Bank, the IMF and the donor community,
undoubtedly contributed toward this stability. However, the specific outcomes
supported by the first two CASs were only partially achieved, as the government
moved much more slowly to deal with the problems of arrears and subsidies that
were the primary focus of Bank support. The misalignment toward the end of the
series of budget support operations between the Bank PRSC and the donor PAF also
raises questions about the adequacy of the Bank’s contribution. The substantial
increase in government salaries in 2013, combined with the failure to utilize the
amounts borrowed on the international capital market efficiently, seriously undercut
the achievements of the preceding part of the review period.

Given the sharp deterioration of the fiscal balance in 2013, the Bank may need to
revisit its decision in the context of the CPS to reduce its strategic focus on the
macro-fiscal area. Fiscal instability is emerging as perhaps the most serious risk
facing Zambia. The size of the budget deficit combined with the new build-up of
debt means that the economy has little or no capacity to weather a potential
downturn in copper production or prices. The Bank has attempted to expose
ministers, members of parliament, and key officials, to good practices in
management of natural resources, such as the case of Chile, through exchange visits
and study tours. The Bank has limited leverage through its lending at present to
help the Zambian government put a fiscal stability framework back in place. In these
circumstances, the Bank would need to undertake a major program of analytic work
that would clarify the implications of the steps they have taken. This would require
risk and sensitivity analysis based on various price scenarios, and international
comparisons of Zambia’s performance relative to comparators, and effective
dissemination of this analysis. It is only when the Zambian leadership becomes
aware that they will suffer disproportionately from the impact of an economic
downturn, that they are likely to support the measures needed to restore longer-
term stability.

The key lessons that emerge from the Bank’s support for Pillar 1 in Zambia are the
following:




                                                                                          19
CHAPTER 2
MAINTAINING MACROECONOMIC AND FISCAL STABILITIES
         The importance of ensuring that the country has the right expertise available
          at the negotiation stage of mineral contracts/privatization. The failure to look
          at other fiscal regimes and obtain expertise on appropriate taxation
          arrangements has had major consequences for Zambia.
         The need for institution building for the National Revenue Authority early in
          the cycle. Transfer pricing is a fact of life in large multinational corporations
          and the tax authorities need to be able to identify this.
         Within fifty years since its independence, Zambia experienced a gradual
          deterioration from a prosperous and resource-endowed country to a highly-
          indebted poor country; and then a quick rise to a lower-middle-income
          country. This experience demonstrates the importance of maintaining sound
          macroeconomic and fiscal management in the face of unpredictable cycles of
          boom and bust in the commodity markets. In this context, adopting some
          form of fiscal rules or agreed mechanisms for sustained monitoring of key
          indicators should be considered.
         Budget support cannot be a matter of democratically reflecting the interests of
          all donors. Support needs to be focused on the key policy issues over time.
          An inter-agency working group with representation from the four or five
          largest contributors should select and define a limited set of triggers for
          budget support for discussion with the government.
         The Zambian economy remains vulnerable to a downturn in the world
          copper price. There are major new copper mines coming on-stream such as
          Oyu Tolgoi in Mongolia. The government needs to take into consideration the
          appropriate policy response to a potential downturn in copper prices. In this
          context, there is a strong case for the Bank to undertake jointly with the
          Ministry of Finance a risk and contingency analysis of the macro-situation to
          analyze various alternative copper price and output scenarios.

1   The issue was substantially over-subscribed.

3In November of 2005, the Cabinet approved reform proposals of the Public Sector Pension
Fund (PSPF), including amending the constitution to allow PSPF to undertake reforms in
order to achieve and remain on a sound financial footing. The PSPF completed a draft three-
year implementation plan to reduce administrative expenses, and negotiated a plan with the
government to retire a small percentage of its arrears. The Local Authorities Superannuation
Fund (LASF) strengthened its financial position through retiring arrears, completed its first
actuarial valuation since 1998, collected data for analysis of various policy reform options,
and negotiated a debt/equity swap to retire a part of its central government arrears. The
National Pension Scheme Authority (NAPSA) drafted an operation manual on its corporate
governance. A revised investment policy was also adopted in 2005 by NAPSA’s Board that

                                                                                  CHAPTER 2
                                             MAINTAINING MACROECONOMIC AND FISCAL STABILITIES


allowed NAPSA to invest in assets externally. Only the PSFP remains active in providing
new pension coverage.
4 While budget support continues, some donors such as the Netherlands and Denmark are
withdrawing from Zambia as a result of its attaining lower-middle-income country status.
Other donors who remain active are moving their entire aid programs away from budget
support (the European Union and the UK). In an environment where the government has
substantially increased available resources, the leverage of budget support (which is now
less than 2 percent of the total budget) for promoting an effective policy dialogue, has
declined.
5These notes drew on an important Public Expenditure Review (PER) prepared a year or
two earlier, which was not published. This study was produced in draft just prior to the
elections and was not subsequently disclosed. It is critical of public sector management, but
provides very clear analysis of the issues. While it is true that the dissemination of the PER
in draft means that many of the Bank’s interlocutors are well aware of the existence of the
document and what it says, the failure to publish it comes at a cost to those who do not have
access to these analyses, including Zambia’s nascent think-tanks and academia.

3. Improving Governance and Institutions for
the Effective Use of Resources
Pillar 2 covers public financial management from the standpoint of the efficient and
effective use of the resources generated both from mineral taxation and other
sources. Specific issues and questions covered in this section include:

        Efficiency of the country’s public financial management institutions and
         arrangements, including: (i) institutions to support efficient spending at the
         project level (such as procedures for project evaluation and selection); and (ii)
         accountability elements of the public financial management (PFM) system,
         that is, institutions and practices to support the monitoring, reporting, audit,
         and evaluation of public spending at the macro, sectoral and project levels.
        Strengthening accountability of the public sector in the midst of an increased flow
         of income from natural resources. Mineral resource revenues are much less
         subject to public debate and scrutiny than other forms of taxation, and
         therefore more susceptible to misuse. This makes traditional public sector
         reforms a major priority for these countries, including: (i) strengthening the
         system of checks and balances (for example, judiciary reforms, accountability
         of parliament); (ii) civil service reforms to improve incentives and attract
         higher quality people; (iii) laws and regulations regarding the availability of
         public information; and (iv) strengthening the demand for good governance,
         which may be weak in view of the perceived windfall nature of resource
         revenues.

As explained in the previous section, in the case of Zambia, mineral revenues and
foreign borrowing have resulted in increased resources for the government only in
the latter part of the review period. During the earlier period, resources were rarely
sufficient to go much beyond government salaries, basic administration and
maintenance expenditures—and were often inadequate to cover the last of these.
Most investment was financed through donor-supported projects. In this situation,
there is a risk that too little attention will be paid to the quality of expenditure and
investment processes and management, as well as the need to build up a portfolio of
efficient investment projects that can be funded when mineral resources come on-
stream.

In the Zambian context, therefore, the questions relate not only to the effectiveness
of the support provided in these areas, but also to their timeliness. In the latter
period when these issues emerged as high priority for Zambia in the context of the


22
                                                                                  CHAPTER 3
                      IMPROVING GOVERNANCE AND INSTITUTIONS FOR EFFECTIVE USE OF RESOURCES
increased availability of resources associated with mining, a key question would be
whether the Bank assign sufficient priority in its program to ‘traditional public
sector reforms.”


Context
At the start of the review period, public financial management in Zambia was
inefficient and ineffective. A World Bank assessment found that the government
faced considerable problems in ensuring sound public financial management and
accountability, which are prerequisites for higher growth and improved service
delivery to the poor and the private sector (World Bank 2003a). A report issued in
2004 (World Bank 2004b) characterized the key problems in Zambia’s public
expenditure management and accountability as follows:

      Spending rules and regulations are not enforced. The Ministry of Finance has
       not held officers who misspent public funds accountable.
      The budget is ineffective and unrealistic. Spending occurs before it is
       approved by parliament. Huge deviations occur between budget approved
       and actual expenditures.
      Supplementary appropriations are large.
      Public procurement is wasteful and inefficient. One estimate suggests that the
       government could save as much as $50 million a year by implementing good
       practice procurement rules and regulations.
      Budget management is not transparent. Reports are produced late and not
       disseminated widely.
      Audit systems are not effective, and findings of audit reports are not
       adequately followed up on.
      Institutions for accountability and oversight (the Office of the Auditor
       General, the Estimates Committee of Parliament) are weak and lack the
       resources to carry out their functions.

This section looks at the extent to which the government—with the support of
donors, including the Bank—has succeeded in improving the quality of public sector
financial management. It also examines the extent to which it continues to constrain
effective public investment and poverty reduction.

An intensive effort at public sector reform began at the end of the 1990s: a Multi-
Donor Trust Fund with the Bank as lead donor supported the Public Expenditure
Management and Financial Accountability (PEMFA) program. Almost every part of
Zambia’s public financial management system from broad plan and budget



                                                                                        23
CHAPTER 3
IMPROVING GOVERNANCE AND INSTITUTIONS FOR EFFECTIVE USE OF RESOURCES
formulation to district-level procurement decisions have benefited from this
support. There has been extensive training, provision of technical assistance, and
study tours, among other things. This has resulted in a cadre of articulate and
knowledgeable civil servants who appear to have the capacity to manage public
services effectively and efficiently, but who are operating in a system in which there
are very limited incentives and accountability for doing so. The three core areas of
reforming governance and public sector management supported by the PEMFA
have been Civil Service Reform, Public Financial Management, and
Decentralization.

On civil service reform, efforts have been made to put in place the basic personnel
systems and to begin to reform wages. The objective was to allow key staff to be
attracted, retained, and motivated to provide quality services, while continuing to
right size and restructure the public service. While considerable capacity building
through training took place in the early 2000s and systems were enhanced, policy
reforms-such as public sector rightsizing and pay reform have not been
accomplished.

As for public expenditure management reform, the period under review has seen
genuine progress. This included the strengthening of the Office of the Auditor
General and the oversight role of the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament; and
building capacity of the Anti-Corruption Commission, the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative (EITI), and the oversight role of the Zambia Public
Procurement Agency. In addition, a payroll system has been put in place and
reportedly has resulted in removing some ghost workers from the payroll. However,
the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) is not yet fully
operational after a decade of implementation efforts. A Medium-Term Expenditure
Framework (MTEF) has been prepared, but is poorly integrated with either the five-
year plans or the annual budget.

Despite frequent public pronouncements regarding decentralization, Zambia has not
so far undertaken any serious effort to move authority to the local level. There has
been an impressive build-up of capacity at the local level, but officials have very
little authority and even the most minor decisions are taken in Lusaka (see box 3.1).

                         IMPROVING GOVERNANCE AND INSTITUTIONS FOR EFFECTIVE USE OF RESOURCES

 Box 3.1. Why Hasn’t Zambia Decentralized?
 Zambia is divided into 11 provinces and more than 100 districts. The provinces are simply
 administrative structures with the central ministries deploying staff in the provincial
 offices to supervise their regional activities. The districts are genuine local governments
 with elected District Councils that meet and approve budgets, and with staff reporting
 directly to the Councils.
 However, the government has not been willing to devolve any serious authority to the
 Councils. Their roads departments, for example, can fill potholes but they cannot decide
 on resurfacing a small stretch of a local road without reference to Lusaka. The evaluation
 asked each of the senior officials of Kitwe district council what their titles were. Eighty
 percent turned out to be “acting” because only the central government can confirm them
 in their positions and they have been waiting for decisions, sometimes for years, while
 continuing to perform the functions. When asked what his or her most important problem
 was, almost everyone responded that it was a lack of authority.
 Officials from the Ministry of Local Government claim that there is a serious program for
 decentralization. They informed the evaluation team that responsibility for primary
 education, maternal and child health, and agriculture would be moved to the district
 level. No one elsewhere in the government confirmed this. There is some willingness to
 increase the number of officials at the provincial level, but with no attendant increase in
 their authority. Meanwhile, the government continues to expand the number of local
 authorities, which is popular since it brings budgets and jobs to the local level. It is
 difficult to interpret the lack of genuine progress on decentralization except in terms of
 the desire of the Lusaka-based civil servants and elite to retain control over local decision
 making and procurement.


Achievements over the review period have been modest relative to both the needs
and to the substantial support provided to Zambia in this area. In the words of a
donor representative with close involvement in the support program, “In public
financial reform, Zambia has flown under the radar—you never get too worried or
too excited—it is never a disaster, but at the same time the government never takes
on transformational reforms. During the past 10 years, other countries have caught
up with Zambia and moved faster.” With the substantial increase in the availability
of discretionary resources for the government in recent years through mining
revenues and market borrowing, this failure to move more effectively on reforming
public financial management represents a very high risk for Zambia in the future.

Zambia has the capacity and institutions to remedy its under-achievement in control
of corruption. Some evidence suggests that corruption may disproportionately
impact the poor. According to surveys conducted in 2003 by the University of
Zambia, citizens in the lowest income deciles have had to pay bribes that represent a
higher share of their income than their counterparts in the middle- and high-income


                                                                                                 25

IMPROVING GOVERNANCE AND INSTITUTIONS FOR EFFECTIVE USE OF RESOURCES
brackets (Ianchovichina and Lundstrom 2009). There have been some effective steps
taken to address the issues arising from corruption. If the remaining missing
elements of the puzzle such as the IFMIS, the Freedom of Information bill, and more
effective press and civil society can be put into place, Zambia could avoid some of
the worst features of corruption often associated with resource-rich countries.


Bank Strategy
The core of the Bank’s public expenditure support was the multi-donor supported
PEMFA program with the IFMIS as its centerpiece, as well as enhanced public
procurement and the strengthening of audit capacity. The Bank is the lead donor for
the PEMFA program. During the period of the FY04–07 Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS), the Bank broadly took on the PEMFA agenda, and targeted most of the issues
identified as major public financial management weaknesses.

The FY04–07 CAS covered many of the fundamental issues related to public
financial management noted above. Unfortunately, the Bank made no provision to
monitor their achievement. The Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report
(CASCR) has as one of its key lessons that if indicators are included in the CAS,
arrangements need to be made both for collecting baseline data and for monitoring
them. The indicators for improved civil service performance were not achieved since
the government did not have the money to fund them, according to the CASCR. The
only indicator for which some quantitative outcomes reported was for procurement,
where 160 staff were trained and 38 certified. However, in the absence of baselines
or targets, it is difficult to evaluate the outcomes from this training. Detailed CAS
outcome targets are illustrated in table E.2 in appendix E.

The Bank strategy during the FY08–12 period was essentially to address and, if
possible in some areas, complete, the long agenda of institutional reforms supported
by the PEMFA. The approach this time was more selective with a focus on four
areas: IFMIS, procurement; auditing; and the EITI.

        IFMIS. A great deal of effort was put into getting the IFMIS operational, but
         progress was slow. The IFMIS was seen as the flagship of the PEMFA
         program. The strategy included milestones for getting it to various
         government ministries, agencies, and provinces. There was progress over the
         review period, but the program moved at a slow pace. The high staff turnover
         after the new government came into office was a particular challenge, with
         new officials needing to be brought up to speed on a system with which

                      IMPROVING GOVERNANCE AND INSTITUTIONS FOR EFFECTIVE USE OF RESOURCES
       many were unfamiliar. After nearly a decade, the system is still not
       operational.
      Procurement. Procurement reform has also moved forward slowly. An
       important milestone that was achieved was the passage of the Public
       Procurement Act in 2008. However, the law had still not been implemented
       by the end of the country partnership strategy (CPS) period. Indicators on the
       speeding up of the procurement processing were also not achieved.
      Audit. By contrast, audit capacity strengthening has been a success story. The
       Office of the Auditor General (OAG) has gradually increased its coverage to
       the district level and there has been a considerable increase in the number of
       qualified auditors. The OAG provides timely audits to the Public Accounts
       Committee of the Parliament, where they are discussed, with considerable
       media coverage of the findings. This part of the governance program qualifies
       as good practice—even though the malpractices identified have often not had
       the expected consequences in terms of staff dismissal or prosecution.
      EITI. Zambia became a candidate country for the EITI in 2009 and was
       compliant before the end of the CPS period. The first Revenue Reconciliation
       Report was published in February 2011, and the subsequent ones have been
       produced yearly. There has been little discussion of discrepancies, however,
       and the EITI Secretariat does not have the capacity to investigate them, given
       its limited access to financial and production information from the copper
       mines.

The Bank’s current strategy during the FY13–16 period places a much greater
emphasis on the demand side of good governance. Although not reflected in the
2007 CAS, this began during the earlier period, reflecting an evolution in Bank
thinking. The Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) financed an extensive program of
activities involving support and training for the media and the nongovernmental
organization community. For the rest, the FY13–16 CPS program represents a
continuation of Bank support for the IFMIS and improved public procurement.


The Bank Program
Capacity development has been the main thrust of Bank support for PFM
throughout the period. This has been supported both by International Development
Association credits for technical assistance, as well as Bank analytic work. It also
includes the Bank’s leadership of a Multi-Donor Trust Fund. Technical assistance
involved helping set up new institutions (for example, the Public Procurement
Agency, the EITI secretariat), instituting new processes or enhancing existing ones

IMPROVING GOVERNANCE AND INSTITUTIONS FOR EFFECTIVE USE OF RESOURCES
(MTEF, IFMIS, investment planning procedures, more timely and realistic budgets)
and training government officials.

In 2000, the Bank initiated the Public Sector Capacity Development Program
(PSCAP) program. This was intended to be a three-phase adaptable program
lending in recognition of the long timeframe required for PFM improvement. With
the need to move to Highly Indebted Poor Country (HPIC) Initiative completion,
there was some willingness on the part of the government for reform. At the same
time, the donor community wanted to be able to account for the considerable
additional resources Zambia would be able to spend as a consequence of the debt
relief. In 2006, the second phase of PSCAP was initiated. The name of the program
was changed to the Public Service Management Program Support Project, because
the PSCAP was associated with retrenchment of staff in the mines and other
privatized industries. The program targeted three broad reform areas public
expenditure reform, public service reform, and decentralization. After the second
phase closed, the Bank decided not to proceed with a third phase because of the lack
of progress over the 12 years of project support. It was also due to an expectation
that the ongoing MDTF would allow the Bank to maintain its involvement in this
area without a lending operation.

Results of the program have been mixed. The Implementation Completion and
Results Report ratings were moderately satisfactory for the first phase and
moderately unsatisfactory for the second. As indicated in box 3.2, a core part of the
program—the IFMIS implementation—was significantly delayed. Progress in
integrating the MTEF and in implementing the procurement legislation was slow.
Decentralization has not moved forward. Perhaps most worrying for the longer term
has been the limited progress in putting in place improved processes for the
preparation, appraisal and implementation of public investments.

The achievements in payroll management, better budgeting, auditing and EITI
compliance should not be minimized. The payroll system was successfully
implemented and the program helped to make the budget process more timely and
transparent. The program has also assisted the Office of the Auditor General, and
helped strengthen the audit capability. Capacity building under the program
resulted in enhancing the auditing of government financial statements to meet
legislative requirements, and in the strengthening of provincial offices of the central
government. Internal audit functions were computerized. The percentage of entities
covered by annual audit has subsequently increased substantially to about 80
percent in 2010 from 50 percent in 2006. Another instance of successful support was
that Zambia was declared EITI compliant in 2012. The challenge still remains in

                         IMPROVING GOVERNANCE AND INSTITUTIONS FOR EFFECTIVE USE OF RESOURCES
ensuring that audit findings are used effectively to address the weaknesses
identified by the audit units and to implement sanctions when necessary.


 Box 3.2. What is Holding up Zambia’s Integrated Financial Management Information System?
 Work on the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) started before
 the completion of the Highly-Indebted Poor Country Initiative in 2005. Nearly 10 years
 later it remains a work in progress. One donor said that if the government wanted, it
 could complete the full roll out of IFMIS within a year. Indeed the Ministry of Finance
 told the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) it was their intention, though no other part
 of the government was willing to confirm this. In one small district office, the head of the
 information technology unit excitedly told the evaluation team that in using the IFMIS, he
 was able to do in a matter of two hours what was traditionally done in three days under
 the old manual system. His superiors hurriedly interjected that there was still a great deal
 to be done to implement the system.
 During the course of this evaluation, IEG has encountered a number of hypotheses to
 explain the failure to fully implement the IFMIS. One explanation points to the inertia and
 reluctance in some quarters to do the work needed to get the system in place. Other
 observers noted fear of the impact on employment, and the fact that it would be more
 difficult to hide the misuse of public funds through computerized and transparent
 records. As a way to overcome these hurdles, a local nongovernmental organization
 observer pointed out, “All the Ministry of Finance has to do if it wants the system is to
 declare that no ministry or agency will receive its funding, unless it is operating through
 the IFMIS.”


The Bank has not utilized its sector programs adequately in support of governance
objectives. Governance and institutional development is a cross-cutting theme that
needs to be taken up in all parts of the Bank program. In some countries, this has
been a major thrust of the Bank’s strategy, but it has not yet taken root in Zambia.
While Bank support for better procurement practices is reasonably well integrated
across sectors, there has been less of an attempt to leverage Bank projects to support
the IFMIS. A start has been made with the agriculture projects, which have helped
move the Ministry of Agriculture to the IFMIS platform. The same approach should
be adopted in other areas of the portfolio. Similarly, given that the agriculture
project sites are often far from the capital, some of these projects could be used to
support the decentralization process through management at the local level.

The Bank has had an extensive program of analytic work in support of better
governance. The Public Expenditure Review and Policy Notes were at the core of the
effort, and both had chapters dealing with public financial management. In addition,
the Bank had three staff members working on governance issues in the Lusaka office
during the period from 2010 to 20121 as evidence of its commitment. However, the



                                                                                            29
CHAPTER 3
IMPROVING GOVERNANCE AND INSTITUTIONS FOR EFFECTIVE USE OF RESOURCES
number has been reduced to one at the time of writing, and it is not unreasonable to
assume that this reflects among other things the lack of progress on governance
issues.

The Bank’s continuing involvement is through its management of a new MDTF that,
at the time of writing, is being finalized. At present, the task team leader for this
MDTF is based in Washington rather than in the field. At the same time, the Bank is
considering a new budget support operation that could provide some leverage on
issues such as IFMIS implementation and the other areas of Bank activity. The
effectiveness of this will depend on whether the Bank is able to form a strong
alliance with the Ministry of Finance, so that it can use the budget support program
as an instrument to bring the line ministries on board with the proposed approaches.


Assessment and Lessons
While there have been a number of solid achievements in the PFM area, they have
not resulted in an effective overall program. The evaluators were impressed with the
capacity that has been built up in the Ministry of Finance and recognizes that there
has been progress in some of the “soft” areas that are difficult to capture in a results
framework. But it is all the more puzzling given the presence of a team of articulate
and thoughtful civil servants in the key ministry that the progress in the “hard”
institutional and process areas remains so limited. The government moves
selectively on those areas that do not challenge strong vested interests and where it
is able to deliver on them. Whenever a program threatens to promote genuine
change, however, the implementation slows down (IFMIS) or stops completely
(decentralization). The absence of a commitment to comprehensive PFM reform
means that even if there is progress in one area, inefficiency and rent seeking
gravitate to other parts of the government program.

The recent focus on the demand side of better public sector management (PSM) and
governance is well judged. It will be difficult to get progress on PSM without a
perception that there are political rewards from efficient and effective government.
This requires a great deal of effort to build up the demand side of the equation. The
Bank’s Zambia program is one of the most wide-ranging in this regard with a
number of interventions in areas such as media training, investigative reporting, and
capacity building of nongovernmental organizations. There has been some outreach
to parliament, and this is an area that merits strengthening.

        The Independent Evaluation Group rates the outcomes in Pillar 2 as moderately
         unsatisfactory. There have been significant advances in some of the fiduciary

                      IMPROVING GOVERNANCE AND INSTITUTIONS FOR EFFECTIVE USE OF RESOURCES
      areas, such as the external audit, the deliberations of the public accounts
      committee, and improved capacity in the public procurement office and EITI
      compliance. However, many of the CAS outcomes were not achieved and the
      progress has not been commensurate with either the efforts made or the
      urgent need to use resources more transparently and effectively. While EITI
      compliance is a useful first step, EITI still needs to be taken to the next level in
      terms of access to basic information on mining production and sales in order
      to have an impact. The mechanisms for reviewing and publicizing its findings
      also have to be explored further.

Sluggish performance in the area of governance and institutional capacity is going to
be an increasing cost for Zambia in the future. With an expanding public investment
program, Zambia will need to utilize its resources far more efficiently to ensure that
the benefits are visible to the public at large. The dilemma for the Bank is whether,
given the limited progress of the sizeable staff and loan resources it has already put
into this area, it should re-focus its program on other areas as the latest CPS
suggests.

The evaluation suggests that the Bank focus its future efforts on the area of
investment planning where there may be more receptiveness to Bank support. In the
past, the Bank has been perceived as essentially slowing down the investment
process through its insistence on exhaustive project evaluations, safeguard
procedures, and cumbersome procurement arrangements. The challenge that the
line ministries face in putting together a portfolio of good quality investment
projects that can then be financed through Zambia’s own resources or by donors, is a
critical one however. This is an area where the Bank could play a useful role and at
the same time provide training and support in project evaluation, preparation,
monitoring and implementation support, if and when needed by the ministries. The
Bank can help put in place a triage procedure whereby relatively simple and smaller
projects can proceed quickly, while others are subject to more careful preparation
and evaluation.

The Bank should work with other donors to support selective implementation of
administrative decentralization in the context of regional projects. The Bank has
tended to take the position that decisions on decentralization should precede some
of its support at the local level in rural areas. However, this position is simply
keeping the Bank out of a range of activities that could play an important role in
reaching the rural poor. A better approach may be to secure agreement to a
decentralized approach for a particular project activity. This will increase the
comfort level of the line ministry and the Ministry of Finance—without requiring

CHAPTER 3

them to make an across-the-board commitment to decentralization of decision
making to local authorities.

For the Bank to remain relevant in this area, the Bank needs to continue building
trust and confidence. The Bank can increase its relevance in the efforts to improve
governance and institutions in Zambia in two ways. First, it can do so through
leveraging resources, as was the case with HIPC and Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative completion. However, this is simply not an option during the part of the
business cycle when copper prices are strong. Under these circumstances, the Bank’s
engagement with Zambia is increasingly similar to that with emerging middle-
income countries that are not financially dependent on donor funding. The message
must be couched in terms of enabling Zambia to leverage the enormous knowledge
and experience the Bank brings to the business of development by allowing the
Zambians to choose where that knowledge will be deployed.

4. Enhancing Economic Diversification and
Nonmineral Sector Growth
The high concentration of (GDP) gross domestic product in the exportable natural
resource sectors with low spillovers and limited job prospects can keep the exchange
rate high, thereby hurting the competitiveness of other sectors of the economy.
Broad-based economic development through diversification of the economy is
crucial in generating employment and reducing the vulnerability of the country to
fluctuations in the prices and output of mineral resources. Pillar 3 covers various
areas of Bank Group support to diversify Zambia’s economy away from the copper
industry. Major areas of activities include infrastructure, private sector
development, and agriculture.


Context
Developing the nonmineral sectors to diversify sources of economic growth has
been a priority in Zambia’s development strategy since its independence. By
reducing the dependency on the mining sector, it is expected to develop resiliency in
the Zambian economy in dealing with the unanticipated boom and bust cycles of
copper prices. Developing nonresource sectors such as manufacturing, small and
medium enterprises (SMEs), tourism, and agriculture would also help improve the
lives of those who do not benefit directly from mining. Given the limited spillovers
from the mining to other sectors, it is an important policy objective toward reducing
overall poverty and promoting shared prosperity.

With the economy under stress during the 1970s and 1980s, the government
introduced a few measures to provide incentives for agricultural production and
manufacturing. However, these measures were short-lived and depended heavily
on either subsidies or protection against competition. With low copper prices and a
secular decline in the production of copper, Zambia's exports dropped, its foreign
debt increased, and per capita GDP declined. The economic reforms initiated in
early 1990s led to some diversification through the development of commercial
agricultural production, but the overall results were mixed.

The lack of satisfactory progress on diversification led the government to focus
anew on the issue starting in 2001. The National Economic Diversification Task
Force set up in that year developed a strategy drawing on successful international
experiences. With the main objective of improving competitiveness, the Task Force



                                                                                     33
CHAPTER 4
ENHANCING ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND NONRESOURCE SECTOR GROWTH
recommended: (i) improving the policy and regulatory environment for business;
(ii) promoting small and medium-sized enterprises, including building SME
linkages with mining; (iii) improving infrastructure; (iv) promoting agriculture; and
(v) developing labor skills. These areas have become a priority in successive
Zambian national development plans, starting from the 2002 Transitional
Development Program, and continuing through the fifth and sixth Five-Year
National Development Plans covering the periods 2006–2010 and 2011–2015.

Empirical data on the structure of the economy show that some limited
diversification has taken place in recent years. Nonmineral growth in 2004–2008 was
led by growth in construction and services, both of which grew at a slightly faster
rate than the overall GDP growth. Since 2008, growth in agriculture has also
outpaced GDP growth (Table 4.1). Manufacturing growth continued to be slow,
although it has grown at a respectable pace of 5 percent per year in the 2009–2012
period.

a. The data for 2012 are preliminary.


There has also been some diversification of exports in recent years. While copper
(and increasingly other mineral) exports remained dominant, there has been a surge
in nontraditional exports since 2010, driven in large part by agricultural
commodities. The number of items exported has increased from 139 in 2004 to 240 in
2011, but minerals still dominate in value terms.1


Bank Group Strategy and Programs
Diversification was an important area of engagement for the Bank Group for three
consecutive CAS periods from FY04 to FY16. One of the three strategic priorities in
the FY04–07 CAS was to provide support for developing “a diversified and export-
oriented economy.” In this context, it identified five possible areas of Bank Group
support. These areas included: (i) trade reforms and facilitation; (ii) the investment

                                                                                CHAPTER 4
                        ENHANCING ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND NONRESOURCE SECTOR GROWTH
climate; (iii) infrastructure improvement, particularly roads and logistics; (iv) labor
skills; and (v) agriculture, including raising productivity of smallholder crop and
livestock systems, and support for commercial agriculture.

The FY08–11 CAS and the FY13–16 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) continued to
emphasize the diversification objective, albeit under different formulations. The
FY08–11 CAS aligned Bank Group support with the objectives as stated in the
government’s Fifth National Development Plan. Diversification was not mentioned
as an explicit goal of the FY08–11 CAS, but was implicit in its overarching goal of
“achieving broad-based wealth and job creation.” The most recent FY13–16 CPS has
as an explicit focus on diversification and private sector development as one of three
themes under “Objective Two: Improving Competitiveness and Infrastructure for
Growth and Employment.” It envisages promoting diversification through support
for the investment climate, SMEs, finance, power, telecommunications, and water.

The broad thrust for diversification in all three strategies was based on creating the
conditions conducive for private investment in nonextractive industries, such as
manufacturing, tourism, agriculture and agro-processing, as well as other
nontraditional sectors. SME development was a key objective, although not
specifically articulated. The broad areas of Bank Group support and the expected
outcomes in these CASs are reviewed below. Specific indicators for the three key
sectors of Infrastructure, Private Sector Development, and Agriculture are presented
in table E.3 in appendix E.

INFRASTRUCTURE
The cost of road transport and the lack of reliable power and limited coverage were
considered the main constraints to private investment. Accordingly, the main areas
of support for infrastructure sectors during the evaluation period were roads and
power. The particular focus of the Bank was to create the institutional and
regulatory structures in both subsectors to ensure sustainability as well as
investments to upgrade quality and reliability. The Bank used financial and advisory
instruments to support these areas. For long-term infrastructure investments such as
toll roads and airports, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) can provide
financing and advice to public-private partnerships (PPPs) through its long-term
financing and global expertise. In practice, IFC has had no engagements with long-
term infrastructure investment, except its PPP advisory work for Kafue George
hydropower project.

CHAPTER 4
ENHANCING ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND NONRESOURCE SECTOR GROWTH
Roads

Until the 1970s, Zambia had a well-developed highway and railway system financed
by the proceeds from copper mining. However, the decline in mineral exports from
the late 1970s, and the impact of macroeconomic and sector mismanagement on
maintenance funding meant that transport infrastructure deteriorated sharply
during the 1980s and 1990s. However, subsequent economic growth enabled the
work toward restoring the road network, and the government launched an
ambitious multi-donor supported 10-year (1998–2007) Road Sector Investment
Program (ROADSIP-I). In 2003, following the successful completion of the first five
years of ROADSIP-I, the government expanded the program to the following 10-
year period, 2004–2013, with an estimated total cost of $1.2 billion (ROADSIP-II).
The Bank has supported both ROADSIP-I and II through a series of International
Development Association (IDA) credits totaling more than $200 million.2 Overall,
the program has met its investment objectives, albeit with issues of high unit costs,
cost over-runs, and allegations of corruption.

An important feature of ROADSIP II is that it was accompanied by a significant
institutional reform program. Under the program, three new road agencies were
created. The National Road Fund Agency (NRFA) coordinates and manages road
financing. The Road Development Agency (RDA) builds and maintains the
country’s core road network. The Road Transport and Safety Agency implements
the government’s road transport policy, including its traffic management and road
safety components. These agencies were set up as autonomous entities with their
own boards of directors and financial resources.

The institutional framework was designed to ensure the setting of appropriate
priorities between different types of roads, and between construction and
maintenance. This is particularly important, as Zambia has a dispersed population
over a large area, and low traffic volumes on most of its road network. The three
sector agencies are fully operational, but their effectiveness is hampered by a
number of factors including internal and external coordination issues, weak local
construction industry capacity, a shortage of qualified labor, and political
interference. Instead of channeling all funds through the NRFA, the government has
tended to fund RDA directly, thus defeating the key goal of prioritization of
investments, as well as between investment and maintenance.

In addition to supporting the ROADSIP program, the Bank led donors in helping the
government develop its national policy in the roads sector in 2002 that instituted the
policy and institutional reforms. There was no formal sector work undertaken, but
the Bank helped develop the policy with its input in the government-donor dialogue

                                                                               CHAPTER 4
                       ENHANCING ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND NONRESOURCE SECTOR GROWTH
in formulating the roads policy. Despite some ongoing issues, the reform program is
considered to have been successful. The Implementation Completion and Results
Reports rate the Bank contribution to institutional development as “substantial.”
However, as noted, the policy framework has not been able to fulfill its assigned
mandate in recent years.

Most of the road sector outcome targets for the FY04–07 CAS were met—a reflection
of the generally positive outcomes from the projects supported by the Bank. The
FY04–07 CAS defined outcome indicators for the road sector as the percentage of
roads in good condition, and increased local participation in road maintenance.
These outcomes were largely met as paved and unpaved networks in good
condition increased from 58 percent and 7 percent in 2004 to 65 percent and 32
percent, respectively, in 2006. The goal of increasing the proportion of road network
under routine maintenance with community participation was partially met,
increasing from 19.5 percent in 2004 to 40 percent in 2006 (and 33 percent in 2005).
However, outcome indicators for the FY08–11 CAS were not monitored well. The
CAS specified the outcome indicators as the percentage of the rural population in
targeted provinces with access to reinstated river crossings and the amount of
increased volume of traffic on improved roads. As indicated in the Country
Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CASCR), the first outcome was achieved,
but it could not assess the second indicator as it was not monitored.3

The Bank now faces new risks to the sustainability of the institutional reforms
implemented over the last decade. There is a growing divergence in views between
the government and the donors on the investment priorities in the sector. The RDA,
which is responsible for construction and maintenance of even the tertiary roads,
has often come under political pressure to upgrade these roads without adequate
consideration of future maintenance. The Accelerated Program of Road
Construction adopted by the government in 2011 would have increased the paved
network to 8,000 kilometers, which is well in excess of the ROADSIP-II target of
about 5,000 kilometers. The original stated concept of an independent Roads Board
that would set priorities seems to have broken down, with decisions increasingly
made based on political considerations.

Donors, including the Bank, may have contributed to the breakdown of the
institutional concept because of the channeling their funds to discreet projects. While
a project approach is appropriate for financing the main roads, the secondary,
tertiary, and rural roads should have been funded as a part of the program to
support the concept of sectorwide planning and investment/maintenance
prioritization by the Road Board.

Power

Zambia is still far from achieving universal access to electricity. Only 23 percent of
the population has access to electricity in Zambia, with about 40 percent coverage of
the urban and peri-urban areas, and a mere 3.1 percent of the rural population.
These numbers are well below the levels in comparable middle-income countries.
Moreover, supply is unreliable with frequent load shedding that has increased in the
last few years as the economy has grown.

The shortfall of supply was a direct consequence of under-investment in new power
generation in the last two decades, stemming from fiscal and economic constraints.
The stagnation of the economy and dying mining sector in the 1980s and 1990s
meant that there was no pressure on the system. However, demand is now growing,
with economic growth fueled by the strong expansion of mining that consumes 50
percent of the electricity. Agriculture and manufacturing also require increased
electricity supply for further growth. Peak demand is projected to increase from
1,600 megawatts in 2010 to 2,400 megawatts in 2020. The National Development
Plan estimates investment needs at $6 billion over the next 10 years. This would
cover needs for new generation, transmission, and distribution to meet demand and
alleviate the problem of load shedding.

As a part of the reforms under the Highly Indebted Poor Country Initiative, the
government committed to unbundle the Zambia Electric Supply Corporation
(ZESCO), a state-owned integrated utility, and to privatize the generation and
distribution functions. The decision, however, was abrogated in 2003 under the
revised energy policy. The view was that privatization of ZESCO was premature
and not feasible given the small size of the system and the immediate need for
additional investments. Accordingly, the focus shifted to commercialization of
ZESCO and to improving its financial viability. The government approved a tariff
increase by 87 percent on average over 2009–2011. The increase helped improve
ZESCO’s finances significantly, turning around an operating loss of about $21
million in FY06-08 to a net operating profit of $70 million in 2010. A key remaining
impediment for ZESCO to become a commercially viable and self-reliant power
company is that it has not been able to obtain regular annual tariff increases from the
Energy Regulation Board. Also, the problem of arrears by government agencies to
ZESCO ($58 million, or 50 percent of ZESCO’s total accounts receivable) remains to
be addressed.

The Bank had a difficult time establishing an effective sector engagement during
much of the evaluation period. Initially, the Bank was viewed, particularly by
ZESCO, as being unrealistic in pushing for sector unbundling and privatization. It


38
                                                                               CHAPTER 4
                       ENHANCING ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND NONRESOURCE SECTOR GROWTH
took several years for the Bank to change its stance and agree to commercialization
of ZESCO as the appropriate strategy. Meanwhile, the government’s noncompliance
with tariff agreements resulted in the Bank-financed power rehabilitation project
(FY98) closing with an unsatisfactory outcome. As a result, the Bank was not able to
finance any other project in the power sector for almost 10 years.

The Bank was able to resume financing projects in the sector in 2008, when it
reached agreement with the government on commercialization of ZESCO as the
appropriate strategy. The government too showed a stronger commitment to
improving ZESCO’s finances as a part of the agreements under the budget support
loans. The first project, approved in 2008, financed the rehabilitation and expansion
of ZESCO’s distribution system. However, project performance was initially
unsatisfactory because of the rural electrification component (through mini-hydro
and solar power) that was not well designed and that added undue complexity to
implementation. It was not until 2010 that the Bank restructured the project, and
removed the poorly performing mini-hydro component and scaled back the solar
component. The Bank also reportedly strengthened project supervision. These
measures helped it regain the confidence of an increasingly competent and self-
reliant ZESCO.

The Bank was subsequently able to re-establish its dialogue in the power sector
through moving away from its insistence on unbundling the sector and through
good performance in its recent projects. The Bank approved two additional power
projects during the review period.4 Both projects are aimed at strengthening and
expanding transmission and distribution systems. Project implementation has been
generally satisfactory and all three existing projects are serving a clear need. The
Bank’s positive contributions to the sector are recognized by the government and
donors. This has allowed the Bank to mobilize significant co-financing.

The advisory service for a major hydropower project was the only IFC involvement
in the sector, but it did not reach financial closure. The FY08 CAS listed the Kafue
Gorge Lower hydropower project (550 megawatts) as a potential project for IFC
investment and an IDA partial risk guarantee. IFC provided advisory services for
the transaction structuring work on this project. However, before the transaction
was formally launched, the government decided to work with the Chinese
government to implement the project, and IFC’s contract was not renewed. 5

The outcome targets of both the FY04 and FY08 CASs were largely met, albeit with
delays and some modifications. The target of completion of commercialization of
ZESCO (of the FY04 CPS) was met, although as noted, without the envisaged
unbundling and privatization. The FY08 CAS target of continued improvement in


                                                                                     39
CHAPTER 4
ENHANCING ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND NONRESOURCE SECTOR GROWTH
ZESCO’s financial viability through regular tariff increases, and for increased access
to electricity (20 to 23 percent) was also largely achieved.

Government strategy over the medium- to long-term envisages exploitation of its
large hydro potential (estimated at over 6,000 megawatts) to meet domestic demand
and to become a major regional supplier of electricity. A number of hydroelectric
projects are under preparation, some of which are expected to be undertaken as
public-private participation projects.6 In addition, the Zambian government
continues to focus on improving the sector performance and finances, and further
integration of Zambia’s power system into the Southern African Power pool. These
are potential areas for future Bank Group support. However, it has yet to define its
role in these plans, lacking any significant sector work and a robust dialogue in the
sector.

Rural electrification is another possible area for future Bank support, but as yet,
there is no clear strategy for expanding coverage. Current government plans to
expand electricity coverage to rural areas need more consideration, taking into
account the highly dispersed rural population that will be hard to reach at a
reasonable and affordable cost with on-grid solutions. In addition, the cost and
institutional constraints in implementing an expanded program of nonconventional
sources of energy need to be considered.

PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT
To promote private sector development, the FY04 CAS proposed support for a
program of reforms to improve the investment climate. Promoting private
investment in nonextractive industries, particularly in manufacturing and SMEs,
was another part of Bank Group support for diversification. The main elements of
this included: (i) improving the business and regulatory environment; (ii) providing
support for private sector investments; and (iii) increasing access to finance by
micro, small, and medium-size enterprises. Bank Group support for each of these
components is assessed below.

Business and Regulatory Environment

Regarding the investment climate agenda, IFC support was mainly through
advisory services, while the Bank’s primary vehicle for involvement was through
policy-based operations. The Bank carried out a policy dialogue and included
relevant conditionality in most of the budget support operations, starting with the
series of Economic Management and Growth Credits and continuing with the
Poverty Reduction Support Credits.

                                                                                CHAPTER 4
                        ENHANCING ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND NONRESOURCE SECTOR GROWTH
IFC’s advisory service helped Zambia reduce the number of business license
requirements. IFC helped reduce 42 out of a total of 152 business licenses. IFC also
supported elimination of the minimum capital requirements. With these
improvements, Zambia became one of the top 10 performers in the Doing Business
Indicators in 2011 (World Bank 2011b). During this period, the responsibility for
investment climate reforms was shifted from the Ministry of Trade to the Private
Sector Development Reform Unit at the cabinet office. This was done with IFC
support, which facilitated the associated inter-ministerial coordination.

However, Zambia still faces significant challenges in improving its business
environment, requiring further efforts. Compared to neighboring countries, a
considerably longer time is needed to process imports and exports in Zambia.7 IFC
has been working toward reducing the processing times by at least 30 percent, and
strengthening the tribunal function to improve the government’s oversight
capability against cartels.8 There appears to be some early indication that the impact
of this support will be to help streamline the processing time.

Promoting Private Investment

During the evaluation period, IFC explored various ways to promote private
investments in Zambia, but its efforts have not yet translated into a diverse and
robust portfolio. Although IFC has been able to increase its committed investment
portfolio from $14 million in FY04 to $62 million in FY13, IFC’s average annual net
commitment was less than $10 million in FY04–13—too modest a level of investment
to make a meaningful impact on the size of the overall private sector investments in
Zambia.

Nevertheless, two activities could have a positive far-reaching impact over a longer
term:

      IFC issued 150 million Kwacha bond (approximately $28.4 million) to deepen
       Zambia’s capital market. Since its proceeds had not been allocated to any IFC
       investments at the time of this evaluation, it has had a limited short-term
       impact on private sector development. However, this bond issue has been
       well received by the banking sector in Zambia because it added depth to the
       capital market, which has been dominated by government bond issues. It is
       also expected to serve as a benchmark for future corporate bond issuance by
       Zambian companies.
      IFC made a $6 million equity investment in a junior mining company in
       FY09.9 This investment was made at the early stage of feasibility study—
       generally considered a high-risk period—without a guarantee of commercial



                                                                                       41
CHAPTER 4
ENHANCING ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND NONRESOURCE SECTOR GROWTH
       production. IFC also set international environmental standards for this
       mining project. IFC’s presence and its due diligence gave comfort to First
       Quantum, a mining major, which later acquired IFC’s equity stake. This
       investment produced an attractive return to IFC. More importantly, given the
       expected total investment of $2 billion for this mining project, the project can
       potentially contribute to Zambia’s long-term economic growth and auxiliary
       private sector investments. IFC had a significant and unique value-added role
       through the process, which was made possible by it taking a relatively high-
       risk in supporting mining investment at an early stage.

Institutional and policy reform in several industrial subsectors was an important
objective of Bank support in private sector development, but the efforts had limited
results. The Bank carried out a number of high quality subsector studies that
identified key constraints to private sector investments. However, the studies found
limited traction with the government to implement the recommended reforms. The
studies were carried out under the Jobs and Prosperity: Building Zambia’s
Competitiveness Program, with funding from the United Kingdom’s Department
for International Development and other donors.10 Based on extensive consultations
with the public and private sectors, the studies identified the critical policy and
institutional constraints to attracting private investments, and the actions needed to
deal with them.

Most studies reached similar conclusions about constraints, which include the
regulatory environment, land, infrastructure, and access to finance. Most also had a
long list of recommendations, but with insufficient emphasis on sequencing.
Moreover, the Zambia Development Authority, the agency responsible for
investment promotion, is very weak and did not indicate any specific plans to follow
up on the recommendations. A lack of clear government ownership for action in this
area led to limited impact of the Bank studies.

The Bank also financed one investment project to promote private investment,
which had an unsatisfactory outcome. The Support for Economic Expansion and
Diversification (SEED) project, approved in 2005,11 was designed to support
institutional and policy reforms in tourism, agro-processing and the gem industry.
However, the agro-processing component was dropped due to a lack of interest by
the Ministry of Agriculture. The gem component was apparently also implemented,
but there was not much information regarding its achievements in the
Implementation Completion and Results Report or during the field visit.

Ultimately, the project primarily financed tourism infrastructure and conservation in
two national parks, which had some positive outcomes. However, there was no


42
                                                                                CHAPTER 4
                        ENHANCING ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND NONRESOURCE SECTOR GROWTH
follow-up to build on the initial achievements. Under this component, infrastructure
in one of the largest national parks, Kafue, was rehabilitated. In addition, the project
improved conditions of several Game Management Areas, and improved the park
monitoring system. Bank support helped the development of a national policy for
the tourism sector and the development of Kafue as a viable tourist destination.
There has also reportedly been an increase or stabilization in the number and
distribution of selected species. One account estimates that it helped increase
tourism revenues almost tenfold between 2004 and 2011 (World Bank 2012b).
However, risk to the environmental objective in SEED was rated as significant
because of the lack of direct government counterpart funding, as well as the lack of a
follow-up operation to support achievements in the Kafue National Park. The
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) rated the overall project outcome as
moderately unsatisfactory.

Access to Finance: Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprise Development

Improving access to finance was the key objective of Bank activities in the financial
sector. Through the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and other
analytical support, the Bank helped the government develop and implement a
Financial Sector Development Program (FSDP). Led by the Bank of Zambia, the
FSDP helped strengthen bank supervision, restructuring and privatization of state-
owned banks and nonbank financial institutions. It also helped to develop a
consolidated legal framework for nonbank financial institutions, and introduce
better accountability and financial discipline in the remaining state-owned financial
institutions. The relevant conditionality was included in the three Economic
Management and Growth Credits. The ICR for these credits rated the outcome of
this effort as moderately satisfactory, noting that while all core and noncore
conditions were met, implementation took longer than expected.

The banking sector in Zambia has grown, but SME access to finance remains
constrained. The banking sector has significant competition, with 17 commercial
banks now operating in the country. The latest FSAP assessment in 2008 rated the
sector as generally sound and adequately supervised by the Central Bank, which is
the beneficiary of Bank technical assistance. However, lack of access to finance for
SMEs has been a recurring theme throughout the review period. Banks are reluctant
to lend to SMEs because of a lack of adequate collateral and perceived credit risk.
More recently, banks have found it more profitable to invest in government
securities, as borrowing by the government has grown.

Efforts were made through IFC advisory services and Bank-supported operations to
expand SME financing but yielded limited success. Under the Africa Micro, Small,


                                                                                      43
CHAPTER 4
ENHANCING ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND NONRESOURCE SECTOR GROWTH
and Medium Enterprise Finance Program, IFC provided SME banking advisory
services to commercial banks in Zambia. IFC helped establish a long-term SME loan
product for its client banks. However, it is yet to be seen whether IFC has realized
sector-wide impact on SME lending. The majority of SMEs in Zambia are either
importers or exporters, and the main financing needs are short-term working capital
loans.

The Bank prepared a project for approval in 2013 that would have provided a line of
credit to participating financial institutions through the Development Bank of
Zambia (DBZ). However, the project was abandoned when, according to Bank staff
involved, the government decided to impose caps on lending rates. DBZ officials, on
the other hand, indicated that it decided not to pursue the credit line when the Bank
insisted that the funds had to be on-lent through Participating Financial
Intermediaries (PFIs), while it preferred to do direct lending. The Bank has
meanwhile provided technical assistance from the Public-Private Infrastructure
Advisory Facility for “institutional strengthening” of DBZ, and for exploring the
potential of subnational lending.

In retrospect, this is an area where the Bank has yet to develop an appropriate
strategic approach. The concept of on-lending is based on the premise that the PFIs
lack access to funding, whereas the actual constraint is not liquidity but concern for
creditworthiness. In addition, high yields for government bonds in recent years have
further dampened the incentive for SME lending. The choice of DBZ as the apex
institution is also questionable, given that its mandate still seems to be largely as a
directed credit institution. More sector work, possibly as a part of a FSAP follow-up,
might have been useful in developing the strategy, examining issues in depth and
devising possible solutions.

As a way to promote both SMEs and inclusive growth, efforts were made to develop
stronger linkages between SMEs and mining companies. IFC extended support for
local SMEs to improve their operations to meet the procurement requirements of
multinational companies, building on its successful pilot in Konkola Copper Mines.
Training was provided to 170 SMEs, but only one out of five participating
multinational companies replaced imports of goods with local products supplied
from SMEs.12 Overall, the efforts have had only limited success so far.

Private Sector Development Outcomes

The relevant FY04–07 CAS outcome indicators were designed around reduced
administrative barriers to exports, investment and production through: (i) improved
duty drawback for exporters; (ii) informed exporters of the African Growth and

                                                                               CHAPTER 4
                       ENHANCING ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND NONRESOURCE SECTOR GROWTH
Opportunity Act and Everything But Arms; (iii) improved perception by foreign and
domestic investors of the investment climate; and (iv) continued high level
satisfaction of industry with Technical Education, Vocational, and Entrepreneurship
Training (TVET) graduates. As noted in the CASCR, the first three indicators were
not monitored, and there was actually deterioration in investor perceptions. The
TVET indicator was met as measured by industry surveys.

The only private sector related outcome indicator in the FY08 CAS was for the
tourism sector. This was linked to the only Bank private sector development project:
a decrease in average number of days to process tourism licenses by the Ministry of
Tourism, Environment and Natural Resources at Livingston’s new “one stop.” The
decrease was from 90 days in 2004 to 60 days in 2010. In practice, the indicator was
not monitored, but some evidence suggests that the indicator did not improve and
may have even deteriorated (World Bank 2012b).

At the same time, the relevance of this indicator for the private sector development
agenda is somewhat peculiar. This is indicative of the overall weakness in the results
framework that was noted by the 2011 CASCR. The FY08 CAS also set indicators for
satisfaction and employability of TVET graduates. The CASCR noted that the
indicator was met. However, as noted in chapter 5, the Bank-supported TVET
project was not successful. Thus, the outcome was probably not attributable to the
Bank’s program.

AGRICULTURE
Zambia’s agriculture sector has considerable potential to contribute to growth and
diversification, as well as to rural poverty reduction. Zambia has 42 million hectares
of arable land, of which only 1.5 million hectares are cultivated each year.
Agriculture accounts for 19 percent of GDP and about 8.4 percent of export earnings.
It provides employment to some 70 percent of the labor force.

Because of the poor policy environment in the first 25 years of independence,
agricultural growth stagnated at about 2.5 percent per annum. This was
considerably below the population growth rate, estimated at 3.1 percent. The
reforms during the 1990s led to faster agricultural growth—at 3.9 percent, before
slowing down to 1.7 percent in 2000–2004 as a result of a series of droughts. Growth
has since resumed with increases in production, particularly in maize and sugar
cane (Figure 4.1). Agriculture has also become an important source of export
earnings. Between 1990 and 1994, agricultural exports went from $30 million to $61
million and increasing to $300 million by 2006 (World Bank 2009c).

Even though some progress was made, the sector has not achieved its full potential
in contributing to growth and diversification, particularly with respect to
smallholders. The sector is dominated by smallholders, who have low productivity
and have not benefited from sector growth. Only a third of these smallholders are
organized in some form of out-grower arrangements to benefit from the
government’s commercialization-driven approach to the sector. For the rest, the lack
of market linkages is a major constraint.

Against this background, the FY04 CAS proposed a two-pronged strategy to support
agriculture development, including: (i) support for raising the productivity of
smallholder crop and livestock systems in a sustainable manner (especially arresting
the spread of disease); and (ii) support for commercial out-grower linkages.
However, there were no outcome indicators specified for the sector in the CAS. The
2008 CAS envisaged a much larger Bank Group engagement in the agriculture
sector. The focus was on increased agricultural productivity and marketing for
smallholders, as well as specified outcomes such as increased agricultural exports of
specific products from improved productivity and value chains in cotton, sunflower,
groundnuts, paprika/chili, and soybean. The CASCR reports that the export targets
have been largely met, but the achievement cannot be attributed to Bank support.

Despite the significance of the sector to increased diversification of the economy and
rural poverty reduction, the outcomes of Bank efforts in the sector have not yet had
much impact. During the evaluation period, the Bank supported three major projects
in the agriculture sector.13 The only project that had closed at the time of this


46
                                                                                CHAPTER 4
                        ENHANCING ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND NONRESOURCE SECTOR GROWTH
evaluation, the Agriculture Development Support Project of 2006, tried to address
the challenges related to smallholder productivity through improving linkages
between smallholder producers and markets.14 The outcomes of the project are
unclear, even though the Implementation Status and Results Report (ISR) of March
2014—the latest obtained for this evaluation—reports satisfactory progress toward
meeting the project development objectives of increasing production exports and the
volumes of specific crops. This is because the extent to which the reported increases
can be attributed to the project or to the general overall growth in agricultural
production is not clear. Moreover, there is no evidence of the project having
achieved its key objective of promoting out-grower schemes for smallholders.

The other two agriculture projects, which are currently ongoing, continue to focus
on improving the productivity of smallholder farmers. The Irrigation Development
and Support Project, approved in 2011, aims at increasing yields per hectare and the
value of diverse products marketed by smallholders. These smallholders are to
benefit from investments in irrigation in selected sites to be made by both the private
and public sectors.15 The Livestock Development and Animal Health Project in FY12
aimed at improving livestock production with an emphasis on disease control—an
area of growing interest among smallholder farmers, both for family consumption
and sale.

Zambia is also one of three beneficiary countries of a regional project approved in
2013 that supports agricultural research and development.16 Each of three countries
focuses research on different crops, results of which are shared among all three
participating countries. The total cost of the regional project is about $95 million,
with Zambia’s share as $29.8 million. The project is just starting implementation, but
initial indications are that it is a promising effort for introducing new and improved
varieties and technologies.

Recently, the Bank financed a project dealing with Water Resource Development
(FY13). Although the project does not directly deal with agriculture, it has important
potential linkages with the sector that were not fully exploited.

Experiences and early indications of implementation status of these projects point to
several design and implementation challenges across the four projects. First, the
highly complex project designs have resulted in long gestation periods, difficult
implementation phases, and a significant likelihood of a major restructuring.

For example, the Agriculture Development Support Project closed in May 2014,
some eight years after approval and two years after the original closing date. The
credit component of the project, which aimed to provide funding to DBZ for on-



                                                                                      47
CHAPTER 4
ENHANCING ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND NONRESOURCE SECTOR GROWTH
lending to participating financial institutions, has not been successful and was
cancelled after a few years. The Irrigation Support Project is in the start-up stage
three years after approval, and there is uncertainty over the public-private
partnership concept—an important feature of the project design. The Agriculture
Development Project has gone through a restructuring, and there is a high
likelihood that the Irrigation Support Project will require restructuring in the not too
distant future as well. The Livestock Development Project approved in FY12 was in
the start-up phase as of March 2014, with detailed design work yet to commence on
most components. The latest ISR in December 2012 rates project development
objective achievement and implementation progress as moderately unsatisfactory.

Second, there has been insufficient sector work to under-pin the key features of
project design. Regarding the Irrigation Development Project, it is uncertain at this
time whether the proposed public-private partnership concept will materialize as
potential investor(s) have yet to be identified, posing a significant risk for meeting
project development objectives. More consideration could have been given to the
fact that potential farm investors have had many other choices of farmland that are
better located than the project sites—without assuming the obligation of serving
adjacent smallholders, and without reliance on the public sector for the provision of
irrigation infrastructure.

Third, the sustainability of positive outcomes is an issue since these projects largely
rely on freestanding Project Management Units and lack an institutional base within
the responsible ministry. As a result, even the successful components within a
project, for example, the competitive grants and rural roads under the Agriculture
Development Support Project, have not been scaled-up. The sustainability of the
effects of the rural roads component, which have demonstrated successful ‘output-
based contracting’ for maintenance, would also be affected by how the institutional
mechanisms for the roads sector will evolve, as noted above.

Finally, Bank efforts in agriculture have not been based on a well-considered and
agreed sector strategy. Each of the four project interventions during the review
period dealt with different aspects of the sector. However, project design and
implementation status show little linkage among various types of interventions and
national strategies in the agriculture and relevant sectors. In addition, there was no
evident effort to build on individual project experiences. For example, it appears
that the Irrigation Support Project is not based on an overall national strategy that
takes into account the intersection of water resource availability, agriculture
prospects and markets. A water sector study indicates that there are serious gaps in
information on water resources in Zambia, as well as potential scarcity in specific

                        ENHANCING ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND NONRESOURCE SECTOR GROWTH
geographical locations, despite overall abundance of water (World Bank 2009d). It is
not clear whether such factors have been incorporated in the project site selection.

The Water Resources Development Project raises questions about appropriate
sequencing. The project is aimed at supporting institutional development of the
newly created Water Resources Management Authority (WARMA) that replaced the
previous Water Boards. The project intends to address the water resource planning
issues over time, something that should ideally have been done as a precursor to the
irrigation project.

Also, the small dams/reservoir component of the Water Resources Development
Project raises a question about the appropriate role of WARMA in water resource
management. There might be value in considering a cross-sectoral approach, that is,
by having this function managed through community-driven development executed
by local governments under the overall control of the Ministry of Local Government
rather than through WARMA. This could be a means to help pilot decentralization.

There is a need for the Bank to work with the Ministry of Agriculture and WARMA
to develop a long-term strategy for the sector that would delineate institutional and
policy options, as well as immediate and medium-term investment priorities.

A key constraint in agriculture development in Zambia has been various forms of
inefficient subsidies, and there is indication that collaborative efforts with other
donors have had some effect on this constraint. The Bank, along with other donors,
has been engaged in dialogue with the government on input subsidies for maize
production and the food reserves program, and a recent policy change by the
government is promising. The two major government agriculture programs—the
Farmer Input Support Program and the Food Reserve Agency—have major
weaknesses. Analysis by the Bank indicates that these programs are costly and
regressive. They encourage expansion of maize, and increase production through
area expansion rather than through productivity enhancement. Both programs have
been under discussion for many years, but without much progress. However, the
government recently took some initial steps along the lines advocated by the donors,
such as reducing the size of the input package and expanding eligibility to include
rice in addition to maize.

In terms of improving Zambian agriculture productivity, developing agro-
processing capability as well as scaling-up its investment activities along the
agribusiness value chains can be highly valuable. This is an area where IFC has
global experience and knowledge. However, IFC has not been able to develop a
strong investment portfolio in the area due partly to its inability to distinguish itself



                                                                                        49

ENHANCING ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND NONRESOURCE SECTOR GROWTH
from other available financing sources. Zambeef has been IFC’s only major client in
the agro-processing sector: it received financing from IFC in June 2010, four years
after the German Investment and Development Company (DEG) provided its first
loan to the company at a time when the risk profile of the company was much
higher. Zambeef has been listed on London’s Alternative Investment Market since
June 2011 and it has a wide range of financing sources, including local and
international banks. IFC had a positive impact on the stock listing of Zambeef with
the signaling effect of its involvement. IFC also offered 10-year local currency loan
through a swap, which Zambeef could not have accessed from the local banks, and
supported the international expansion of its operations. Although IFC, jointly with
DEG, has helped improve the company’s operation in the area of environmental
impact and safety, IFC’s potential value-added on a wider range of areas along the
agribusiness value chains does not appear to be clearly recognized by the
agribusiness sector as Zambeef has been IFC’s only main agribusiness client during
the country program evaluation (CPE) period.

IFC also set up a loan scheme to promote entrepreneurial farmers, but there was
limited demand for such a program. IFC worked with Zambia National Commercial
Bank (Zambia’s state-owned commercial bank) to provide a combination of advisory
and loan services to help develop financing to Zambia’s emerging farmers.17 The
aim was to support those farmers who have the entrepreneurial skills and track
record to become independent large-scale commercial farmers. This new loan
program has reached its target by financing 171 emerging farmers.

MIGA, in contrast, had notable exposures to the agribusiness sector through a long-
term contract with a private equity firm. MIGA entered a master contract agreement
with Chayton Atlas Investments (CAI) in May 2010. CAI is a private equity fund
with extensive regional farming experience focused on investing in agribusiness in
countries in the Southern African Development Community. This long-term contract
helped expand MIGA’s activities in the sector, which reached the total gross
exposure of $60.6 million. MIGA’s guarantees supported CAI’s equity investments
in Chobe Agrivision Company Ltd. (Chobe), an agricultural operating company in
Zambia. With installations of irrigation systems and other improvements in farm
lands, these farms were able to increase productivity of their agricultural products.


Assessment and Lessons
There have been positive trends in export diversification and growth of nonmineral
sectors, but their effects on building broad-based development have been limited.
The prospect of faster growth and job creation in manufacturing, and among small-

                        ENHANCING ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND NONRESOURCE SECTOR GROWTH
scale enterprises specifically, in the short-term is unclear. Apart from inadequate
infrastructure and lack of access to finance, entrepreneurs cited the high cost of
inputs (including labor) and “cheap imports” from China (via South Africa) as major
challenges. The Bank needs to undertake a detailed analysis to assess the validity of
these claims.

Notwithstanding the slow pace of diversification, the core areas of Bank Group
support remain appropriate. Improving infrastructure, promoting private
investment, and developing agriculture are all core aspects that can contribute to
economic diversification. As a recent Bank study in Central Asia (Gill and others
2014) has argued, it is difficult, if not impossible, to make diversification happen.
Instead, the strategy for resource-rich countries should be to efficiently convert their
resource rents into physical, human, and institutional capital. The Bank’s focus on
infrastructure, agriculture, skills, and private investment is consistent with this
approach.

The Bank Group contribution to each of the components of its diversification
strategy, however, has been mixed. Regarding infrastructure, the Bank’s
contributions have been generally satisfactory, albeit with some weaknesses. In the
power sector, the Bank’s focus on unbundling and privatization before the sector
had achieved a critical mass was seen by many in Zambia as inappropriate. It was
also a stumbling block to an effective sector dialogue and to the Bank’s ability to
provide much needed support. The Bank was successful in re-establishing a good
dialogue in the last 4-5 years, in part by changing its rigid stance on unbundling and
by bringing in stronger sector staff. The Bank is well placed to provide further
assistance to the sector, and should do so in the context of a longer, sustained
engagement to ensure effectiveness.

The Bank also played an important role in the development of the road sector. The
Bank was instrumental in putting in place a well-conceived institutional framework
designed to ensure adoption of appropriate standards and effective prioritization of
expenditures between maintenance and construction. However, the institutional
framework did not function as planned, in large part because of political
considerations that have led RDA to emphasize new construction and unsustainable
standards. This potentially jeopardizes the gains from the institutional reforms.

Bank Group work in support of private sector development was diffuse and
unfocused. The Bank Group’s work on helping improve the business environment
was useful and helped Zambia to improve its regulatory environment. However, its
impact thus far has been limited. Entrepreneurs see the investment climate as an
area of lesser importance than other factors, such as infrastructure, access to finance,


                                                                                      51
CHAPTER 4
ENHANCING ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND NONRESOURCE SECTOR GROWTH
the high cost of inputs, and competing cheap imports. Both Bank and IFC efforts to
promote SMEs were largely unsuccessful, as they continued to focus mainly on lines
of credit that were not much in demand because the underlying issues of
creditworthiness and collateral were not addressed. Recently, the high yield on
government bonds and imposition of interest rate caps may have also restrained
lending to SMEs.

Regarding agriculture, the Bank’s performance has been less than satisfactory. In the
initial period, the sector did not receive the necessary priority, despite its importance
to the country’s economic diversification. Although the Bank was much more active
in the second half of the review period, the projects supported have been overly
complex. They are scattered among un-linked interventions, have the risk of
institutional sustainability, and have not been based on a well-articulated sector
strategy. IFC played a very limited role in strengthening the relevant industries,
including private businesses along the agribusiness value chains for which it has
global knowledge, client relationships, and investment experience. For its part,
MIGA has had success in engaging in a long-term contract with a private equity firm
with expertise in agribusiness in southern Africa.

Overall, IEG rates Bank Group performance for the diversification pillar as
moderately unsatisfactory. In future, the Bank Group would need a much more
strategic approach, as is the stated intent of the most recent CPS. The Bank can have
a positive role in the infrastructure sector (roads and power), given its past
successful interventions, as well as the priority the government places on rapid
infrastructure development. With its expertise in public-private partnership
advisory services and infrastructure financing, IFC could also make a contribution.

However, the Bank should be cautious about expanding into other infrastructure
subsectors, such as telecommunications and water—areas that the current CPS
indicates as potential areas of support—in order to avoid diffusion of efforts. A more
promising area, and the one that could also have a beneficial poverty impact, would
be to extend services to selected secondary cities through the development of local
government.

One potentially fruitful extension of the Bank’s involvement in infrastructure would
be in the development of selected secondary cities and market towns. Such a project
would have a potential impact in terms of spreading benefits to rural areas, which is
necessary both from a political economy perspective and for rural poverty
alleviation. The project would also be a vehicle to promote decentralization and local
government development, as suggested in chapter 3.

                           ENHANCING ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND NONRESOURCE SECTOR GROWTH
In the agriculture sector, the Bank should remain active given the importance of the
sector, but it needs to rethink its support. Bank support can only be effective if it is
recast with (i) a narrower focus on fewer areas; (ii) the building of successive project
interventions; (iii) simplification of project designs; and (d) a focus on institutional
sustainability beyond specific projects. Most important, the Bank needs to place its
support within a well-articulated sector strategy, something that has been missing
thus far.

There are opportunities for the IFC to play a more meaningful role in private sector
development in Zambia. It can work to explore business opportunities and attract
investors in areas such as the agribusiness value chain and tourism where Zambia
has potential, as well as in building linkages between mining and SMEs. To expand
the opportunities for more active operations, IFC needs to distinguish itself from an
increasing number of funding sources for high-performing Zambian corporate
clients. In this context, the value-added in nonfinancial areas becomes increasingly
important. IFC’s global knowledge, experiences, and network as well as expertise in
advising on environmental and social standards sets it apart from other financing
sources. The experiences during the review period show that the IFC has had
limited success in adjusting its role as Zambia receives growing interest from private
investors. It is an appropriate time for IFC to assess its role in Zambia’s transition to
a middle-income country and develop a strategic medium-term plan for project
development and client relationship building—something that it lacks at the
moment.


1   The data were obtained from the World Integrated Trade Solution.
2These were: an Adaptable Program Loan (APL) in 2004 for Road Rehabilitation and
Maintenance ($50 million), the second phase of an APL in 2009 ($75 million), and an
additional financing of $15 million in 2010.
3The 2008 CAS set a goal of average vehicle traffic on improved roads to increase from 3,480
in 2009 to 4,176 in 2010 and 5,046 in 2011. No information is available to assess performance.
4These projects are the Victoria Falls Transmission Line Reinforcement Project ($60 million
with $30 million in co-financing; 2011), and the Lusaka Transmission and Distribution
Project ($105 million with $105 million in co-financing; 2013).
5The Zambian government had received an offer from the Chinese government to fund the
project but, in the end, the project did not reach financial closure. At the time of IEG mission
to Zambia (March 2014), the government was in the process of structuring the transaction
with different financing arrangements.

hydropower stations (120 megawatts). Both the Lower Kafue and Ithezi-tezi projects are
envisaged to be constructed as public-private ventures.
7For importing, Zambia still costs 25 percent or more, as compared to neighboring
countries. It usually takes 56 days to process imports, partly due to a 100 percent check for
all imports (most of the countries are risk based and there is a 60 percent random check). For
exporting, it takes 46 days to process.
8For example in the fertilizer industry, the government paid an extra $20 million from the
cartel behavior of the industry being controlled by a few main market players.
9 IFC looked at other mining investment possibilities in Zambia (around 170 projects) and
did not find another investment opportunity. About 30 percent of projects were rejected
because of integrity due diligence issues (e.g., the contract award was not transparent).
Other projects were supported by major mining companies and did not require IFC
financing.
10They covered beef and dairy, tourism, copper mining, copper fabrication, the service
industry, and light manufacturing (textiles, leather, wood, metals, and agro processing).

13Zambia has also received a regional project in this area. It is one of three beneficiary
countries (Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia) of the regional Agricultural Productivity
Program for Southern Africa (APPSA). It was approved in 2013 and supports agricultural
research and development. Each of three countries focuses research on different crops, the
results of which are shared among all three participating countries. The total cost of the
regional project is about $95 million, with Zambia’s share as accounting for $29.8 million.
The project is just starting implementation, but the concept appears to be promising.
14Project components included: (i) a supply chain credit facility that was to provide short-
and medium- to long-term loans to agribusiness/commercial farmers to allow them to
strengthen agribusiness and linkages with smallholders; (ii) a market improvement and
innovation facility that provided matching grants for the development of innovative
business linkages to agricultural value chains; and (iii) and a rural roads improvement
facility for improving roads in high agricultural potential areas. The PDOs for the project
included increases in: agricultural exports from target value chains; commodities produced
by target out-grower schemes; and participating farmer incomes.

hectares with a three-year track record in farming.

5. Promoting Human Capital Development
In many resource-rich developing countries, the pace of poverty reduction and
human capital development lags behind that of macroeconomic growth, missing the
opportunities to translate the natural resource earnings into inclusive growth for the
population at large. This chapter covers the activities related to sharing the benefits
of economic growth more widely through interventions in the health, education,
and social protection sectors.

In comparison to countries with similar per capita income levels, Zambia lags
behind in various human development indicators. In the health sector, although
Zambia spends significantly more than its neighbors at about $871 per capita for
health, key health outcome indicators, such as life expectancy, lag behind
comparator countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (Figure 5.1). The acquired immune
deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and malaria were two critical causes of deaths in
Zambia during the evaluation period. As a consequence of the epidemic of the
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and AIDS in the 1990s and early 2000s, life
expectancy at birth in Zambia fell from 51 to 41 years. Likewise, malaria was the
leading cause of morbidity and the second highest cause of mortality, especially
among children when the FY04 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was prepared
(World Bank 2007b).

CHAPTER 5
PROMOTING HUMAN CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT
Regarding education, Zambia made progress in primary education enrollment, but
improving learning outcomes remains a challenge. Primary school net enrollment
rates increased from 73 percent in 1998 to 94 percent in 2012. Primary completion
rates improved from 68 percent to 91 percent, and the number of children out of
primary school drastically declined from approximately 500,000 to 124,000.
However, adult literacy rates are lower in Zambia than in neighboring countries
(Figure 5.2). The 2012 Zambian National Assessment Survey reports that that only
roughly 30 percent of Zambian learners (5th grade) are meeting minimum levels of
achievement in Reading in English, Mathematics, and Life Skills. Another study of
early grade reading and math skills in a sample of Bemba-speaking schools shows
severe learning deficits among Zambian students.

for economic diversification, but also to fill the deficiency in public service provision
in rural areas.


Bank Strategy and Programs
The Bank has been selective in choosing the areas of engagement in the education,
health, and social protection sectors during the evaluation period. According to the
2008 CAS, the government indicated that it would prefer to use scarce International
Development Association (IDA) resources for financing infrastructure, and would
finance social sector interventions either through its own resources or through grant
financing (World Bank 2008b). There were also a number of cooperating partners

that were capable of providing grant funding. In addition, the FY08 CAS noted that
there was a demand for the Bank’s analytical leadership in the social sectors, and
thus a need to direct the Bank’s focus on analytical activities, including managing
grant funding associated with global programs and grant resources provided by
bilateral cooperating partners. The broad areas of Bank Group activities and the
expected outcomes in these CASs are described here. A detailed listing of indicators
for the health, education, and social protection sectors can be found in table E.4 in
appendix E.

IMPROVING HEALTH
In the health sector, the Bank focused on addressing the human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV), acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), and malaria, which was
appropriate given the severity of their impact on the overall health status of the
Zambian population. Out of 14 CAS outcome indicators on health over the three
country strategy documents, nine are related to HIV/AIDS or malaria. The two
more recent country strategies also include indicators measuring improvements in
maternal health.

These indicators were largely met as the government made important progress in
controlling HIV/AIDS and malaria. The HIV prevalence and incidence rates
declined during the first decade of the 2000s, and the government effort to control
HIV/AIDS is broadly regarded as a success.2 Between 2000 and 2008, the annual
number of malaria deaths in the country decreased by at least 50 percent, which
contributed to a decline in the all-cause mortality rate for children under five years
of age by 29 percent between 2002 and 2007 (World Bank 2010).

The Bank’s main HIV/AIDS intervention helped to build the institutional capacity
that continues to be used in fighting HIV/AIDS, long after project completion in
2008. The Zambia National Response to HIV/AIDS (ZANARA) Project, approved in
FY03, was the main instrument used to help Zambia control HIV/AIDS. Feedback
from government counterparts consistently suggests that the project helped build
the capacity for project management, procurement, and monitoring and evaluation
of the relevant central and local organizations, including those at the community
and district levels. This capacity serves as the institutional foundation for fighting
HIV/AIDS today. The Bank also leveraged engagements in other projects to
enhance support to fight HIV/AIDS. For example, the Basic Education Sector Project
(approved in FY99) helped develop a strategy to integrate HIV/AIDS into the school
health and nutrition curriculum, and the Zambia Social Investment Fund (ZAMSIF)
Project supported the training of counselors and peer educators.

CHAPTER 5
PROMOTING HUMAN CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT
The project provided useful support for local authorities and communities and
helped to improve the Bank’s image in Zambia. The Community Response to HIV
and AIDS component of the project provided direct funding to community-based
initiatives and interventions, which helped enhance community ownership in
confronting HIV/AIDS. The Bank was seen as responsive to local demand because it
ensured reallocation of project resources for use at the district and local levels, as
and when justified. The community response component also focused on supporting
some of the most vulnerable groups, including orphans who had lost their parents
because of HIV/AIDS, as well as empowering grandmothers who were taking care
of these orphans. These types of support shed a positive light on the Bank’s image in
Zambia. Until then, the Bank’s image had been dominated by its perceived role in
structural adjustment and privatization, and the associated hardships experienced
by parts of the population.

Bank support in combatting HIV/AIDS has been largely successful, but the extent of
its contributions to the short-term results needs to be carefully calibrated. The key
area of Bank contributions is in institutional strengthening, particularly at the
community level—the true effects of which are expected to emerge over the long
term. However, an important part of the success seen in Zambia today is associated
with the direct effects from treatments made available through the purchasing of
drugs and financing of medical services.3 In this context, the financing by some
external development partners (including the U.S. government; the Global Fund to
Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; and the Gates Foundation) dwarfed the
amount provided by the Bank in this area.4

With respect to malaria, the Bank helped the government by sustaining financial
support at a time of uncertainty. The Bank’s main channel of support was the
Malaria Booster Project approved in FY06. Its project targets were substantially
achieved (Table 5.1). However, the sustainability of this success was threatened
when a corruption case involving the malaria program surfaced in 2008. Several key
donors withdrew funding, which led to a disruption in the preparation for the 2009–
2010 malaria season.

The Bank was able to maintain financial support, while also taking necessary
measures to safeguard its resources. It undertook an in-depth financial transactions
review in addition to the forensic audit led by Zambia’s Office of the Auditor
General. The amount identified as an ineligible expenditure was repaid by the
government ($ 1.3 million). Part of the amount was later found to be eligible through
further examination of evidence, and the Zambian government was reimbursed.

The FY04 CAS also aimed to reduce key constraints for better health outcomes as
measured by the efficient use of financial and human resources in the health sector,
as well as the reliable and sustainable provision of water in areas of Bank support.
With regard to enhancing the efficient use of financial and human resources in the
health sector, the Bank has had limited impact. The main operations considered at
the time of CAS preparation, the Health Sector Support Program and the Health
Poverty Reduction Support Credits, did not materialize. The Bank undertook a
Health Public Expenditure review to contribute to this objective. However, given the
continuing challenge of shortages of skilled human resources and high expenses in
the health sector, its effects are considered limited. In the future, the ongoing pilots
for results-based financing could provide a useful analytical base. The core of the
pilot is performance-based financing to health facilities. An impact evaluation of the
pilot phase is expected in the near future, and the recently approved Bank-financed
project, Health Services Improvement Project, aims to expand the use of results-
based financing.

 Regarding the reliable and sustainable provision of water, the health outcomes of
the two water sector operations are not clear. The review by the Independent
Evaluation Group of the Mine Township Services Project reports some

improvements in constancy of water supply, solid waste collection, and sewerage
treatment in five townships affected by the privatization of the Zambia Consolidated
Copper Mines. The self-evaluation of the Water Sector Performance Improvement
Project reports an improvement in access to safe water and institutional
strengthening in the urban water sector. However, there is no assessment as to
whether or how these operations contributed to better health outcomes.

STRENGTHENING SKILLS AND EDUCATION
In the education sector, the Bank supported efforts for primary education
enrollment, vocational and technical education, and public expenditure reviews. The
focus of support for primary education was tightened from a broad objective
encompassing completion rates, learning achievements, and admission rates in the
FY04 CAS to exclusively focus on completion rates in the 2007 CAS. Outcome
indicators related to the quality of technical and vocational education and training
are included in both the 2004 and 2007 CASs.

The main Bank contribution to primary education was through rehabilitation and
construction of school infrastructure to accommodate an expansion in student
enrollment. The IDA-financed Basic Education Subsector Project contributed to 65
percent of the total classrooms and teachers' houses constructed and rehabilitated
under the government program (World Bank 2007a). The project also aimed to
improve learning outcomes through the provision of learning materials and
strengthening of teacher training. However, given the persistent challenge in
improving learning outcomes, it is likely that the effects of these activities have been
marginal.

Regarding vocational and technical education, the objective of creating a system
capable of improving worker skills for the formal and informal sectors was only
modestly achieved. Skill development through vocational and technical training was
a key CAS objective during the evaluation period. Financial and managerial
autonomy in the publicly owned training institutions, as well as the establishment of
an autonomous national training authority responsible for regulation and quality
assurance, were considered important for progress. However, IDA support for the
TVET Development Support Program (approved in FY01) did not lead to the
envisaged transformation of the sector governance and financing framework.

The intended activities for sector information management, a skills development
strategy and policy development were not accomplished. The Program
Coordination Office supported by the project was seen as operating in a semi-
detached manner, and training providers felt that the program did not reflect the
needs on the ground. Training initiatives for the informal sector were successfully

                                                                              CHAPTER 5
                                                    PROMOTING HUMAN CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT
piloted through a competitive fund, but these initiatives ceased when the donor
funding ended. The project also had an explicit focus on encouraging women to
undertake vocational training. However, gender balance had an unrealistic target of
a 25 percent increase in the share of female TEVET graduates, and the target was not
met (IEG 2011).

The Bank produced a series of analyses on education expenditures, which were well
received by the government and the donor community, but their impact on the
policy debate is unclear. In 2002, the Bank helped the Ministry of Education carry
out an Expenditure and Service Delivery Survey to examine the structure of funding
and service delivery in the education sector. In addition, the Education Sector Public
Expenditure Review and a public expenditure tracking survey were undertaken in
2006 and 2008, respectively. These reports informed the Ministry of Education about
the efficiency and equity of fund flows and identified areas that required policy
actions. However, there is little evidence as to how these analyses actually helped
change education expenditures in Zambia.

HELPING POOR AND VULNERABLE GROUPS—SOCIAL PROTECTION
There are no specific CAS outcome targets for the social protection sector, although
the Bank supported an important social protection sector mapped project—the
Zambia Social Investment Fund Project approved in FY00. The project was the key
operation to support poor and vulnerable groups in local communities, and it
helped to strengthen their capacity. It provided useful support for building quality
rural infrastructure through community-based initiatives. More importantly, the
project helped build a valuable local institutional capacity for implementing
HIV/AIDS and malaria programs, as well as the ongoing pilot program for climate
resilience (box 5.1).

The project aimed to reinforce the anticipated efforts toward decentralizing the
management of resources to local entities. However, the Bank saw that the
systematic efforts to strengthen local participation waned during project
implementation, and it did not proceed with the originally envisaged second phase
of the project. In addition, the project self-evaluation reports it has helped address
some of the gender-related issues through focus group discussions during the
Participatory Rural Appraisal processes. However, its effects are not clear, as the
beneficiary figures in the project monitoring system were not disaggregated by
gender, beyond the composition of the subproject committee membership (World
Bank 2008a).

A recent Bank report on social safety nets in Zambia has raised awareness about the
weaknesses of the existing transfer and subsidy programs. The report (World Bank


                                                                                     61
CHAPTER 5
PROMOTING HUMAN CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT
2013d) found that Zambia spends substantially on transfer and subsidy programs.
However, most of it goes to the better-off, and almost none of the very poor are
benefiting from public transfer program. Given the attention this report has drawn
from policy makers in Zambia, the actions that stem from the ensuing dialogue
could lead to important improvements in sharing the benefits of economic growth
more widely. The report recommends a move toward an integrated social safety net
system composed of expanded cash transfers for the most vulnerable; public works
for routine maintenance and environmental measures; and an element to promote
better behavior and decision making. The Bank is also helping Zambian officials
learn from experiences in other countries (for example, Brazil) through encouraging
cross-country knowledge sharing opportunities.

Under the theme of improved lives and protecting the vulnerable, the FY04 CAS
aimed to increase the resilience of poor households and communities in areas
vulnerable to droughts and floods. The Emergency Drought Recovery Project (FY03)
included elements of building resilience to climate variability in the design.
However, the overall effect is not clear due to a lack of information. At the same
time, this project has made an important contribution: it helped increase the
resilience of farmers who applied sustainable land management techniques. About
35 percent of project participants adopted conservation farming practices, and
farmers who had continued the conservation farming suffered much lower crop
losses than farmers applying traditional farming practices in the 2004-05 dry season
(IEG 2007b).


Assessment and Lessons
There is a strong case for the Bank’s decision to be selective in its support of the
health, education, and social protection sectors over the evaluation period.
Regarding health, the Bank focused on two diseases with the most impact on the
lives of the Zambian people. In the education sector, skill development and
vocational training formed the core part of intervention. The Bank continued to
provide analytical work in all of these areas. These decisions are appropriate based
on the government preference, limited IDA allocation, and the presence of active
operations financed by other donor institutions.

Important outcomes from past interventions are associated with working at the
community level. The community support component of the ZANARA project and
the community-based activities under the ZAMSIF projects are cases in point. The
Bank is right to build on these experiences, as in the recently approved project to
support health services, which aims to leverage community organizations. However,



62
                                                                                CHAPTER 5
                                                     PROMOTING HUMAN CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT
to further increase the effectiveness of these efforts, progress in the overall
decentralization plan will be an important factor. The Bank also made positive
contributions in the health sector and the ZAMSIF project, but the objective to
improve skill development and education was not met. The Bank’s analytical work
has been of high quality and appreciated by the government and cooperating
partners. The recent report on the social safety nets has spurred momentum for
reform. However, it appears that analyses in other reports have had limited effect on
improvement in policies or public service delivery performance.

Taking these results and the selective approach the Bank chose to follow into
consideration, the overall outcomes of Bank operations in these areas were
moderately satisfactory. A key lesson from this review is that the Bank can be
effective in strengthening institutions at the local level and in providing flexible
support, depending on the needs on the ground.

Despite economic growth, wide income disparity and a persistent rural-urban gap
indicate the need to address rural poverty. To support such an effort, a continuing
emphasis on support to local communities could be useful. In this context, the focus
on primary and community-level maternal, newborn, and child health and nutrition
services in the new Health Service Improvement Project seems promising. The
project focus also indicates a departure from the prior disease-based vertical
approach. Given the broad-based nature of health challenges in Zambia, this also
seems to be a natural step to take. However, for improvement in a wide area of rural
livelihoods to take place, a more integrated approach that combines efforts in
relevant areas including infrastructure, private sector development, agriculture, and
decentralization would be needed.


1   The WDI data were available only through 2011.
2The 2007 Zambia Demographic Health Survey estimates the prevalence rate of the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to be 14.3 percent for adults nationally—a decline of more
than 2 percentage points over five years.
3For example, there was a significant improvement in coverage of prevention of mother to
child transmission of HIV between 2008 and 2011. This was due largely to a booster made
available through U.S. government funding (National AIDS Council 2012).
4The Bank is one of the few early contributors to Zambia’s effort in combating HIV and the
acquired immune deficiency syndrome. At the start of the ZANARA project in 2003, the
Bank provided about 22 percent of $8 million of total donor funding in this area. However,
when donor financing reached the annual average of $258 million between 2006 and 2008—
the share of the ZANARA project was about 9 percent. The same percentage became about 1
percent at the closing of the project in 2008. In addition, some of the high-risk, high-

transmission groups (for example, miners, sex workers, and long-distance truck drivers)
were not fully captured in the objectives of the Bank-supported projects. Gains made
through behavioral changes among these groups are therefore not linked directly to Bank-
financed operations.

6. Cross-Cutting Issues
This chapter discusses how the two cross-cutting themes of the clustered country
program evaluation (CPE)—gender and environment—were addressed in the
context of the Zambia country program during the period of this review.


Environment
Zambia is richly endowed with natural resources, including land, wildlife, forests
and water. Over 60 percent of the land area is covered by forest and 31 percent are
protected areas. However, the forests are subject to rapid deforestation estimated at
about 250,000 to 300,000 hectares per year, mainly driven by the widespread use of
wood fuel and charcoal, timber production, and unsustainable land use practices.
National Parks and Game Management Areas (GMAs) cover about 30 percent of the
land and provide a solid basis for the development of tourism. Wildlife is protected
in the National Parks and hunting is permitted through a licensing system in the
surrounding GMAs. Compared to other countries in southern Africa, Zambia is also
well endowed with water resources. However, because of high spatial and seasonal
variability, the country is very sensitive to recurrent floods and droughts, which are
likely to be increased in scale and number by climate change in future.

Zambia’s pollution issues are concentrated in the mining regions. A decade ago,
major environmental issues in the Copperbelt and in Kabwe were identified as:1

      Air Pollution. The copper smelters emitted 300,000 to 700,000 tons per year of
       sulfur dioxide (SO2) into the air.
      Soil contamination. SO2 emissions from the smelter contaminate the soils
       downwind of the smelter and causes loss of vegetation.
      Water pollution. Runoff and leakage from mine tailing dumps and dams were
       polluting mine area streams, causing widespread downstream impacts that
       extended to the Kafue River and adjacent wetlands.
      Lead contamination. In Kabwe, tens of thousands of residents (including about
       9,000 children) had been exposed to high levels of lead contamination, both
       from naturally occurring mineralization in the soil and the impact of the zinc
       mining and smelting operations.

The Word Bank Group’s 2004 and 2008 strategies do not have an explicit focus or a
dedicated pillar on environment and sustainable natural resources management.
Instead, environmental activities were included to support the diversification



                                                                                    65
CHAPTER 6
CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES
strategy (tourism development and National Parks management) and the mining
sector privatization agenda. This was in line with the government’s Fifth and Sixth
NDPs, which did not identify environment as a stand-alone strategic theme, but as
one of the cross-cutting issues. The FY13–16 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)
explicitly incorporates climate variability risks as one of the vulnerability factors for
its Pillar 1 focus is on poverty reduction.

The main Bank Group interventions with environmental and climate change
activities focused on three areas:

        Tourism and sustainable management of the National Parks;
        Environmental compliance as a part of the privatization process; and
        Climate resilience and climate change mitigation.

The Bank’s two operations in support of tourism and sustainable park management
achieved some environmental results. The GEF-funded Miombo Woodland Project
promoted integrated ecosystem management and conservation farming as an
alternative for traditional slash-and-burn (chitemene) agriculture. However, the
project reached 400 ha, which is a fraction of its target area—6,000 ha. Its impact is
also questionable because of weak monitoring and evaluation as well as the absence
of incentives to prevent the recurrence of slash-and burn practices.

The Support to Economic Expansion and Diversification Project (SEED) (see chapter
4) was intended to improve the business environment for sustainable tourism in the
greater Livingstone area and securing critical wildlife habitats in the Kafue and
Mosi-o-Tunya National Parks. While the business environment improvement
objective was not fully achieved, the Kafue National Park, the largest in Zambia, was
rehabilitated and turned into attractive tourist destination. The number and
distribution of wildlife has also been stabilized, as confirmed by surveys and
observations (World Bank 2012b). It should be noted, however, that the
sustainability of both projects was affected by lack of general support from the
government on overall policy, legal and institutional reforms.

The Copperbelt Environment Project aimed to address the adverse environmental
legacy accrued over years and facilitate the privatization of the copper industry. The
key mining induced environmental problems at the time of project appraisal
included such issues as air pollution, soil contamination, water pollution, risk of
failure of tailing dams, and lead poisoning. The project was also intended to
strengthen the regulatory and institutional frameworks for controlling
environmental impacts related to mining. By the time the project was completed, it
had successfully mitigated the environmental issues associated with historic mining

                                                                        CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES
activities and prevented further deterioration of air, water and soil quality in the
region. This was achieved despite an increase of more than 100 percent in copper
production between 2003 and 2010. The project also helped improve the reputation
and capacity of the environmental regulatory institutions. However, indications are
that the strengthening of enforcement capacity remains a work in progress, as
suggested by continuing repots about mining sector chemical spills in the
Copperbelt in 2007, 2011, and 2013.2

In spite of the country’s growing vulnerability to climate change, there was an eight-
year gap between the Bank Group’s two explicit interventions on this issue. The
Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) was the first Bank Group intervention
to explicitly address Zambia’s climate vulnerability following an eight-year hiatus
after the closure of the Emergency Drought Recovery project (discussed in Chapter
5), which included elements of building resilience to climate variability (see box 6.1).
The PPCR was designed in cooperation with the International Finance Corporation,
African Development Bank, and other partners. Under the recently completed Phase
I, climate change risks have been systematically mainstreamed into the Sixth
National Development Plan’s sector strategies. With about 20–30 percent in
budgetary allocation towards adaptation activities in the 2011 budget, a National
Coordination Secretariat for Climate Change was set up under the Ministry of
Finance, and a Disaster Management Act was adopted to help address climate-
related disasters and require more climate resilience development planning at the
local and national levels.


 Box 6.1. Pilot Program for Climate Resilience
 The Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) under the Climate Investment Funds is a
 two-phase program to address Zambia’s climate vulnerability in such areas as
 agriculture, energy, food security, forestry, health, water, and wildlife. It was designed
 jointly with the government, the Bank, International Finance Corporation, African
 Development Bank and other contributors. The first phase of the PPCR, which was
 completed in FY14, aimed to assist Zambia in the formulation of the Programmatic
 Framework for Climate Resilience to be financed under the Sixth National Development
 Plan. The self-evaluation by the Climate Investment Fund in October 2013 suggests that
 there was progress in the mainstreaming of climate risks and opportunities with a
 number of sectoral strategies. An important institutional set-up that came out of this
 activity is the Secretariat for Climate Change, which was established under the Ministry
 of Finance. It includes representatives from the Zambian government, nongovernmental
 organizations, and the private sector. Phase II of the PPCR, which was approved in FY13,
 focuses on the institutional framework for climate resilience, and improving the adaptive
 capacity of vulnerable communities in the Barotse sub-basin.

CHAPTER 6
CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES
Overall, the Bank Group assistance to the strengthening of environmental
management generated some positive outcomes, but their sustainability is doubtful.
The most important achievement was the rehabilitation of Kafue National Park,
including the stabilization of its wildlife population. The Copperbelt Environment
Project successfully mitigated historic environmental liabilities, but the
strengthening of environmental enforcement capacity remains a work in progress.
On the other hand, building resilience to climate change variability, which had been
effectively promoted under the Emergency Recovery Project, was subject to a
lengthy eight-year gap when no progress was made. In addition, forest degradation
and deforestation was not addressed, and has continued unabated. The long-term
sustainability of the Bank’s contributions remains doubtful in face of a general lack
of government support for necessary policy, legal and institutional reforms.


Gender
Successive country strategies during the evaluation period have recognized the
magnitude of gender inequalities in the country. The FY04-FY07 CAS points out the
barriers that gender disparities pose to Zambia’s low economic growth. It attributes
poverty reduction to closing gender gaps in education, health, decision making, and
access to and control over productive resources. The FY08-FY11 CAS notes that the
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome
(AIDS) epidemics had reached a mature stage and suggests that the “feminization of
the AIDS epidemic” is evident in Zambia. More women than men have become
infected by HIV/AIDS, caused to a large degree by gender discrimination, social
restrictions, gender-based violence, as well as by women's lack of access to
education, employment and decision-making power. The FY13–16 CPS continues to
emphasize the specific challenges faced by women in health, education, labor force
participation, agriculture, and access to land.

Although these strategies emphasize the need to recognize and act on gender-
related issues in sectoral interventions, it is not clear how this recognition was
translated into operations. The FY04–07 CAS mentions that women dominate the
agricultural sector and do most of the farm work, but they do not have control over
or access to resources. It indicates that sector policies and programs need to
explicitly recognize and act on gender-differentiated structural roles in agriculture.
However, the emphasis on gender disparities has yet to be translated into an
increased focus on women in agriculture.

The Bank also committed to addressing gender issues in its analytic and advisory
activities (AAA) and to mainstreaming gender in Bank operations as part of its

                                                                      CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES
development priorities. Following this commitment, a major piece of AAA, the
Zambia Strategic Country Gender Assessment, was completed in 2005. It focused on
several important aspects of gender such as women’s economic roles in the
household and in the market, discrimination against women in the dual legal
frameworks of customary and constitutional laws, gender dimensions of poverty,
and gender disparities in human development indicators (Milimo and others 2004).

However, its recommendations were very broad and hard to implement. These
included engendering key instruments for development; aligning national laws to
gender-based protections; and providing equality in access to and control over
increased production. The FY08-12 CAS points out that it was not clear how this
report was utilized in operations, even though some of the Bank-supported
operations in the human development sectors exhibited gender-sensitive elements in
their activities. Another gender review conducted in 2012 primarily covered eight
projects financed by the International Development Association (World Bank 2012a).
The review recommended that portfolio activities make better use of analytical work
in the design of projects to incorporate country and sector level gender issues. It
emphasized that at the project-level, greater gender emphasis needed to be
incorporated in the infrastructure, and the water sector. Finally, it pointed to
education and gender-based violence as two areas where gender relevant work was
not covered in the portfolio activities.

To make progress in gender related issues in Zambia, working on the linkages
between gender and agriculture is key. Limited women’s access to agricultural
inputs and the customary law, which determines land allocation and inheritance,
remain major challenges for women in the agriculture sector and rural areas in
general. In the year 2000, only 10 percent of female-headed households in rural areas
had titles to land (AFDB 2006). Women’s lack of land ownership has a negative
effect on their access to credit, since financial institutions often require land or other
similar assets as collateral from loan applicants (World Bank 2012a).

The Irrigation Development and Support Project (IDSP) (FY10) and Livestock
Development and Animal Health Project (FY12) plan to emphasize gender-relevant
dimensions of agriculture. More specifically, they include such activities as tracking
data disaggregated by gender, taking into account female participation in
beneficiary focus groups and establishing a special window to support investments
and business skills training by women and vulnerable groups. The IDSP draws on
three analytical studies on gender in agriculture in Zambia.3 The project adopts a
participatory approach to land use planning, and plans to give women preferential
access to group and individual training events. However, in the recent ISR (January
2014), the only indicator tracked so far is the number of female beneficiaries. It was 5

CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES
percent of the total (321 beneficiaries), with a target of 30 percent female
beneficiaries that was to be achieved by 2013. Since the project is still active, the
outcomes remain to be seen.4

In the health sector, both the Zambia National Response to HIV/AIDS Project and
the malaria project incorporated gender aspects relevant to the respective
interventions. In particular, the malaria project included a significant maternal
health focus and tracked several gender-based indicators.5 However, a broader set of
gender-related challenges in health remain in Zambia. The Bank has yet to address
these challenges given the selective approach it took during the period covered by
this evaluation. These challenges include the lack of progress in maternal mortality,
and regional as well as urban-rural disparities in the quality of healthcare for
women.

In summary, the Bank recognized gender disparities in health, education, and labor
force participation in the CASs, and conducted analytical work on gender. However,
there was little emphasis on integrating or addressing gender issues beyond
individual project interventions. In the health sector, the Bank focused its attention
on gender issues related to the HIV/AIDS and malaria projects, but it did not
directly address other gender-related issues in the health sector in general, such as
high fertility rates and high maternal mortality. The issues related to job creation or
entrepreneurship in the formal and informal sectors for women were left largely
unaddressed. Overall, there has been progress in integrating gender aspects in
recent sectoral interventions, but the lack of a gender-targeted approach has made it
challenging to address and track gender based outcomes.

women’s voice, participation and control over agricultural resources. Additional measures
need to be taken to integrate women as producers, food processors, or small entrepreneurs
as a means to empower women and sensitize men to change gender relations (Poutiainen
and Mills 2014).

7. Conclusions and Recommendations
From 2004 to 2012, Zambia experienced a combination of good economic policies
and high rates of growth not seen since the early years after independence. The
macroeconomic situation was brought under control with government deficits being
reduced to 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). Fiduciary controls,
particularly the external audit and public procurement offices, were strengthened.
The Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative agreement and the Multilateral
Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) almost eliminated public debt and provided the fiscal
space for selective, high-priority investments.

The privatization of the copper mines brought new investment in rehabilitation and
the expansion of production. Together with buoyant copper prices, this drove new
construction, a rapid expansion of the consumer sector in Lusaka, and the growth of
the agri-business sector serving both domestic demand and exports. With
conservative management of the financial sector, Zambia was able to ride out the
global recession in comfort, rapidly resuming growth. The period also saw a
substantial expansion of primary education and progress in dealing with the most
pervasive public health problems—the spread of the human immunodeficiency
virus, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and malaria. Regarding analytic and
advisory activities, the Bank produced quality economic work and technical
assistance, some of which has had a positive impact, for example, with regard to
agriculture subsidies, and the implementation of Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative.

These positive developments set the stage for tackling many of the more difficult
underlying problems still facing the Zambian economy, including:

        Pervasive poverty, particularly in rural Zambia;
        The under-investment in rehabilitation and expansion of infrastructure;
        The continuing ineffectiveness of public sector management with the failure
         to implement modern financial management systems and to put in place
         arrangements for screening and implementing public investment programs;
        Significant agricultural policy distortions;
        The poor quality of education and health services;
        The continuing over-centralization of the administrative system, with little or
         no decentralization of authority to local governments.

The Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) provided critical support
when Zambia’s debt level became unsustainable. Zambia’s critical debt situation in

                                                       CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
the late 1990s and early 2000s led to a genuine policy dialogue and helped the
government take much needed, but politically difficult, policy actions. The
incentives for improved performance for the achievement of HIPC and MDRI
completion were present, and there was significant progress on the macroeconomic
and privatization fronts. Arguably, these are the signal achievements that set the
stage for Zambia’s ability to take advantage of the reversal of copper prices and the
larger revenues from mining.

The Bank was able to promote robust macro-policies together with the IMF and
support from the multi-donor budget support program. However, the Bank’s role
waned afterward as the increase in international copper prices led to rapid economic
growth in Zambia. In the meantime, some of the longer-term weaknesses—the
failure to get sufficient traction by the government on implementing the Integrated
Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) and on decentralization—
became apparent. In addition, confusion emerged with the Poverty Reduction
Support Credits (PRSCs), where the Bank was out of alignment with the rest of the
donor community. A disconnect also emerged between the triggers agreed between
the Bank for the PRSCs and the list included in the donor-supported Performance
Assessment Framework.

During the evaluation period, the Bank was effective in supporting institutional
strengthening in areas where its focus was clearly defined. More specifically, the
Bank provided useful support in the health, roads, and power sectors, as well as for
improving audit and procurement frameworks. The support in the health sector
focused only on the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), acquired immune
deficiency syndrome (AIDS), and malaria. Through health sector interventions and
the Zambia Social Investment Fund (ZAMSIF) Project, the Bank helped to strengthen
the local institutional capacity to continue implementing activities even after the
Bank credit was closed. The Bank was also sensitive to local community needs and
applied flexibility to reallocate project resources.

The Bank was successful in supporting institutional and policy reforms in the road
and power sectors. The Bank played a lead role in helping to establish a framework
for road financing and prioritization. In the power sector, the Bank was successful in
promoting the commercialization of the Zambia Electric Supply Corporation as the
appropriate strategy, but only after it changed its previous insistence on unbundling
that was not considered appropriate given the state of the sector. Success in local
community support through the ZAMSIF and health sector projects, and
appropriate calibration of the country-specific context in the power sector, together
demonstrate the value that locally specific knowledge, particularly on the political
economy associated with reforms, can bring.

CHAPTER 7
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Throughout the evaluation period, the Bank was unable to make much impact on
the public investment management system. Bank Group contributions to nonmining
private sector investment growth to reduce reliance on copper have been limited.
Bank efforts in agriculture have not been based on a well-articulated sector strategy
underpinned by extensive analytical work, and have high risk with regard to
institutional sustainability. The country program outcome targets on skill
development were only modestly achieved. The International Finance Corporation
(IFC) made some potentially consequential investments to advance diversification of
the economy, but its overall program and contributions in Zambia remained small.
IFC was one of the many funding sources available in the market, and its value
proposition has yet to be articulated clearly to the private companies in Zambia.

Taking into consideration the assessment of Bank Group relevance and effectiveness
in the four pillars, this evaluation rates the overall outcome as moderately
unsatisfactory. The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) rates the macroeconomic
and fiscal stabilities as well as the human capital development pillars as moderately
satisfactory. The remaining two pillars—governance and economic diversification—
are rated moderately unsatisfactory. The overall rating took into account the relative
importance of each pillar in the Zambia country program during the evaluation
period. The human capital development pillar was a relatively small component of
the Bank Group operations, whereas governance and economic diversification were
a major focus of Bank support throughout the period (see appendix F for the
summary assessment by pillar).


Recommendations
The evaluation of Bank Group activities in Zambia during the period from 2004 to
2013 points to several areas to be strengthened further in its future Zambia country
program. In looking ahead, a key element that defines the environment for Zambia’s
poverty reduction effort is that the medium term outlook for Zambia’s fiscal
revenues is positive. Resources from the copper boom, which until recently had
largely accrued to the private sector, began to show in the government budget. It
also became evident that Zambia would be able to access funds on the international
capital markets on relatively favorable terms, especially given its low debt levels and
the expectation of a continuation of high copper prices with substantially higher
government revenues.

However, Zambia faces growing risks to macroeconomic stability as its deficit has
risen to 6.6 percent of GDP. With growing debt levels as well, the country is very
vulnerable to a downturn in copper prices. While there has been some success in

                                                         CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
diversification through increased commercial agricultural production and exports,
as well as increased tourism, growth remains dependent on the demand for services
and construction resulting from investment in the copper mining sector. There has
been little progress on poverty reduction, and the human development indicators
are among the lowest relative to per capita income of any country in the world.
Progress on public financial management continues at a slow pace as there are
further delays in making the IFMIS operational and a virtual absence of any
movement toward decentralization.

It will not be an easy task to achieve a substantial improvement in outcomes of Bank
support in the future. There is the legacy of a difficult past relationship and a
residual lack of trust to overcome. It will take efforts on both sides to achieve a better
working relationship. On the Bank side, there needs to be recognition that the Bank’s
value proposition in Zambia is no longer the money it puts on the table, but the
knowledge and experience it can share with the Zambian authorities, whether
provided through lending operations or analytic and advisory work. Equally, on the
Zambian side, there needs to be recognition that the access the Bank provides to
global knowledge networks and the experience it brings to the table are resources
that can be tapped for more effective and efficient growth and poverty reduction.

The current Bank strategy appears to be moving in the right direction in setting a
stage for undertaking a meaningful dialogue. There is a serious effort to build trust
with the government. The Bank Country Director is now based in Lusaka, which
demonstrates the Bank’s commitment to build a robust relationship. The Bank is
trying to work in areas where the Zambian government has shown openness to
engage, such as agriculture and infrastructure. There is a stepping back from some
of the more confrontational areas of the program, such as macroeconomic policies
and governance, although the Bank continues to carry out important analytic work
in these areas.

The most recent country program strategy calls for selectivity in Bank Group
interventions; it should make serious efforts to implement this principle into reality.
At both the Bank and the IFC, there have been many attempts to find entries for
possible future support through trust funds, nonlending services, and other tools.
Irrespective of the merits of the individual proposals, excessive explorations can
divert scarce Bank Group and government capacity into too many areas. Selectivity
that allows for sustained Bank Group support and engagement will be important for
building trust and demonstrating visible results. The small size of the economy and
correspondingly small allocation from the International Development Association,
plus the presence of other significant donors, should allow Bank to be selective in its

CHAPTER 7
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
interventions. For the Bank Group to provide effective support under these
circumstances, IEG makes the following recommendations.

Recommendation 1: Help the authorities prepare for potential copper price
volatility by jointly exploring alternative scenarios and appropriate arrangements
for sound fiscal management and monitoring over the medium-term as well as for
developing contingency plans.

With its dependence on copper, Zambia will continue to be vulnerable to periodic
price shocks. The most appropriate strategy for Zambia would be to maintain a
sound fiscal framework, as well as a sustainable fiscal deficit and debt profile. One
approach to consider would be for the government to set credible ceilings on
recurrent expenditures with additional revenues going for investment. It would be
important for the Bank to explore and take advantage of any opportunities for
initiating a dialogue with the government on this subject.

While the details of such an arrangement should be defined through close dialogue
with the government, a possible mechanism could be to channel all mineral
revenues above a certain percentage of GDP (for example, 2 percent—the level that
prevailed from 2005–2010), and all market borrowing into investment under a
framework designed to mitigate the effects of short-term booms and busts in copper
pricing. A fiscal rule on the level of salaries as a share of the budget or GDP would
also be appropriate. Given the levels of borrowing, it would also be necessary to set
a fiscal rule on the appropriate level of external debt to GDP. In the absence of such
rules, the Bank could systematically monitor and analyze the performance against
these yardsticks, and provide the Zambian government and public with this
information, as well as information on the performance of key comparator countries.

The Bank, jointly with IMF, should also maintain a dialogue on macroeconomic and
fiscal policies. They should be prepared to step in with exceptional budget support
in case of an abrupt downturn in prices. The Bank should also support Zambia’s
efforts in maintaining access to international financial markets that could be tapped
if the need arises. Further, it would be important to undertake necessary analysis to
develop realistic contingency plans for dealing with price downturns. The Bank
should proceed together with the government and the IMF to explore the
implications of alternative scenarios triggered by declines in copper prices and
government revenues.

Recommendation 2: Focus governance and institutional strengthening support on
building government capacity for the efficient use of fiscal resources including
IFMIS implementation, and decentralization. Leverage Bank interventions at the

                                                                               CHAPTER 7
                                                        CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

project level (for example, through requiring IFMIS and decentralized decision
making for Bank-supported projects).

With the strong medium-term outlook for fiscal revenues, it is increasingly urgent
for the government to build its capacity to use these resources efficiently and
effectively. IFMIS implementation needs to reach a satisfactory completion point to
enhance accountability and transparency of fiscal resource management. The Bank
could play a useful role in these areas through support in such aspects as training,
project evaluation, preparation, monitoring and implementation.

To make progress in these areas that cut across sectors, there may be room for the
Bank to leverage its current engagements with the government. More specifically, as
suggested in chapter 4, the Bank needs to build on the start it has made with
through leveraging its three agriculture projects to support the full implementation
of the IFMIS in the Ministry of Agriculture. Leveraging these inter-linkages could
also be useful for other policy agenda items, such as decentralization. As the
agriculture project sites are often located in rural areas, some of these projects could
be used to support the decentralization process through management at the local
level.

Recommendation 3: Work with the transport, power, and health ministries to
develop a portfolio of priority projects for implementation, and strengthen their
capacity to more effectively manage implementation. Bring IFC and MIGA into
the sector dialogue and explore potential collaboration.

In the past, the Bank’s posture in Zambia tended to focus on not doing the wrong
things, of avoiding waste and inefficiency and reducing costly and regressive
subsidies. It has had problems in positioning itself in support of growth and poverty
reduction. Even when Bank reports include these topics in their titles, they tend to
focus their recommendations on greater efficiency. The Bank needs to recognize the
political pressures that the government faces to increase investment in human and
especially physical capital. It should work with the government to suggest where
such investments can have the highest pay-off, and identify activities that can be
carried out relatively quickly and provide returns within the political cycle.

This will require analytic work at the sector level to develop strategic approaches
and identify investment opportunities. In spite of a substantial program of analytic
work in Zambia, the work at the sector level has been thin and, as indicated, has
often focused on policy issues rather than investment opportunities.

The Bank has built up good relationships with selected sector ministries and the
evaluation recommends that it continue to focus on these areas and not allow itself


                                                                                      77
CHAPTER 7
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
to be drawn too widely into other areas ( for example, education, water and
communications). The Bank can also continue to play a role in mobilizing additional
donor and/or private funding for its projects. With its experiences in PPP advisory
work in other countries and its diverse menu of infrastructure financing including
guarantees, loans, and equity investments, IFC can also make considerable
contributions. The opportunities for collaboration with IFC in leveraging private
sector financing should be pursued whenever possible.

Recommendation 4: Conduct a sector analysis and put in place a strategy for Bank
support for agriculture, using potential synergies from the Bank, IFC, and MIGA
with the latter two institutions in particular playing a larger role. Ongoing
projects should be recast and integrated into the strategy.

Agriculture is a key sector in the government’s efforts to achieve economic
diversification and the Bank should remain an active player. The effective linking of
smallholders into agricultural value chains could also contribute to reducing
poverty in rural Zambia. However, the multiple Bank project interventions in this
area have yet to demonstrate their benefits clearly and lack synergies between each
other. A strategic view of relevant interventions by various players would be useful
to increase effectiveness of support in this sector. The findings of this evaluation also
point to the need to take stock of the existing interventions, and redesign or
restructure some of those plagued by design complexity. Efforts should also be
made to ensure institutional sustainability for activities in the sector beyond specific
projects. Focused sector work should be undertaken collaboratively with the
government to identify the sector priorities and sequencing of support. Most
importantly, the Bank needs to place its support within a well-articulated sector
strategy, something that has been missing so far.

Leveraging the knowledge and capacity across the Bank Group in agriculture is also
important. Agribusiness value chains should offer substantial investment
opportunities for IFC and potential synergies with the World Bank, which could
finance the links between smallholder operations and larger private agribusiness
partners supported by IFC. MIGA has established notable exposure in this sector in
Zambia. The Bank Group needs to be more pro-active in leveraging these inter-
linkages between institutions.

Recommendation 5: Make addressing rural poverty a more central part not just of
Bank strategy documents, but of the Bank’s operational program. While there are
poverty-related interventions in agriculture and health, the Bank needs to develop
a strategic approach, looking at various options for having an impact on rural
poverty in the medium term.

                                                      CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Zambia is becoming two different countries—one is a narrow strip down the central
corridor of the country, where more than half of the population lives and where
growth and development are concentrated; and the other is the two large wings
where the other half of the population is thinly spread and where poverty, disease
and illiteracy remain endemic. Even with current rates of migration, there will
continue to be a large minority of very poor people in the ‘wings’ in the foreseeable
future.

The Zambian authorities and the Bank need to work together to develop an
approach to promoting rural development and poverty reduction that is affordable
and effective. The Bank needs to carry out analytic work to understand this spatial
dimension of Zambian development and to develop programs to pilot various
models. It needs to explore options such as conditional cash transfers and to
consider whether it should resume support for a CDD program in Zambia. In
addition, it could look at the possibility of supporting the development of market
towns that can serve as growth poles for rural areas. An increased emphasis on
inclusive growth and poverty reduction should be a major part of the repositioning
of the Bank in Zambia.

 Goals1                    Achievement of Associated CAS/CPS Outcomes Or Results                        Ratings2
 First Pillar: Maintaining Macroeconomic and Fiscal Stabilities                                         Moderately
 The Bank and the IMF successfully exploited the leverage provided by the HIPC initiative and           satisfactory
 the MDRI to achieve progress on privatization and some follow through on fiscal
 management. The reductions in debt servicing created substantial fiscal space and the
 successful mining privatization combined with surging copper prices set the stage for new
 investment and growth. Given the vested interests involved and the political risks, it would
 have been very difficult for the government to achieve this without the involvement of the
 Bank and the IMF, and probably also without the impetus provided by the HIPC initiative.
 Subsequent to debt relief, the Bank shifted its focus to the diversification and human capital
 development agenda. It seemed that the key structural problems had been dealt with and the
 ongoing responsibility for fiscal stability and sustainability rested mainly with the IMF dialogue.
 Despite the positive start to the period under review, the specific outcomes supported by the
 first two CASs were only partially achieved. The government moved very slowly in dealing
 with the problems of arrears that were the primary focus of Bank support. The misalignment
 towards the end of the series of budget support operations between the Bank and other
 donors also raises questions about the adequacy of the Bank’s contribution.
 Second Pillar: Improving Governance and Institutions for Effective Use of Resources                    Moderately
 There have been a number of solid achievements and success stories in the public financial            unsatisfactory
 management area, yet they do not constitute an effective overall program. The government
 moved selectively on those areas. Work on the IFMIS, started before HIPC completion in
 2005, remains a work in progress. The recent focus on the demand side of better public
 sector management and governance seems well judged and the Bank’s Zambia program is
 one of the most wide-ranging in this regard. It includes a number of programs in areas such
 as media training, investigative reporting, and NGOs. Zambia became a candidate country for
 the EITI in 2009 and was compliant before the end of the CPS period.
 While there is little doubt that there have been significant advances in some of the fiduciary
 areas such as external audit, the deliberations of the public accounts committee and a well-
 functioning public procurement office, the overall impact of these changes is not readily
 apparent. There is little evidence that it has contributed to more efficient government in
 Zambia.

 Third Pillar: Enhancing Economic Diversification and Nonresource Sector Growth                         Moderately
 This pillar contains three major components: infrastructure, private sector development; and          unsatisfactory
 agriculture.




                                                                                                                        85
APPENDIX A
ZAMBIA: SUMMARY OF WORLD BANK GROUP PROGRAM OUTCOME RATINGS
 Infrastructure         Regarding infrastructure, the Bank’s contributions have been generally
                        satisfactory, albeit with some weaknesses. The Bank played an
                        important role in the development of the road sector. The Bank was
                        instrumental in putting in place a well-conceived institutional framework
                        designed to ensure adoption of appropriate standards and effective
                        prioritization of expenditures between maintenance and construction.
                        However, the institutional framework did not function as planned in large
                        part because of political considerations that have led RDA to emphasize
                        new construction and unsustainable standards. This potentially
                        jeopardizes the gains from the institutional reforms. In the power sector,
                        Bank’s focus on unbundling and privatization before the sector had
                        achieved a critical mass was seen by many in Zambia as inappropriate.
                        It was also a stumbling block to an effective sector dialogue and to the
                        Bank’s ability to provide much needed support. The Bank was
                        successful in reestablishing a good dialogue in the last 4-5 years, in part
                        by changing its rigid stance on unbundling and by bringing in stronger
                        sector staff.
 Private sector         Bank Group work in support of private sector development was diffuse
 development            and unfocused. The Bank was active in a number of areas, but it lacked
                        clear and measurable objectives. Both Bank and IFC efforts to promote
                        SMEs were largely unsuccessful in reaching to scale, as they continued
                        to promote lines of credit that were not much in demand. The Bank
                        Group’s work on helping improve the business environment was useful
                        and helped Zambia to improve its regulatory environment, but its impact
                        has been limited. Entrepreneurs see the investment climate as an area
                        of lesser importance than other factors such as infrastructure, access to
                        finance, and the high cost of inputs. The work on subsector
                        development in essence was an attempt to help the government plan
                        and implement an industrial strategy, a task that has had little success
                        in most countries, in particular those with low institutional capacity.
                        There appears to have been little payoff of the extensive support in this
                        area during the review period. Neither of the Bank Group institutions
                        has been successful in developing instruments that could help channel
                        ample liquidity in the financial sector to SMEs.
 Agriculture            In the initial period, the sector did not receive the necessary priority,
                        despite its importance to diversification. Although the Bank was much
                        more active in the second half of the review period, the projects
                        supported have not been based on a well-articulated sector strategy.
                        They have been overly complex, are scattered among un-linked
                        interventions, and generally have the risk in institutional sustainability.
 Fourth Pillar: Promoting Human Capital Development                                                    Moderately
 The major components of this pillar are activities mapped to three sectors: health, education,        Satisfactory
 and social protection.
 Health                 The Bank contributed positively to the government effort to control HIV,
                        AIDS, and malaria. Bank support had a lasting impact through the
                        strengthening of the local institutional capacity to implement activities to
                        control HIV/AIDS even after the Bank credit was closed.
 Education              The Bank-supported project contributed to rehabilitation and
                        construction of school infrastructure to accommodate expansion in
                        student enrollment, but the effect on learning outcomes has been
                        marginal. The objective of creating a system capable of improving
                        worker skills for the formal and informal sectors was only modestly

                                                                                      APPENDIX A
                                     ZAMBIA: SUMMARY OF WORLD BANK GROUP PROGRAM OUTCOME RATINGS
                        achieved. The Bank produced a series of analyses on education
                        expenditures, which were well received by the government and the
                        donor community, but their impact on the policy debate is unclear.
    Social protection   The ZAMSIF project provided useful support for building quality rural
                        infrastructure through community-based initiatives. It helped build a
                        valuable local institutional capacity for implementing HIV/AIDS and
                        malaria programs, as well as the ongoing pilot program for climate
                        resilience. A recent Bank report on social safety nets in Zambia has
                        raised awareness about the weaknesses of the existing transfer and
                        subsidy programs.

1The goals of Bank Group assistance may be distinct from those of the client country’s own
development objectives, although the two are usually consistent.
2The Bank Group program outcome sub-ratings and overall rating assess the extent to
which the Bank program achieved the results targeted in the relevant strategy document(s)
and/or the documents for individual operations. They do not attempt to assess the extent to
which the client country was satisfied with the Bank’s program, nor do they try to measure
the extent (in an absolute sense) to which the program contributed to the country’s
development. Equally, they are not synonymous with Bank performance.

aggregated commitment. Between
FY04 and FY13, about two-thirds of the total approved commitments were for
operations in sectors including Agriculture and Rural Development, Energy and
Mining, and Transport (figure A.1). However, the support with the most significant
impact on Zambia’s public finance was likely debt relief amounting to $2.7 billion.

Zambia is also a party to several regional projects financed by IDA and the Global
Environment Facility (table A.1). These include the Southern Africa Power Market
project, which is the oldest and largest regional project in terms of commitment size.
Originally approved in FY04, the total commitment amount is $383 million. Recent
projects include the Agricultural Productivity Program for Southern Africa, which
aims to increase the availability of improved agricultural technologies in
participating countries. The Bank has also been a part of regional partnership
programs. The Sub-Saharan Africa Transport Policy Program—an international

The riskiness of the Bank’s portfolio has shown significant variation between 2004
and 2013. In FY04, 4 percent of commitments in Zambia were at risk, as compared
with 19 percent for the Africa Region as a whole. This figure showed drastic
fluctuations in recent years. In FY12, no projects were deemed at risk, whereas in
FY13, 28.7 percent of commitments and 25 percent of all projects under
implementation were at risk. Some projects moved back and forth between at risk
and not at risk status over the course of project implementation. For example, the
Road Rehabilitation Maintenance Project was flagged at risk in 2005, 2010, 2011, and
2013; the Support for Economic Expansion and Diversification (SEED) project was
flagged at risk in 2005–2007, 2009, and 2011.

The evaluations by the Independent Evaluation Group of completed Bank Group
operations in Zambia are generally unfavorable. Seventeen Bank projects were
reviewed between FY04 and FY13, of which eight (44 percent) were rated
moderately satisfactory and above. These included projects in the transport, health,
and economic policy portfolio. The only rated agriculture project—the Emergency
Drought Recovery loan—was rated as moderately satisfactory. Projects in the
education, and financial and private sector development portfolio were rated
moderately unsatisfactory and below. See appendix D for individual project ratings.

As for nonlending operations, the Bank delivered 77 analytic and advisory activities
(AAA) in Zambia between FY04 and FY13. These included 38 economic and sector
work projects and 39 technical assistance activities. A bulk of AAA focused on the
Financial and Private Sector Development, Economic Policy, and Health, Nutrition
and Population sectors, accounting for 55 percent of all AAA in the review period.

WORLD BANK GROUP INSTRUMENTS AND PERFORMANCE RATINGS

International Finance Corporation
The International Finance Corporation (IFC) strived to build a robust investment
portfolio in Zambia, but demand remained limited. During the FY04–07 CAS period,
IFC was cautious and sought to expand its investment activities only after
significant progress on the overall business environment. A much more positive
outlook for IFC investments was projected in the FY08–11 CAS. A number of
opportunities from agribusiness to commercial real estate were listed as prospective
investments. This optimism has continued in the latest FY13-16 CAS.

However, the demand for IFC investments was considerably less than envisaged. In
FY04-13, IFC had an average annual net commitment in Zambia of less than $10
million. This is due partly to the presence of such alternative funding sources as
local and international banks, private equity funds, and bilateral and multilateral
donor agencies.1 IFC’s internal approval procedures may also have contributed to a
low investment volume. Some of the IFC clients in Zambia indicated that IFC’s
approval procedures and due diligence requirements were lengthy and cumbersome
compared to other financiers.

IFC’s total net investment commitment in the country during this period amounted
to $92.9 million across 11 investments. Most investments were in finance and
insurance, followed by food and beverage. A majority of IFC’s transactions in
Zambia were long-term loans, which accounted for 86 percent of the investment
program. Equity investments accounted for 10 percent ($8.9 million). IFC’s Global
Trade Finance Program strategy aimed to increase its volume in IDA countries such
as Zambia. However, IFC provided a very small trade finance guarantee during the
evaluation period: $ 4.2 million to the African Banking Corporation Zambia. IFC had
one investment in the mining sector ($6 million) in FY09 to a junior mining
company. Two large loan transactions accounted for 59 percent of IFC’s total net
commitment—a $25 million loan to the Zambia National Commercial Bank in FY10,
and another $30 million loan in FY12.

IFC undertook 15 Advisory Services operations during FY04-13. Out of $14.7 million
committed to these operations, the Investment Climate business line had the largest
total commitment of $5.8 million. This was followed by the public-private
partnerships (PPP) business line ($4.9 million), with the single PPP advisory project
to support the Zambia Kafue Gorge Lower Hydroelectric Power Plant. The
investment climate business line had seven projects, followed by Sustainable
Business Advisory activities with five.

                                    WORLD BANK GROUP INSTRUMENTS AND PERFORMANCE RATINGS
IEG validated two investment operations during FY04 and 13, both rated mostly
unsatisfactory or worse. These investments were approved before 2001. IEG also
validated three advisory services projects with Mostly Unsuccessful ratings for two
projects and one Sustainable Business Advisory project as “cannot verify” for overall
development effectiveness.

Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency
The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) did not underwrite any
guarantee contracts during the FY04–07 CAS period but succeeded in engaging the
agribusiness sector from FY11. After a CAS period without any new guarantee
issuance, MIGA focused on increasing operations in the infrastructure and
agriculture sectors during the FY08–11 CAS period. The effort led to the issuance of
a $5.2 million guarantee in FY11 to Chayton Atlas Investments, an investment firm
specializing in agriculture, agribusiness, and related infrastructure. This guarantee
became an entry point for MIGA in the agribusiness sector.

During the three-year period from FY11 to FY13, MIGA underwrote six guarantee
contracts with a gross exposure of $85.8 million. Except for one manufacturing
contract with Hitachi Construction Machinery ($13.5 million), the guarantees were
for investments in agribusiness, with a total gross exposure of $72.3 million. MIGA’s
support for the Hitachi Construction Machinery project was for the construction and
operation of a remanufacturing plant for reconditioning used parts and components
from heavy-duty earth-moving machinery, primarily in the mining sector, to
provide a more cost-effective maintenance solution to serve clients within Zambia as
well as in adjacent countries.

Appendix D. Copper Privatization and Its Impact
on Mineral Resource Revenues
In the decades of the 1980s and 1990s, falling copper prices and underinvestment led
to a steady decline in copper production in Zambia. Coupled with the responsibility
for social expenditures for mine works, the State Enterprise that was running the
copper mining sector was depleting its resources during much of the 1990s. The
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) saw privatization as a
necessary condition for any improvement in the situation of the mines and the fiscal
situation as a whole. Privatization negotiations were carried out between 1997 and
2000 but after privatization, Anglo-American pulled out of the sector on the grounds
that the investment costs, after years of mismanagement, were too high relative to
the expected earnings at the then projected levels of copper prices. Subsequently in
2003, the government began negotiations with an Indian company, Vedanta, which
agreed to take over the largest copper mine.

With the bleak outlook for copper prices, the government had to agree to a generous
package of incentives in order to reach a deal. The agreement provided that the
company could release excess employees and that the government would meet the
social expenditures in the future. In addition, new investment could be fully
depreciated in the year it was made, losses could be carried over, and power would
be supplied at very favorable rates to the mines. The government also agreed not to
make changes to the agreements for a period of 15 years. The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) provided a financial adviser to assist the government in the
negotiations, but unfortunately, there was no fiscal advice provided. The mines were
subject to the regular Zambian profit tax, but there was no variable tax based on the
size of earnings, nor a windfall profits tax as is common with mining contracts.

Against expectations, there has been a steady rise in copper prices since 2004,
reflecting growing demand from China in particular. The company started investing
and soon started to increase output and earn profits. But the fiscal arrangements
meant that there was little direct benefit to the Zambian Treasury. With increasing
public resentment of the lack of any direct benefit to revenues, the government
passed legislation in 2008 to abrogate the agreements and introduce a windfall profit
tax. However, the government withdrew the application of the tax to existing mines
after the resistance it received from the mining companies.

There has been much speculation on what caused the government to back down.
The interactions between the mining companies and the government have been

COPPER PRIVATIZATION AND ITS IMPACT ON MINERAL RESOURCE REVENUES
opaque starting from the original negotiations with Vedanta to the present. The
Zambian government does not even know how much copper the mines are
producing. It was eventually decided that the government would wait until the
limitations on the agreements ran out. Tax revenues have begun a gradual increase
as the companies have run out of accumulated losses to offset profits. With rising
copper prices, new mines are coming on-stream, and they are subject to the higher
tax rates. The IMF, Norwegian government, Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development, and the World Bank are all providing technical
assistance to support better tax administration, in particular strengthening of the
National Revenue Authority’s capacity to carry out performance audits of the
accounts of the mines and to detect transfer pricing.

Appendix E. Guide to IEG’s Country Program
Evaluation Methodology
This methodological note describes the key elements of the country program
evaluation (CPE) methodology of the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG).1

A World Bank Group assistance program needs to be assessed on how well it met its
particular objectives, which are typically a subset of the country’s development
objectives. If a Bank Group assistance program is large in relation to the country’s
total development effort, the program outcome should be similar to the country’s
overall development progress. However, most Bank Group assistance programs
provide only a fraction of the total resources devoted to a country’s development by
development partners, stakeholders, and the government itself. In CPEs, IEG rates
only the outcome of the Bank Group’s program, not the country’s overall
development outcome, although the latter is clearly relevant for judging the
program’s outcome.

The experience gained in CPEs confirms that Bank Group program outcomes
sometimes diverge significantly from the country’s overall development progress.
CPEs have identified Bank Group assistance programs that had:

      Satisfactory outcomes matched by good country development;
      Unsatisfactory outcomes in countries which achieved good overall
       development results, notwithstanding the weak Bank Group program; and,
      Satisfactory outcomes in countries that did not achieve satisfactory overall
       results during the period of program implementation.

By the same token, an unsatisfactory Bank Group assistance program outcome does
not always mean that Bank Group performance was also unsatisfactory, and vice
versa. This becomes clearer in considering that the Bank Group’s contribution to the
outcome of its assistance program is only part of the story. The assistance program’s
outcome is determined by the joint impact of four agents: (i) the country; (ii) the
Bank Group; (iii) partners and other stakeholders; and (iv) exogenous forces (for
example, events of nature, international economic shocks, and so forth). Under the
right circumstances, a negative contribution from any one agent might overwhelm
the positive contributions from the other three and lead to an unsatisfactory
outcome.




                                                                                  111
APPENDIX E
GUIDE TO IEG’S COUNTRY PROGRAM EVALUATION METHODOLOGY
IEG measures Bank Group performance primarily on the basis of contributory
actions the Bank Group directly controlled. Judgments regarding Bank Group
performance typically consider the relevance and implementation of the strategy,
the design and supervision of the Bank Group’s lending and financial support
interventions, the scope, quality and follow-up of diagnostic work and other analytic
and advisory activities, the consistency of the Bank Group’s lending and financial
support with its nonlending work and with its safeguard policies, and the Bank
Group’s partnership activities.

Rating Assistance Program Outcome
In rating the outcome (expected development impact) of an assistance program, IEG
gauges the extent to which major strategic objectives were relevant and achieved,
without any shortcomings. In other words, did the Bank Group do the right thing,
and did it do it right. Programs typically express their goals in terms of higher-order
objectives, such as poverty reduction. The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) may
also establish intermediate goals, such as improved targeting of social services or
promotion of integrated rural development, and specify how they are expected to
contribute toward achieving the higher-order objective. IEG’s task is then to validate
whether the intermediate objectives were the right ones and whether they produced
satisfactory net benefits, as well as whether the results chain specified in the CAS
was valid. Where causal linkages were not fully specified in the CAS, it is the
evaluator’s task to reconstruct this causal chain from the available evidence and
assess relevance, efficacy, and outcome with reference to the intermediate and
higher-order objectives.

For each of the main objectives, the CPE evaluates the relevance of the objective; the
relevance of the Bank Group’s strategy toward meeting the objective, including the
balance between lending and nonlending instruments; the efficacy with which the
strategy was implemented; and the results achieved. This is done in two steps. The
first is a top-down review of whether the Bank Group’s program achieved a
particular Bank Group objective or planned outcome and had a substantive impact
on the country’s development. The second step is a bottom-up review of the Bank
Group’s products and services (lending, analytical and advisory services, and aid
coordination) used to achieve the objective. Together these two steps test the
consistency of findings from the products and services and the development impact
dimensions. Subsequently, an assessment is made of the relative contribution to the
results achieved by the Bank Group, other development partners, the government
and exogenous factors.

                                  GUIDE TO IEG’S COUNTRY PROGRAM EVALUATION METHODOLOGY
Evaluators also assess the degree of country ownership of international
development priorities, such as the Millennium Development Goals, and Bank
Group corporate advocacy priorities, such as safeguards. Ideally, any differences on
dealing with these issues would be identified and resolved by the CAS, enabling the
evaluator to focus on whether the trade-offs adopted were appropriate. However, in
other instances, the strategy may be found to have glossed over certain conflicts, or
avoided addressing key country development constraints. In either case, the
consequences could include a diminution of program relevance, a loss of country
ownership, and/or unwelcome side effects, such as safeguard violations, all of
which must be taken into account in judging program outcome.

Ratings Scale
IEG utilizes six rating categories for outcome, ranging from highly satisfactory to
highly unsatisfactory:

Highly satisfactory:            The assistance program achieved at least
                                acceptable progress toward all major relevant
                                objectives, and had best practice development
                                impact on one or more of them. No major
                                shortcomings were identified.

Satisfactory:                   The assistance program achieved acceptable
                                progress toward all major relevant objectives. No
                                best practice achievements or major shortcomings
                                were identified.

Moderately satisfactory:        The assistance program achieved acceptable
                                progress toward most of its major relevant
                                objectives. No major shortcomings were
                                identified.

Moderately unsatisfactory:      The assistance program did not make acceptable
                                progress toward most of its major relevant
                                objectives, or made acceptable progress on all of
                                them, but either (a) did not take into adequate
                                account a key development constraint or (b)
                                produced a major shortcoming, such as a
                                safeguard violation.

Unsatisfactory:                 The assistance program did not make acceptable
                                progress toward most of its major relevant


                                                                                      113

GUIDE TO IEG’S COUNTRY PROGRAM EVALUATION METHODOLOGY
                                     objectives, and either (a) did not take into
                                     adequate account a key development constraint
                                     or (b) produced a major shortcoming, such as a
                                     safeguard violation.

Highly unsatisfactory:               The assistance program did not make acceptable
                                     progress toward any of its major relevant
                                     objectives and did not take into adequate account
                                     a key development constraint, while also
                                     producing at least one major shortcoming, such
                                     as a safeguard violation.

The institutional development impact can be rated at the project level as high,
substantial, modest, or negligible. This measures the extent to which the program
bolstered the country’s ability to make more efficient, equitable and sustainable use
of its human, financial, and natural resources. Examples of areas included in judging
the institutional development impact of the program are:

IEG is, however, increasingly factoring institutional development impact ratings
into program outcome ratings, rather than rating them separately.

Sustainability can be rated at the project level as highly likely, likely, unlikely, highly
unlikely, or, if available information is insufficient, nonevaluable. Sustainability
measures the resilience to risk of the development benefits of the country program
over time, taking into account eight factors:

         Technical resilience
         Financial resilience (including policies on cost recovery)
         Economic resilience
         Social support (including conditions subject to safeguard policies)
         Environmental resilience
         Ownership by governments and other key stakeholders

       Institutional support (including a supportive legal or regulatory framework,
        and organizational and management effectiveness)
       Resilience to exogenous effects, such as international economic shocks or
        changes in the political and security environments.

At the program level, IEG is increasingly factoring sustainability into program
outcome ratings, rather than rating them separately.

Risk to development outcome. According to the 2006 harmonized guidelines,
sustainability has been replaced with a “risk to development outcome,” defined as
the risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or expected
outcomes) of a project or program will not be maintained (or realized). The risk to
development outcome can be rated at the project level as high, significant, moderate,
negligible to low, and nonevaluable.
