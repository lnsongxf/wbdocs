About the World Bank Institute’s Governance Practice
Governance is one of seven priority themes in the World Bank Institute’s recently launched renewal strate-
gy—a strategy that responds to client demand for peer-to-peer learning by grounding WBI’s work in the dis-
tillation and dissemination of practitioner experiences. The Institute is committed to building knowledge and
capacity on the “how to” of governance reforms, with emphasis on supporting and sustaining multistake-
holder engagement in bringing about such reforms.

WBI’s Governance Practice works with partners, including networks of country and regional institutions, to
develop and replicate customized learning programs. Its programmatic approach aims at building multistake-
holder coalitions and in creating collaborative platforms and peer networks for knowledge exchange.
