 A Note from
 the Director
 Asli Demirgüç-Kunt



R   esearch plays a crucial role in learning from past
    policies and thinking about the future. Without
the independent scrutiny of research, conceptual
and empirical foundations for policymaking would
be weak, “best practices” would be emulated without
sufficient evidence, and new fads and fashions would
get more attention and traction than they deserve.

To have impact on development policies, research
must address relevant questions, answer them
rigorously and persuasively, and the findings must be
effectively communicated to policy makers. DECRG—
the World Bank’s research department—undertakes              Asli Demirgüç-Kunt
and stimulates such catalytic research with the              Director of Research,
                                                             Research Department
aim of generating new knowledge on the process of
development and policies to enhance it. Although
research activities occur throughout the World Bank,
DECRG is the unit with a special mandate to conduct
research.

By generating policy-relevant, high-quality research, DECRG seeks to
shape development thinking. Being a producer of original research is
also important in being able to keep abreast of advances in development
thinking. Hence, for the Bank, DECRG also provides a window on all
development research done outside the Bank. Given this mandate, DECRG’s
audience is not only World Bank senior management and operational
colleagues, but also other researchers, national policy makers, the broader
development community, and the general public. DECRG seeks to reach
this wide audience through academic publications, books, conferences,
blogs, and other social media channels (see Box 1.1 on the Policy Research
Talks, a new initiative to extend DECRG’s dissemination efforts). Despite
limited resources—less than 1 percent of the administrative budget of the
World Bank—Bank researchers produce a large volume of work that is of
high quality and influential by academic standards, yet much more focused
on development issues and developing countries when compared to the
research of academic institutions (Das et al. 2013; World Bank 2012c).

Much of DECRG’s interaction with operational colleagues takes place by
working directly on projects with them. On average every researcher spends
30 percent of his or her time per year supporting operations, which not
only facilitates the dissemination of research findings first hand but also
gives researchers insight into the problems and challenges faced by client
countries, hence informing and shaping DECRG’s research agenda. This
continuous exchange and tacit knowledge creation, in addition to the more
formal publication and dissemination channels, allows researchers to reach
broad audiences both inside and outside the World Bank (see Box 1.2).

                                                    The discipline of policy analysis is increasingly sophisticated. In addition to
                                                    research, new data and tools are required to address emerging challenges.
                                                    Both research and data work in the World Bank have a long tradition
                                                    of openness, with much of the research conducted jointly with outside
                                                    academics and developing-country partners, findings debated publicly in

                                                    community (see Box 1.3 on DECRG conferences, one of the forums for such
                                                    debate). This openness is integral to ensuring quality and rigor in research

The work carried out in DECRG spans all sectors: with the purpose of not
only maintaining core expertise in all sectors in which the World Bank is
involved, but also striving to address the most important research issues
within each sector. DECRG also tackles research themes that cut across
sectors. One of the challenges of research is to anticipate topics sufficiently
early, creating space for researchers to explore areas before demand for
them is evident. Research management pays close attention to how the
whole research program fits together, exploiting knowledge overlaps
and synergies across sectors. Given limited resources, prioritization and
selectivity are keys to ensuring that the research agenda is focused on
strategic policy priorities for the World Bank and its clients (see Box 1.4 on
the Research Academy, a new initiative to do more with less by incentivizing
high-quality research across the entire World Bank).

                                                  as at periodic meetings with regional and practice management teams to
                                                  discuss research priorities. Identifying the agenda is a bottom-up exercise:
                                                  topics often emerge directly from work and consultations with operational
                                                  colleagues and interactions with policy makers and researchers outside

                                                  to further strengthen this collaboration). Strategic research priorities are
                                                  defined collectively by the DECRG director and research managers, under
                                                  the overall guidance of the Senior Vice President and Chief Economist. The

                                                 DECRG’s current research priorities are organized into the following
                                                 cross-cutting clusters: (i) Science of Delivery; (ii) Risk Management and
                                                 Vulnerability; (iii) Productivity, Competitiveness, and Job Creation; (iv) Shared
                                                 Prosperity and Inclusion; and (v) International Cooperation and Global Public
                                                 Goods. Permeating all of DECRG’s work is an emphasis on novel data-
                                                 collection, rigorous empirical work, and innovative solutions to practical
                                                 policy questions.

                                                 Science of Delivery research focuses on how to deliver development in a
                                                 multi-sectoral fashion, including public service delivery, aid effectiveness, as
                                                 well as good governance. DECRG’s work covers the public sector (e.g., the
                                                 courts, customs, and land registers) and the private sector (e.g., financial
                                                 services), as well as sectors with public-private partnerships (e.g., education,
                                                 health, and infrastructure). It covers the labor-intensive human development
                                                 sectors, as well as the capital-intensive infrastructure sectors. DECRG’s
                                                 research in this area spans all aspects of the field: (a) measuring outcomes
                                                 and aspects of the delivery process; (b) explaining why variations in delivery
                                                 exist; (c) assessing the impacts of government reforms; and (d) designing
                                                 and piloting innovative schemes to improve delivery.

                                                 Risk Management and Vulnerability research recognizes that risk
                                                 management can be a powerful tool for development. In recent years,
                                                 the occurrence of significant economic crises and natural disasters has

                                                 systemic in certain circumstances like in the case of health epidemics.
                                                 DECRG’s research at the aggregate or macro level focuses on understanding
                                                 the mechanisms that shape vulnerabilities (exposure to shocks and their
                                                 propagation) and on identifying appropriate risk-management policies.
                                                 At the micro-level, individuals and firms confront many shocks and the
                                                 department has an extensive research agenda on specific kinds of risks and
                                                 on policies (such as social protection programs) and financial products to
                                                 address them. DECRG distinguishes between different sources of risks and
                                                 potential policy responses.

                                                 Productivity, Competitiveness, and Job Creation research focuses on
                                                 understanding the dynamics of economic growth and job creation and
                                                 does this through four inter-related approaches: First, better measuring and
                                                 understanding drivers of firm dynamics, examining their correlates with different
                                                 internal and external factors within and across countries, and identifying
                                                 potential areas where policy efforts could be used; Next, examining the two
                                                 main avenues through which government policy actions influence private sector
                                                 development and the productivity and growth prospects of a country through
                                                 (a) establishing an enabling environment (general facilitation) and (b) more direct
                                                 interventions (active catalyst), respectively; and finally researching the political
                                                 economy of productivity policy to understand the conditions under which
                                                 successful reform policies are undertaken.

Shared Prosperity and Inclusion research continues the World Bank’s
leading role in measuring and monitoring poverty and addresses new areas
of shared prosperity and environmental sustainability. The goal is to provide
the international research community, civil society, and policy-makers with
a better informational basis to guide poverty reduction efforts. A three-
pronged approach is being pursued: (a) define and refine methods for
measuring and tracking well-being and its distribution (including poverty
and inequality) over time and space; (b) promote, generate, and disseminate
improved data and methodological guidelines to foster the effective use
of information and countries’ capacity to monitor poverty and inequality;
(c) continued research on longstanding, and fundamental, questions
concerning the drivers and consequences of poverty, and the impact of
policies to combat poverty and inequality.

International Cooperation and Global Public Goods research addresses
the political economy, policy design and evaluation challenges that arise
in international cooperation. Externalities across boundaries are varied
and widespread. DECRG’s research analyzes a wide range of attempts
at international cooperation. These include (a) regional and multilateral
trade; (b) climate change and environmental security; and (c) international
coordination of macroeconomic and financial policies.

In addition to research, DECRG includes a team (Surveys and Methods) that
focuses on data and computational tools, and another—the Development
Impact Evaluation Initiative (DIME)—that focuses on impact evaluation,
specifically in the context of projects implemented by the World Bank or
other development organizations. These teams interact very closely with the
research teams and provide important links to the rest of the World Bank and
development community. Through its Surveys and Methods team, DECRG
plays a valuable role in generating and maintaining original databases, as well
as expanding and improving the tool kits routinely employed by policy makers
and analysts in data collection and analysis. And through its impact evaluation
team, the World Bank learns from its evaluative research, rigorously assessing
whether development policies are effective, addressing design challenges
when they are not, and disseminating knowledge on both policy successes
and failures. DECRG researchers have the training and skills to inform the
World Bank’s practitioners and the development community as they search
for operational solutions to pressing development problems, and these two
teams facilitate this interaction.

The Demand for Bank Research

DECRG produces a wide range of research outputs, including working papers,
books, datasets, policy reports, and peer-reviewed journal articles. Between
2011 and 2013, DECRG on average produced 155 peer-reviewed journal
publications per year. The production of research begins with the Policy
Research Working Paper (PRWP) series, established in 1988 as the primary
vehicle for the dissemination of new research produced by the World Bank.
The series is a stepping-stone to publication in a peer-reviewed journal,
which ultimately certifies the quality of the research. This body of work
then frequently feeds into outputs targeted to a broad audience of policy
makers and other development stakeholders, whether in the form of a World
Development Report, Policy Research Report, or other synthesis document.i

Given the central role of PRWPs in the production of research, download
statistics for this series provide one useful indicator of overall demand for
research. PRWPs are disseminated through multiple channels, including
two of the world’s largest online aggregators of social science research—
Research Papers in Economics (RePEc) and the Social Science Research
Network (SSRN)—and through the World Bank’s own websites. Data from
both RePEc and SSRN indicate high demand relative to comparator working
paper series, while data from the World Bank’s own websites indicate
particularly high demand for work authored by DECRG.

RePEc provides an online bibliographic database of research in economics
and related disciplines. As of October 2014 RePEc listed 1.4 million pieces
of research by over 35,000 authors.ii Download data from RePEc indicates
that PRWPs are one of the most frequently downloaded series on a per
paper basis compared to other major working paper series included on the
site. PRWPs have been downloaded an average of 229 times per paper—
placing the Bank’s working papers ahead of other major series such as the
National Bureau of Economic Research, the Center for Economic and Policy
Research, and the IMF Working Paper series, among others (Figure 2.1).

                                                 A similar story emerges upon examination of data from SSRN. As suggested
                                                 by its name, SSRN focuses on dissemination of research work in the
                                                 social sciences, and contains a collection of over 473,000 downloadable
                                                 documents. The PRWPs once again emerge as the most frequently
                                                 downloaded working paper series on a per paper basis against the major
                                                 comparators available in SSRN (Figure 2.2). PRWPs have been downloaded
                                                 an average of 223 times per paper, compared to 212 times per paper for
                                                 the New York Federal Reserve, the next closest series. The World Bank also
                                                 far outstrips other multilateral development banks (i.e., the Inter-American
                                                 Development Bank and the Asian Development Bank), which together
                                                 average 57 downloads per paper.

                                                 Downloads from the World Bank’s own websites extend the story, and
                                                 also allow us to differentiate downloads of PRWPs produced by authors
                                                 from different parts of the World Bank. Over the period 2008–2013, over
                                                 2,000 PRWPs were produced, with about one-third of these authored or
                                                 co-authored by DECRG staff. Across the full set of PRWPs, papers were
                                                 downloaded directly from the World Bank’s own websites an average of
                                                 379 times—but with a large differential depending on authorship. DECRG-
                                                 authored or co-authored working papers were downloaded 72 percent more
                                                 often on average than non-DECRG authored papers.

                                                 While DECRG-authored working papers were more frequently downloaded
                                                 on average, it is possible that this could be entirely due to a few “big
                                                 hits”—a handful of DECRG-authored papers that generated great numbers
                                                 of downloads. A closer analysis of working paper downloads by percentile
                                                 demonstrates that this is not the case. Not only are DECRG-authored
                                                 working papers more frequently downloaded on average, they are also
                                                 more downloaded across the spectrum. DECRG-authored working papers
                                                 are downloaded more frequently than non-DECRG working papers at every
                                                 percentile of the distribution of downloads (Figure 2.3). At the 1st percentile,
                                                 the least downloaded DECRG-authored working papers were downloaded
                                                 55 percent more often than non-DECRG-authored working papers (79

papers were downloaded more than twice as often as non-DECRG-authored
working papers (3,215 versus 1,540 downloads).

Regardless of authorship, the PRWP series outperformed World Bank
Economic and Sector Work (ESW) in terms of downloads, both on average
and at every percentile. ESW primarily consists of operational reports written
by World Bank country economists in support of the policy dialogue with their
client countries. Between 2008 and 2013, ESW reports were downloaded 148
times on average, with the median ESW report downloaded just 48 times
(Figure 2.3). The corresponding figures for PRWPs were 379 and 260.

The Influence of Bank Research

While download data reflects the general demand for World Bank research,
it does not provide a direct indication of the influence that this work has on
the broader research discourse. For this, the tools of bibliometric analysis are
required. Bibliometrics provide a quantitative assessment of the influence
of published research through analysis of citations. The availability of large
databases such as SCOPUS, an online bibliographic database containing
abstracts and citations from some 21,000 journals, has vastly expanded the
ability to carry out this kind of investigation.

Bibliometric analysis provides a range of tools to assess influence—reflecting
different judgments about how best to value different types of citations.
For example, it is clear that a citation in a top-ranking journal should carry
more weight than a citation in a lesser-known journal focusing on a narrow
subfield. But there is no agreement on exactly how to rank journals or weigh
citations, which has given rise to a multitude of approaches to measuring
influence (Engemann and Wall 2009). Given the lack of agreement, two
different approaches to analyzing the influence of DECRG research are
considered. The first uses a neutral metric: an unweighted average of the
number of citations per paper, benchmarked against comparator institutions.
The second draws on the well-known rankings produced by RePEc, which
synthesizes a broad set of underlying bibliometric indicators that adjust for
many factors such as quality of the journal in which a citation appears.

                                                  How does DECRG-authored research stack up in terms of citations of its work?
                                                  DECRG is clearly influential when compared against a broad set of academic
                                                  and development institutions. Peer-reviewed journal articles and handbook
                                                  chapters published by DECRG between 1995 and 2014 have been cited an
                                                  average of 33 times in peer-reviewed journals, placing DECRG second only to
                                                  Harvard University and far ahead of many other well-known research institutions
                                                  (Figure 2.4). By this metric DECRG research clearly has wide influence.

                                                  DECRG research necessarily tackles both big questions of wide interest
                                                  and less attention-grabbing questions that are still of vital importance to
                                                  the World Bank’s clients. Nevertheless, an analysis of citations by percentile
                                                  demonstrates that the full spectrum of DECRG-authored research is cited
                                                  frequently relative to comparators (Figure 2.5).

                                                  Consider an article at the 50th percentile of the distribution of citations for
                                                  a given institution. This “typical” article for DECRG will have 12 citations,
                                                  compared to 10 citations for Harvard University and 4 citations for the IMF.
                                                  This puts DECRG in 1st place when ranked against comparator institutions.
                                                  DECRG does well at the high end as well. An article at the 90th percentile
                                                  for DECRG is cited 81 times, putting it in third place behind Harvard
                                                  University (93 citations), and Princeton (83 citations).

The more sophisticated set of rankings produced by RePEc provides a
second way of measuring the influence of World Bank research. Instead of
simply counting unweighted numbers of citations, RePEc aggregates across
32 different metrics. These metrics cover everything from number of works
produced to citation counts, journal page counts, and RePEc web traffic. Over
40,000 registered authors are ranked on these 32 metrics, and these rankings
are in turn used to rank the institutions to which the authors are affiliated.

Out of more than 6,700 institutions, DECRG ranked number 12 in economics
research overall, and ranked first in development economics (Box 2.1).iii
This placed DECRG ahead of Brown University, Harvard University, and the
London School of Economics in the domain of development economics.
DECRG’s high ranking as an institution is of course driven by the high
ranking of many of the researchers who belong to it—and, in fact, a total
of 19 DECRG researchers are ranked within the top 10 percent of the field
of development economics. Since DECRG researchers work across many
fields that are important for economic development, their expertise also
reflects this diversity: 28 of them are ranked in the top 10 percent of their
respective fields. DECRG researchers also rank in the top 1 percent of five
different fields: Agricultural Economics, Banking, Human Migration, Health
Economics, and Positive Political Economics.

                                                    The Relevance of Bank Research

                                                    While World Bank research is in demand and influential, this is not enough.
                                                    It must also be relevant to the issues faced by the developing countries that
                                                    the World Bank aims to serve. Given the broad range of challenges that
                                                    developing countries experience, there is no single metric that allows us
                                                    to gauge relevance. However, a number of metrics, each reflecting some
                                                    aspect of relevance, suggest that DECRG research fills a gap in addressing
                                                    the research needs of developing countries.

One way of judging the relevance of World Bank research to the needs
of developing countries is to consider how the geographical focus of
Bank research stacks up against other producers of research. It turns out
that startlingly little empirical research is done on low-income countries.
For example, over the 20 year period 1985–2004, just four papers were
published in the top 202 economics journals on Burundi, nine on Cambodia,
and twenty-seven on Mali (Das et al. 2013). To put that into perspective,
some 36,649 empirical economics papers on the U.S. were published over
the same timeframe in the same journals (Map 2.1).

What is driving this distribution of research publications? Das et al. (2013)
find that the most important factor is the per capita GDP of a country, which
alone accounts for 75 percent of the variation in per capita publications
across countries. But for the World Bank this “research-wealth relationship”
does not hold. Instead, the distribution of World Bank research is clearly
tilted in favor of Low and Lower-middle Income Countries (Figure 2.6). More
than one-third of the World Bank’s journal articles have been on Low-income
Countries, compared to only 11 percent on High-income Countries. Among
non-Bank authors the picture is reversed: around 8 percent have been on
Low-income Countries and over 70 percent on High-income Countries.
The World Bank alone accounts for 7 percent of the total global output of
research on Low-income Countries. These findings underline the point that
DECRG fills a gap that is left by purely academic research.

It is also possible to gauge the relevance of DECRG research via its impact
on other World Bank knowledge products—specifically, Economic and Sector
Work (ESW) reports targeted towards policy makers. A study by Doemeland
and Trevino (2014) analyzed five years’ worth of download statistics for ESW.
They find a great deal of variation in report downloads, with nearly one-third
of ESW reports never having been downloaded a single time.

                                                 Doemeland and Trevino (2014) also looked at the relationship between
                                                 downloads and cross support, i.e., staff time provided across organizational
                                                 units to support a project, and their findings were stark: DEC was the
                                                 only vice presidential unit whose cross support was linked with greater
                                                 downloads and greater citations. DEC-supported reports received 302
                                                 downloads on average—more than double the 129 downloads per report
                                                 for non-supported reports (Figure 2.7). This relationship of increased
                                                 downloads for DEC-supported reports also held at every percentile. This
                                                 record of downloads points to the policy-driven nature of DEC research,
                                                 which has helped enhance the relevance of ESW reports specifically geared
                                                 towards a policy making audience. This policy relevance is also one of the

  The work of DECRG is frequently
  the go-to source for major media
  outlets around the world covering
  development economics and related
  areas of work, with numerous
  references in major outlets like
  The Economist, Financial Times, or
  Bloomberg. Journalists often turn
  to cross-country data produced by
  DECRG on topics where no other
  authoritative data is available or
  to innovative policy research that
  overturns received wisdom. The

                                                      practical basis for creating and organizing useful
                                                 datasets. Over the years, DECRG researchers have
                                                 collected data from scratch if interesting policy
                                                 questions could not be answered using existing data,
                                                 with collection efforts spanning almost the full range
                                                 of World Bank themes. In addition to enabling the

                                                 be answered with the datasets available at the time,
                                                 many of DECRG’s data collection efforts have made it
                                                 possible to compare countries and track progress over
                                                 time. Box 3.1 provides examples of how these efforts
                                                 make a difference for policy when data is credible and
                                                 constructed with foresight.

                                                 Moreover, as analytical and computational tools used

                                                 Data Compilation

                                                 Agreement is widespread that thoughtful data collection, guided by
                                                 researchers who understand what types of information are most needed
                                                 to address fundamental policy questions, is an important World Bank
                                                 contribution to the field of development. The research-based data products
                                                 generated by DECRG fall into three categories. Some are compilations of
                                                 existing data series, while others are collections of primary data. The third
                                                 category comprises datasets that are constructed by piecing together
                                                 information from different sources and then performing some modeling.
                                                 A vital characteristic of all three types of datasets is that they are valuable
                                                 public goods: the same data can be used by many researchers and policy
                                                 analysts to answer a broad range of development policy questions.

                                                 Data Collection

                                                 Data compilation relies on data being there to start with. When World Bank
                                                 President Robert McNamara saw so many gaps in the poverty and inequality
                                                 data series in the 1979 World Development Report, the reason was not
                                                 that his staff had not bothered to compile the data needed for McNamara’s
                                                 reorientation of the Bank toward poverty reduction; the data simply did
                                                 not exist. Most countries had never fielded a household survey, and those
                                                 that had had not asked the necessary questions to accurately estimate a
                                                 household’s consumption.

                                                 To address this deficiency, the Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS)
                                                 team set about designing a consumption questionnaire that could be used
                                                 in household surveys in different settings, and they fielded it in multiple
                                                 countries. Other organizations subsequently embraced the philosophy
                                                 of the consumption module, thanks in part to a three-part volume the

                                                 everything from financial inclusion to service delivery.

Data Construction

The Database of Political Institutions and the Worldwide Governance
Indicators lie at one extreme of database creation, and LSMS and Enterprise
Surveys lie at the other. The former are highly valued compilations of
existing data series, while the latter are collected through questionnaires and
observation in thousands of households and firms all over the developing
world. Between these two extremes lies another type of dataset: one that is
constructed by piecing together information from different sources and then
performing some modeling.

                                                 The range of computational tools produced by DECRG are designed to
                                                 empower researchers and policy practitioners in developing countries
                                                 to conduct their own research with minimal technical assistance. One
                                                 case in point is Survey Solutions, which was developed to help national
                                                 statistical organizations in developing countries by reducing the costs and
                                                 improving the timeliness and quality of survey data. Since the release of the
                                                 first version at the end of 2013 more than 30 countries have used Survey

To promote the adoption of methodological best practices and new tools,
DECRG emphasizes building capacity across partner countries. Capacity
building includes a combination of sustained hands-on training through
long-term engagement and country presence, and more formal classroom
as well as web-based and remote training. The assistance is delivered in
partnership with other institutions and as part of broader global initiatives
like the Global Strategy to Improve Agricultural and Rural Statistics and
the National Strategy for the Development of Statistics, contributing to the
sustainability of the work of LSMS. The success of this model can be seen
with increasing government contributions to the maintenance and expansion
of systems, expanding support by a large number of institutional partners,
growing use of the information collected, and decreasing need over the
years for technical assistance.

           Working hand-in-hand with operations, DECRG has played a central role in
           expanding the use of impact evaluations in World Bank projects, enhancing
           rigor and quality, and drawing global lessons from this body of work. The
           publication of the 2009 Policy Research Report Conditional Cash Transfers:
           Reducing Present and Future Poverty set a precedent for the way that
           the World Bank’s impact evaluation agenda is now structured around key
           clusters of priority areas (see Box 2.3). A few years later, the Independent
           Evaluation Group (IEG) also specifically cited the role of DIME—a unit within
           DECRG with a mandate to produce high-quality impact evaluations—in
           improving quality control in impact evaluations (IEG, 2012). And DECRG’s
           publication record demonstrates its outsized role in turning the results of
           impact evaluations into global knowledge: of the 35 papers published in
           2014 as part of the World Bank Impact Evaluation working papers series, 28
           were produced either jointly or solely by DECRG.i

           The World Bank is the largest producer of impact evaluations among
           development institutions, with the stock of impact evaluations rising from
           less than 20 in 2003 to around 193 in 2014. DECRG is closely involved with
           a large fraction of these. DIME’s portfolio alone contains 175 completed or
           ongoing impact evaluations (see below for further information). And DECRG’s
           engagement in impact evaluations cuts across all sectors of the World Bank,
           with projects that range from boosting the productivity of the private sector
           (Box 4.1) to assessing results-based financing in healthcare (Box 4.2).

                                                 Development Impact Evaluation (DIME)

                                                 Established in 2005, the Development Impact Evaluation (DIME) team’s
                                                 mandate is to generate high-quality operationally relevant impact evaluation
                                                 research to transform development policy. It works closely with World
                                                 Bank operations to increase the use of impact evaluation in the design and
                                                 implementation of public policy, improve the quality of World Bank projects,
                                                 strengthen country institutions for evidence-based policy making, and
                                                 generate knowledge in strategic development areas. DIME achieves these
                                                 through (i) designing evaluations to inform decisions in collaboration with
                                                 government partners, (ii) building counterpart agencies’ capacity to do this
                                                 systematically, and (iii) drawing lessons and sharing them face-to-face with
                                                 global audiences.

A critical feature of DIME’s approach to impact evaluation is the focus on
both the question of “what works?” and “why/how it works?” DIME impact
evaluations both evaluate the effectiveness of packages of interventions
(the “what”) and experiment with mechanisms (the “why/how”) to better
understand what drives impact. Examining both of these questions allows
DIME to provide actionable evidence to its implementing partners. And
to ensure evidence is turned into action, the DIME model transfers the
knowledge and tools needed to support evidence-based policy making to
country institutions through a learning-by-doing approach (Box 4.3).

DIME’s 175 projects span nearly all of the World Bank’s Global Practices (Figure
4.1). The largest concentration of projects fall under the Agriculture Global
Practice (20 percent), with substantial shares in Health, Nutrition, and Population
(15 percent), Social, Urban, Rural, & Resilience (13 percent), and Education (11
percent). A number of new initiatives are helping to broaden DIME’s coverage
even further, including the ieGovern Initiative that is pushing the frontier in
terms of what works in governance reform, the Evidence for Peace designed
to fill the knowledge vacuum about what works in settings characterized
by fragility, conflict, and violence, and Impact Evaluation to Development
Impact (i2i), a World Bank fund supported by the Department for International
Development (DFID) that will increase the use of impact evaluations in areas
that have traditionally been under-evaluated.ii

DECRG Alumni:
Where Are They Now?
DECRG has an impact not only through its own outputs, but also through
the human capital and networks gained by the staff who pass through its
doors. Many of the researchers who work in DECRG have gone on to take
leadership positions elsewhere, whether within the World Bank or in senior
positions outside of the institution. What follows is a selection of DECRG
alumni, along with positions they have held since leaving DECRG.
