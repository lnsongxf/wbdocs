Corporate Scorecards

In 2013, the overarching World Bank Group (WBG)
mission of a world free of poverty was reinforced by the
establishment of ambitious goals:

 ending extreme poverty by reducing the percentage of
•
 people living on less than $1.25 a day to three percent
 by 2030; and

 promoting shared prosperity by fostering income
•
 growth for the bottom 40 percent of the population in
 every developing country.

This enhanced focus on fighting poverty underlines
the World Bank Group’s commitment to support global
endeavors and individual countries’ efforts to overcome
development challenges. The Strategy adopted in 2013
outlined how the World Bank Group will partner more
                                                              3
effectively with clients to help them achieve these goals

through economic growth, inclusion, and sustainability
and resilience.

The implementation of the Strategy is being monitored
by the World Bank Group Corporate Scorecard which
was first presented in April 2014. It provides an apex view
of the results and performance indicators of the three
World Bank Group institutions—the World Bank (WB),
the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). The
World Bank Group Corporate Scorecard is complemented
by the World Bank Corporate Scorecard as well as the
revised IFC and MIGA Scorecards.

This brochure presents the World Bank Group and World
Bank Corporate Scorecards updated with fiscal year
2014 data. All four Scorecards are living documents to
be adapted and improved based on experience with
their implementation and evolving external and internal
priorities.

                                           The World Bank Group Corporate Scorecard has become
                                           better integrated into the broader monitoring system of
                                           institutional performance. It is increasingly used as an
                                           accountability and management tool and has gained

                                           The indicators in Tiers I and II are grouped into three
                                           categories encompassing growth, inclusiveness, and

                                           sustainability and resilience. The World Bank Group
                                           Strategy recognizes the importance of each of these
                                           areas to the achievement of the goals. Economic growth
                                           that creates good jobs requires action to strengthen
                                           both the private and public sectors. Inclusiveness entails
                                           empowering citizens to participate in, and benefit from,
                                           the development process and removing barriers to
                                           those who are often excluded. Sustainability ensures
                                           that development progress is not reversed; it implies
                                           securing the long-term future of the planet and its
                                           resources, ensuring social inclusion, and limiting the
                                           economic burden on future generations. When feasible,
                                           Corporate Scorecard indicators are disaggregated by
                                           gender and fragile and conflict-affected situations (FCS),
                                           in recognition of the importance placed on these factors
                                           in the World Bank Group Strategy.
    Tier I


    Tier I: Goals and Development Context
    Tier I of the Corporate Scorecard reports the long-term
    development outcomes that countries have achieved.
    As such, it reflects the broader context in which
    the World Bank Group is operating. Improvements
    observed in Development Context indicators are
    not attributed to the World Bank Group as they are
    the outcome of collective efforts by countries and
    their development partners. While Tier I reflects
    the development context in World Bank Group
    client countries, some aspects of environmental
    sustainability, particularly those related to climate
    change, have global dimensions and require efforts by
    all countries. Therefore, indicators for CO2 emissions
    and deforestation are reported for the world as a
    whole.

    Tier I indicators are expected to be refined over time
    to reflect the evolving consensus on key development
    challenges and how progress should be measured.

6
    This update reflects some of the on-going work
    on refinement of the indicators. The World Bank
    Group Corporate Scorecard will be aligned with the
    outcomes of on-going international dialogues such
    as the United Nations-led Post-2015 Development
    Agenda and the United Nations Framework
    Convention on Climate Change(UNFCCC). In addition,
    the international community, including the World
    Bank Group, continues to strive for more outcome-
    and quality-oriented indicators for the World Bank
    Group Corporate Scorecard. For example, efforts are
    underway to develop a “quality of learning” indicator
    to replace or complement the current “school
    completion” indicator.

Status of the
Corporate Scorecard
Indicators
Tracking performance is imperative to provide early
signals in areas that require attention or remedial action
to achieve the desired outcomes.

To this end, each indicator in the Corporate Scorecards
had a baseline value set when the World Bank Group and
World Bank Corporate Scorecards were first released.
The current edition shows varying degrees of progress
based on the latest available data.

In addition, Performance indicators (Tier III) include
targets and performance standards, where feasible,
to reinforce the World Bank Group commitment to
accountability, provide a vision of where the institution
aspires to be, and strengthen the focus on achieving
results.

A “traffic light” system is used to track the status of
individual performance indicators with established
targets for fiscal year 2017 and to provide insights into
data trends.

The traffic light system aims to convey, at a glance, areas
where there has been progress and highlights where
challenges remain and additional efforts are required.
Traffic lights also help guide dialogue on the actions for
improvements and corrective measures.

      On-track: A meaningful increase from the
      baseline or previous reported value. The
      indicator shows a positive trend toward
      achievement of target.


      Watch: No meaningful increase or decrease
      from baseline or previous reported value.
      Improvement is needed.


      Off-track: A meaningful decrease from baseline
      or previous reported value. The indicator shows
      a negative trend toward achievement of target.
      Significant improvement is needed.

        Population living on less than US$ 1.25 (PPP) a day (%): Percentage of the world population living on less than $1.25 a day at
        2005 international prices. Average, weighted by the total population. Data reported for the world.
        Source: Global database of Shared Prosperity circa 2006-2011, calculated         Frequency: Annual (available annual data varies by
        from PovcalNet 1.                                                                country)
        Median of growth rates of average real per capita income of the bottom 40% (%): Median, across all client countries, of
        growth rates of average real per capita income of the bottom 40% of every country’s population. The growth rate of the
        bottom 40% of the population of a country for year T is the average annual growth rate measured over a period of (roughly)
        five years leading up to (or close to) year T. The baseline number refers to a period that corresponds to roughly five years for
        every country, ending in a year between 2009 and 2013. Data is available for 64 countries.

        GDP per capita (constant 2005 US$): Gross domestic product divided by midyear population. GDP is the sum of gross value
        added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of
        the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation
        of natural resources. Current value generated in September 2014.

        Gross capital formation (% of GDP): Gross capital formation (formerly gross domestic investment) consists of outlays on additions
        to the fixed assets of the economy plus net changes in the level of inventories. Fixed assets include land improvements (fences,
        ditches, drains, etc.); plant, machinery, and equipment purchases; and the construction of roads, railways, and the like, as well
        as schools, offices, hospitals, private residential dwellings, and commercial and industrial buildings. Inventories are stocks of
        goods held by firms to meet temporary or unexpected fluctuations in production or sales, and “work in progress”    . According to
        the 1993 SNA, net acquisitions of valuables are also considered capital formation. Current value generated in September 2014.

        Agriculture value added per worker (constant 2005 US$): A measure of agricultural productivity. Value added in agriculture
        measures the output of the agricultural sector (ISIC divisions 1-5) less the value of intermediate inputs. Agriculture comprises
        value added from forestry, hunting, and fishing as well as cultivation of crops and livestock production. Average, weighted by
        agricultural employment. Current value generated in September 2014.

        Adult women with financial accounts (% of women, age 15+): Percentage of adult women (age 15+) that use an account at
        a bank, credit union, another regulated financial institution (e.g., cooperative, microfinance institution), or the post office.
        Accounts can be accessed directly at a branch, or remotely via an agent, correspondent, or mobile phone.

        Countries with growth concentrated in the bottom 40% (%): Percentage of countries (with available data) for which growth in
        average (mean) real per capita income of the bottom 40% is positive and greater than growth in average (mean) real per capita
        income of the total population. Growth rates are annualized (average annual growth rate) over a time interval of roughly five
        years. The growth rate of the bottom 40% of the population of a country for year T is the average annual growth rate measured
        over a period of (roughly) five years leading up to (or close to) year T. The baseline number refers to a period that corresponds
        to roughly five years for every country, ending in a year between 2009 and 2013. Data is available for 64 countries.

        Access to electricity (%, bottom 40% and gap to average): Percentage of the poorest 40% of population of each country (with
        available data) with access to electricity through a household connection and the gap to country’s average electricity access rate.
        Electricity refers to public or quasi-public service availability of electricity from mains. It refers to having an electrical connection
        and does not reflect details about actual electrical service received by the household. Bottom 40% is defined as the poorest
        40% of each country. The data is not to be interpreted as data for the poorest 40% globally. The gap is calculated as a difference
        between country’s total population average rate and the average rate for the poorest 40% of population. Average, weighted by
        the total population. Data is available for 59 countries.

Employed persons remaining extremely poor (%, age 15+): Percentage of extreme poor among employed people of age 15+.
The employed comprise all persons of working age who, during a specified brief period such as one week or one day, were in
the following categories: a) paid employment (whether at work or with a job but not at work); or b) self-employment (whether
at work or with an enterprise but not at work). Extreme poor are defined as people who live under US$ 1.25 a day at 2005
international prices. Average, weighted by the total population. The baseline number refers to a period 2005-2013. Data is
available for 64 countries.

Countries with equal economic opportunities for woman in law (number): Number of countries that provide women and men
the equal legal ability to participate in the economy or generate an income through getting a job or starting a business, including
the capacity to sign contracts, open bank accounts, or pursue employment opportunities. The indicator covers four areas: (i)
accessing institutions – examining legal capacity; (ii) using property - covering ownership rights; (iii) getting a job – examining
working hours, industry restrictions, and retirement and pensionable ages; and (iv) providing incentives to work - covering tax
treatment. Data are examined separately for married and unmarried women.

Primary school completion rate (%, ages 15-19; bottom 40% and gap to average): Percentage of the poorest 40% persons of
each country age 15-19 who have completed primary school education and the gap to the country’s average rate. Bottom
40% is defined as the poorest 40% of each country. The data is not to be interpreted as data for the poorest 40% globally. The
gap is calculated as a difference between country’s total population average rate and the average rate for the poorest 40% of
population. Average, weighted by the total population. Data is available for 65 countries.

        Countries without wealth depletion (%): Percentage of countries with positive or zero changes in wealth per capita. Based on
        changes in physical, human, and natural capital, change in wealth per capita indicates a country’s genuine savings to sustain
        income and welfare for its (growing) populations in the future. This measure is based on gross national savings adjusted for
annex

        changes in physical (i.e. depreciation in fixed capital), human (e.g. education expenditure), and natural capital (i.e. mineral,
        energy, and forest depletion), and accounting for the wealth-diluting effects of population growth.

        Countries with low or moderate risk from unsustainable debt (number): Number of countries rated 4.0 and above on a 1
        to 6 scale on question 3. A of the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) rating. The indicator rating is based
        on debt policy criteria and assesses whether a country’s debt management policy is conducive to ensure medium-term debt
        sustainability and minimize budgetary risk. The criteria cover the extent to which external and domestic debt is contracted with
        a view to achieving/maintaining debt sustainability. CPIA rates countries against a set of 16 criteria grouped in four clusters: (a)
        economic management; (b) structural policies; (c) policies for social inclusion and equity; and (d) public sector management
        and institutions.

        Countries mainstreaming disaster risk management (%): Percentage of countries that have made progress toward
        mainstreaming disaster risk management (DRM) in their developmental policies and programs. It includes countries that have
        reported satisfactory progress (satisfactory refers to an HFA (Hyogo Framework for Action) score of 3 out of 5) with an aggregate
        HFA score of 15/25 for all HFA priority areas: (i) ensuring DRM is a national and local priority with strong institutional bases for
        implementation; (ii) identifying, assessing, and monitoring disaster risks and enhancing early warning, (iii) using knowledge,
        innovation, and education to build a culture of safety and resilience, (iv) reducing underlying risk factors; and (v) strengthening
        disaster preparedness for effective response.

        Population living in areas under water stress (%): Definition under development. Final definition and data will be available in
        fiscal year 2015. Water stress is measured by an index determining water demand pressures from the domestic, industrial, and
        agricultural sectors (including usage, pollution, and abiotic stress) relative to the local and upstream water service supplies.
        This measure will also account for infrastructure to mitigate water stress (e.g. water treatment plants) so as to calculate the net
        water stress. This index will be used to identify areas with water stress and be overlaid with population maps to calculate the
        population share living in these areas.

        Population exposed to air pollution (PM 2.5) (%): Definition under development. Final definition and data will be available
        in fiscal year 2015. New satellite data on global Fine Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM2.5) concentrations is available. These data
        have been measured using the total column aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging
        Spectroradiometer) and MISR (Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite instruments and coincident aerosol vertical
        profiles from the GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model (van Donkelaar et al. 2010). Based on these data the World Health


 16
        Organization (WHO) is planning to publish a new database including annual mean PM2.5 concentration levels at 10x10km grid
        cell resolution. Overlaid with population maps, the share of population living in areas with critical PM2.5 exposure (following
        WHO air quality guidelines) will be calculated.

        CO2 emissions (kg per 2011 PPP$ of GDP): Carbon dioxide emissions are those stemming from the burning of fossil fuels and
        the manufacture of cement. They include carbon dioxide produced during consumption of solid, liquid, and gas fuels and gas
        flaring. Other greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are not included. CO2 is the primary greenhouse gas emitted through human
        activities. Measured in kg of CO2 equivalent per $ of GDP at 2011 international prices. GDP in PPP is the gross domestic product
        converted to international dollars using purchasing power parity rates. An international dollar has the same purchasing power
        over GDP as the U.S. dollar has in the United States. The indicator measures CO2 emissions intensity of GDP   , which shows how
        clean production processes are. Reductions can be due to gains in economic efficiency, while total GHG emissions can still go
        up. Mitigating the risks of climate change will require the stabilization of atmospheric GHG concentrations and thus reductions
        in total GHG emissions. Data is reported for the world. Initial baseline value was based on kg per 2005 PPP$ of GDP    . Updated
        baseline value for kg per 2011 PPP$ of GDP generated in September 2014.

Tier II: CLIENT RESULTS SUPPORTED BY WORLD BANK GROUP/WORLD BANK OPERATIONS
The Results sections of the World Bank Group and World Bank Corporate Scorecards report results achieved by World Bank
Group/World Bank clients, supported by World Bank Group/World Bank operations. Results reported are three- year incremental
results, as reported by projects active and/ or closed during the three-year reporting period (currently fiscal years 2012-2014).

Data are disaggregated for fragile and conflict-affected situations (FCS) and for female beneficiaries where feasible. The number
of female beneficiaries is, however, often underreported, as many projects are only starting to disaggregate beneficiaries by
gender. Efforts are continuing to improve the level of gender reporting by projects. FCS figures are based on countries of the
FCS list equivalent to the last year of the reporting period (currently fiscal year 2014).
WORLD BANK GROUP
The Results Tier of the World Bank Group Corporate Scorecard integrates Results from World Bank’s Investment Project
Financing (IBRD, IDA, and Recipient Executed Trust Funds) and IFC’s Investment Services (IS). The exception is the “Countries
with strengthened public management systems” indicator, which also includes the World Bank’s Development Policy Operations
and IFC’s Advisory Services (AS). Efforts are underway to integrate more systematically the results of policy, knowledge and
advisory activities. Efforts are also underway to integrate results from operations supported by MIGA.

When interpreting results, it is important to consider that the World Bank and IFC operate with different instruments and work
with different clients—i.e. government and private sector respectively. The results reported are those achieved by these clients,
with support of the World Bank and IFC. It is also important to bear in mind that some indicators aggregate results from projects
that finance expenditures (e.g., WB projects that fund vaccinations) and projects that finance capital investments (e.g., IFC
investments in hospitals). Aggregation rules will be improved in the future to make such numbers more comparable.

The aggregation of results across the World Bank Group has created the opportunity for the World Bank, IFC and MIGA to align
their methodologies to support accurate and meaningful results reporting. This alignment resulted in some adjustments to
baseline values, as methodologies were refined to better capture actual results.

         •	 Word Bank contribution includes the total number of students in all countries that benefited from World Bank-supported
            projects or activities supporting classroom assessment, examinations, national, or international assessments. The number
            of students benefiting from the assessment is calculated as the total number of students in the targeted cycle in each of
            the countries supported. The cycle refers to International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED 2011) categorization:
            primary, lower secondary, upper secondary education. The students are counted only if the Governments score 5 or higher
            (the highest score is 6) in the Assessment Rubric based on the Systems Approach for Better Education Results Framework,
            which measures the extent to which the country is utilizing the results of the assessments to enhance the quality of education.

         •	 IFC counts the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) students enrolled annually in institutions receiving support from IFC.
            Student FTE represents the institution’s best academic judgment of the full-time equivalence of the students. The full-time
            equivalence of students on part-time courses should be established by comparison with a comparable full-time course.
            Part-time students should be returned as a proportion of an equivalent full-time course. The Student FTE of part-time study
            can be estimated on either a ‘credit’ or ‘time’ basis. The number of student loans provided by financial institutions receiving
            support from IFC also counts towards the total number of students reached by IFC, where each loan outstanding is used as
            a proxy for one student.

emission reduction over the lifetime of the investments supported by these projects, divided by the lifetime of the respective
investments. In the case of MP   , the GHG emission reduction is achieved through the elimination of ozone-depleting substances.
For CF projects, the annual equivalent figure for Emission Reduction Purchase Agreement (ERPA) approved during the fiscal
year is the expected GHG emission reductions over the time-period of the ERPA contract, divided by the time- period of the ERPA
contract. This indicator is a placeholder for a broader greenhouse gas accounting indicator, which is being developed under the
WBG Corporate Scorecard (climate change mitigation and adaptation indicator). Once the WBG indicator is in place, it will also
be included in the World Bank Corporate Scorecard. Data: Fiscal years 2012- 2014.

Projected lifetime energy and fuel savings (MWh and MJ): Lifetime energy savings (converted to MWh) and lifetime fuel savings
(converted to MJ) achieved due to energy efficiency measures, directly attributable to the Bank-supported project. Projected
savings are calculated against baseline or business-as-usual scenario in the absence of the project. Savings are defined as
projected savings for the lifetime of the intervention in the year it is completed. The core sector indicators for “projected lifetime
energy savings” and “projected lifetime fuel savings” were approved in fiscal year 2014 only. Reporting is expected to start in
fiscal year 2016.

         •	 World Bank IBRD and IDA operations. Data are for three-year rolling period for those exit fiscal years for which at least
            60% of the projects have been evaluated by IEG. The rating captures the extent to which a project’s major relevant original
            objectives or formally revised objectives were achieved or are expected to be achieved efficiently. The rating is contingent
            on an operation’s stated objectives at the time of approval or at the time of relevant restructuring and on three criteria:
            the relevance of the objectives and design (relevance), the extent to which the objectives were achieved (efficacy), and
            the extent to which the operation achieves a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital or is able to provide an
            economic justification (efficiency). The baseline data are for exit fiscal years 2010-2012. The baseline data was updated
            because more projects exited in fiscal years 2010-2012 were evaluated by IEG as of June 30, 2014 compared to February
            28, 2014.

         •	 For IFC and MIGA operations, the development outcome rating is a synthesis rating reflecting achievement of both
            project benchmarks and objectives. It rates the project across four development dimensions: project business success,
            economic sustainability, environmental and social effects, and private sector development impact.

         •	 For IFC, the rating captures percentage of IFC projects rated over a given calendar year with Highly Successful, Successful,
            or Mostly Successful Development Outcome ratings. IFC’s project evaluation for a given calendar year is based on a
            representative sample of projects that have reached early operating maturity, defined as projects approved five years
            earlier than the calendar year for which the evaluation is being conducted (with adjustments for early operating maturity
            made based on judgments by IEG and IFC staff). It is based on a self- evaluation by investments staff of development
            and investment outcomes, as well as work quality and their sub-dimensions using Expanded Project Supervision Reports
            (XPSR) and corporate guidelines. All ratings are independently validated by the Private Sector Evaluation Department
            of the Independent Evaluation Group (IEGPE) and are adjusted, as needed, to ensure that the prescribed evaluation
            guidelines and criteria are applied consistently. The baseline data are for calendar years 2010-2012.
 •	 For MIGA, the ratings capture the percentage of MIGA- supported projects rated satisfactory or excellent for their development
    outcomes. MIGA and IEG evaluate the entire population of regular MIGA guarantee projects reaching operating maturity in
    a given fiscal year. Projects supported by the Small Investment Program (covering eligible guarantees up to $10 million) are
    being evaluated on a programmatic basis. MIGA staff conduct self- evaluations of a proportion of regular MIGA guarantee
    projects; these are independently validated by IEG. In addition, IEG evaluates a share of MIGA projects directly to ensure
    coverage of the population of regular guarantees by evaluation. Both self-evaluations and direct evaluations follow the
    same evaluation guidelines and criteria. The baseline data are for fiscal years 2010-2012. The actual data are for fiscal years
    2011-2013.

        Climate-related World Bank Group commitments (US$ billions, annual): Annual dollar amount of World Bank Group

        benefits when they contribute to climate change adaptation and/or mitigation, even when adaptation and/or mitigation is not
        their main objective. In other terms, an activity can provide adaptation and/or mitigation co-benefits both when climate change
        is among its stated objectives or one of its positive externalities. The climate finance system tracks lending commitments with
        climate change co-benefits at the time of project approval, not the amount of emission reductions or increased climate resilience
        resulting from the financing associated with each operation.

         •	 Adaptation is defined as an activity that provides adaptation co-benefits if it reduces the vulnerability of human or natural
            systems to the impacts of climate change and climate variability-related risks by maintaining or increasing adaptive capacity
            and resilience.

         •	 Mitigation is defined as an activity that provides mitigation co-benefits if it either reduces Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions
            into the atmosphere or enhances their removal from the atmosphere. Reductions are measured against a “no-project”
            baseline, and, similar to adaptation, the assessment is based on information in the project’s appraisal and/or supporting
            documents.

        Satisfactory outcomes for World Bank operations (%, IEG rating): Percentage of IBRD and IDA operations and percentage
        of IBRD and IDA commitments at exit rated moderately satisfactory or satisfactory or highly satisfactory on achievement of
        outcomes by Independent Evaluation Group (IEG). Data are for three-year rolling period for those exit fiscal years for which at
        least 60% of the projects have been evaluated by IEG. The rating captures the extent to which a project’s major relevant original
        objectives or formally revised objectives were achieved or are expected to be achieved efficiently. The rating is contingent on an
        operation’s stated objectives at the time of approval or at the time of relevant restructuring and on three criteria: the relevance
        of the objectives and design (relevance), the extent to which the objectives were achieved (efficacy), and the extent to which the

        operation achieves are turn higher than the opportunity cost of capital or is able to provide an economic justification (efficiency).
        The baseline data are for exit fiscal years 2010-2012. The baseline data was updated because more projects exited in fiscal years
        2010-2012 were evaluated by IEG as of June 30, 2014 compared to February 28, 2014.

Commitments with climate co-benefits (US$ billions): Commitments that are addressing climate change mitigation or adaptation.
Development activities provide climate change co-benefits when they contribute to climate change adaptation and/or mitigation,
even when adaptation and/or mitigation is not their main objective. In other terms, an activity can provide adaptation and/or
mitigation co-benefits both when climate change is among its stated objectives or one of its positive externalities. The climate
finance system tracks lending commitments with climate change co-benefits at the time of project approval, not the amount of
emission reductions or increased climate resilience resulting from the financing associated with each operation.

 •	 Adaptation is defined as an activity that provides adaptation co-benefits if it reduces the vulnerability of human or natural
    systems to the impacts of climate change and climate variability-related risks by maintaining or increasing adaptive capacity
    and resilience.

 •	 Mitigation is defined as an activity that provides mitigation co-benefits if it either reduces Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions
    into the atmosphere or enhances their removal from the atmosphere. Reductions are measured against a “no-project”
                                                                                                                                      27

legally, and managerially autonomous; and (c) is not owned or managed by a government. Private capital mobilized by IBRD or
IDA in an IBRD or IDA member country is reported in the indicator when the private capital provided is legally committed to the
project or invested in the client for defined business purposes or when it facilitates access to private financing by guaranteeing
defined government payments or obligations. “Private capital mobilized” is a sub-set of “Capital mobilized on commercial
terms” reported in the WBG Corporate Scorecard.
