              BOX 3.1: CLASSIFICATION OF FRAGILE AND CONFLICT-AFFECTED COUNTRIES

     The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development/Development Assistance Committee clas-
     sification of fragile and conflict-affected countries is as follows:

     1.	 Deterioration (deteriorating governance environment/ongoing conflict). States where the ability (or
         willingness) of the state to perform its functions is in decline. This poor performance frequently springs
         from chronic low capacity and is often associated with very weak rule of law and territory beyond the
         control of government. These countries are often experiencing conflict or are highly vulnerable to conflict.

     2.	 Prolonged crises or impasse (arrested development). States that fail to use their authority for pro-poor
         outcomes. The state’s ability to exert its will might be very weak, or very strong donors are typically
         unwilling to deal with the state directly.

     3.	 Postconflict/crisis or political transition. The states offer a window of opportunity for stakeholders to
         work together with government on a program of reform. However, the transition is fragile, with the
         prospect of return to conflict remaining high.

     4.	 Early recovery/gradual improvement. Countries where some effort is being made to improve performance
         but where performance is patchy. These countries might be postconflict or countries where conflict is
         not the primary driver. Often, there is no strong leadership championing reform within government, and
         capacity to implement reforms is weak.

     Frequently, countries can move from one category to another in a short amount of time.

          BOX 4.1: EVALUATION RESULTS FOR THE YEMENI SOCIAL FUND FOR DEVELOPMENT

     The Republic of Yemen’s Social Fund for Development focuses on pro-poor long-term development through
     Community and Local Development, Capacity-Building, Small- and Micro-Enterprise Development, and
     Labor-Intensive Public Works Programs. The Labor-Intensive Public Works Program played a crucial role in
     cushioning beneficiary communities from the economic shock of 2010–11, and averted potential longer-term
     consequences related to selling off assets and incurring debt. The public works program was scaled up to
     increase relief and humanitarian responses. By employing community members in public works activities,
     the program effectively reached a large number of rural households, increased average wages, shifted the
     structure of the workforce away from work in the lowest-paid sectors and caused a significant increase in
     the probability of female employment.

     Similarly, the Rain-fed Agriculture and Livestock Program has helped improve agricultural productivity by
     fostering the formation and training of small producer groups in the country’s rural regions. The program
     allowed villagers to self-select into participation in project groups where they would make investments in
     agriculture, receive training in organization and agricultural best practices, and receive subsidies for the
     purchase of livestock. The program had strong impacts on increasing community solidarity and—to some
     degree—female empowerment.
