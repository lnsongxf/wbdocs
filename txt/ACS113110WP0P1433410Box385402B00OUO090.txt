EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

T   his survey, the first of its kind in Djibouti, was based on linked anonymous HIV, syphilis and
    behavioral surveys to examine the magnitude and risk factors for HIV infection among female
sex workers (FSWs) and long-distance truck drivers (LDTDs).


The objectives of this survey were:
    1. To identify/validate locations where FSWs and LDTDs operate or where they are accessible
       in Djibouti Ville
    2. To assess baseline behaviors among FSWs and LDTDs in Djibouti Ville related to HIV/AIDS,
       sexually transmitted infections (STIs), reproductive health (RH) and family planning (FP)
    3. To measure the prevalence of HIV among FSWs and LDTDs
    4. To measure the prevalence of syphilis among FSWs and LDTDs
    5. To assess the extent of health service access and needs among FSWs and LDTDs
    6. To provide recommendations for evidence-based interventions among survey populations in
       Djibouti.

Methods
To select eligible LDTDs for the survey, a two-stage time-location cluster (TLC) sampling approach
was adopted. A “take all” approach was adopted for FSW. Socio-demographics and behavioral
information was collected via structured individual interviews using Samsung electronic tablets.
Blood samples were collected and linked to an individual’s socio-demographics and behavioral data.
Biological indicators from both FSWs and LDTDs included testing for recent and untreated syphilis
using a non-treponemal test and HIV prevalence testing using a Determine kit. Those who tested HIV
sero-positive were confirmed using an Immunocomb kit; those who tested positive for syphilis were
confirmed using Treponema Pallidum Hemoagglutination Assay. The protocol, consent forms and
draft questionnaires were approved by FHI 360’s Committee for Protection of Human Subjects, with
the approval of the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Djibouti.

Sex Workers: Key Findings
HIV/STI Prevalence
Overall, the prevalence of HIV among FSWs was 13%—six times higher than that of the general
population of Djibouti, which is estimated at 2.5%. The HIV prevalence was lowest for those aged
18–24 years (5%) and highest among those aged 40 years and over (36%). The syphilis prevalence
among FSWs was (5%), five times higher than the national estimated prevalence of 1%.

Basic characteristics
     A majority (52.5%) of the FSWs operated from service bars, while 22% operated from homes
      and the remaining 25% operated from the streets or brothels.
     A majority (68%) of the FSWs were under the age of 30, and the mean age in this population
      was 27.1.
     The illiteracy levels ranged between 41.7% and 85.2%, depending on the survey site.




                                                1
    Almost half (49.9%) of FSWs were unmarried and living alone. Another 29% of the FSWs were
     either divorced or separated.
Sexual and Reproductive Health
    More than 60% of FSWs from all the survey sites used contraceptives, and more than 72% of
      the FSWs were using contraceptives at the time of recruitment. More than 40% of the FSWs
      had had unplanned pregnancies in their lifetime.
    The condom was the most preferred contraceptive method (50%), followed by daily hormonal
      pills (22%) and injectable hormones (17%). Between 4% and 6% of those who used
      contraceptives used a combination of at least two contraceptive methods.
Sexual Patterns and Behaviors
    Of the 363 FSWs recruited, 252 (69%) had had their first sexual encounter when they were
      aged under 18 years, but 72% had started engaging in commercial sex after attaining the age
      of 18.
    Those who had had an early sex debut were more likely to start engaging in commercial sex at
      an earlier age than those who had delayed their debut.
    About 63% of the FSWs had regular clients, while 82% had occasional clients.
    Between 50% and 56% of FSWs (depending on survey site) had regular partners.
Condom Use
    Between 29% and 40% of all sexual encounters were unprotected when engaging with
      occasional and regular clients, respectively.
    Condom use among FSWs working in brothels was at only 47%, while among those working
      elsewhere it was 57%.
    Only 38% of sex workers (SWs) in brothels used condoms regularly, compared to more than
      48% of those working elsewhere.
    Incidences of condom breaks within a month before the recruitment drive were at 14%, while
       9% reported a condom break during the last sexual intercourse.

Knowledge of STIs
    At least 164 (45%) of the FSWs reported having heard of STIs in their lifetime. Of these, 19.0%
      had experienced vaginal discharges, 16.3% had abdominal pain and 10.4% had genital ulcers.
      Only 18% of brothel-based FSWs reported having heard of STIs. At least 69% of those who
      operated from public places such as bars and Chicha beits had heard of STIs, followed by
      those who operate from homes (60%).
    At least 50% of those with STI-like symptoms sought assistance from public health clinics/
      hospitals, while 23% sought assistance from private pharmacies. Another 19% took home
      remedies, while 9% consulted private clinics and/or hospitals. At least 40% of those aged
      over 40 and those aged 30–34 years (44.0%) preferred to buy medicine from private
      pharmacies.
Gender-Based Violence
    At least 74 FSWs reported cases of GBV, and 28% of these were of sexual nature.
    Close to 60% of FSWs who experienced GBV did not consider themselves at risk of HIV or STIs.



                                                2
     HIV prevalence among the 74 women who reported to have experienced GBV was 10%.
     About (39%) of perpetrators of GBV were clients and friends were implicated in 11% of cases.
Recommendations
Based on these findings, we recommend the followings:
     Demand for STI diagnosis and treatment among the SW population in the survey area should
       be increased by improving their knowledge on sexual health, the major symptoms of STIs,
       and the link between untreated STIs and HIV.
     While consistent condom use (i.e., every time) should constitute the major intervention
       strategy with both paying clients and non-paying partners, prevention programs should
       place more emphasis on promoting consistent condom use with both categories.
     FSW-friendly, outreach and mobile STI, condom promotion and voluntary counseling and
       testing services should constitute the priority intervention.
     Further research to understand the spread of STIs and risk factors for STIs among SWs is
       warranted. In this survey, blood samples were tested only for active syphilis, although this
       was supplemented by self-reported STIs.
     This survey provides baseline data that have not been available on various issues related to
       HIV and syphilis infections and prevalence in Djibouti. This report provides critical data that
       will be useful in formulation of other related studies in future. There is need for further
       research on areas and sub-populations not covered by this survey such as other clients of
       sex workers (dock workers, military etc) and other vulnerable populations such as youth.
       We anticipate that a follow-on survey to evaluate interventions that will take between 2 and
       5 years to implement will be designed based on findings of this survey. Qualitative research
       will also provide an in-depth understanding of emerging issues.
     It is important to note that both groups largely comprised of young participants (less than 25
        years old). Considering that this survey only recruited adults (above the age of 18 years),
        there are possibilities that children (under the age of 18 years) may also be working as sex
        workers and truckers. Future studies and programs should also focus on these groups and
        find strategies to reach to younger ages through media including social media


Long-Distance Truck Drivers: Key Findings
HIV/STI Prevalence
     Among the 526 truckers tested, 1% tested HIV positive and 1.5% were ere positive for syphilis.
     Interestingly, 4 of the 5 HIV-positive cases reported among LDTDs were found among the
        “literate.”
     Similar to the findings on FSWs, there was a correlation between anal sex and acquisition of
        HIV.
Basic characteristics
     More than 50% of the truckers were younger than 30 years, with a mean age of 31 years, and
       only 16% were aged 40 years or over. A majority of truckers (94%) slept in their trucks during
       the road trips, while only 5% and 2% slept either in a home or in a hotel, respectively.



                                                  3
    Literacy levels were relatively high among the truckers (64%) being able to read and write.
    Close to 45% of all LDTDs were currently married.
    About 63% of the truckers had worked for less than 3 years, indicating that the majority were
      still new in their jobs.

Sexual Patterns and Behavior
    More than 77% of the LDTDs had their first sexual encounter when they were between the
      age of 16 and 20 years.
    Those who had had a sex debut at an age under 15 years were more likely to seek a paid
      sexual encounter than those who had had a delayed debut.
    More than 77% first sexual encounters among the LDTDs were with a non-paid female.
    More than 10% of the LDTDs had paid for sex in the last one month before the survey, and
      another 25% of having had sex with a non-paid partner.
Condom Use
    Only 3.3% of the 526 LDTDs reported experiencing a condom break.

    The rate of consistent condom use with occasional and regular partners was only 72%. The
      rate of those who reported having had sex with paid female sex partners was 20%. More
      than 90% indicated that they had used a condom the last time they had sex with paid
      partner, and 76% had used condoms with non-paid female sex partners.

Knowledge of STIs and STI Symptoms and HIV and Self-Perception of Risk to HIV/STIs
    Knowledge of symptoms of STIs was relatively low, with only 6.5% reporting to have heard of
      STIs.
    The prevention methods for HIV/STIs that were correctly identified by most LDTDs unassisted
      included safe blood transfusion (92%), always using a condom while engaging in sexual
      intercourse (89%), having sex with only one uninfected female partner (88%), avoiding
      sharing of injection equipment (86%) and abstaining from sexual intercourse (85%).
    Some misconceptions of HIV/STIs and transmissions were noted. About 31% of truckers who
      were aware of HIV/AIDS felt that one can prevent HIV infection by cleaning genitals after
      sex, by avoiding being bitten by mosquitoes or other insects (38%) and by not sharing
      clothes or utensils (17%). Almost 72% of the LDTDs believed that it is possible to guess if
      someone is HIV positive through visual assessment.
    A high percentage (75%) reported having been previously tested for HIV. A majority (93%) of
      those tested indicated that the last test was voluntary, and 75% were counseled on
      HIV/AIDS and its prevention methods.
    Slightly more than 30% of the LDTDs were aware of drugs that can be used for the
       management of HIV/AIDS, and 16% had specific knowledge of antiretroviral therapy
       (ART).More than 50% of the truckers knew of someone with AIDS or someone who died
       from AIDS.




                                                 4
Possible Risk Factors for Syphilis and HIV
     About 18% of the LDTDs felt that they were at risk of contracting HIV, but 57% did not
       consider themselves to be at risk.
     A small percentage (less than 10%) considered themselves at risk of HIV by engaging in anal
       sex, having more than five sex partners, and having had a condom break during sex.
Recommendations
Based on these findings, we recommend the following.
     There is a need to increase the demand for testing of HIV and syphilis status among LDTDs.
     Future studies should investigate whether LDTDs, the majority of whom are foreigners, face
       language and cultural barriers that hinder their access to critical information on HIV and
       syphilis prevention.
     There is a need to design strategies to improve the knowledge of LDTDs on STI symptoms and
       self-assessment of risk of HIV and syphilis infections.
     A significant proportion of LDTDs indicated that they constantly engage in sex with unpaid sex
       partners, a population that was not included in the present survey. Future studies should
       investigate the role of such sexual associations in HIV/STI epidemics.
     LDTDs have traditionally been labeled as a special vulnerable group and a transmitter group
       for HIV and STIs. However, this survey found that the prevalence of HIV and syphilis among
       this group were below the national averages of Djibouti and Ethiopia, the native country of
       most LDTDs. Future studies should investigate the reasons behind these apparent
       discrepancies.
     Majority of LDTDs who participated in this survey were from Ethiopia. There is therefore a
       need to launch cross-border HIV/STI prevention and sensitization programs targeting such
       highly mobile and vulnerable groups.

1       INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND

1.1     HIV/AIDS in Djibouti
Djibouti lies in northeast Africa on the Gulf of Aden, at the southern entrance to the Red Sea. It
borders Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia. The country is mainly a desert with scattered plateaus and
highlands. The country has a population of approximately 850,000 people and a 2011 estimated per
capita gross national income of US$1,513 (UN Data: World Statistics Pocketbook 2013). The 2013 CIA
World Fact Book estimates that 42% of the population lives below the poverty line. The estimated
adult HIV prevalence of 2.5%, the highest among Arab League countries. HIV has reached epidemic
levels in Djibouti: An estimated 16,000 people currently live with the virus. More than 50% (about
9,000) of those who are HIV positive are women, and more than 1,000 are children. However, recent
reports1 show that HIV prevalence in Djibouti has been relatively stable in the last 10 years (UNAIDS
2012).

Djibouti’s current Strategic Plan for the Fight against HIV 2012–2016 has identified SWs and their
clients, especially the LDTDs, dockworkers and other migrant populations, as highly vulnerable
groups. SWs and their clients account for 21% of new HIV infections (UNGASS 2012). This is partially
because there is significant stigma and discrimination associated with HIV in Djibouti, which inhibits
testing and disclosure of sero-positive status, which in turn jeopardizes access to prevention, care
and treatment services. Due to the existing knowledge gaps on the dynamics of HIV epidemics in
Djibouti, there is a paucity of reliable data and information that can be used to formulate policies
and prevention strategies to halt the spread of HIV and other STIs among vulnerable groups. There is
therefore a need to generate reliable and up-to-date data that the Government of the Republic of
Djibouti (GORD) and its development partners can use to make accurate and informed decisions on
HIV/AIDS/STI prevention and management strategies, especially among vulnerable groups. Lack of
accurate and up-to-date data also undermines the efforts of GORD to mobilize resources for
appropriate responses to the ever-changing HIV transmission and management dynamics.

The transport corridors are important avenues for HIV/STI transmission in Djibouti. Various studies
have shown a relationship between HIV and mobility. Although mobility and migration are not risk
factors for HIV per se, the harsh conditions of travel and long periods of isolation (from family, peers
and friends) experienced by LDTDs can force them to engage in behaviors that are strongly
associated with increased vulnerability to HIV. These conditions may also create barriers to accessing
HIV prevention, treatment and care support. In most cases, the LDTDs seek sexual services from
FSWs who patronize the areas where trucks stop, especially those located near major cities. This is
particularly worrying because HIV prevalence has been reported to be as high as 20% among FSWs in
Djibouti’s capital city (Marcelin, Anne‐ Geneviève, et al. 2002)

It has been shown that LDTDs, military personnel, sailors and migrant laborers form the bridging
populations in HIV transmission, and this group of vulnerable people often record high prevalence of
HIV due to their interactions with FSWs. They are among the main clients of FSWs, whose HIV
prevalence is known to be much higher than the national average. The LDTDs may therefore serve as
a bridging population that could in turn serve as conduits of infection from the key populations (such
as SWs) to their regular partners, including spouses and wives.

1.2     Anatomy of the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Transport Corridor
The Addis Ababa-Djibouti Transport Corridor is an 850-km two-way stretch that has more than 27
towns/stops. Approximately 4,000 truck drivers and their assistants traverse this corridor every day.
A majority of LDTDs stop at PK12, which is the main stop along the corridor in Djibouti. The stop,
whose name is derived from the distance to Djibouti Ville, the capital center of Djibouti, is home to
some 25,000 people. At least 700–800 trucks that travel the corridor between Djibouti and Addis
Ababa park at this point every day; therefore, PK12 constitutes an important focal point for possible
interaction between LDTDs, SWs, and the local community (http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/
djibouti_54193.html). Such concentrated interaction has the potential to exacerbate the HIV
epidemic in the region. LDTDs are considered to be at higher risk of contracting and transmitting HIV
because of their job-related mobility, which in many countries has shown to lead to an increased
patronage of commercial and casual sex partners (Lacerda et al. 1997).

Existing data show that a majority of truck drivers along this corridor are Ethiopians. Most truckers
stop for meals, to sleep overnight and to meet with FSWs in hotels and bars, and it is not unusual for
the truckers to engage in unprotected sex with these FSWs. FSWs may also prefer LDTDs over local
residents because the LDTDs may have more money. It has been reported in several studies that
FSWs may opt to have sex without condoms for higher pay. This exposes them and their clients to
higher chances of infection (Ramjee et al. 2002).

These vulnerabilities have been classified in three categories: individual, social/economic and
programmatic. Individual vulnerability could arise among LDTDs as a result of the loneliness and
isolation that the LDTDs experience during long hours of driving or as a result of separation from
their home, families and peers. LDTDs may also experience a disconnection from their normal social
behavior and traditions, and differences in culture along the transport corridor and the stopover
points. Social and economic vulnerability may be more common among SWs, perhaps as a result of
extreme poverty that pushes them to sex work and a lack of legal status and rights, especially if they
are foreigners, and as a result of stigma and discrimination associated with transactional sex. In
addition, gender inequality makes FSWs vulnerable to violence and abuse, including non-consensual
sex and more-risky anal sex. Programmatic vulnerability may arise due to the limited access to
health, information and other support services that mobile people like LDTDs and SWs experience. A
combination of these vulnerabilities can predispose individuals to engage in risky behaviors
associated with high chances of acquisition and transmission of HIV/STIs.

Previous studies have shown that there are insufficient health service points and that poor attention
is paid to the specific needs of truckers and SWs, especially along the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Transport
Corridor. This is particularly worrying because it has been shown that both FSWs and dock
workers/truckers engage in a significant amount of risky behavior and that condom use is low or
inconsistent. A previous survey showed that sexual health seeking behavior was poor among SWs



                                                  8
and LDTDs; nearly 40% of LDTDs and dockworkers and 50% of SWs continue to have sex while
experiencing STI-like symptoms. The survey also showed that the current health facilities along the
corridor are insufficient and that there are no clear plans to increase their numbers in the future to
cope with the huge rise in traffic along this corridor (UNDP (2011).

There is also a need to develop strategies that can estimate the number of SWs and LDTDs at
different contact points (“hotspots”), estimate the volumes of transactional sex taking place on the
major transport corridors and determine if the majority of such sexual encounters are conducted
safely by using protective aids such as condoms. There is also a need to determine the availability of
health care facilities that provide testing and management support for HIV/AIDS/STIs along the
corridors. It is also important to identify the spatial distribution of “vulnerable places.” Places of
vulnerability, as defined by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), are those areas
where migrants and mobile populations live, work, or pass through, or from which they originate.
They may include border posts, ports, truck stops or hotspots along the transport corridors,
construction sites, commercial farms, fishing communities, mines, migrant communities and urban
informal settlements, migrant sending sites, detention centers and emergency settlements. Within
each of these places, there exist micro-hotspots that include bars, hotels, popular eating and
drinking spots and discotheques. Transactional sex is openly or covertly available in such spaces and
GBV and sexual abuse are not uncommon.

1.3      Rationale
There are considerable gaps in the quantity and quality of information available in Djibouti on
HIV/AIDS to help understand the underlying dynamics of the HIV epidemic and its likely future
course. In this context, in collaboration with the World Bank and U.S. Agency for International
Development (USAID)/Djibouti, FHI 360 conducted this IBBSS to generate relevant data to inform
HIV-related policy discussions, strategic decision making, mobilization and allocation of resources
and measurement of HIV and AIDS program results in the country, with a focus on FSWs and LDTDs.

1.4      Overall Objective
The main objective of the current survey was to generate baseline data to inform HIV-related policy
discussions, to help in strategic decision making and to support resource mobilization for HIV
interventions. The information generated is meant to serve as a baseline for subsequent evaluations
of the effectiveness of HIV interventions among FSWs and LDTDs in Djibouti.

1.5      Specific Objectives
Below are the specific objectives of this survey that were achieved in three phases (which are
discussed later):
      1. To identify/validate locations where FSWs and LDTDs operate or where they are accessible
         in Djibouti Ville
      2. To assess baseline behaviors among FSWs and LDTDs in Djibouti Ville related to HIV/AIDS,
         STIs, RH and FP
      3. To measure the prevalence of HIV among FSWs and LDTDs
      4. To measure the prevalence of syphilis among FSWs and LDTDs
      5. To assess the extent of health service access and needs among FSWs and LDTDs



                                                  9
      6. To provide recommendations for evidence-based interventions among survey populations in
         Djibouti

1.6      Survey Area/Sites
This survey covered four areas/quartiers of Djibouti Ville: Quartier 2, Quartier 4, Arhiba and PK12.
These sites were identified by the GORD for HIV intervention through the Roads to a Healthy Future
Project (ROADS). PK12 is the only truck stop within Djibouti Ville and was therefore naturally
selected as the site for sampling truckers. Arhiba, Quartier 2 and Quartier 4 were selected because a
large number of FSWs in Djibouti Ville operate there.

1.7      Survey Population
The survey population included FSWs and LDTDs. For purpose of this IBBSS, an FSW was defined as
any female 18 years or over who had received money or other valuable gifts/incentives in exchange
for sex in such areas as brothels, bars, restaurants, night clubs, or hotels, or on the street, within the
month prior to survey recruitment. An LDTD was operationally defined as a long-haul driver or
assistant/loader, aged 18 years or over, plying the Djibouti-Addis Ababa transport or similar route,
who stays away from the home area for durations of at least 1 day.

2       METHODOLOGY
The second generation surveillance approach was used for this survey. This approach was developed
by the World Health Organization (WHO) for regular, systematic collection, analysis and
interpretation of information for use in tracking and describing changes in the HIV/AIDS and STI
epidemic over time. There were three main phases to the research: 1) pre-survey assessment (PSA),
mapping and estimation of FSWs and LDTDs; 2) a pilot survey; and 3) the main IBBSS.

2.1     Phase I: PSA, Mapping and Estimation of FSWs and LDTDs
The PSA was undertaken to gain a better understanding of the survey groups and relevant
contextual factors, to examine how the survey groups can be reached, to build rapport with the
target population, to sensitize the population on the survey, to identify potential challenges or safety
concerns for either the survey team or survey population, and to assess the population’s receptivity
to the survey. This activity was also undertaken to get a rough estimate of the number of FSWs and
LDTDs operating from the survey areas. We anticipate that more data will be collected in the future
using other methods of size estimation to triangulate the PSA results and validate the estimated
number of FSWs and LDTDs in PK12, Quartier 2, Quartier 4 and Arhiba. The PSA was conducted
through focus group discussions (FGDs) with FSWs and LDTDs to get a better understanding of their
operations—where they can be found and the time of the day when the most or least number of
FSWs are available at the hotspots—and in-depth interviews with key opinion leaders, including local
administrators, FSW welfare association leaders and government officials, to get additional
information and corroborate information from the FSWs and LDTDs. The data collectors also
observed and counted the number of FSWs at specific times of the day. The main topics selected
were the nature and characteristics of the FSWs and LDTDs, their work, their estimated numbers at
the hotspots, the types of clients for the FSWs, the mobility pattern of the target groups and their
health care-seeking behavior. This phase targeted 8–12 focus groups of SWs (2–3 in each of the four
quartiers of Djibouti Ville), with about 10 participants each, and 2–3 focus groups of LDTDs, with 10
participants each. At least 12 in-depth interviews were conducted with opinion leaders, 3 in each
quartier. (A separate, detailed pre-survey assessment report is available).

Mapping of FSWs and LDTDs was conducted to build comprehensive sampling frames from which
the representative samples were to be drawn. The exercise targeted all possible locations in Djibouti
Ville (PK12, Quartier 2, Quartier 4 and Arhiba). The locations were identified through community
leaders, SWs, peer educators and other individuals knowledgeable of the areas. As most
transactional sex in these areas occurs in bars and lodges, these were also mapped and covered in
the survey. For each mapped bar or lodge, some key information, such as operational days,
operational time, and estimated size, was collected through interviews with staff members.

2.1.1   Estimated Number of FSWs by Locations
The numbers presented in Table 1 are from the mapping exercise conducted by trained research
assistants (RAs), who were paired with one FSW peer educator in each site to assist in the
identification of FSW hotspots and in the gathering of information, such as site characteristics,
estimated number of FSWs and working hours. After a peer educator showed the RA a hotspot, the
RA approached all females present and directly asked if they were engaged in sex work. Additional


                                                  11
data were collected through FGDs with selected FSWs to corroborate the number established from
the direct count. The FGDs revealed that there is a significant number of young “hidden” FSWs who
are in contact with their clients through telephone and/or social media; this hidden population was
therefore not found at the hotspots.

In the four survey sites, 46 hotspots were identified, including Chicha beits, informal “alcohol selling
houses,” bars/hotels/restaurants, brothels, lodges and street corners. An RA accompanied by a peer
educator visited each hotspot three times a day, every day of the week. The highest number and the
lowest number of FSWs during all these visits were defined as the maximum and minimum counts,
respectively. The average was considered the medium count. It was estimated that a maximum of
561 FSWs operated from these hotspots during peak hours (time that the highest number of FSWs
can be found at the hotspot, when they are likely to find clients), 327 at medium hours (in-between
time: no highest or lowest number of FSWs can be found at the hotspot, when not so many clients
frequent the hotspot) and 178 at lean hours (time during which the least number of FSWs can be
found at the hotspot, when there are few clients, in most cases coinciding with regular working
hours). Quartier 2 had the highest number of FSWs, followed by PK12, Arhiba and Quartier 4.

Quartier 2. Hotspots in Quartier 2 consisted of mainly Chicha beits, alcohol dens, khat dens and/or
brothels.

Quartier 4. The eight hotspots in Quartier 4 included Chicha beits, lodges, brothels and street
corners.

Arhiba. In Arhiba, hotspots included brothel-like houses, street corners and Chicha beits.

PK12. Most of the hotspots in PK12 were Chicha beits (14) and informal “alcohol selling houses” (3).
There was one bar/hotel. It was reported that there had been several police operations targeting
FSWs in the area, leading to closure of numerous venues where sex work was occurring.

2.1.2     Long-Distance Truck Drivers
The number of LDTDs found daily at PK12 was estimated through a review of Customs records and
corroborated with truck drivers’ association records. Table 2 shows the estimated number of trucks
at PK12 per day based on truck drivers’ association records. The daily average number of trucks
indicated by customs in an in-depth interview was 500, which is close to the number obtained from
the association’s records. These records indicated that 442 were recorded on Wednesday and 568
were recorded on Thursday. From key informant interviews, it was apparent that each truck has two



                                                  12
operators: a driver and an assistant. Therefore, on any given day, there was an estimated 884–1,136
LDTDs (drivers and their assistants) at PK12. The number may be higher, given that some trucks that
ply the route do not necessarily stop overnight at PK12.

2.2       Phase II: Pilot Survey
A 1-week pilot field trial was conducted in two of the survey areas (PK12 and Quartier 2) involving
testing various aspects of the survey process, including the survey protocol, methodology, training
and data collection. A total of 20 LDTDs were identified and interviewed in PK12, and 26 FSWs were
interviewed in Quartier 2. A team of 2 RAs (data collectors) led by a co-investigator conducted the
pilot survey to assess the feasibility of the main IBBSS. The research team gathered information to
inform improved quality and efficiency of conducting the main IBBSS. The pilot survey was designed
to provide vital information on the feasibility of the proposed procedures and, therefore, was a good
foundation for collection of high-quality data. Data were collected on HIV knowledge, attitudes and
risk behaviors, as well as HIV status.

2.3       Phase III: Implementation of Main IBBSS Survey
The final phase of the survey involved conducting a cross-sectional IBBSS among the survey
populations (FSWs and LDTDs).

2.3.1     Sample Size
Sample sizes for each population (sub-group) included in the IBBSS were calculated on the basis of
the following factors typically used in surveys with probability samples (see Section 2.3.2 on
sampling):
       Expected baseline value of key behavioral indicators (e.g., consistent condom use with various
         partner types)
       Magnitude of change it is desired to be able to detect
       Confidence level
       Statistical power
       Design effect

The following formula was used to determine the sample size for target groups for the IBBSS:




                                                   13
                         nD
                                2 P (1  P ) Z1  P1 (1  P1)  P2 (1  P2 ) Z1    
                                                                                        2


                                                          2

where:
         D      =   design effect
         P1     =   estimated proportion at the time of the first survey
         P2     =   proportion at some future date, such that the quantity (P2 − P1) is the size of the
                    magnitude of change it is desired to be able to detect
         P      =   (P1 + P2) / 2
           2                  2
         ∆      =   (P2 – P1)
         Z1-   =   the z-score corresponding to the probability with which it is desired to be able to
                    conclude that an observed change of size (P2 − P1) would not have occurred by chance
         Z1-   =   the z-score corresponding to the degree of confidence with which it is desired to be
                    certain of detecting a change of size (P2 − P1) if one actually occurred


For the Djibouti IBBSS, the following assumptions have been made regarding these parameters:
   1. Expected baseline value of 50%. Measurements require the highest sample size to detect
      change when the baseline is 50%, hence this figure was used. If it can safely be assumed that
      baseline values of all indicators are significantly lower or higher, then sample sizes could be
      lowered.
   2. Desired change to detect: 10%–15%. This refers to the amount of change that can be
      detected between two survey rounds. For example, if condom use changed by an absolute
      10%–15%, this would be detected as a statistically significant change. A lower absolute
      change would not be detected as statistically significant. Smaller differences require larger
      sample sizes.
   3. The alpha (α) level has been set at 0.05, corresponding to 95% confidence in the observed
      estimates.
   4. The beta (β) level has been set at 0.10, corresponding to 90% power.
   5. Design effect of 1.7. This adjusts for the use of sampling designs that are not simple random
      methods, e.g., cluster sampling.

2.3.2    Female Sex Workers
A sample size of 400 FSWs was calculated for this survey. However, based on the pre-survey
mapping exercise, the number of FSWs at the four sites ranged from a low of 178 to a high of 561.
Therefore, a “take all” approach was adopted, since the numbers involved may not have allowed for
any other sampling design (see Section 2.3.2). Of the expected 178–561 FSWs, the actual number
recruited for this survey was 363 (see Table 3).

2.3.3    Truck Drivers
The above formula derived a sample size of 600 LDTDs at PK12 truck stop. The actual achieved
sample size of 526 was finally recruited in this survey.

2.3.2   Sampling Procedures
FSWs. The PSA estimated the total number of FSWs in the survey areas (four quartiers) to be
between 178 and 561. Therefore, based on this key finding, we decided to adopt the “take all”
sampling approach to cover FSWs for the IBBSS. The “take all” sampling attempts to include every
eligible and accessible participant within the defined sampling domain using multiple approaches,
including field visits, and outreach using peer key informants and community leaders, etc. In this
survey, our field teams attempted to access all the eligible FSWs, through community volunteers and
liaisons who were working very closely with FSWs on daily basis. Duration of the fieldwork was
extended for a longer period to ensure that as many FSWs as possible were recruited or reached in
the survey. The survey team managed to recruit a majority of all eligible FSWs in Quartier 2 (see
Table 3) and the least number in PK12. PK12 had the lowest number of recruited FSWs (12) out of an
expected highest expected (125), followed by Quartier 4 (54 out of an expected total of 101). It
should be noted that the number of SWs varied depending on the time of the day, day of the week
and season (the number of clients available varied at those times of day and year). The low turnout
in PK12 was probably attributed to the nature of the SWs in the area: A majority of them were either
young or foreigners who got their clients through phone and/or social media and were therefore not
easily available for face-to-face interviews.

LDTDs. To select eligible LDTDs for the survey, a two-stage TLC sampling approach was adopted.
Based on detailed mapping information on all possible access points for LDTDs within PK12,
operational time of the site, average duration of stay at the site, average duration for a return visit at
the site, etc., a list of the relevant TLCs for PK12 was developed. For the first stage, a total of 26 field
day TLCs, each TLC being of 1-day duration, was covered for the survey. Based on the findings of the
PSA, a truck driver was likely to come to PK12 at least once within a period of 26 days. It was
calculated that going beyond the 26 days would likely get the same individuals already interviewed
and the recall period for participation in the interview was within the month.

A systematic random sampling approach covering the selected TLCs was used for selection of the
required number of eligible respondents during the second stage. On average, the field team,
consisting of six interviewers, recruited about 20 eligible respondents (LDTDs) per day. Respondents
were selected systematically from different corners of the TLC. An RA visited the TLC and
approached every male present and confirmed that he was a truck driver before requesting an
interview. The process was repeated until all eligible participants of the day were covered. The team
kept track of total estimated number of LDTDs at the TLC, the response rates and the reasons for
refusals.

2.3.3   Ethical Issues
Participation of all respondents in the survey was strictly voluntary. Measures were taken to ensure
that the respect, dignity and freedom of each individual participating in the survey was safeguarded.
To guarantee the anonymity of each participant, the names of respondents, their addresses or other
identifying information were not included in the questionnaires or on any biomarker tracking forms.
The questionnaires were identified with a code. Stickers with numbered codes were used on the
questionnaire, on the blood sample vials, on the laboratory reports and on the HIV testing and
counseling (HTC) referral forms. Informed consent was obtained from each participant by reading a
short paragraph that summarized the survey and the guarantee of confidentiality. After witnessing
informed consent, the form was signed by the respondent and the RA. In cases where the
respondent did not wish or was not able to provide a signature, the form was signed by the person
requesting the consent and by a witness, a person identified by the respondent (usually a fellow
truck driver or friend). The witness was deemed valid only if he was a witness after verbal informed
consent of the participant had been obtained. During the interview, basic information was provided
regarding HIV/AIDS, diagnostic testing, condom use and specific risks for each target population.

FHI 360’s Committee on Protection of Human Subjects and Djibouti’s MOH concurrently approved
the protocol, consent forms and draft questionnaires of the survey. (Note that the Djibouti National
Institutional Review Board was not operation at the time the survey was designed.)

2.3.4   Recruitment and Training of Personnel
A field team comprising 1 coordinator, 3 supervisors, 1 data manager and 14 RAs, along with 18 HTC
counselors and 18 laboratory technicians provided by the government for the IBBSS process was put
in place before the implementation of the survey. The RAs were selected carefully; they had to have
a minimum of a secondary school education (10 years of schooling) and had to be experienced in
data collection and/or HIV programming. For the testing exercise, the government provided trained
and accredited counselors and laboratory technicians. Most importantly, the interviewers and
counselors were individuals who were able to read and speak the local language of the interviewee.
Two levels of training were implemented: a 2-day training of coordinators, supervisors and data
manager, and a 6-day training for RAs, followed by training of HTC counselors and laboratory
technicians. At this training, the field team was guided through in-depth sessions on the survey
objectives, the methodology and the questionnaires. Their understanding of their roles in the survey,
the survey process, ethical considerations and the need for good quality data were also enhanced.
Data were collected using electronic devices (tablets). The field teams got a 1-day training on the use
of tablets and a 1-day practical session. During the training, each question in the questionnaire was
reviewed and role-played and possible challenges identified and addressed. In addition, a 1-day field
trial was conducted for the interviewers in two selected sites prior to commencement of data
collection. HTC counselors and laboratory technicians were given refresher courses on the processes
of counseling, testing of HIV/syphilis among most-at-risk populations (MARPs) and ethics
consideration with a special focus on confidentiality.

To ensure sustainability and to build the capacity of Djibouti’s institutions, the person responsible for
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) in the Executive Secretariat for HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria (ES) was
trained and involved in supervision of the field team.

3         DATA COLLECTION
3.1       Data Collection Instruments
A standard IBBSS questionnaire developed by WHO, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, FHI 360 and other organizations was modified to suit the Djibouti context and used for
data collection. A paper-based questionnaire was used during the pilot survey, but for the main
IBBSS survey, the questionnaire for each of the sub-groups was uploaded into Samsung Galaxy Tab 3
tablets for electronic data collection. The questionnaire was translated into French, and the RAs
(interviewers) were trained to ask questions without changing and/or distorting the intended
meaning and content of the question. Information was obtained on selected behavioral indicators,
including sexual history and practices, sexual risk behavior, condom use with different types of
sexual partners, knowledge of STIs, STI care-seeking behaviors and FP knowledge and practice,
among other issues. Biological indicators from both FSWs and LDTDs included testing for recent and
untreated syphilis using a non-treponemal test and HIV prevalence testing using a Determine kit. The
blood samples of those who tested HIV sero-positive were confirmed using the Immunocomb kit,
while syphilis-positive samples were confirmed using the Treponema Pallidum Hemoagglutination
Assay.

3.2       Data Collection Flow and Interview Procedures
Data were collected daily using hand-held electronic data collection devices (Galaxy Tab 3 tablets)
between March 8, 2014 and April 10, 2014, from FSWs identified at hotspots in the four quartiers,
while the LDTDs were identified at the truck park in PK12. Trained RAs conducted face-to-face
interviews with the respondents after the HIV testing. HIV testing was conducted by public health
care providers (a laboratory technician and a counselor).

The following steps were followed during the survey data collection process:
       The counselor introduced and explained the survey to the participant.
       The counselor obtained informed consent for the biological component from the participant
         and assigned a unique code (ID) to the client to be used at the laboratory and by the
         interviewer during the behavioral interview.
       The counselor referred and accompanied the respondent to the interviewer.
       The interviewer obtained consent from the participant for the behavioral component.
       The interviewer conducted the behavioral interview using the participant ID and accompanied
         the participant back to the counselor.
       The counselor conducted pretest counseling and accompanied the participant to laboratory
         technician.
       A laboratory technician drew a blood sample from the participant and labeled the sample with
         the participant’s survey ID.
       A laboratory technician conducted a rapid test and sent results to the counselor.
       Blood samples with corresponding code numbers were appropriately stored and those that
         tested positive for HIV (and/or syphilis for the main survey) were sent to the referral
         hospital.



                                                   17
       The counselor provided HIV test results to the participant (if desired) and post-test counseling.

Behavioral interviews were conducted in private settings (health facility or community centers) that
guaranteed the confidentiality of information provided by the respondent. The survey team in each
facility consisted of interviewers, a supervisor, counselors and laboratory technicians. Consent was
obtained by a counselor or supervisor who acknowledged that all necessary information was
provided and understood. Interviewers ensured that respondents were not interviewed twice by
asking respondents if they had been interviewed in the last 30 days and by using a single team for
screening of participants. This was done because the target groups were very mobile and the
probability of double recruitment at two different survey locations was high. Adequate preparations
were made to ensure that the interviews were conducted at a time determined during the pre-
surveillance mapping exercise as the most suitable to conduct the interviews and testing. In
particular, the exercise was synchronized with the working hours of the FSWs, who normally start
working at 4pm. The peak period (when the majority of them were in the hotspots) was determined
to be between 4pm and midnight. For security reasons, the field team visited and stayed at the
hotspots between 3pm and 9pm as they recruited participants.

3.3       HIV/Syphilis Counseling and Testing
Before the behavioral interview, a counselor explained the HIV testing and escorted the participant
to the laboratory technician, who drew blood and conducted a rapid test for HIV and syphilis. The
counselor escorted a participant for the test only after he/she had voluntarily consented to take the
test. Following discussions with the MOH and an analysis of the PSA data, it was agreed that testing
would be conducted at the health facility, the ideal place for the required privacy. In PK12, testing
was conducted at the ROADS II-supported resource center, after getting approval from the MOH for
sufficient privacy and confidentiality. At the other three survey sites, interviews and testing was
conducted at the nearest public health facility (the Arhiba and Khor Bourhan health centers). To
ensure that there was no interruption of routine service delivery for other members of the public,
the field coordinator, supervisors and interviewers made prior visits to officers in charge of the
target venues. Most of the participants tested were willing to participate and received their test
results immediately after appropriate post-test counseling. Those who did not immediately collect
their test results were encouraged to collect them at their convenience. Each participant was given a
card with a reference number to enable him/her to collect his/her results whenever he/she wished.
Apart from the reference number, no personal identification information was included on the
questionnaire or card. The laboratory technician completed the MOH HTC forms/register from which
the supervisor extracted the results at the end of each day, linking to the questionnaire through the
MOH unique ID number, which was also used on the questionnaire. In addition to free HIV
counseling and testing, the counselor referred those who required services to the health facility.
He/she also provided one-on-one education and counseling regarding risk reduction and prevention
of HIV infection. He/she then encouraged respondents to repeat the test at a nearby HCT center
after 3 months. All respondents (FSWs and LDTDs) who tested positive for HIV received information
on available services and were referred to the health facility for appropriate care.

3.3.1     HIV Testing
Clinical procedures for blood testing were carried out according to the national algorithm for rapid
testing using Determine and Immunocomb kits. Trained laboratory technicians collected a single



                                                    18
biological specimen of 10 ml venous blood from each respondent using serum separation tubes
labeled with the participant’s survey ID number and date of collection. The Determine test was then
conducted immediately and results completed within 15 minutes. If the test result was negative, the
participant received his/her result and post-test counseling. The remaining blood sample was then
disposed of according to the national standard procedures. The positive and indeterminate results
were tested in the health facility using the confirmatory Immunocomb test. After the confirmatory
test, any discordant results were taken to the reference laboratory for further testing using the
Western Blot technique. All samples were stored appropriately.

3.3.2   Syphilis Testing
One drop of blood was used for conducting a rapid syphilis test in the field using the Determine
syphilis kit. Results from the syphilis test were recorded on the paper form questionnaire. The blood
sample for those who tested positive were used for confirmation using the Treponema pallidum
Hem agglutination Assay. Those testing positive were also referred for treatment. The respondent
was allowed to make an independent decision on whether to go to the health facility after
counseling and receiving all relevant information.

All data, including hard copies of informed consent forms and HIV/syphilis test results, were kept
confidential and stored in a secure place under lock and key, accessible only to the key survey staff.

4        DATA MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS
4.1      Field Supervision
For the IBBSS survey, the field coordinator provided supervision and oversight by reviewing all
completed questionnaires and test results before they were uploaded to the server. During survey
data collection, each site team consisting of interviewers, counselors and laboratory technicians had
a supervisor verify all entries. The supervisor reviewed each completed questionnaire on the tablet
and the HTC register immediately after the interview and testing session ended and identified
mistakes for correction before the respondent left the site. Identified errors were discussed with the
enumerators to avoid repetitions during succeeding interview sessions. A team composed of a field
coordinator, the ROADS II M&E Officer and an ES/M&E officer in charge reviewed each completed
questionnaire. The M&E officers were also involved in the supervision. After review and verification,
the team provided guidance and oversight to supervisors where necessary. They also supervised the
sampling techniques to ensure that the teams adhered to the methods described for each group and
that all ethical issues were addressed.

4.2      Data Cleaning
For the interviews, electronic versions of the final and approved questionnaires were uploaded into
the electronic data collection device using a free and open-source data kit (ODK). HIV and syphilis
test results obtained through specimen testing were entered in the electronic database and linked to
the behavioral questionnaire using a unique ID code. To ensure the quality of data entry, a template
for the questionnaire was designed with preprogrammed consistency checks for cross-checking
answers, including skips and eligibility criteria. Before uploading the collected data to the server, a
team composed of a field coordinator from MOH, a data manager, supervisors and a ROADS M&E
officer proceeded on the data-cleaning exercise by reviewing each RA’s entries for consistency and
completeness. A simple frequencies and cross-tabulation test was run to identify inconsistencies
and/or detect missing values. Verification included:
       Cross-checking all corresponding skips to the questionnaire
       Tallying the supervisor’s log of blood samples collected to ensure that recorded numbers of
         samples matched the results recorded in the tablets and that the data were uploaded in
         formats compatible with the pre-approved analysis plan
       Verifying that the questionnaire completion responses from the interviewers in the tablets
         matched those recorded in the supervisors log
       Consistency checks involving cross-checking answers to related questions

4.3      Data Analysis
Data were analyzed using the SPSS statistical analysis software. Simple frequencies were generated
to initially recheck or revalidate the quality, and a range of relevant consistency checks were carried
out. All the key behavioral and biological indicators (mostly in percentages or proportions) were
calculated using appropriate numerators and denominators. Bi-variate analysis was conducted using
cross-tabulations. HIV and syphilis results were stratified by socio-demographic characteristics and
sexual behavior of survey populations.



                                                  20
Geographic coordinates of hotspots were collected using GPS-enabled electronic devices. Using
ArcGIS software, maps were generated of hotspots and health services and juxtaposed with HIV
prevalence and sexual behaviors.

5       LIMITATIONS OF THE SURVEY
There was a possibility of the same respondent being interviewed more than once due to the
associated mobility of the target groups. In this IBBSS, the participants (FSWs and LDTDs) were
mobile. However, efforts were made to avoid such occurrences. Participants were asked before
taking part in the survey if another survey team had interviewed them within the last month.
Anyone interviewed in the last month was not re-interviewed.

The survey did not cover all the potentially high-risk and vulnerable groups in the country. As such,
the results from this survey are not necessarily representative of the key populations in Djibouti. The
focus of this survey was on heterosexual activity. Same-sex relations are not explicitly included in
this survey.

The behavioral component of this survey exclusively relied on respondents’ self-reports. This data
collection method often has limitations that are attributed to the tendency for people to under-
report socially unacceptable attitudes and behaviors (e.g., risky sexual behavior) and to over-report
socially acceptable behaviors (desirability bias).

This survey was not designed to explain causality. One limitation of such cross-sectional design is
that it is difficult to explain causality in both observed behavior and status.

At the time of the survey, FSWs in PK12 were not available for recruitment and therefore only a
small number of participants (12) were recruited. Most FSWs in this site are illegal immigrants (from
Ethiopia and Somali) who feared being exposed to arrest if they participated in the survey. Data
collection was extended by 5 days after the end of data collection in the other quartiers, but the
anticipated number (31 and 125) was still not achieved.

6        RESULTS
6.1      Refusal to Take the HIV Test
Of the 363 FSWs recruited for this survey, 361 (99%) agreed to participate in both behavioral
interviews and the HIV/syphilis testing exercises. On the other hand, of 526 LDTDs selected, 23 (4%)
refused to participate in the biological components of the survey. However, all 526 agreed to be
interviewed.

6.2      Female Sex Workers
6.2.1    Socio-Demographic Characteristics of FSWs
6.2.1.1 Distribution of FSWs Based on the Area of Operation
This survey recruited 363 FSWs in four quartiers in Djibouti Ville and 526 LDTDs (drivers and
assistants) identified and selected from PK12 area. Table 4 shows the socio-demographic
characteristics of the FSWs based on the location where they operated. Close to half (48.5%) of all
FSWs sampled were located in the Quartier 2 area and more than 33% were in Arhiba. However, it
was not possible to establish the reason why the FSWs preferred these two areas. The survey also
revealed that a majority (52.5%) of the FSWs operated from service/bar and lodge, while 22%
operated from homes and the remaining 25% operated in the streets, brothels or Chicha beits. This
survey therefore identifies bars and residential homes as important contact points for FSWs and
their clients. Such facilities should be given priority in future campaigns for safe sex.

6.2.1.2 Distribution of FSWs Based on Age
The survey reveals that a majority (68%) of the FSWs were under the age of 30 and the mean age in
this population was 27.1; most of the recruited FSWs were young, regardless of the area and facility
from where they operated. Interestingly, only 7% of the FSWs were over the age of 40, probably
indicating that FSWs retire only after a couple of years as SWs or that the older women migrate to
other areas not covered in this survey. These assumptions remain to be ascertained in future
studies. However, it is important to note that this survey focused only on SWs over the age of 18 and
the results do not rule out the possibility that underage girls are involved in commercial sex. This
survey did not cover FSWs who use other means of reaching their clients, such as via phone and
social media.

6.2.1.3 Literacy among FSWs
Significantly low levels of literacy were recorded among the FSWs. The illiteracy (inability to read and
write) levels ranged between 41.7% and 85.2%, depending on the survey site, indicating that most
FSWs were not properly educated. However, 50% of FSWs at PK12 could read and write. Thus, this
survey suggests that a majority of the FSWs sampled may not be able to read and/or comprehend
written information on critical such issues as HIV protection strategies, campaigns against HIV/AIDS
and where to access support for sexual health, including condoms and contraceptives.

6.2.1.4 Marital Status among FSWs
A majority (64%) of the recruited FSWs had never been married, including a larger group (49.9%)
who were living alone and a second group (13.8%) who were unmarried but living with a partner. A
significant percentage (29%) of FSWs were either divorced or separated. Only seven of the FSWs
were married. However, it was not possible to establish if the spouses of the married FSWs were
aware of their wives’ engagement in commercial sex. These data therefore reveal an important
finding: that some FSWs maintain stable relationships despite their occupation. Such relations are
likely to be highly risky, and the spouse may remain significantly predisposed to infection with HIV or
STI.

6.2.2   Period of Work as an FSW
The survey revealed that a high percentage (64%) of FSWs at Arhiba had worked for less than 3 years
as SWs, while Quartier 4 had the highest proportion of FSWs who had worked for more than 10
years. The survey also revealed that more than 50% of all FSWs working in brothels, from their
homes or from other public places such as bars and Chicha beits were relatively new to their
profession, having worked for less than 3 years. FSWs in brothels were more likely to have worked
there for more than 3 years than who operated in other facilities (OR: 5.79, CI: 3.41–9.83). The cross-
tabulations of all statistical tests in this survey are presented in Appendix 1.

6.2.3   Mobility among FSWs
Of the 363 females recruited in this survey, 69% lived in the same city or locale in which they
operated as SWs. Another 21% were migrants from other regions of Djibouti, while 3% were from
Ethiopia. Among the 363 FSWs recruited, only 100 (28%) agreed to reveal the identity of their native
homes or country of origin. At least 64% of these 100 FSWs were from Djibouti, 29% were from
Ethiopia and 7% were from Somalia/Somaliland. At least 29% of the 363 FSWs return home more
than once per year.

6.2.4   Sex History among FSWs
The survey shows that of the 363 FSWs recruited, 252 (69%) had their first sexual encounter when
they were under 18 years old, but 72% started engaging in commercial sex after attaining the age of
18. Regardless of their category (where they operate), a majority of SWs (59%–89%) had a sex debut
under the age of 18, but between 57% and 82% in different categories started engaging in
transactional sex after the age of 18. The survey also reveals that those who had an early sex debut
were more likely to start engaging in commercial sex at an earlier age than those who delayed their
debut (OR: 6.61, CI: 4.77–9.16).

6.2.5   Transactional Sex among FSWs
The current survey did not determine any statistical differences in type and number of sex partnersin
Quartier 2 and Arhiba (the two sites with the highest concentration of FSWs) and those in the other
regions (OR: 1.5, CI: 0.913–2.4). Our analysis did not identify a statistical difference between the
number of sex partners among FSWs operating in defined facilities, such as brothels and homes, and
those operating in public places, such as bars, restaurants and Chicha beits (OR: 0.66; CI: 0.42–1.04).

6.2.6   Sexual Partners among FSWs
Majority of FSWs were found to engage with both regular sex workers and with occasional partners
in which case least (63%) of the 363 participants had regular clients while 82% of these 363 also had
occasional clients. High percentages (ranging between 50% and 56%) of FSWs working in all survey
sites also had regular partners. A similar high percentage (ranging between 39% and 88%) of those
working in different facilities, such as brothels, homes and public places, also had regular sex
partners. The percentages of FSWs who had occasional clients in the four survey sites were also
above 65%. Similar high percentages (75%–95%) of those operating in brothels, homes and public
places had occasional partners. As expected, statistical tests showed that a higher proportion of
FSWs were likely to have occasional clients than regular clients (OR: 3.2, CI: 2.3–4.5).

6.2.7   Family Planning
6.2.7.1 Use of Contraceptives among FSWs
The methods and types of contraceptives that women use are important in HIV/STI prevention
because not all contraceptives protect the user from infection while protecting her from unwanted
pregnancies. Condoms are the only contraceptives that have this protective against both. There is a
possibility that women who are not conversant with critical issues related to HIV and STI
transmission may be keen to avoid pregnancy and therefore engage in risky unprotected sex if they
are using other contraceptives, such as daily hormonal pills or injections that do not offer any
protection against HIV and STIs.

Although the main focus of this survey was on condom use, we also interrogated the use of other of
contraceptives among the FSWs. Table 5 shows FP and contraceptive methods used by the
participating FSWs. The current survey revealed that more than 60% of FSWs from the four survey
sites use contraceptives. A total of 39% of the FSWs reported having previously conceived against
their wishes, and 72% were on contraceptives at the time of recruitment. The condom was the most
preferred contraceptive method (50%), followed by the daily hormonal pills (22%) and injectables
(17%). Between 4% and 6% of those who used contraceptives employed a combination of at least
two contraceptive methods. At least 38% of the FSWs used a combination of two FP methods.

6.2.8    Condom Use between FSWs and Their Clients
Table 6 shows the pattern of condom use among FSWs and their occasional and regular partners in
the last month prior to recruitment. Condom use with occasional clients was estimated at 82% (244
out of 297 who responded to the question) and more than 71% of all FSWs indicated that they
consistently used condoms. Condom use with regular clients was 77% (238 out of 309 who
responded to the question), while it was at 71% with the regular clients. These data indicate that
between 29% and 40% of all sex encounters with different category of clients were unprotected.
Condom use among FSWs working in brothels was only at 47%, while that of those working
elsewhere was at 57%. Furthermore, only 38% of SWs in brothels used condoms regularly, compared
to more than 48% of those working elsewhere. Only 50% of FSWs in Arhiba used condoms,
compared to more than 66% of FSWs in all other survey sites. The number of FSWs in Arhiba who
reported consistently using condoms with regular clients was also low (28%) compared to more than
88% in all other sites. These data suggest that, in general, condom use is low in Arhiba and in
brothels. These data further support our hypothesis that FSWs working in brothels are likely to
engage in risky sex because they establish a stable client base (regular customers) with whom they
develop mutual trust. However, it is not clear why use of condoms in Arhiba was lower than use in
other sites. More than 48% of FSWs were unable to use condoms because their clients refused to
wear them, while 21% indicated that they would wish to have protected sex but that condoms were
not available. Another 5.8% indicated that they did not use a condom because they trusted the

clients. Only a small percentage (7%) of those who did not use condoms cited affordability as the
reason for not using condoms.

6.2.10 STI/HIV/AIDS Knowledge, Attitudes and Behavior
This section presents indicators of STI/HIV/AIDS knowledge, attitudes, and related behaviors for
FSWs. It also seeks to establish respondents’ personal assessment of their risk of contracting STIs
and HIV.

6.2.10.1 Knowledge of STI Symptoms and Infections among FSWs
We sought to establish knowledge of STIs and health-seeking behavior among FSWs. Table 8 shows
the knowledge of STIs and STI symptoms based on socio-demographic characteristics among FSWs.
In general, 165 (46%) reported having heard of STIs. The most recognized STI symptoms in women
by close to or more than 50% of the FSWs were: burning sensation (62%), lower abdominal pain
(58%), foul-smelling vaginal discharge (51%), genital ulcers (49%) and itching around the genital area
(59%). This group of FSWs was also aware of a number of STI symptoms in men, such as urethral
discharge (44%), burning sensation during urination (52%), genital ulcers (41%) and swelling around
the groin (33%).

The proportion of FSWs who had heard of STI symptoms varied depending on the areas of
operation. Only 18% of brothel-based FSWs reported having heard of STIs. On the other hand, 69%
of those who operated from public places such as bars and Chicha beits had heard of STIs, followed
by those who operate from home (60%).

6.2.10.2 Self-Reported Experience with STIs and STI Symptoms
Table 9 shows data on self-reported cases of STIs and health-seeking behavior among the FSWs.
Among 165 FSWs who reported having experienced STI-like symptoms in their lifetime, 19.0% had
vaginal discharge, 16.3% had abdominal pain and 10.4% had genital ulcers. The proportion of FSWs
who reported having had STI-like symptoms at Arhiba was at least twice as large as those who
reported having STI-like symptoms in all other locations.

We sought to establish health care-seeking behavior among the 121 FSWs who reported to have
experienced STI-like symptoms in the last 1 year prior to recruitment. Among these 121 FSWs, 60%
sought assistance from public health clinics and/or hospitals and 25% sought assistance from private
pharmacies. Another 12% took home remedies, while 9% consulted private clinics and/or hospitals.
About 38% of those aged over 40 and those aged 30–34 years (40.0%) preferred to buy medicine
from private pharmacies.

This survey revealed that a majority of FSWs continued to engage in sexual intercourse even when
they had STI-like symptoms and that a majority did not reveal their illnesses to other people,
including their sex partners or spouse and fellow FSWs. This is an important observation, considering
that some STI-like symptoms reported included genital ulcers that are significantly associated with
acquisition and transmission of HIV infections.

6.2.11 Prevalence of Syphilis among FSWs
A total of 18 participants among the 361 FSWs who submitted blood samples were diagnosed with
syphilis, giving an estimated prevalence of 5%. The rates were higher among the divorced (7.5%),
those operating from brothels (11.8%), those aged over 40 years (20.0%) and those aged 30–34
years (8.6%) (see Table 10).

6.2.11.1 Syphilis Prevalence Based on Age
FSWs older than 30 years were more likely to test positive for syphilis than those under the aged less
than 30 years (OR: 4.04, CI: 1.49–10.9). The syphilis prevalence among those older than 35 years was
determined to be different from those observed among FSWs aged between 24–35 years (OR: 1.4,
CI: 0.55–3.62). It is therefore possible that older FSWs who have engaged in commercial sex for
longer than the younger females may have a have higher probability of acquiring syphilis infections.
This explanation, however, assumes that a majority of FSWs start engaging in commercial sex at an
early age and that older FSWs have been in this business for a longer period of time.


                                                     31
6.2.11.2 Syphilis Prevalence Based on Literacy
Good literacy skills may allow a person to access important information on HIV and STI prevention
through better comprehension of verbal and written information. However, the literacy level was
not found as a significant influencing factor on the outcome of syphilis testing among FSWs (OR:
2.18, CI: 0.44–9.7), suggesting that all FSWs may be equally predisposed to these infections
regardless of their literacy level. This is not surprising considering the fact that the majority of FSWs
were not properly educated and that even those who had “higher” levels of literacy were not
schooled for more than 10 years.

6.2.11.3 Syphilis Prevalence Based on Marital Status
This survey showed that there was a relationship between marital status and HIV status among
FSWs. However, being divorced, separated, or widowed was not found as begin significantly
associated with the likelihood of FSWs testing positive for syphilis (OR: 1.4, CI: 0.22–1.56).

6.2.11.4 Syphilis Prevalence Based on Place of Operation for FSWs
Our analysis did not identify significant differences in syphilis prevalence among FSWs based on their
operation base (OR: 0. 44, CI: 0.17–1.15). These findings suggest that the risk of infection with
syphilis may be equally spread across all survey sites from which the FSWs were recruited.

6.2.11.5 Syphilis Prevalence Based on Age at Sex Debut and Exposure to Transactional Sex
Our analysis did not find a significant association between the age of sex debut of an FSW and the
outcome of her syphilis status (OR: 1.35, CI: 0.51–3.59). Similarly, the age at which a female started
engaging in commercial sex was not found to be related to her syphilis status (OR: 1.17, CI: 0.37–
3.69). The most logical explanation for these observations is that the risk of syphilis infection rises
due to a combination of factors and that the age of sex debut alone may not be the most significant
factor.

6.2.11.6 Syphilis Prevalence Based on Type and Number of Sex Partners
We failed to determine any association between the number of partners an FSW had and the
outcome of the syphilis test (OR: 0.92, CI: 0.05–16.71). The chances of testing positive for syphilis
were found to be similar between those FSWs engaging in sex with fewer than five clients per week
and those engaging with more than five clients (OR: 0.49, CI: 0.16–1.53). Those who had regular
clients were found to be just as likely to be syphilis positive as those who had occasional clients (OR:
0.96, CI: 0.47–1.95). These results do not necessarily indicate that the number of sex partners and
the volume of sex per week per FSW does not increase the chances of acquiring syphilis, but instead
may point to the fact that the manner in which transactional sex is conducted (especially if condoms
are not used) is more important in STI prevalence than how often the FSWs engage in sex.

6.2.11.7 Syphilis Prevalence Based on Length of Service
The length of service as a SW was found to be significantly associated with the outcome of syphilis
status (OR: 0.47, CI: 0.17–1.27). These results may be interpreted to mean that no matter how long
an FSW works, the likelihood of contracting syphilis remains the same.

6.2.11.8 Syphilis Prevalence Based on Use of Contraceptives
The chance of testing positive for syphilis among FSWs who were using contraceptives was not
determined to be significantly different from that of those not using them (OR: 1.909, CI: 0.58–6.79).


                                                   32
These results suggest that as long as condom use remains low among FSWs, uses of other
contraceptives that do not prevent the exchange of sexual fluids apparently have no significant
influence on the prevalence of syphilis.

6.2.11.9 Syphilis Based on Exposure to Anal Sex
Anal sex was identified as one of the most important risk factors for syphilis prevalence among FSWs
(OR: 10.105, CI: 3.64–28.04). These results suggest that anal sex is a risk factor for syphilis, just as it
is for HIV infection.

6.2.11.10 Syphilis Prevalence Based on Unprotected Sex and Condom Breaks
FSWs who reported condom breaks were found to be more likely to test positive for syphilis than
those who had unprotected sex (OR: 2.56, CI: 0.87–7.54). The most plausible explanation to these
seemingly perplexing observations is that due to the low usage of condoms among FSWs, a condom
break does not necessarily present a bigger risk for an infection than that presented by unprotected
sex, which is rampant in this population.

6.2.11.11 Syphilis Prevalence Based on Alcohol
FSWs who take alcohol on daily basis were found to be more likely to test positive for syphilis than
those who had never taken alcohol (OR: 5.01, CI: 1.72–14.58). The reasons for these differences
remain unclear and further studies should be conducted to investigate this phenomenon.

6.2.11.12 Syphilis Prevalence Based on Drugs and Sharing of Needles
One of the most unexpected results in this survey was that the use of drugs and even sharing of
needles were not determined to be significantly related to the outcome of a syphilis test (OR: 1.90,
CI: 0.59–7.79). While these results are baffling, it is important to realize that a very small proportion
of participants used drugs and only 6% of FSWs shared needles. Within this population, two were
HIV positive. It is therefore possible that a larger sample size than what we used in this survey could
reveal more conclusive data on the role of sharing needles in transmission of syphilis among FSWs.
There is also a possibility that drug use is under-reported in this country due to cultural and religious
reasons.

6.2.11.13 Syphilis Prevalence Based on GBV
Our survey found that women who reported cases of GBV were more likely to test positive for
syphilis than those who did not (OR: 0.219, CI: 0.03–1.68). The most likely explanation for these
results is that some forms of GBV may be of a sexual nature and probably unprotected. This could
significantly increase the exposure of the victims to infections, including syphilis.

6.2.11.14 Syphilis Prevalence Based on Knowledge of HIV/STIs and Self-Assessment of Possible Risk
to Infection
Our survey determined that FSWs who believed that they were at risk of HIV infection/STIs and
those who did not know if they were at risk had the same chances of testing positive for syphilis (OR:
0.46, CI: 0.14–1.5). This observation may be due to a combination of several factors, including low
literacy levels and poor knowledge of HIV and STI issues among the FSWs.

6.2.11.15 Self-Assessment of Risk to HIV and Knowledge of HIV/AIDS Support Programs among
FSWs
Knowledge of HIV status helps HIV-negative individuals make specific decisions to reduce risk and
practice safer sex. For those who have HIV, knowledge of their status allows them to take action to
protect their sexual partners, to access treatment and to plan for the future.

To assess the awareness and coverage of HIV testing services, respondents were asked whether they
had ever been tested for HIV. If they responded affirmatively, they were asked whether they had
received the results of their last test and when the testing occurred. Table 11 shows FSWs’
perception of self-risk of HIV infection, HIV testing status and knowledge of ART by socio-
demographic characteristics. At least 40% of FSWs were aware that there are drugs that can help
manage HIV/AIDS among infected people. At least 25% of FSWs had heard of ART and 15% knew of
someone who was taking ART drugs.

Self-assessment of possible modes of acquiring and transmitting HIV and STIs and knowledge of risk
factors play important roles in prevention of infection transmission. About 40% of the FSWs felt at
risk of HIV infection. More than half (54%) reported having been tested for HIV previously, and 96%
of those tested reported that the tests were voluntary and that they received their results upon
testing. Surprisingly, 56% of drug users and half (50%) of those who engaged in anal sex did not
know that they were exposed to HIV and STIs. Close to 60% of FSWs who had sex with more than
five clients per week, those who worked daily and those who had sex without a condom did not
necessarily consider themselves at risk of HIV infection. A similar proportion of FSWs who suffered
GBV did not consider themselves at risk. A worrying observation was that 26 of the 47 HIV sero-
positive cases (55%) and 5 of the 18 syphilis-positive cases (28%) reported in this survey were
detected among FSWs who did not know they were at risk.

6.2.12 HIV Prevalence among FSWs
Figure 1 shows HIV prevalence by socio-demographic characteristics. Overall, the HIV prevalence
among FSWs was estimated at 13%. The prevalence was lowest for those aged 18–24 years (5%). HIV
prevalence among those over the age of 40 was as high as 36%. We analyzed for HIV prevalence
based on selected characteristics as presented in the sections below.

Figure 1. HIV Prevalence among FSWs by Age




                                                34
6.2.12.1 HIV Prevalence Based on Age
This survey showed strong association between HIV prevalence among FSWs with increasing age.
Those aged 30 years and older were more likely to be HIV positive than those aged less 30 years (OR:
6.56, CI:3.2–13.5). These data suggest that the risk of acquiring HIV infection increases with
increasing age. These findings confirm those showing that FSWs older than 35 years were
significantly more likely to test positive for HIV.

6.2.12.2 HIV Prevalence Based on Literacy
Considering that literacy plays an important role in helping individuals gain meaningful knowledge,
access information that enables them to make informed decisions and use their knowledge to
discern health risks, it is possible that low literacy levels may compromise the chances of accessing
such information among the participants. We analyzed for HIV prevalence based on the level of
education and found that 34 of the 47 HIV-positive cases (72%) were among the illiterate group of
FSWs, but these proportions were not determined to be statistically different from those among the
“literate” groups (OR: 1.39, CI:0.64–2.98).

6.2.12.3 HIV Prevalence Based on Marital Status
It was observed that 26 of the 47 HIV-positive cases (55%) reported among FSWs were detected
among women who were divorced, separated or widowed. Further analysis revealed that
divorced/separate/widowed FSWs were more likely to test positive than those who were unmarried
(OR: 2.36, CI: 1.18–4.77), but not than those who were married (OR: 0.36, CI: 0.04–3.4). These
results are in agreement with others that show that HIV cases were relatively more common among
the same group of divorced/separated/widowed FSWs. As mentioned before, we speculate that
some of the widowed FSWs may have lost their partners to HIV, hence the higher prevalence of HIV
in this group. Future studies should ascertain whether these assumptions are true.

6.2.12.4 HIV Prevalence Based on Base of Operation for FSWs
Close to half of the 47 HIV-positive cases (23, 49%) among FSWs were from the group that operated
in public places, such as Chicha beits and bars. However, these proportions were not significantly
different from those recorded among FSWs operating in brothels and other types of
accommodations (OR: 0.61, CI: 0.33–1.13).

Although 38 (80%) of HIV-positive cases were recorded among FSWs operating in Arhiba and
Quartier 2, the proportions of HIV-positive individuals in these two locations were found to be
significantly different from those observed in other survey sites (OR: 3.03, CI: 0.73–6.09). These
observations suggest that the chances of acquiring HIV infections may be equally distributed across
all the sites.

6.2.12.5 HIV Prevalence Based on Age at Sex Debut and Age at Exposure to Transactional Sex
An early sex debut can be a risk factor for acquiring STIs. We sought to categorize HIV prevalence
based on the age at which participants had their first sexual encounters and the age at which they
started engaging in transactional sex. Of the 47 cases HIV, 25 (53%) were among FSWs who had a sex
debut under the age of 18, and the remaining 22 were among those who had a delayed debut.
However, HIV prevalence in these two groups were not statistically different (OR: 0.96, CI: 0.52–
1.78).



                                                  35
6.2.12.6 HIV Prevalence Based on Type and Number of Sex Partners
The number and type of sex partners can be a compounding factor in HIV acquisition and
transmission. This survey was not able to demonstrate a significant association between the number
of clients that FSWs engaged with and HIV test outcomes (OR: 0.65, CI: 0.31–1.4). This is probably
because more than 60% of FSWs had both occasional and regular clients and condom use was not
consistent. It is important to note that some FSWs revealed that they had maintained stable sexual
relationships with regular male clients for a period of up to 10 years. It was also noted that
unprotected sex with regular clients was common. Such sexual behavior is likely to increase the
possibility that, although the type of client an FSW has may not be related the outcome of her HIV
test ,engaging in unprotected sex is likely to be a more risky behavior in HIV infection than the type
and number of clients the FSW has.

6.2.12.7 HIV Prevalence Based on Length of Service
The current survey revealed that 25 (53%) of all HIV-positive cases were detected among FSWs who
had been in this profession for a period of 3 years or more. Statistical analysis revealed that FSWs in
this category were more likely to test positive for HIV than those who had worked for less than
3 years (OR: 2.25, CI: 1.15–4.42). It is therefore possible that working as an FSW for a long time
increases the probability of contracting HIV.

6.2.12.8 HIV Prevalence Based on Use of Contraceptives
This survey found that condoms were the most preferred form of contraceptive, but that their use
among FSWs was only at around 50%. A majority of women were found to use a combination of
methods to prevent pregnancy. A high percentage, 34 (72%) of the 47 HIV-positive FSW cases, was
detected among FSWs who were using contraceptives. The HIV prevalence was similar for those
using a contraceptive method and those not using (OR=1.15, CI:0.57-2.45). These results suggests
that, in the absence of high condom use among FSWs, the use of other contraceptives may not
influence the HIV test outcomes. There is therefore a need to sensitize this population on the need
to use condoms as safer contraceptives in every sexual encounter, because condoms provide dual
protection against infections and pregnancy.

6.2.12.9 HIV Prevalence Based on Exposure to Anal Sex
Unprotected anal sex is recognized as an important risk factor for HIV acquisition among males and
females. We investigated if there was a association between engaging in anal sex and acquisition of
HIV among FSWs and found that only 4 FSW ever had anal sex and were HIV negative. This is
surprising considering that condom use was significantly low. It is important to consider that this
survey also revealed that FSWs received more requests for anal sex but the majority did not consent
for the same. This calls for improved education strategies and campaigns to sensitize FSWs and their
clients on the need to use condoms in all sex encounters, especially anal sex, as HIV prevalence will
continue to rise and probably result in similar trends to those observed among homosexual males
who have been identified as particularly vulnerable to HIV.

6.2.12.10 HIV Prevalence Based on Unprotected Sex and Condom Breaks
This survey showed that there was a significant association between condom use and testing HIV
positive among the FSWs (OR: 3.07, CI: 1.31–7.17), and those reporting experience of condom
breaking were more likely to be HIV positive (OR: 1.59, CI: 0.66–3.77). We recommend that more



                                                  36
robust case-controls experiments should be designed in future to investigate this phenomenon
further. In addition, since unprotected sex is only about 50% among the FSWs, it is possible that the
effect of a condom break is masked by the risk associated with not using a condom at all.

6.2.12.11 HIV Prevalence Based on Use of Alcohol
Alcohol is reported to distort judgment, and an intoxicated person is more likely to engage in risky
behavior than the one who is sober. As mentioned in preceding sections, alcohol use was not found
to be a serious problem in both target groups (FSWs and LDTDs), possibly because a majority of
people in Djibouti are Muslim and alcohol use may not be popular in such settings. Indeed, statistical
analysis failed to draw any associations between consumption of alcohol and HIV status among
FSWs (OR: 0.31, CI: 0.16–0.94). These results were similar to those on syphilis that showed no
association between alcohol intake frequency and being syphilis positive (OR: 0.61, CI: 0.16–2.12).
The reasons for these differences remain unclear.)

6.2.12.12 HIV Prevalence Based on Drug Use and Sharing of Needles
Using drugs and sharing needles have been identified as important factors for HIV acquisition.
Sharing contaminated needles is one of the most risky behaviors associated with HIV acquisition,
partly because a high viral dose may directly reach the blood stream without being subjected to
screening by first lines of immunological defenses. This survey found that among the 120 FSWs who
used drugs, 29 (24%) used injectable drugs and shared needles. The use of drugs was not
significantly associated with the HIV prevalence among FSWs (OR: 4.88, CI: 0.25–94.84). Similarly,
this survey did not show statistical differences on HIV prevalence among drug users who shared
needles and those who did not (OR: 0.84, CI: 0.43–1.63). Considering that of the 29 FSWs who
shared needles, 2 tested positive for HIV, there is a chance that a robust sample size in a future
survey will link sharing needles and HIV infections in vulnerable populations in Djibouti. We also
suspect that the use of drugs, especially injecting drugs and sharing needles, may be under-reported
among the participants due to the possibility of stigma associated with use of drugs.

6.2.12.13 HIV Prevalence Based on GBV
GBV makes women venerable to HIV because they may be subjected to unprotected sex, which may
cause physical trauma to the genitals and predispose females to acquire an infection. It is expected
that in most cases FSWs may not be in a position to negotiate for safe sex, especially where GBV is
involved. Some cases of GBV may also involve sodomy, and unprotected anal sex is significantly
associated with HIV infections. This survey found that HIV prevalence among the 74 women
subjected to GBV was 10%, but those who reported being a victim of GBV were not necessarily
found to have a higher probability to test positive for HIV than those who did not (OR: 0.65, CI: 0.27–
1.52). These data did not demonstrate GBV alone as a risk factor in HIV acquisition, but a
combination of compounding factors, including whether or not the GBV involves unprotected sex, is
more important in HIV infections among FSWs in Djibouti.

6.2.12.14 HIV Prevalence Based on Knowledge of HIV and Self-Assessment of Risk to HIV Infection
This survey revealed that 31 of the 47 HIV-positive cases (66%) among FSWs were among people
who knew about HIV/AIDS. Statistical analysis revealed that FSWs who did not have sufficient
knowledge of HIV were more likely to test positive for HIV than those who were well versed with
critical issues (OR: 0.37, CI: 0.19–0.075). However, self-assessment of risk to HIV (participant



                                                  37
perceiving that she was at risk, was not at risk or not knowing whether she was at risk or not) those
who think they are at risk were more likely to be HIV positive than those not perceiving themselves
as at risk (OR: 2.22, CI: 0.99–5.05).

6.2.12.15 HIV Prevalence Based on Previous HIV Testing
This survey revealed that the chances of testing positive for HIV were similar between those who
had been tested in the last 12 months and those who had not tested.(OR: 0.83, CI: 0.07–15.15).

6.2.13 Gender-Based Violence
In recent years, there has been increasing concern about violence against women in general, and
about domestic violence in particular, in both developed and developing countries. Not only has
domestic violence against women been acknowledged as a violation of basic human rights, but also
an increasing amount of research highlights the health burdens, generational effects and
demographic consequences of such violence (United Nations General Assembly 1991; Heise et al.
1994; Heise et al. 1999; Jejeebhoy 1998). Women also bear the health and psychological burdens of
most GBV. Victims of domestic violence are abused inside what should be a secure environment—
their own homes.

The collected data revealed that 74 cases of GBV were recorded, but only 50% of these cases were
reported. Only one of these cases was reported to a nongovernmental organization (NGO), and only
19% and 18% of victims were willing to report such cases to the police or a friend, respectively (see
Table 11). Of these GBV cases, 28% were of a sexual nature. Although this survey did not establish
whether or not some of these cases involved sodomy, 75% of the FSWs who reported having had
forced sex also reported to have had anal sex. A majority of the perpetrators of these acts were
clients. Relatives were involved in 4% of these cases, while friends were reported to have committed
11% of these cases. As mentioned in the preceding sections, our analysis was unable to show any
association between GBV and HIV status (OR: 0.65, CI: 0.27–1.52), but those subjected to GBV were
apparently more likely to test positive for syphilis (OR: 0.219, CI: 0.028–1.68). These data suggest
that, although both of these infections are sexually transmitted, their transmission dynamics may be
different.

6.2.14 Mapping of FSWs Hotspots in Relation to Facilities and Resources in the Survey Area
Geographic information system (GIS) mapping of FSW hotspots and other facilities, including heath
care centers, administrative facilities, NGOs and other resource centers, revealed that the mapped
points were located in areas with good road networks and access to these facilities should be easy.
These maps are available and can be provided on request, but we did not include them in this report
based on ethical considerations and the safety of the SWs.

In general, the distribution of resource centers in Arhiba was poor, with centers mapped in the
region located quite a distance from each other. Similarly, although a majority of SWs were mapped
around the quartiers, the distribution of administrative support, NGOs and health care facilities was
poor in these locations. The resource centers at PK12 were also located far outside the range zone of
concentration of FSW hotspots. Only one major health care facility was mapped around PK12, and
none of these facilities were present at the PK12 satellite site (truck bay).

6.3.1    Socio-Demographic Characteristics of LDTDs
Table 12 shows the distribution of socio-demographic characteristics of LDTDs. More than half of the
truckers were younger than 30 years, with a mean age of 31 years, and only 16% were aged 40 years
or over.

6.3.1.1 Habitation of LDTDs
A majority of truckers, 493 (93%), slept in their trucks during the road trips, while only 28 (5%) and 8
(2%) slept either in a home or in a hotel, respectively during their field trip. It was however not
established if those who slept in homes during the field trips lived with their wives, relatives or sex
partners.

6.3.1.2 Literacy among LDTDs
Literacy levels were higher among the truckers than among the FSWs, with 64% of the LDTDs being
able to read and write This suggests that the LDTDs are likely to be more advantaged as far as
accessing and understanding written information on critical issues on HIV and STIs. However, it is
important to note that, although the LDTD population was significantly more literate than was the
FSW population, less than 20% of the truckers had an education of more than 10 years of schooling.
This observation further suggests that even though the LDTDs are more literate than the FSWs, they
are equally likely to experience serious limitations in understanding complex issues regarding sexual
health, prevention of HIV and STIs and linking various behavioral components to infections and
transmission of sexually acquired infections.

6.3.1.3 Marital Status among LDTDs
Almost 45% of all LDTDs were married at the time of recruitment; 51% had never been married and
3% compared to 29% among FSWs were either divorced/separated/widowed. . At least 94% of all
the married truckers lived in a trucks during the road trips, and among unmarried truckers, 95% of




                                                    40
whom lived/slept in their trucks during road trips. However, considering that a majority of these
married truckers are Ethiopians,

6.3.2   Period of Work as an LDTD
At least 331 (63%) of all truckers had worked for less than 3 years, indicating that most LDTDs were
still new in their jobs. Our analysis did not find a significant association between the length of time a
trucker had worked and his ability to seek other types of accommodation, rather than sleep in his
truck (OR: 0.23, CI: 0.028–1.88). It is therefore possible that factors other than familiarity with the
truck stop and the period during which the trucker had worked made a majority of truckers prefer to
sleep in their trucks.

6.3.3   Mobility among LDTDs
At least 27% of the LDTDs indicated that they did not visit their home or native districts or families.
These data further suggest that a majority of truckers live a life of physical alienation from their
families and maybe friends, who could provide support. In contrast to the FSWs (a majority of whom
prefer to operate in their native homes), a majority (more than 60%) of LDTDs were from Ethiopia,
indicating that the truckers’ population was largely made up of foreigners. A large majority (93%) of
these truckers were travelling to Addis Ababa and other towns in Ethiopia, while the rest were
destined to the port of Djibouti. The LDTD group was identified as highly mobile, with 443 (84%)
making a round trip to their destinations in 3 days. At least 15% of the truckers made between 26
and 30 round trips per month. These data suggest that a majority of the truckers are away from their
homes for long periods of time, during which they live in sub-optimum conditions (their trucks). In
addition, the numerous trips they make suggest that they are likely to be overworked. A
combination of such factors is likely to force truckers to engage in risky behavior that may include
unprotected sex. It is important to remember that a majority of these foreign truckers have a
relatively low level of education and may also suffer from culture and language barriers. An
interaction of such socio-cultural and economic challenges and low literacy levels may make LDTDs
significantly vulnerable to HIV and STIs. This vulnerability is multiplied by the fact that the truckers
solicit sex from FSWs who have even lower literacy levels.

6.3.4   Sex History among LDTDs
Among the LDTDs recruited in this survey, 77% had their first sexual encounter when they were
between the age of 16 and 20 years. Seven of the participants had not had any sexual encounter in
their life. This survey revealed that those who had a sex debut at an age under 15 years were more
likely to seek a paid sexual encounter than those who had a delayed debut (OR: 2.3, CI: 1.4–10). This
survey also revealed that 77% first sexual encounters among the LDTDs involved non-paid females. A
majority of truckers reported having had their sex debut with a friend (67%); others reported their
sex debut with a co-worker (40%) or a stranger (33%). This survey also established that cases of
incestuous first sexual relationships occur in about 15% among LDTDs.

6.3.5   Where Do LDTDs Pick Sex Partners?
At least 10% of LDTDs indicated that they had paid for sex in the last 1 month. Brothels were the
preferred sources of sex partners among the LDTDs. Of the LDTDs interviewed, 5% picked their
partners during loading and reloading of their trucks, and a similar proportion picked FSWs when
staying at home during the loading/reloading. Statistical analysis revealed that the chances of



                                                   41
picking a SW was equal between LDTDs living/sleeping in their trucks and those seeking
accommodation in a hotel or a home (OR: 1.46, CI: 0.5–4.2). Considering that most truckers live in
their trucks and most of them reported to have picked an FSW in the course of their work, this
survey indirectly suggests that some truckers may take their partners to the trucks to perform sex
acts, but this remains to be verified. Should this be the case, it is important for future studies to
investigate if sex acts in a truck are performed in privacy and if there are cases of group sex or
shared sex partners. It is also important to investigate whether the truckers, especially those who
live in homes, perform sex acts in brothels and lodges or take their sex partners home or use the
trucks for sex.

6.3.6   Condom Use among LDTDs
This survey found that up to 10% of LDTDs did not use condoms with their sex partners. Although
this proportion of LDTDs might appear low, not using condoms with FSWs is particularly risky
because FSW population has been identified as an important seed population that fuels the
emergence of new HIV infections in most countries. The 10% of LDTDs who did not use a condom
could in turn infect other partners, including their spouses

Table 13 shows condom use during sexual intercourse with paid and non-paid female partners by
truckers. About one-fifth of the truckers reported having paid for sex, and 90% of these had used a
condom in their last sexual activity prior to recruitment. Among those who used a condom, 87%
indicated that they consistently used condoms with a paid sex partner. Another 25% of truckers
indicated having had sex with a non-paid partner, and 76% of these had used a condom with their
non-paid partners. Among those who used condoms with occasional partners, 74% consistently used
condoms. These data show that, depending on the category of the sex partner, at least 13% to 26%
of sexual encounters by LDTDs are not protected. Those not using condoms are likely to be
particularly vulnerable to infections and may act as a seed population to other people, including
their spouses and other sex partners.

6.3.6.1 Condom Breaks among LDTDs
In general, condom breakage during sex was reported at lower frequencies among the LDTDs than
among the FSWs. Overall, only 3.3% of the 526 LDTDs reported experiencing a condom break. The
percentage of those reporting condom breakage was below 10% in all categories except among the
divorced/separated/widowed, which was 14%.

6.3.7      Knowledge of STI Symptoms and Infections among LDTDs
Table 14 shows the knowledge of STIs and STI symptoms by socio-demographic characteristics of
LDTDs. Knowledge of these symptoms was relatively low, with only 6.5% reporting to have heard of
STIs. FSWs were more likely to identify at least one STI symptom unassisted compared to LDTDs .

At least 90% of the 30 LDTDs who knew about STIs could identify “a burning sensation during
urination” as an STI symptom. Other symptoms correctly identified by these 30 LDTDs included
urethral discharge (40%), swelling of groin (40%), inability to retract foreskin (30%) and genital ulcers
(16.7%). No LDTD reported having had symptoms of STIs and therefore none were interviewed on
STI-related health-seeking behavior

6.3.8      Prevalence of Syphilis among LDTDs
The syphilis prevalence rate among the 526 truckers who submitted blood samples was estimated at
1.6%. High values were recorded among those who were aged over the age of 45 years (5.6%), those
between the ages of 30 and 34 (2.3%) and those between the ages of 35 and 40 years (1.4%). A high
value was also observed among those who were married, namely, 2.6%.

6.3.8.1 Syphilis Prevalence Based on Age
Of the eight syphilis cases detected among LDTDs, four (50%) were among those over the age of 35
years, and those age 35 year and higher were more likely to be syphilis positive than those below
35years but not statistically significant difference (OR: 2.32, CI: 0.48–11.2). These data suggest that
age could be an important factor in the prevalence patterns of syphilis among the FSWs, but not
among LDTDs.

6.3.8.2 Syphilis Prevalence Based on Literacy
Similar to FSWs, the literacy level was not associated with the outcome of syphilis testing among
LDTDs (OR: 0.92, CI: 0.22–3.87). This was similar to the no association between syphilis and literacy
level among FSWs (OR: 0.40, CI: 0.06–1.09). It is important to consider that a majority of truckers
were Ethiopians and there is a possibility that language and cultural barriers hinder their access to
information.

6.3.8.3 Syphilis Prevalence Based on Marital Status
Although being divorced was identified as a risk factor among FSWs, marital status was not found to
be significantly associated with the outcome of the syphilis test among LDTDs (OR: 0.27, CI: 061–
5.9).

6.3.8.4 Syphilis Prevalence Based on Where LDTDs Sleep/Live during Road Trips
Similar to the findings that the operation base of FSWs did not influence the chances of testing
positive for syphilis, the residence of the truck drivers was not found to be significantly associated
with testing positive for syphilis among This is expected, because 93% of all truckers lived/slept in
their trucks.




                                                      45
6.3.8.5 Syphilis Prevalence Based on Age at Sex Debut and Exposure to Transactional Sex
Similar to the findings on FSWs, the age at sex debut of an LDTD was not significantly associated with
the outcome of syphilis test (OR: 0.28), CI: 0.034–2.23, Furthermore, the age at which an LDTD
solicited for paid sex was also not related to the outcome of the syphilis test.

6.3.8.6 Syphilis Prevalence Based on Length of Service
Similar to the findings on FSWs, length of service as an LDTD was also not associated with syphilis
status in men (OR: 1.34, CI: 0.12–15.05). This suggests that new truckers are as equally exposed to
syphilis as their older counterparts.

6.3.8.7 Syphilis Based on Exposure to Anal Sex
Anal sex was not found to be a risk factors for syphilis acquisition among FSWs, LDTDs who had anal
sex had apparently almost equal chances of acquiring syphilis infections as those who did not). It is
therefore possible that FSWs, who are likely to play the receptive role in anal sex, are significantly
more at risk that their male partners.

6.3.8.8 Syphilis Prevalence Based on Unprotected Sex and Condom Breaks
An interesting observation was that FSWs who reported condom breaks were not found to be
significantly more likely to test positive for syphilis than those who did not (OR: 2.56, CI: 0.87–7.54).
Similar findings were made on LDTDs: Those who reported a condom break apparently had equal
chances of testing positive for syphilis as those who did not (OR: 5.22, CI: 0.59–4.49). This is probably
because condom use was relatively low among LDTDs. This presents a bigger risk that could mask
the risk associated condom breakage.

6.3.8.9 Syphilis Prevalence Based on Alcohol
The survey found that FSWs who take alcohol daily were not more likely to test positive for syphilis
than those who had never taken alcohol (OR: 0.48, CI: 0.02–3.91). This is different from findings of
alcohol use as a risk factor for syphilis acquisition among LDTDs. The reasons for these differences
remain unclear, and further studies should be conducted to investigate this phenomenon.

6.3.8.10 Syphilis Prevalence Based on Knowledge of HIV/STIs and Self-Assessment of Possible Risk
to Infection
LDTDs who had previously been tested for HIV were equally likely to test positive as those who had
not been tested before (OR: 1.26, CI: 0.14). These results are somehow expected considering that
HIV testing was not voluntary among LDTDs and a majority of those tested before did it as a job
requirement and did not collect their results. It is important therefore to formulate other related
studies that can make voluntary HIV testing more acceptable among SWs and LDTDs. The chances of
testing HIV positive were equal among LDTDs who believed that they were at risk of contracting
HIV/syphilis and those who did not think so (OR: 0.51, CI: 0.05–5.02). Similar findings were made on
FSWs and, therefore, self-assessment of risk is not an important factor that influences syphilis/HIV
status.

6.3.9   Knowledge of HIV/AIDS and Its Prevention Strategies
Respondents interviewed in this survey were asked whether they had heard of an illness called AIDS.
Those who reported having heard of AIDS were asked a number of questions about whether and
how AIDS could be prevented and how it is transmitted. Table 16 shows that awareness of HIV/AIDS


                                                   46
is high, with more than 93% of LDTDs having heard of AIDS. However, only 43% of the truckers were
aware of the correct methods of preventing HIV infections. The prevention methods that were
correctly identified by most LDTDs unassisted included safe blood transfusion (92%), having sex with
only one uninfected female partner (88%), always using a condom while engaging in sexual
intercourse (89%), avoiding sharing of injection equipment (86%) and abstaining from sexual
intercourse (85%).

However, various reported misconception of HIV prevention and transmission were reported among
the truckers. About 31% of truckers who were aware of HIV/AIDS felt that one can prevent HIV
infection by cleaning genitals after sex, by avoiding bites by mosquitoes or other insects (38%) and
avoiding sharing of clothes or utensils (17%). Close to 72% of LDTDs believed that it is possible to
guess if someone is HIV positive by physical assessment of by visual assessment

6.3.9.1 Self-Assessment of Risk to HIV and Knowledge of HIV/AIDS Support Programs among
LDTDs
A high percentage (75%) reported having been tested for HIV previously. A majority (93%) of those
tested indicated that the last test was voluntary, and 75% were counseled on HIV/AIDS and
prevention methods (see Table 17). Slightly more than 30% of LDTDs were aware of drugs that can
be used for the management of HIV/AIDS, and 16% had specific knowledge of ART. Half of those
under the age of 20 were aware of ART. Knowledge of ART among other age groups was between
21% and 37%. More than 50% of the truckers knew of someone with AIDS or someone who had died

from AIDS. A small percentage (8%) indicated that they could tell if someone was HIV positive based
by visual examination.

More than 18% of LDTDs felt that they were at risk of contracting HIV, but 57% of all LDTDs did not
consider themselves to be at risk. The rest did not know whether they were at risk or not. A small
percentage (less than 10%) considered themselves at risk by engaging in anal sex, having more than
five sex partners and having had a condom break during sex.

6.3.10.1 HIV Prevalence Based on Age
The HIV prevalence was highest for truckers aged 45 years and over and lowest for those aged
between 30 and 34 and those aged between 40 and 44 years. Further analysis revealed that LDTDs
over the age of 35 were more likely to test positive than those under the age of 35 years (OR: 3.48,
CI: 0.47–30.0). The most probable explanation for this is that the LDTDs over the age of 35 are more
likely to have engaged in risky behavior for longer than the younger truckers, but this explanation
assumes that frequency and access to sex increases with age, which may not be the case for all
LDTDs. Future studies should therefore address this observation.

6.3.10.2 HIV Prevalence Based on Literacy
As mentioned before, the literacy levels among SWs and LDTDs were very low, and although a high
proportion of LDTDs could read and write compared to that of the FSWs, a majority of truckers did
not have more than 10 years of schooling. Interestingly, four (80%) of the five HIV-positive cases
reported among LDTDs were found among those not able to read and write. Statistical tests did not,
however, find any absolute relationship between literacy and HIV status among LDTDs (OR: 0.45, CI:
0.02–4.3). This is probably because, although the truckers may be better educated than their FSWs
counterparts, they may not access critical information regarding HIV prevention because the
majority are foreigners who are likely to encounter cultural and local language barriers.

6.3.10.3 HIV Prevalence Based on Marital Status
We found a statistical differences between HIV prevalence among those never married and the
divorced LDTDs (OR: 11.6, CI: 0.01–185) but no difference between those married and those
unmarried (OR: 1.15, CI: 0.11–11.3). These data differ from the findings on FSWs, where marital
status was a risk factor for infections.

6.3.10.4 HIV Prevalence Based on Accommodation of LDTDs
All the HIV-positive cases among LDTDs were recorded among truckers who lived/slept in their
trucks, but sleeping in trucks was not necessarily found to influence the HIV test of the entire
population of truckers.

6.3.10.5 HIV Prevalence Based on Age at Sex Debut and Age at Exposure to Transactional Sex
HIV prevalence among LDTDs who had a sex debut at the age of under 18 was not statistically
different from that observed among those with a delayed debut (OR: 1.35, CI: 0.22–8.17). We also
did not find any significant associations between the first ages a trucker sought transactional sex and
HIV prevalence (OR: 0.96, CI: 0.17–1.17). Taken together, these results suggest that other factors
could play a more critical role in HIV transmission and acquisition among the target groups than age
at sex debut and age at first transactional sex.

6.3.10.6 HIV Prevalence Based on Type and Number of Sex Partners
None of the HIV-positive cases were found among LDTDs with a defined number of partners and all
positive cases were recorded among men who did not reveal how many partners they had. Similarly,
all HIV-positive cases were found in LDTDs who did not reveal where they picked their sex partners.
Because it was difficult to categorize such participants, it was not possible to run any statistical tests
to analyze any associations between number of partners and HIV status

6.3.10.7 HIV Prevalence Based on Length of Service
We were unable to show any relationships between the length of service of a trucker and the
outcome of his HIV test. It is therefore possible that the risk of infections is not related to the length
of time a trucker has worked.

6.3.10.8 HIV Prevalence Based on Exposure to Anal Sex
Similar to previous findings that there was a correlation between anal sex and acquisition of HIV
among FSWs (OR: 4.5, CI: 2.3–8.7), the LDTDs who reported to have engaged in anal sex were also
found to be more likely to test positive for HIV than those who did not (OR: 9.2, CI: 1.49–57.03).
These results further confirm that unprotected anal sex is a risk factor for HIV acquisition for LDTDs.

6.3.10.9 HIV Prevalence Based on Unprotected Sex and Condom Breaks
The chances of testing positive for HIV were similar between LDTDs who reported to have used
condoms and those who reported not using condoms in the last sexual engagement before
recruitment to the survey. Similarly, no statistical differences were found between those who
reported condom breaks and those who did not. The most probable explanation for these results is
that the majority of LDTDs did not use condoms consistently and only about half of all truckers used
condoms and, therefore, those who reported having used condoms in the last sexual encounter may
have had unprotected sex in other sex acts.

6.3.10.10 HIV Prevalence Based on Use of Alcohol
Statistical analysis failed to draw any significant associations between consumption of alcohol and
HIV status among the LDTDs (OR: 0.24, CI: 0.014–3.909). These results show that alcohol use was not
a significant risk for HIV acquisition in this population.

6.3.10.11 HIV Prevalence Based on Knowledge of HIV and Self-Assessment of Risk to HIV Infection
All five HIV-positive cases were recorded among LDTDs who knew about the disease. However,
statistical analysis revealed that HIV sero-positive status was not necessarily related to knowledge of
HIV among LDTDs). As was the case among FSWs, self-assessment of risk to HIV was not found to be
associated with the outcome of HIV test among the LDTDs (OR: 1.13, CI: 0.116–11.0).

7       DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
This survey was designed to provide baseline data on behavioral risk factors for HIV and STIs. The
survey also provides estimates on the prevalence of HIV and syphilis among FSWs and among LDTDs
in Djibouti Ville. Past studies have found these two groups as vulnerable populations (Lacerda et al.
1997). Studies conducted in other countries show that transport corridors play an important role in
shaping disease epidemics, including HIV and STIs such as syphilis (Gomez et al. 2013). Related
studies also show that SWs (male and females) must be included in HIV/STI prevention programs
because these populations are not only vulnerable, but can act as an important source of new
infections and probably even new HIV strains (due to the associated sexual activities with multiple
partners) (Stringer et al. 2006).

The survey was formulated to fill existing knowledge gaps on HIV prevalence among FSWs and LDTDs
operating in Djibouti Ville. It provides baseline data on potential risk factors for HIV and STI
infections in the survey areas in Djibouti Ville. While the data provided in this report may not be
sufficient to make general conclusions of HIV/STI status in Djibouti as a country, the survey provides
important clues on the prevalence and pattern of spread of these infections in two important
vulnerable groups. The survey provides basic statistical analysis of the results obtained. However,
considering the small sample sizes of participants from some survey sites (e.g. PK12), and the small
proportions of participants that tested positive for HIV and/or syphilis, the statistical findings of this
survey should be interpreted with caution in order to avoid bias. Based on these considerations, we
were cautious not to subject the data to multivariate analysis and only provided simple statistical
analysis based on comparing selected dichotomous variables. We however anticipate that future
studies, especially case-control studies, will provide robust data that that qualify for rigorous
statistical analyses that will in turn provide a clear picture on interactions of multiple variables
related to HIV/STIs epidemiology.

Our survey estimates the prevalence of HIV among the FSWs was 13% and 1% among the LDTDs. The
prevalence of syphilis was estimated at 5% among FSWs and at 1.6% among the LDTDs. These results
show that HIV prevalence among FSWs in Djibouti is at least six times higher than the national
average, while that observed among LDTDs was lower than reported nationally.

The prevalence values of HIV and syphilis among LDTDs were relatively lower compared to those
reported in related studies. These findings are interesting because LDTDs have traditionally been
labeled as a “core transmitter group.” A survey carried out along the Kenya-Uganda transport
corridor revealed an HIV prevalence of up to 35% among LDTDs compared to the control group
(Mbugua et al. 1995). It is therefore clear that the prevalence recorded among the LDTDs in our
current survey is relatively low.

There is a likelihood that the prevalence of HIV and syphilis in our survey population differs from
those reported in other studies due to differences in confounding factors and difference in
composition of the target groups. It is also important to note that this was a cross-sectional survey
and we cannot rule out that follow-up studies may provide data that significantly differs from that
presented in this report. These assumptions are based on observations that the volume and



                                                   52
composition of LDTDs and FSWs may vary seasonally due to changes in economy, weather, and
other factors. It is also important to note that majority of LDTDs who participated in this survey
were from Ethiopia. The data presented here therefore underlines the need for cross-border
measures to reduce HIV prevalence among highly mobile vulnerable groups.

The most important factors identified as possible risk factors for infection with HIV and/or syphilis
among the FSWs and LDTDs can be summarized as follows: being over the age of 35; engaging in
(unprotected) sex; being divorced, separated or widowed; and daily consumption of alcohol among
FSWs (although not among LDTDs) and longer experience in commercial sex work. Previous studies
have shown a correlation between HIV sero-positivity and older age, longer duration working as a
driver, fewer visits per month to spouses and contacts with commercial SWs per month (Richard et
al. 2007). However, most of these variables were not identified as risk factors in the current survey.
Other studies showing a correlation between truckers’ age/length of service have been published in
South Africa (Ramjee et al. 2002) and Kenya (Mbugua et al. 1995). Taken together, our results
suggest that risk factors for HIV and syphilis acquisition among LDTDs in Djibouti are likely to be
different from those encountered in other countries, but the reasons behind these differences
remain to be investigated.

The survey found that most FSWs operating from brothels were more likely to have worked as SWs
for more than 10 years than those operating in bars and streets. Based on these data, it is possible to
assume that working from a fixed facility (such as a brothel) offers a SW a more stable client base
and personal security, thereby allowing these women to work for longer periods of time. On the
other hand, it is possible that FSWs operating in “stable” environments are more likely to establish
regular customers with whom they may develop mutual trust that eventually leads to unprotected
sex that may in turn raise the chances of infections.

This survey also revealed that literacy is low among FSWs and LDTDs. There is a possibility that
illiteracy contributes to poor knowledge as far as protecting oneself from HIV and STIs is concerned.
It is also possible that some LDTDs are likely to experience difficulties in communication because the
majority are foreigners from Ethiopia. A combination of illiteracy, language and other cultural
barriers could partially explain why most participants were not conversant with programs meant to
benefit vulnerable groups, such as those offered by ROADS and other NGOs operating in the survey
area. Low literacy levels and few years in formal education could also be related to the early sex
debut, as two-thirds of the SWs had a sex debut under the age of 18. There is therefore need to
improve literacy levels in these vulnerable groups. In addition, visual campaigns using billboards, TV
and audio commercials in languages and contexts that these groups can understand would be
important.

This survey further suggests that, depending on the category of the participants, between 15% and
40% of sex encounters are without protection. Studies conducted elsewhere show that the risk for
HIV infection is lower among SWs who use condoms consistently (Ye et al. 2014). This survey also
reveals that consistent use of condoms is low (at only about 50%) among the FSWs and the LDTDs.
This likely explains the reason that “not using condoms” was identified as an important risk factor
among FSWs and LDTDs. Similar to studies conducted elsewhere; availability of condoms and cost of
condoms was not identified as important reasons for not using them (Bayer et al. 2013). Similarly,
refusal by clients was the most commonly cited reason for non-use of condoms among the FSWs. In



                                                  53
related studies in Ghana, women cited client refusal (73%), receiving a higher payment (33%) and
client brutality (43%) as reasons for not using condoms (Asamoah-Adu 2001). It has also been shown
that male attitudes and behaviors, as well as discrimination against women, are critical factors that
contribute to men’s demand for unprotected paid sex, while brothel owners may ask the SWs not to
use condoms (Atteraya 2014).

There are also occasional reports by SWs of the sub-standard quality of condoms (Silver et al. 1998).
A small fraction of FSWs and LDTDs in this survey reported having experienced condom breaks
during sex. Future studies should therefore investigate the quality of the condoms in circulation in
Djibouti and other reasons behind reported condom breaks. Health caregivers and lobby groups
should also teach the target groups about the proper use of condoms.

Our survey revealed that a majority of FSWs engaged with both regular and occasional clients. Taken
together, the data from this survey suggest that the nature of sexual relationships and the frequency
of interaction are similar regardless of the category and operation base of the FSWs. It is important
to note that 18 (38%) of the 47 HIV sero-positive FSW participants had regular sex partners. The
importance of these results is even more significant based on the observation that 48 FSWs that had
regular clients indicated that they did not use condoms regularly. It is also important to note that a
number of clients revealed that they had maintained stable sexual relationships with their regular
clients over a period of 10 years. Such stable relationships are likely to raise the chances of
contracting and transmitting HIV and other STIs due to possible complacency that may develop
between the FSWs and their clients over a period of time.

Our survey reveals that a significant proportion of FSWs have regular clients with whom they have
maintained a sexual relationship for more than 10 years. On the other hand, the LDTDs have
multiple sex partners, while others were married. Such relations are likely to expose partner to
infections. A similar study in Benin found that HIV prevalence was twice as high among boyfriends of
SWs, suggesting that stable, long-term sexual relationships with FSWs are important risk factors to
HIV/syphilis infections (Rwenge 2013).

The findings of this survey of sexual liaisons between FSWs and regular and occasional clients was
similar to those reported in related studies. A survey conducted in Gambia showed that condom use
was not related to SW characteristics per se, but rather to client characteristics and setting
(Peitzmeier et al. 2014). Other studies have also found condom use varies by type of sexual partner,
and those with regular clients or partners are less likely to use condoms (Swe et al. 2013). It is also
important to note that self-reported use of condoms tends to have bias and there is a possibility that
condom use is actually lower than what is reported in this survey. To avoid such bias, we propose
that future studies should use biological test methods to ascertain the use of condoms. One such
method is based on detection of prostate-specific antigen on vaginal swabs. The presence of
prostate-specific antigen indicates that recent unprotected sex took place. Such strategies have been
used in Madagascar and Kenya (Mose et al. 2013).

Our survey found that literacy levels among FSWs and LDTDs were very low. This could be related to
low condom use in these two groups. This is because related studies have found that, although the
setting of sex work appears to be a critical determinant of condom use, other characteristics, such as
the education level of SWs and clients, are also important predictors of condom use. Our findings



                                                  54
point to the need for concerted efforts to update FSWs’ and LDTDs’ knowledge on correct and
consistent use of condoms.

This survey also investigated GBV. Sexual clients, especially regular clients, were identified as the
majority of perpetrators of such acts. Unlike in related studies, police or security agents were not
identified as major perpetrators of these crimes. Out of the 74 GBV cases, about 50% (37) were
reported to the police of whom 28 were of a sexual nature. It is also important to address the issues
of GBV among FSWs, and an even greater emphasis should be put into building and sharpening
negotiation skills of FSWs for safer sex using condoms. Other studies show that the most successful
strategy to increase safe and consistent condom use involves use of peer or other health educators
to reach out to target groups, providing condoms and promoting and increasing HIV/STI testing and
treatment (Schneider et al. 2014).

This survey reveals that clients requested anal sex from the FSWs but anal sex was found be low in
among the survey participants (4 reported cases). These findings are similar to those reported in a
study in South Africa that showed that although requests for anal sex was as high as 50%, only 2% of
FSWs met these requests (Ramjee et al. 2002). Our survey also revealed no significant association
between anal sex and acquisition of HIV and or syphilis. These findings are inconsistent with other
studies that have found that SWs who had anal sex were 3.5 times more likely to acquire HIV. Some
studies conducted in South Africa have indicated that substituting oral sex and non-penetrative
sexual practices for sexual acts that have a higher HIV risk, such as anal and vaginal sex, is a potential
strategy for reducing the risk to SWs (Richter et al. 2013). However, promoting safer sex is likely to
produce more meaningful results than campaigning for alterative non-protected oral or non-
penetrative sex.

The survey shows that a majority of the truckers are from Ethiopia and a majority of them sleep in
their trucks during the road trips. About a fifth of these truckers engage in sexual activities with
multiple partners whom they pick along the way or from brothels. Of importance to note is that
some of the truckers, including those that are married, engage in unprotected sex with multiple
SWs.

A majority of the LDTDs indicated that they have ever solicited for paid sex in the course of their
work. Related studies show that LDTDs are economically better off than other clients of FSW and are
thus able to solicit for sex, including unprotected sex from women along the transport corridor
(Rakwar et al. 1999). Another survey found that at the South Africa-Zimbabwe border, the favorite
clients for commercial SWs are LDTDs who pay in foreign currency. These clients are preferred
because they often pay more than the usual fee per encounter (Ramjee et al. 2002). Other studies
show that LDTDs and FSWs may use middlemen to solicit for safer clients. Using middlemen also
ensures that the clients can honor their pledge to pay for sex (Gysels et al. 2001). Although this
survey did not investigate such practices, future studies should establish the role of purchasing
power and the role played by middlemen in soliciting “safe” partners, because such practices could
reduce the chances of using condoms among LDTDs and among FSWs.

It is important to note that knowledge of STI symptoms was low among FSWs and even lower among
LDTDs. It is therefore possible that STIs were under-reported in this survey and especially among
LDTDs. Health-seeking behavior for suspected HIV infections is low among both categories of
participants. In most categories, less than 30% had good knowledge on HIV and STIs. Most STIs are


                                                   55
not reported and most respondents reported not seeking professional medical assistance. This
survey showed that a majority of LDTDs and SWs are not conversant with NGOs and civil-based
organizations involved in sexual health and related campaigns in this area. This is not unexpected
considering the limited services in the survey areas. ROADS is currently the only one operating in
Djibouti Ville, with activities just starting in the other quartiers apart from PK12. Such facilities and
programs, including those provided by ROADS, have the potential to educate and provide support
for recognizing and treating HIV and other STIs. The government of Djibouti remains the major
provider of support care and management of HIV/STI issues. There is clearly a need for more
partners to support the government and devise innovative methods and strategies for providing care
and support

Mapping is necessary to allow health care planners and outreach programs to identify areas and
regions where more or less resources should be allocated. The city planners and lobby groups can
also use maps for devising strategies for providing security for the vulnerable groups. For the first
time, this survey provides GIS maps for the survey areas indicating the SWs’ hotspots, locations of
health care, resource centers, schools and other support facilities. Our GIS data indicate that most
facilities, though limited in number, are situated in areas where they can be easily accessed. The
maps reveal that most facilities and especially the health care clinics are not equitably distributed
and that some areas, such as PK12, have very few of these facilities to match the volume of SWs and
LDTDs who interact there. Our data compares well with that published by Morris and Ferguson
(2005) that found that facilities that may support HIV and syphilis programs are few and poorly
distributed across 47 hotspots along the Kenya-Uganda highway.

It is our hope the government of Djibouti and its partners use these maps to identify hotspots and to
more effectively allocate resources, such as condoms, ART programs and prevention outreach in the
survey area. Since condom use is still low among SWs particularly, the government and NGOs can
use these maps to develop strategies for condom distribution.

It is important that caution is taken publishing such maps to protect the SWs from possible
harassment. Our maps are available on request by researchers and planners.

8       RECOMMENDATIONS
    1. This survey provides baseline data that have not been available on various issues related to
       HIV and syphilis infections and prevalence in Djibouti. The report provides critical data that
       can be used for formulation of other related studies in future. There is a need for further
       research on areas and sub-populations not covered by this survey. A follow-on survey to
       evaluate interventions that will take between 2 and 5 years to implement will be designed
       based on findings of this survey. Qualitative research will provide an in-depth understanding
       of emerging issues

    2. Prevention is the mainstay of the HIV response, and SWs constitute a key population for HIV
       and STI prevention programs. In addition, access to HIV treatment and care for those with
       HIV is important, as this can potentially reduce the onward transmission of HIV. Services
       must be seen in the context of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)
       three pillars of an effective, evidence-informed response to HIV and sex work:
            a. Pillar 1: Ensuring universal access to comprehensive HIV prevention, treatment, care
               and support.
            b. Pillar 2: Building supportive environments strengthening partnerships and
               expanding choices.
            c. Pillar 3: Reducing vulnerability and addressing structural issues.

    3. Condoms are the single most effective available technology for reducing sexual transmission
       of HIV. Therefore, an increase in correct, consistent condom use should be promoted as the
       main strategy for reducing unprotected sex. These should conform to quality standards and
       be made available free or at low cost to SWs and their clients.

    4. Each partner has a role to play in maximizing successful negotiation of condom use,
       including enforcing their use. Comprehensive human rights-based condom programming
       and promotion among SWs and clients, as well as owners of sex work establishments and
       other intermediaries, should be a priority

    5. Contacts between health workers and SWs or clients should be used to promote and provide
       condoms. Building the condom negotiation skills of SWs is also a central component of
       consistent condom use promotion and should include empowering SWs to initiate discussion
       of condom use with clients.

    6. LDTDs have traditionally been considered a special vulnerable group and a transmitter group
        for HIV and STIs. However, this survey found that the prevalence of HIV and syphilis among
        this group were below the national averages of Djibouti and Ethiopia, the native country of
        most LDTDs. Future studies should investigate the reasons behind these apparent
        discrepancies
    7. Sex debut was early in the two groups. Early sex debut is a known risk factor for STI
       infections including those that may lead to development of cervical cancer. Future programs
       should address these issues and probably advocate for sex education in schools. In order for
       these groups to benefit, sex education should start early because majority of participants
       had a less than 10-year schooling.


                                                 57
8. Majority of LDTDs who participated in this survey were from Ethiopia. There is therefore a
    need to launch cross-border HIV/STI prevention and sensitization programs targeting such
    highly mobile and vulnerable groups. Future studies should investigate whether LDTDs, the
    majority of whom are foreigners, face language and cultural barriers that hinder their access
    to critical information on HIV and syphilis prevention.
9. It is also important to consider providing HIV/STI information in form of bill boards and
    pamphlets in language that the truckers would include alongside the national language on
    Djibouti.
10. This survey suggests that various factors such as anal sex, long period of engagement as a
    sex worker, alcohol consumption among others may be significant risk factor for HIV/STI
    acquisition in one or both groups studied. While the data is not conclusive due to the small
    sample size of positive participants and the fact that only selected sites were included,
    future studies, especially case-control studies should be designed in future with a view to
    providing a deeper understanding on interaction of multiple confounding factors.
11. A significant proportion of participants did not consider themselves to be at risk of HIV/STIs
    despite engaging in risky behavior such as unprotected anal and genital sex. Future
    programs should enlighten target groups on how to accurately assess their individual
    vulnerabilities. Such campaigns should include lobbying for frequent HIV/STI testing.
12. Condoms are the single most effective available technology for reducing sexual transmission
    of HIV. Therefore, an increase in correct, consistent condom use should be promoted as the
    main strategy for reducing unprotected sex. These should conform to quality standards and
    be made available free or at low cost to SWs and their clients. The use of condoms is
    significantly low in both groups. There is a need to promote safe sex especially between the
    FSWs and the regular clients with whom they often develop long-term relationships.
    Sensitization campaigns on safe sex should also be supplemented with accurate information
    on family planning methods. Each partner has a role to play in maximizing successful
    negotiation of condom use, including enforcing their use. Comprehensive human rights-
    based condom programming and promotion among SWs and clients, as well as owners of
    sex work establishments and other intermediaries, should be a priority
13. A curious finding in this survey was the lack of an obvious link between use of injectable
    drugs, sharing needles or condom breakage and HIV/Syphilis status. Future case-control
    studies should verify these findings.
14. It is important to note that both groups largely comprised of young participants (less than 25
    years old). Considering that this survey only recruited adults (above the age of 18 years),
    there are possibilities that children (under the age of 18 years) may also be working as sex
    workers and truckers. Future studies and programs should also focus on these groups and
    find strategies to reach to younger ages through media including social media
15. There is a need to encourage FSWs and LDTDs to know their HIV/syphilis status and
    measures must be put in place to improve access to HIV care and support (including access
    to ART) among those who turn positive. The government of Djibouti and her partners can
    improve the efficient of service provision and support for vulnerable groups by using GIS
    maps such as those generated in this survey.
