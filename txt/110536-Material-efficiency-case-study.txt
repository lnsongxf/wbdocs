KEEP TRACK AND STAY IN THE BLACK
How manufacturerscan improve profitability, make belter business
decisions, and reduce waste
Did you kncow that the real cost of waste can be up to 100 times
higher than you think?
Many ma nufadurers underestirate theirvaste costsby focusirg an disposal a penses and recyding reenue,
missing the high cost of ra w rnaterials that don't end up i n the final product. In fact, by tracking the cost
of raw materials, erergy and other esDu rces throughout the producilon process, significant cast reductions
can be identified and waste decreased. Tracking also provides actionable information about production pmrses
enpowering cornpanies ta make mora efectie business decisions.

the amount of material usel to make your product. Since material         of Production Costs
costs are often the largest share af all production ex penses, using
less material can lead to significant savings. Iln fact, this isa sounder  Aluninu n
