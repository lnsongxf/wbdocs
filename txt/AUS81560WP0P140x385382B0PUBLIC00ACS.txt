SUMMARY

The ICT sector is growing even faster than the overall economy. The sector growth has positive cross-sectorial
impacts, as demonstrates the fact that an appropriate use of ICTs contributes to advance positions forward in
competitiveness global rankings. While this is true, it has to be stated that the ICT impact in Panama’s international
commerce is more driven by goods than by services. The reason may be rather related to the prominent role of the
Canal than to insufficient ICT international connectivity, because the available international broadband capacity
exceeds the demand, both in the short and the medium term. In the same regard, ICT national market is
competitive on the offer side, as indicate the existence of four market players for a relatively small market and
telecommunication services’ comparatively low. On the demand side, cell phone penetration is very high, while
computer and internet penetration remain in moderate levels.

From the governmental side, public authorities promote ICT-based services, at least in the public sector. Hence,
Panama ranks above most regional economies on eGovernment thanks to its dedicated ICT infrastructure, online
services and staff. This innovative way to interact with citizenship could be fostered by embracing Open Data
initiatives, so that citizens could propose ICT-based services to help authorities improve their public service
delivery; thus, upgrading eGovernment to a bidirectional relation. Still, in the private sector, many workers who can
benefit more directly from Internet do not use it. The causes are difficult to outline, but although it is true that
Panama is fairly well ranked on access and use of ICT, it has a lot of room for improvement on ICT skills, which could
be a bottleneck to expand the use of ICT in the private sector.

Those three parameters (ICT access, skills and use) achieve heterogeneous levels across the country, reaching lower
records in rural and indigenous communities. Among the three, ICT access is an enabler of the other two; and yet,
access to ICT infrastructure in remote areas is a big challenge that Panama needs to address in the short term.
Nevertheless, there are opportunities to take advantage of. For instance, being prepaid handset-based mobile
broadband and fixed broadband comparable on affordability and penetration rate, they constitute complementary
alternatives to expand broadband connectivity across the country. Actually, stakeholders from different sectors
could think of deploying joint infrastructure to increase their investment profitability in remote areas. To promote
it, the government could consider developing tailored regulation and fiscal policies for infrastructure sharing, so
that ICT services were accessible to more citizens. Such policies would back current government deployment of free
internet access sites in targeted areas to reduce Panama’s digital gap; thus, contributing to reduce economic, social
and demographic differences between citizens in urban, rural and indigenous communities.

Equally important, Panama achieved remarkable milestones on institutional empowerment. Likewise, it started
processes to create legal and regulatory initiatives in several areas. However, the government could take additional
actions to create a solid institutional, legal and regulatory framework. For instance, while Panama took important
steps on legislating on eGovernment, other areas like open access, shared infrastructure, spectrum management,
personal data protection, childhood protection, cybersecurity, open data and eCommerce remain at an early stage
of development. In addition, the telecommunications sector ex-post regulation could benefit from an update to
better respond to the market changes occurred in the last two decades. Regarding cybersecurity, the government
has identified a number of infrastructures to reinforce and started to raise awareness among stakeholders, but it
needs to design and implement an inter-institutional cybersecurity strategy comprising every key asset.

INTRODUCTION

The Government of Panama and the private sector recognize the importance of Information and
Communications Technology (ICT) as an enabler of national development. The government wishes to improve
local industries’ competitiveness by creating a responsive and transparent framework, as well as establishing an
enabling environment that allows the economy of Panama to transition into a knowledge economy that better
capitalizes on the global virtual economy.

This ICT Sector Policy Note seeks to identify opportunities and challenges for growth of the ICT sector in Panama,
particularly on rural access to broadband services and on cybersecurity, and potential for spillover impacts across
other sectors. Furthermore, it provides a brief overview of the ICT sector in Panama and outlines a series of
strategic actions and recommendations aimed at leveraging ICT as an engine of growth by targeting connectivity
infrastructure, policies, regulation, eServices, public data and skills.

This report is meant to cater to a wide audience, particularly: local policy makers interested in the ICT development agenda;
and governmental institutions interested in modernizing the government processes and public service delivery. Besides the
primary audience, this note can be of interest of the following players: telecommunications service providers considering
expanding their operations across the country; potential investors from abroad considering investing / using financial services
in Panama; and other stakeholders interested in international electronic commerce.

The following three sections briefly describe the ICT sector in Panama, breaking down the analysis into supply and
demand dynamics. In addition, section 4 describes the sector status from the cybersecurity point of view. Based on
these analyses, section 5 identifies challenges that are hindering the growth of the industry, and section 6 proposes
policy options to overcome them. Finally, the World Bank describes the ways it could support those policy options
(section 7) and proposes a set of joint activities (section 8).




1. ICT SECTOR IN THE ECONOMY

1.1 Institutional, legal and regulatory environment

Panama has achieved remarkable milestones on institutional empowerment. Likewise, it started procedures to
create legal and regulatory initiatives in several areas. However, there is still room for improvement to
consolidate its institutional, legal and regulatory framework. A number of institutions are involved with ICT policy
and regulation; among them, ASEP (Autoridad Nacional de los Servicios Públicos or Public Services National
Authority), and AIG (Autoridad Nacional para la Innovación Gubernamental or Governmental Innovation National
Authority). The first one, ASEP, which belongs to Dirección General de Telecomunicaciones (Telecommunications
General Directorate), controls and regulates economic activities in the telecommunications sector and issues
concessions to telecommunication services providers.i The second one, AIG, is responsible for modernizing public
administrations through the use of ICT. Among many other initiatives, AIG developed the Strategic Digital Agenda
for Panama 2012-2014 (SDA 2012-2014 or Agenda Digital Estratégica Panamá 2012-2014) defining national
priorities of public interest, governmental entities’ action in the mid-term, and innovation processes.ii

                                                              7
While Panama took important steps on eGovernment legislation, other areas like open access, shared
infrastructure, spectrum management, personal data protection, childhood protection, cybersecurity, open data
and eCommerce remain at an early stage. As stated, there have recently been legislative reforms tackling
eGovernment. The Law 65, October 30th 2009 was updated by the Law 83, November 9th 2012 to regulate the use
of electronic tools for executing governmental transactions. Among others, this legislation covered the following
points: electronic and in person signatures are equally valid; official notices must be published on institutional
websites; public institutions must present to AIG an annual proposal on processes improvement and a Digital
Agenda; and all documents required for official transactions must be available online. Moreover, a national
payment portal was expected to be available by 2013, enabling public institutions to offer ePayment (online
payment) options by cards and online banking. However, legislation on Open Data and Personal Data Protection is
incipient, and strengthening the telecommunications sector regulation could set a sounder basis for ex-post
decisions.

On eCommerce the legislation in force is the Law 92, November 9th 2012, which modified the Law 51, July 22nd
2008, giving powers to the Public Registry (Registro Público) as registering and certifying root authority for the
national electronic signature system. This institution expected to issue the first electronic signature by 2014. On
Data Protection, there are a number of sectorial regulations (e.g. the Health system has its own rules) including
economic sanctions, but there is no centralized authority either cross-sectorial uniformity.

Last, telecommunications sector ex-post regulation could benefit from an update. The market has changed a lot
since it was fully open in 2003. For instance, in the mobile telephony segment, there was a duopoly until 2007,
when two additional operators entered the market. In contrast, the current regulatory market dates from 1996;
hence, upgrading it could promote fair competition to a further extent.


1.1.1   Universal Access Fund

The Universal Access Fund receives taxes from certain telecommunication services to invest them in making ICT
accessible to more citizens. The Universal Access Fund (UAF) was established by the Law 59 of 2008 to promote
access to affordable telecommunications services including voice telephony and Internet access, as well as
broadband connectivity at community, household, and individual levels. A Universal Access Fund serves as an
instrument to enhance access among remote underserved locations. The fund is financed by a levy imposed on
phone, cable mobile and internet service providers, accounting for 1 percent of their taxable income from local,
national and international fixed telephony; personal communication services; mobile telephony;
telecommunications signal transport; and internet service. Moreover, 0.01Balboa (USD0.01) was charged until
December 2012 to foreigner operators for every minute of international call terminating in Panama.

To manage the fund, the same law created the Universal Service and Access Advisory Board (Junta Asesora de
Servicio y Acceso Universal), administered by AIG. On average, the fund receives 8 million Balboa (USD8M) per year,
which are used to finance the following projects: (i) operation and maintenance of public phones in rural and
remote areas (more than 14,000 public and semi-public phones are operated in the country), with an associated


                                                        8
 cost of 1.4 million Balboa per year; and (ii) operating and maintaining the National Network for Universal Internet
 Access (RNI or Red Nacional de Acceso Universal a Internet), composed by 1,157 free Wifi Internet access sites
 across 41 cities and towns, with an associated cost of 32.8 million Balboas in 5 years.iii


 1.2 ICT in the economy
                                                                                                  Figure 1. ICT sector turnover components (2011)

  The ICT sector is growing even faster than the overall economy.                                                            Others,

 sectorial gross income components and its share, where mobile
 telephony represents more than half of the sector business.

 Panama is well positioned as importer and exporter of ICT goods, but its ICT services exporter potential can be
 further exploited, as illustrated in the following Figures 2 and 3. Probably because of the tremendous influence
 that the Canal has in the national economy, the country has a very balanced relation of imported and exported ICT
 goods in the region, only behind Costa Rica, which doubles Panama’s figures. In contrast, probably influenced by
 the amount of services exports related to the Canal (only bigger countries like Argentina and Chile export more
 value in services), Panama holds one of the smallest percentages of ICT services exports of total services exports
 among the analyzed regional countries. Therefore, Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) could be fostered.

Box 1. Investing in broadband triggers growth and employment

Increasing broadband penetration has a positive impact on the GDP per capita and job creation. International studies
indicate that a 10 percent increase of broadband penetration triggers a 1.38 percent increase of GDP growth per
capita while each job directly related to broadband expansion creates 1.5-4.5 indirect jobs. According to the Inter-
American Development Bank, in LAC, such increase in broadband penetration is associated, on average with a 3.2
percent GDP increase and 67,000 new jobs in a given country. iv Expanding broadband infrastructure can leverage
existing civil society, SMEs, entrepreneurs and Government institutions to distribute services with greater
efficiency, reach and impact.

Moreover, other models, when applied to the Panamanian case, show that every 1 percent increase of fixed
broadband expansion between 2000 and 2010 triggered a 0.045 percent growth of GDP; while every 1 percent
increase of qualified jobs related to this expansion triggers a 1.15 percent growth of GDP. Furthermore, this model
predicts that a 10 percent decrease in the broadband subscription rate would increase the penetration in more
than 21 percent.v

demand, both in the short and the medium term. The
primary international traffic access offered by domestic
telecom service providers in Panama is via five
submarine cables; two more cables were planned to be
operational by September 2014. Those cables land in
four different points, which are located at both extremes
of the canal (see Figure 4). These landing points are
located in three areas, thus increasing resilience and
security of capacity against natural disasters. They offer
international connectivity via several providers, thus
increasing competition, and therefore contributing to Source: Submarine Cable Map

Actually, most main regional providers offer their services in Panama, which positions the country in a privileged
strategic situation that could be leveraged to become a regional submarine cables hub. These submarine cables,
their respective landing stations and capacity are described in the Table 1 below:

InteRed Panama is the country’s Internet Exchange Point (IXP) and is mostly used by the main Internet operators
in the country. An IXP is a physical network node that gathers and routes traffic from multiple Internet Service
Providers (ISP). Generally speaking and disregarding other key aspects, the closer a user has an IXP, the more
efficiently its ISP will route his data. For instance, in Panama, the ISPs’ alternative was to exchange traffic through
satellite connections, which tend to be slower and more expensive.vi Thus, IXPs help ISPs to better allocate their
networks’ capacity, therefore contributing to optimize the use of both national and international bandwidth
resources. InteRed Panama’s board members, who manage and have access to the IXP services, are: (i) the main
ISPs, (ii) SENACyT (National Secretariat for Science, Technology and Innovation), and (iii) PANNet (Red Académica
de Investigación Nacional or National Research Academic Network). PANNet manages the NIC (Network
Information Center) Panama, which is in charge of the national Internet domain name .pa and its sub-domains.vii

There is a regional initiative to map roads, water, ICT and electricity infrastructure to explore opportunities for
sharing its use could be extremely cost-effective. SIEPAC (Central American Countries Electric Interconnection
System or Sistema de Interconexión Eléctrica de los Países de América Central), is a project with an important role
to play on international connectivity. Actually, SIEPAC triggered the creation of REDCA (Central American Fiber
Network or Red CentroAmericana de Fibras Ópticas) in 2007, whose potential can be further leveraged. Regional
synergies are active not only on infrastructure, but on regulation as well, as proves COMTELCA (Regional Technical
Commission on Telecommunications or Comisión Técnica Regional de Telecomuincaciones) that unites,
disseminates and assists regulators in six Central American Countries. The regulator, ASEP (Public Services National
Authority or Autoridad Nacional de los Servicios Públicos), is involved in COMTELCA and, despite not being member
of Regulatel (Latin American Forum of Telecom Regulator or Foro Latinamoericano de Entes Reguladores de
Telecomunicaciones), takes part in a number of its projects. Besides these public-led initiatives, private companies
with regional presence (e.g. Continental Towers Corp.) operate in Panama as neutral players to offer shared passive
infrastructure to telecommunications operators.


2.2 National Connectivity

Stakeholders could consider deploying joint and cross-sector infrastructure. Due to geographic, demographic and
socioeconomic distribution, it is not easy or profitable to deploy telecommunication networks to offer fixed
telephony and broadband services in certain remote areas or areas inhabited by indigenous population. Therefore,
in some of those regions offering internet connection through microwave is a good solution, while in cities
operators use more frequently fiber optic cables.

The following private telecommunications companies manage the country internet backbone and backhauls: (i)
C&W (Cable & Wireless Panamá), which is the incumbent; (ii) Cable Onda, which originally offered only cable
television; and (iii) UFINET (Gas Natural y Unión Fenosa Redes de Telecomunicación), which originally provided only
electricity. ISPs deploy their own networks, especially in the backhaul and access sections, but they often lease
fibers from UFINET, which has a large fiber optics network deployed nationwide with exclusive presence in both
geographic extremes of the country. Figures 6 and 8 illustrate that Cable Onda and UFINET networks are mainly
deployed around the same areas, which, as described in the Demand section, are some of the most densely
populated. UFINET’s fiber network was originally for its own use only. Likewise, ETESA (Empresa de Transmisión
Eléctrica S.A.) and the company managing the Canal have their own fiber networks that keep for internal use only.

In fact, there are cross-sector initiatives for infrastructure sharing under execution, while some others are under
study. Collaboration between telecommunications and electricity carriers seems quite immediate, since the latter
often own fiber deployed across its network, initially for signaling purposes but easily upgradable for commercial
transmission data. For instance, AIG and the electricity transmission company ETESA reached an agreement for
sharing a segment of ETESA’s network to reach targeted remote areas.

Likewise, UFINET operates as carrier of carriers, grouping data transport demand from Cable&Wireless, Claro and
Telefónica, and benefitting from economies of scale to buy fiber directly from producers, as well as from its
electricity network’s ducts, poles, and dedicated maintenance team. Hence, it offers very competitive prices that
their clients would hardly reach by operating their own transport fiber networks. Thus, although there are no signs
of power abuse, UFINET holds a dominant position in the broadband transmission market. It offers international
connectivity with Costa Rica to its main clients, but the connection with Colombia is still under study, and might be
eventually done with submarine cables. In rural areas, UFINET is usually subcontracted by public contract
awardees. Nevertheless, UFINET’s network has very limited presence in areas inhabited by indigenous
communities, because it has encountered difficulties in agreeing compensations for rights of way and land use.



2.3 Fixed Telephony Market

The incumbent, Cable and Wireless Panama, controls the market. The firm is 49 percent state-owned, another 49
percent belongs to C&W Plc., and the remaining 2 percent belongs to its workers. C&W is the incumbent operator,
owning the legated PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) and holding exclusivity in national and international
long distance calls. Moreover, it operates and maintains its country-wide public telephones network, as part of its
obligations as Universal Service provider. The possibility of enabling 12,000 payphones with broadband access
powered by solar energy is under discussion.

2.3.2   Fixed Telephony in Rural Areas

Despite the remarkable number of public and semi-public phones available, their use decreases; probably
subject to a substitution process in favor of mobile telephony. As mentioned earlier, one of the uses of the
Universal Access Fund is financing the operation and maintenance of public phones. In 2011, there were 13,937
public (80 percent) and semi-public phones, down from 15,453 in 2007. More than 80 percent of those phones
belong to Cable & Wireless Panamá. Although those phones are used mainly for local calls, both local and national
calls using those devices decreased during 2011, probably because of the increasing trend of mobile telephony use
and coverage. viii



2.4 Mobile Telephony Market

The existence of four players in such a relatively small market is an indicator of effective competition. Más Móvil
(Cable & Wireless Panamá), Movistar (Telefónica), Digicel Panamá, and Claro Panamá (América Móvil) are the four
mobile active operators in the country. The two first have been active for more than a decade in Panama and hold
a mobile telephony concession, while the other two entered the market in 2008 after obtaining a personal
communications service concession. ix

The following Figures 9 and 10 show that the two operators that firstly entered the market accumulate about 78
percent of shares; Digicel holds another 13 percent, and Claro the remaining 9 percent; as of June 2014. It is
remarkable that Telefónica doubles Más Móvil’s shares in the contract sector, probably due to a major presence in
corporate accounts. However, this figure has to be analyzed bearing in mind that there are about 8 times more
prepaid connections than contracts, and Más Móvil leads this much bigger prepaid marked.

Nevertheless, it is worth noting that rural and indigenous communities whose households are not covered by
mobile telephony network often own cell phones too, since they can use it while are in areas with network signal.
Hence, due to their sporadic use, they probably tend to adopt pre-payment plans under pay-for-use basis, which
contributes to unbalance the pre-paid - contract ratio.

Despite the overall increase in
broadband downstream capacity Figure 14. Available connection speeds (Mbps) (September 2012)
available in the retail market, several
countries in the region offer higher
speed connections. Taking into
account the high concentration of
business in the country’s capital and
the remarkable acquisition power of
their employees, there would
probably be demand for internet
connection with downstream speed Source: Update: the state of broadband in Latin America by BNAmericas

figure, in 2013 ISPs offer 10, 20 and 50Mbps downstream for residential clients.

Box 2. Broadband Strategy for 2020

After the Broadband Master plan defining this internet service as a minimum of 1Mbps downstream speed and 256 Kbps
upstream, the currently under discussion national Broadband Strategy for 2020 intends to increase the connection speed
across the country. AIG’s preliminary target for 2020 could be reaching 100Mbps per 20USD/month in urban areas (e.g.
Santiago, Colón, San Miguelito, David, Chitré, etc.) and 10Mbps in rural areas (at least in public facilities), but it still needs to
evaluate its feasibility. Furthermore, AIG would envisage increasing the current 86 percent of population with potential access
to internet up to 100 percent. Pursuing this latter objective, AIG have designed five projects (although not all five have started
yet) to increase internet coverage by about 2 percent each project at a cost of 3.5-5 million dollar each. An overall investment
of about 150 million dollar (understanding that part of it has already been executed) would eventually enable to achieve such
ambitious objective.

The public network of Figure 17. Access Sites of Red Nacional de Internet

contributes to reduce
Panama’s digital gap
(65 percent of its users
are in the country’s
interior). However, its

sustainability        and
expansion       to    the
remaining 14 percent
                             Source: ASEP, 2013
of population remain
an issue. In a first phase, RNI (Red Nacional de Internet or National Internet Network Service) made 1Mb internet
service available to inhabitants from 9 out of the 12 provinces through 655 Wifi access points (see Figure 17). AIG,
the institution managing the project, expanded it to 41 cities and reached 1,105 points by mid-2013. The project,
initially foreseen for 5 years plans to invest a total of USD32 million. Its acceptance is proven by the 1,300,000
registered users by December 2013, from which 25,000 use them in daily basis to exchange more than 180 GB on
average. Liberty, which was awarded to deploy NRI, used fiber to connect 85 percent of its access points, while it
used microwave to connect 4 of them. For its maintenance, a set of local professionals was trained across the
country to provide rapid response to incidences and ensure high availability.

Besides RNI, Government funds about 300 community centers equipped with about 10 desktop computers,
enabled with free wifi, and managed by 1 facilitator. These centers, named Infoplazas, organize trainings on
software like Windows operating system, Ubuntu, Windows Office, Open Office, movie edition, educative content
creation, education virtual platforms, coding logics, web2.0 tools, collaborative tools, and SOLCA (Software Libre y
Codigo Abierto or Open Code and Free Software) to contribute to bridge the digital gap with impaired citizens. An
Infoplaza, which is typically open from 8am to 7pm on weekdays and from 8am to 2pm on Saturdays, is used daily
by 70-150 citizens. According to staff, more citizens could benefit from them if opening hours were more flexible
and there were more computers, since often there is unattended demand due to limited resources, which are
funded by the Government. Furthermore, a number of them have an annex space equipped with a
videoconference kit, television, audio system and a projector, which is used by the community as multipurpose
room.

Additionally, 36 public pay phones in the countryside have been equipped with a 1Mbps free wifi connection. It is
planned to double both the number of featured pay phones and their speed connection.

Box 3. Economic impact of targeted free internet services

Every dollar invested in facilitating targeted free internet access creates economic activity equivalent to 7.53 dollar.
According to AIG, its investment in making free internet available in certain spots triggers internet subscription s’ raise, since
users want to have independent and uninterrupted internet access. This factor, jointly with the subsequent acquisition of ICT
terminals and equipment, as well as the increasing number of existing and new business among those communities adopting
ICT, have a positive impact in the economy. This premise serves as baseline to dedicate part of the aforementioned Universal
Service Fund to invest in free internet networks like RNI.

2.6 Mobile Broadband Market

Mobile internet access, being one of the highest in the region, overtook fixed line                Figure 18. Fixed vs. Mobile Broadband
access in late 2010. Considering mobile connections of 256kbps or faster and                       Penetration (2011)

including prepaid users who don’t have full data plans, only Brazil and Chile show
higher mobile broadband penetration in the region, as of 2011 (see Figure 18).x


Market players are the same as in mobile telephony, being their shares quite
similar as well: Más Móvil and Telefónica entered the market in 2009 and currently
aggregate 83 percent of subscribers, while Digicel and Claro, which entered the
market two years later, hold the remaining 17 percent (see Figure 19). The four
mobile operators were awarded licenses to offer 4G services, while the

2.6.1     Mobile Broadband Pricing

The four mobile broadband players offer a wide variety of retail options and base their competition strategies,
firstly, on data downloading capacity and, secondly, on price. In the postpaid (or contract) market competition is
equally based on both price and downloading capacity (see Figure 20), while in the prepaid market competition is
rather based on downloading capacity than on price or length of the plan (see Figure 21).

2.6.2       Mobile Broadband in Rural Areas

                                                                    speaking, 3G is available in all cities, while 4G is

                                                                    according to Digicel, its 4G network (see Figure 22)

capillarity legated network and upgrading it to GPON (Gigabit Passive Optical Network) technology. In conclusion,
although pricing and business model are key issues that would need to be analyzed, mobile technology has
potential to partially address the lack of high speed internet in remote or low populated areas. Indeed, it could be a
commercial complement to RNI, which offers fixed broadband connection to 80 of population through a subsidized
network of wifi access points.

3.1 Economic, social, and demographic distribution

There are clear economic, social and demographic differences between urban and rural areas. Lowest population
density, average age, economically active population percentage, and literacy rates are concentrated in the same
areas, which are mostly rural (see figures 23, 24, 25, and 26).

In 2013, urban population was at 76.4 percent, being its average growth rate close to 3 percent in the last decade.
Economically active population is mainly concentrated in cities, which are generally areas with lower analphabetism
rate, and where most adults develop their careers. Overall, unemployment rate decreased notably from 13 percent
to 4 percent in the decade 2003-2012. xi

Box 4. Governmental initiatives to promote internet adoption across the education ecosystem
Internet for all (Internet para todos) is the popular name of the aforementioned country-wide free public wifi network RNI.
Access points are installed in public places naturally acting as meeting points, like squares or public schools. Public high
schools are being enabled with a minimum of 4Mbps broadband connection in sites reachable by terrestrial network,
whereas a 2Mbps internet connection is offered to schools placed in remoter areas. The internet subscription cost of 1,464
schools is USD7million per year. However, those represent only 45 percent of the 3,300 public schools of the country,
whereas a number of the remaining 55 percent (often in less densely populated areas) could not be included in the program
because of its instable electricity supply. To address this situation, in 2012, MEDUCA contracted the power infrastructure
improvement of 162 schools through public contest. Additionally, 6,000 people from disadvantaged communities were
provided with house, internet and training.
Peer-to-peer (Entre pares) program, leaded by MEDUCA and with Microsoft collaboration, to train teachers to develop ICT
skills to incorporate them both as content and vehicular tool in their daily professional activity. Thus, it is ensured that those
teachers who had not developed ICT skills during their previous formation can equally offer education at high quality
standard to their students. As a result, by 2013 30,000 teachers have been trained and received a laptop.
SOLCA, institution depending on AIG, trains and certifies (in person and online) 2,000 university students and professors on IT
skills including configuration and administration of servers and firewalls. Its research lab studies and tests technologies that
will be eventually used by governmental institutions. Furthermore, it develops specific software for several types of
impairments, which could be translated to indigenous and foreign languages to maximize its social inclusive impact.
The Technology for all (Tecnología para todos) program, a joint initiative of AIG and the Minister of Education (MEDUCA),
gives a customized laptop to public high-school students from grades 10, 11 and 12 countrywide, with views to expand it to
grade 9 in upcoming years. Each laptop, equipped with Microsfot Windows 7 costs USD290. This initiative aims to reduce the
existing gap between private and public schools regarding the access to computers and internet by delivering 181,300 laptops
(half in 2012 and half in 2013) among 162 centers. A microchip enabling remotely blocking the laptops was installed to
discourage robbery. Indeed, it was effective since only 40 laptops were reported as stolen. Students have the right to have its
laptop replaced once, and the duty to give it back if they do not finish secondary school. In its first phase, 1,500 volunteer
students were selected to be members of the Informatics Solidarity Group (CSI or Cuerpo de Solidaridad Informática), being in
charge to assist other students on the use and maintenance of their laptop. In order to stimulate the IT skills development of
this targeted group of students, MEDUCA organized a robotics contest among them. MEDUCA covers the USD25 million cost
of this project; while its total estimated investment reaches USD50 million, which would need to be incremented to about
USD 80 million to expand the project to all schools.

Box 5. Governmental partnership initiatives to support high quality training on ICT

In 2006, the Government of India contributed to create the India-Panama IT Education Centre of Excellence. India
collaborated with INADEH (Instituto Nacional de Formación Profesional y Capacitación para el Desarrollo Humano or National
Institute for Professional Training and Capacitation for Human Development) to create this center.

In 2012, the Government of Korea contributed to create the Panama-Korea Centre for Information Access. The goal of this
center, created in collaboration with AIG, is to offer tailored training programs to Government officials on eGovernment.

In 2014, the government envisages to formalize a partnership with Microsoft. This partnership is still under discussion.

The state-owned telecommunications Multi-Service Network reduces costs, increases interoperability and
enables more dynamic relation with citizens. The Multi-Service Network (RMS or Red Multi-Servicios de
Telecomunicaciones del Estado), carries voice, data, internet and video to serve State institutions. Moreover, it
comprises a governmental switchboard and an IP telephony platform with a wide variety of functionalities. RMS
robustness, resiliency and service continuity is reinforced through redundant topology, as illustrated in Figure 33.xiii

electronically, while 5 transactions are fully feasible online. Furthermore, national Public Registry (Registro Público)
is developing an electronic signature system to set a secure authentication framework that will enable to increase
its online transactions portfolio on registering the property of land, building, vehicle, firms, etc. For this purpose, an
affordable chip card (i.e. 50-75 USD for 2 years of service) would allow citizens to use a fully operative electronic
signature. Moreover, the Government plans to create an electronic payment portal for eGovernment transactions,
taking advantage of citizens’ familiarity with the use of bank accounts (a vast majority of salaries are paid by bank
transfer, while only a small share are paid by check); but the financial sector needs to deploy eBanking to a further
extent for this initiative to become fully successful.

EGovernment initiatives are not exclusive of national institutions, but also local governments are adopting this
trend. The MuNet project, led by AIG, made available to 28 municipalities an online portal containing practical and
tourist information, and they plan to offer electronic transactions in the mid-term. Besides facilitating technical
support and ICT infrastructure to those municipal authorities, AIG offers eGovernment capacitation courses.
Actually, eGovernment could have an enormous impact on administrative informality among remote communities,
because part of their citizens cannot access Government offices and therefore do not register deaths, births,
marriages or properties.

To contribute to the upwards trend on competitiveness, AIG promoted the project Panama sin papel (Panama
paperless); created by Executive Decree in 2010. Its scope comprises the judicial system, local governments, public
finances, and the public health system. Thanks to this project, online forms and digital files to enable electronic
tracking will be available for electronic transactions in public institutions. In addition, the implementation of the
Multi-Service Network triggered an important leap forward in global competitiveness indices.

In both temporal evolution graphics many parameters increase abruptly right after 2008, because at that time two
new operators entered the market to join the existing two. However, while unique subscribers and post-payment
connections increased slightly, population remained quite stable. Therefore, it can be concluded that a big share of
new mobile subscriptions were in pre-payment modality after the two new licenses concession, which triggered a
remarkable penetration rate raise.

3.6 Internet Service

Internet penetration is growing at high pace and there is still room for improvement. Internet subscribers
increased constantly from 2005 to 2010 at a bigger pace than population (see Figure 40). Furthermore, the number
of internet users, based on the average number of people per household and employees per company, increased
much faster, which indicates an increasing degree of business and social adoption. As illustrated, in 2010 there
were almost 1.5 million of users and more than 3.5 million inhabitants. Therefore 42.9 percent of inhabitants used
internet as of 2013, which is a rate close to the average of regional countries used as benchmark (see Figure 41),
and above of Latin America’s average (28.8 percent). It is of notable interest the fact that, in 2010, 87 percent of
subscriptions were from residential users, while 97.9 percent of connections were considered broadband.xiv

Almost 9 out of 10 internet connections are robust and speedy, being at the head of the region on the
percentage of connections with more than 4Mb of bandwidth, but lagging behind on bandwidths bigger than
10Mb. The most popular access technologies, subject to an increasing trend, are ADSL (53.9 percent) and cable
modem (35.2 percent), while Dial up has dramatically decreased in the last decade down to 3.3 percent in 2010
(see Figure 42), WiMax and other technologies incremented their presence at slow pace. Actually, 75 percent of
broadband connections have more than 4Mb of bandwidth; only Chile has better records in this parameter across
the region. However, in the adoption percentage of bandwidth bigger than 10Mb, Panama falls behind many other
countries like Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Guatemala, Colombia, Mexico or El Salvador (see Figure 43).

3.7 Fixed Broadband Market

Although recent public administration efforts for expanding computer and internet access may have not been
yet accounted in international databases, penetration rate could be improved. Figures 44 and 45 show that, in
2013, Panama ranked in the mid-range of regional countries on percentage of households with computer (39.3
percent) and with Internet connection (31.5 percent); as well as of on broadband subscription per 100 inhabitants
(7.8 percent). Causes may be, among others, lack of electricity access, affordability, ICT skills, or interest.

As mentioned, it has to be taken into account that these figures may do not include remarkable governmental
initiatives like Internet para todos (Internet for all) and Infoplazas (info-sites), providing free internet access to
citizens in public spaces and community centers. Hence, the impact of those initiatives may be not yet accounted in
broadband subscriptions statistics per household or per 100 inhabitants. Likewise, AIG’s initiative of giving a laptop
to 9-12 grade students of 45 percent of public high-schools country-wide may be not reflected yet in the
percentage of computers per household statistics elaborated by ITU.



3.7.1     Fixed Broadband Affordability

Regarding fixed broadband subscription affordability, Panama is very close to reach ITU’s objective on 1 percent
of GNI per capita. As shown in Figures 46 and 47, fixed broadband is among the most affordable in the region,
representing the average sub-basket’s price 2 percent of GNI per capita, and 1Mb connection’s price 1.04 percent
of GDP per capita.

4. CYBER SECURITY AND PROTECTION OF CRITICAL INFORMATION
   INFRASTRUCTURE

4.1 Context

Together with the rapid expansion of the ICTs in Panama end users, business community, public institutions and
Internet service providers (ISPs) began to increasingly face cyber security threats. First cyber security incidents go
as far back as 2006 when the DNS servers of the major ISPs were hit by DDoS attacks, and more recently in 2010
the mail account of the Chief of Staff of the Presidency was subject to illegal interception and leakage. After those
events the Panamanian government has been subject to two (2) anonymous operations, both in 2012. Few years
ago Registro Público faced major cyber security attack which resulted in leakage of personal data of most of the
records in their databasexv thru scrapping techniques. Other incidents include web defacement, phishing attacks,
botnet proliferation, and more.

The fast growing number of cyber security incidents (see Box 6) gained attention of public institutions and private
companies, especially the recent ones started to take appropriate technical and administrative measures
preventing and protecting its networks and information from the cyber threats.

Box 6. Cyber-incident trends in Panama, 2012

Web defacement was the primary type of cyber incident reported in Panama, comprising 27% of all cases managed by CSIRT
(country’s national incident response team). This was closely followed by DDoS attacks (23%), and unauthorized login attempts
(15%). Cases involving phishing (6%), fraudulent information use (4%), SQL injection (4%), spamming (6%), and unauthorized
information disclosure (7%), XSS use (4%), and other unauthorized access attempts (4%) completed the attack chart. The
majority of incidents in Panama were reported in the third quarter of 2012 (see Figure 50).

Figure 50. Dominant Cyber-Incident Types Reported in Panama, 2012




                                                                             The aforementioned cyber incidents were paired
                                                                             with reports from Panamanian authorities that
                                                                             customer service centers often had more access
                                                                             to clients’ personal information than necessary,
                                                                             needlessly exposing individuals to insider
                                                                             threats. These service centers were frequently
                                                                             exposed to DDoS attacks, compounding risks to
                                                                             precariously stored sensitive information.

Apart of the cyber security vulnerabilities Panama has faced energy supply outages which resulted in greater
connectivity losses. For instance, and uncontrolled wildfire resulted in a power outage, due to the fact that the
electrical network is by itself a single point of failure, the resulting blackout affected the whole country, impacting
the availability of mobile networks and Internet services.

Nowadays, leading telecommunication companies require additional investments to increase resiliency to
electricity cuts. For instance key infrastructure assets of Cable&Wireless are equipped a with 2 hours battery and
5,000 gallon tanks of fuel to ensure 5 days electricity autonomy. A more reliable national electricity system would
allow operators to concentrate their investments in more productive assets.

Emerging cyber security situation and overall understanding of criticality of the ICT infrastructure to the
functioning of the key sectors of the economy, elevated the issue up on the political agenda and resulted in
number of legal and policy initiatives aiming to strengthen cyber security resilience and critical information
infrastructure protection.


4.2 Overview of the legal framework

Legal cyber security framework in
                                        Figure 51. Structure of the Cybersecurity Framework and main legislative initiatives in Panama
Panama is only starting to emerge
however pace of the development
is significant. First of all on the
international level (see Figure 51)
Panama, as well as the other
member states, is the signatory to
the regional OAS/CICTE AG/RES.
2004 (IV-O/04): Adoption of a
Comprehensive         Inter-American
Strategy To Combat Threats to
Cybersecurity on march 2004xvii. On
15 November 2012, Panama was
invited to accede to Budapest
                                        Source: AIG
Convention       on      Cybercrime.
Legislative reforms are underway to enable Panama to become a party. On the national level major developments
may be split into the policy and legislative initiatives. Among the most significant policy initiatives are Position
paper on Cyber security that describes the official stand in regards of Critical Infrastructure Resilience, protection of
minors online and cyber securityxviiiadopted by the Foreign Relations Ministry and the Telecommunications
Regulator (ASEP) and the National Cyber Security Policyxix adopted in May 2013. Among the legislative initiatives
may be mentioned the draft law number 377 that modifies the penal code which was submitted to Parliament on
2Q 2012 and Law of Data protection which according to the Policy should be adopted in 2013. It is also worthy to
mention decree on establishment of CSIRT PANAMAxx (National computer emergency response team of Panama)
adopted in September 2011.


                                                                 33
Despite the great effort, at the moment of writing of the Note Panama is lacking legislative framework for cyber
space in number of areas. Among them the legal framework for personal data protection may be named as one of
the significant importance due to its capacity to build the confidence of the society and business community in the
cyber space and promote broader penetration of the usage of ICTs. Indeed interviewed ISPs (the ISP´s interviewed
were Cable and Wireless and Cableonda) named data privacy breaches as a second dominating among the end user
complaints. According to the CSIRT unauthorized log in attempts and phishing were accounting to near 50% of all
the reported cyber security incidents over 2012 (see also Box 6).

However it is expected that Policy will provide strong and coordinated stimulus to the development of the cyber
security framework in Panama. Indeed ambitious and concrete 3 years (2012-2015) action plan may be seen as a
strong political commitment. Across the Latin and Central Americas Panama is the second country adopting Policy
(Columbia has adopted National policy in 2011). However short time horizon definitely challenges the
implementation of the Policy. Taking that into account, it may be needed to ensure the continuity of the initiatives
launched by the Policy beyond 2015 by, for instance, establishment of Policy review framework and procedures. It
could be noted as well that coordination and accountability mechanisms are not embedded into the Policy at this
moment and this subsequently may result in additional implementation challenges.

Policy in a holistic cross sector way addresses broad set of cyber security challenges. Indeed the Policy document
is well organised around six pillars (see Table 2) and it is composed from 36 tasks mainly assigned to the public
institutions. Objective of the Policy is: “combining the efforts of our citizens, companies, and public institutions to
bring about an increase in cybersecurity, to allow the reliable use of information technologies in all areas of national
life while also safeguarding the fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens and an economic and regulatory
environment that encourages corporate growth and development and allowing the correct functioning of the
state.”xxi

Document was toughly consulted with public and private institutionsxxii. It was observed however that higher level
of public and private institutions interviewed during the WB missionxxiii was not always aware about the existence
of the Policy as such. This may be caused by the fact that preparation of the Policy was carried out on more
technical level without deeper involvement of the managerial level of public institutions and private companies. It
is however of utmost importance to involve both in order to ensure sufficient level of engagement and
commitment to the Policy implementation.

                                                                               34
So far the legal cyber security framework does not foresee cyber security and CIIP related obligations to the
public institutions and (or) ISPs. Existing arrangements aiming to strengthen the cyber security resilience (for
instance minimal technical measures), reporting of the cyber related incidents to CSIRT, etc., and limited initiatives
in the area of CIIP are based on near entirely on cooperation basis and mutual benefits.

During its mission WB noticed a broad agreement across public and private sectors on the need for critical
information infrastructure protection (CIIP) framework and endorsement for further implementation of CIIP
action plan foreseen by the Policy. It is therefore a recommendation of the WB to gain the momentum arising
from that understanding and go ahead with the development of the sound CIIP framework. Emerging as an
important international business hub with its strong financial, logistics, ICT and other sectors Panama in many ways
leads economic development in the region. Public sector demonstrates great effort in terms of implementation of
e-government services for the public and making its own operation more efficient through virtualization and
adoption of electronic G2G processes on the following fields: (i) e-Government, where AIG built capacity among
public officials on the Panama Paperless initiativexxiv, and developed a payment national portalxxv; (ii) cloud
computing, which engaged governmental institutions like the Ministry of Presidency (Ministerio de Presidencia)xxvi,
the Ministry of Housing and Land Use (Ministerio de Vivenda y Ordenamiento Territorial or MVIOT)xxvii, and the Land
Management National Authority (Autoridad Nacional de Administración de Tierras)xxviii; and (iii) Registro Público,
which modernized its online information systems triggered an improvement in international competitiveness
indexesxxix. However further development may be put at risk if Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) is not
protected from vulnerabilities and threats arising from the increased dependence of the essential sectors of the
economy on ICTs. Public institutions running CII, for instance Registro Público, are facing cyber security challenge
on daily basis. There were events of the leakage of private data in the past and it is a broad endorsement for
establishment of national CIIP framework, including CIIP governance model, CII identification methodology,
principles, guidelines and coordination for public CII.



4.3 Governance model

As it is usual in the area of cyber security, Panama follows its own governance model with AIG playing the role of
the natural leader of the cyber security agenda. Figure 52 presents a list of different organizations that have been
identified as responsible of the different task resulting from the identification of the six initiatives that conform the
National Cybersecurity Strategy with most of them assigned to AIG.

AIG hosts the CSIRT PANAMA. The mandate of the CSIRT foresees its key role in ensuring cyber security in the
public sector, i.e. coordination of efforts to raise levels of resource security and systems related to information
technologies and communications of governmental entities. According to AIG, CSIRT monitors the cyberattacks
within the following segments: National Multiservices Network; Government Cloud Computing; Government
Agencies; and civil population. However it also active in collaboration with private sector and among is objectives
names such as the prevention, treatment, identification and resolution of security incidents attacks on computer
systems that make up the nation's critical infrastructure and access to information of the citizens of Panama.

Organisational structure of CSIRT is provided on the Figure 52.

CSIRT plays the key role in ensuring cyber security for such public sector. For instance, within the Multiservices
Network (dedicated network for public sector institutions) CSIRT provides an IT Security Perimeter thru Firewalls
and Intrusions Prevention Systems for public institutions such as the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the
Ministry of Commerce and Industries. Likewise, among others, CSIRT serves the governmental cloud computing
initiative, led by AIG, through which several Ministries and national authorities share centralized IT resources and
infrastructure. So far CSIRT is not operating on 24/7 basis, but it is foreseen by the Policy to strengthen its real time
incident monitoring capacity. CSIRT may be considered very active and rich in different initiatives however
systematic annual planning of the CSIRT activities and financial resources securing the subsequent implementation
so far is not being performed.

In order to secure the leadership, continuity and sustainability of the initiatives in the cyber security area AIG
should strengthen its institutional capacity in terms of strategic planning, financial and human resources. AIG has
emerged as a natural and strong leader of the cyber security agenda in Panama and the best prove of that AIG was
capable to take a lead on a preparation of the Policy document and was designated as a coordinator for its
implementation. As a coordinator of the Policy implementation process AIG should coordinate and ensure smooth
implementation of planned activities across near 20 public and private institutions. At the same time out of 36 tasks
established across the 6 pillars of the Policy AIG leads or co-leads 26 of them. On top of the great implementation
and coordination challenge AIG is in charge of many other day-to-day assignments in the area of cyber securityxxx
such as running of a CSIRT and cyber security awareness campaigns, organisation of national cyber exercise, etc.
There is no doubt however that implementation of the Policy will bring even more functions to AIG, for instance,
broader competences for CSIRT extending its competence to private sector, development and potential
implementation of data protection and CIIP frameworks, etc. Detailed assessment of the evolving situation,
potential implications and strategic planning (including mid and long term) in terms of administrational, financial
and human resources is essential for execution of assigned and foreseen functions.



4.4 Awareness and Capacity building

Awareness campaigns and capacity building programmes are not coordinated and usually represent stand-alone
initiatives most commonly were triggered by the cyber incidents which gain broader public attention. Pattern of
the cyber security incidents and experience of the ISPs proves that there is a room to improve the awareness of the
society as a whole in terms of the cyber security threats and vulnerabilities. Players from both private and public
sectors see the empowerment of the end user as an arising necessity.

Panama has signed the STOP.THINK.CONNECT messaging convention, in order to be able to carry out a harmonized
message shared by other OAS member states (United States, Canada, and Paraguay have also signed the
convention). The campaign is programmed to be launched in 3Q 2013, to address that gap and further activities
are foreseen by the Policy. International experience however suggests that better results could be achieved when
awareness and capacity building campaigns are systematically planned and coordinated. Such approach also
ensures that initiatives are targeting most relevant groups of the society / aspects and there is no overlap between
the initiatives. Better planning also provides opportunity to joint forces among different initiatives, institutions,
sectors, etc.

5. CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES

As a result of the ICT sector diagnosis, several challenges have been identified. Following is a brief summary of the
challenges along with opportunities that can help the country to fully realize the potential of the ICT sector,
grouped into four areas: (i) institutional, legal and regulatory environment; (ii) eTransformation; (iii) Cybersecurity;
and (iv) broadband connectivity in rural areas.



5.1 Institutional, legal and regulatory environment

Panama has achieved remarkable milestones on institutional empowerment. Likewise, it started procedures to
create legal and regulatory initiatives in several areas. However, there is still room for improvement to create a
more solid institutional, legal and regulatory framework. First, AIG is a very active institution with governmental
support that is in the position of leading the implementation of strong inter-institutional coordination mechanisms.
Second, While Panama took important steps on legislating on eGovernment, legislation on other areas like open
access, infrastructure sharing, spectrum management, personal data protection, childhood protection,
cybersecurity, open data, or eCommerce remain at an early stage. In addition, Panama could review the application
of its Universal Service Law to maximize the impact of its investment and to screen telecommunications services to
refine which would be taxed and to what extent. Last, telecommunications sector ex-post regulation could benefit
from an update, because the market changed notably since the creation of the current regulatory framework
twenty years ago.



5.2 eTransformation

While Panama achieved comparatively good assessments in eGovernment, it lags behind in ICT skills, while it is
just starting on Open Data. First, Panama ranks above most regional economies in the UN eGovernment index
measuring the delivery of online services. As a matter of fact, applying appropriately ICTs can have a positive
impact in competitiveness indices and rankings, because ICTs can be effective tools to increase productivity and
quality. Nevertheless, the use of ICTs could be expanded to the private sector to address the fact that about 20
percent of workers who can benefit more directly from Internet do not actually use it.

Second, ICT skills remain an issue in Panama as the lack of skilled manpower may be a binding constraint to realize
the potential of the ICT sector and to foster local innovation. The ITU Skills Index illustrates this lack of skills ranking
Panama far from the top countries in the region. To improve this aspect, Panama could adopt targeted skills
development and certification programs, which may include supporting university-industry. From its side, public
administration did some remarkable efforts implementing ad-hoc programs. Besides continuing building on these
programs, Panama could benefit of applying international best practices to those trainings.

Finally, despite the ICT sector growing even faster than the overall economy and the country leading the region on
ICT goods importing and exporting ratios, it lags behind as ICT services exporter. Given the amount of services
generated by the Canal and the financial sector, and taking into account the country’s great potential for Business

                                                            38
Process Outsourcing (BPO), governmental support in promoting a strong IT/ITES industry could attract foreign
investments and balance the relation between international trade of goods and services. Moreover, joining the
innovative international trend of governments opening their data could be an opportunity to stimulate
entrepreneurs to create business offering new ICT-based services (e.g. transports and logistics, or even eCustoms,
with adequate governmental action). These innovative services could process certain data made available by the
government to offer tailored information to citizens in a user-friendly presentation. Consequently, it would foment
the creation of jobs, because ICT professionals and citizens could leverage their skills to produce and consume new
services, and the government could know better the interests of their citizens by monitoring that emerging market
of ICT-based services.



5.3 Cybersecurity

Emerging cyber security situation and overall understanding of criticality of the ICT infrastructure to the functioning
of the key sectors of the economy has elevated the issue up on the political agenda. However it is of the utmost
importance to ensure the continuity of the initiatives launched by the Policy beyond the 2015 by, for instance,
establishment of the Policy review framework and procedures. Monitoring of the Policy implementation could be
enhanced through the introduction of the coordination and accountability mechanisms which are not embedded
into the current framework.

Legal cyber security framework in Panama is only starting to emerge however the pace of the development is
significant. And despite the great effort in terms of the setting up of national cyber security agenda, at the
moment of writing of this Note Panama is lacking legislative framework for cyber space in number of areas ,
among them the legal framework for personal data protection, protection of critical information infrastructure, etc.
Consistent review of the legal base as a whole would allow to identify more gaps and systematic planning of
adoption and (or) amendment of legislation base would allow Panama to establish a sound legislative framework
in that area.

Policy in a holistic cross sector way addresses a broad set of the cyber security challenges and numerous public
institutions are supposed to take a role in its implementation. In order to ensure sufficient level of engagement
and commitment to the Policy implementation it is crucial to build an awareness of that important role within
the participating institutions (on both technical and managerial levels).

So far the legal cyber security framework in Panama does not foresee CIIP related obligations for the public
institutions and (or) ISPs. During its mission WB noticed a broad agreement across public and private sectors on
the need for CIIP framework and endorsement for further implementation of CIIP action plan foreseen by the
Policy. AIG has an important opportunity to gain the momentum arising from that understanding and go ahead
with the development of the sound CIIP framework.

In order to secure the leadership, continuity and sustainability of the initiatives in the cyber security area AIG
should strengthen its institutional capacity (including CSIRT) in terms of strategic planning, financial and human
resources.


                                                          39
Awareness campaigns and capacity building programmes are not coordinated and usually represent stand-alone
initiatives. Better and more sustainable results could be achieved when awareness and capacity building campaigns
are systematically planned and coordinated.

Lack of the work force qualified in the area of cyber security was raised as a serious concern by interviewed ISPs
and public institutions running information systems and providing e-government services. To address this issue a
number of necessary actions have been documented in the National Cybersecurity Strategy, including the signing
and execution of cooperation agreement with the national technical university in order to encourage students to
op for security related careers, implement intern programs at the CSIRT and joint research and development
projects. It may be concluded therefore that system of high education in Panama is not addressing that gap
sufficiently. Policy document foresee certain measures in that regard, however implementation remains an issue
and may take time.



5.4 Broadband connectivity in remote areas

The lack of critical mass for broadband demand, infrastructure sharing regulation, and ad-hoc funds represents a
challenge for operators considering deploying broadband networks in remote areas. However, public works
could become an opportunity. Limited affordable broadband connectivity contributes poorly to reduce the
economic, social and demographic differences between urban and rural areas. The challenge remains on the
viability to expand across the countryside some of the excellent national average figures like affordability (fixed
broadband subscription is close to reach ITU’s objective on 1 percent of GNI per capita, and mobile broadband is
among the cheapest in the region), mobile broadband penetration (Panama is the regional leader), cell phone
penetration (one and a half numbers per inhabitant), or robust and steady internet connections (9 out 10).
Nonetheless, the fact that approximately 20 percent of rural population in the countryside lacks access to mobile
services impedes the development of mobile broadband as an alternative to rolling out fixed infrastructure in the
last mile.

In contrast, the government could leverage the following opportunities to designing policies enabling broadband
connectivity in remote areas: (i) 50 percent of incomes generated by the 700MHz spectrum band bid will be
dedicated to finance the Underground Burying Fund, which could be used as an incentive for joint infrastructure
deployment under an appropriate business model; (ii) major works being done for the construction of a subway in
Panama City could trigger common interests between electric, telecommunications, water and transport
companies, which could establish a precedent on infrastructure sharing susceptible of being expanded to rural
areas; (iii) a new entity will be created to manage common underground ducts; (iv) the underground burying cables
plan foresees a 24 million investment in government-owned civil infrastructure in the financial district; (v) the Rural
Electrification Office plans to expand its network to 200 towns more and there could be room for rolling out fiber
on their poles at an estimated cost could be 1 USD per pole; and (vi) a set of governmental initiatives to bring
computers and free internet access points to the country-side.




                                                          40
6. PROPOSED STRATEGIC DIRECTIONS

Given this analysis of challenges and opportunities, the Government could develop strategies around the following
areas: (i) institutional, legal and regulatory environment; (ii) eTransformation; (iii) cybersecurity; and (iv) broadband
connectivity in rural areas.



6.1 Institutional, legal and regulatory environment

The country could improve the institutional, legal and regulatory framework to strengthen oversight of the
sector to bring about change. Panama could reinforce the autonomy of the regulator and build capacity and
human capital. Then, if technical and substantive staff benefited from specialized training, they could contribute to
modernize regulation, to empower cybersecurity, and to better handle the disputes that they are currently
mediating or involved in. Updating the legal framework, as suggested in the SDA 2012-2014, would be particularly
effective for fostering open access, shared infrastructure, spectrum management, personal data protection,
childhood protection, cybersecurity, open data, and eCommerce. The process could include continuing to update
substantive regulations in conjunction with ASEP (interconnection, licensing, universal service obligation, tariffs,
spectrum, and scarce resources management) and internal procedures (dispute resolution, procedures for
investigating and resolving complaints, conducting public consultations, etc.) to give teeth to the new regulations.



6.2 eTransformation

Panama could reinforce policies aimed at improving government and private sector efficiency, skills and
transparency for national eTransformation. First, Panama could significantly increase cost savings by developing
cross-cutting infrastructure and procedures, notably establishing the standards and shared platforms for
interoperability of eGovernment services and facilitating the deployment of shared communications infrastructure.
Second, the country would need to raise the ICT skills level of their government officials, citizens and professional
enabling them to effectively use and design eTransformation services. Finally the Government could open public
data for the citizens and private sector to contribute to identify and alleviate problems they face.

The first component, developing cross-cutting infrastructure and procedures, would improve the delivery of
eServices, including eGovernment, eCommerce, content, eBanking, mBanking, and eSociety applications; which
would contribute to achieve SDA’s 2012-2014 goals like offering online half of the State’s services. The relatively
high positions in which Panama ranked in the last years in the UN eGovernment index (see Figure 34), should fuel
existing and new eTransformation initiatives like opening data to citizens and private sector for them to use it to
develop new commercial or community services. Transformational impact could be achieved by creating an
opportunity for citizens and businesses to interact with government without the need for a face-to-face contact,
instead using ICT. Significant cost savings are generally achieved by focusing on cross-cutting infrastructure, notably
establishing the standards and shared platforms for interoperability of eGovernment services, facilitating the
deployment of shared communications infrastructure, and digitization of government records.


                                                           41
The second component, raising the ICT skills level, would contribute to make available the other two components
to all citizens. Thus, Panama should promote developing ICT skills, jointly with content for inclusive software
(translations to indigenous languages, tailored accessible programs for different types of impaired people), to
expand the impact of its eGovernment and Open Data initiatives among all groups of citizens.

The third component, opening public data, could bring benefits from open data and open government initiatives in
terms of improving transparency, accountability and citizen participation. Panama could take advantage of creating
synergies between eGovernment initiatives and the increasing mass of ICT skilled government officials, citizens and
IT professionals, to implement policies related to open data and open government. Thus, engaging public sector,
private sector and civil society could trigger innovative solutions that help Government better serve citizens while
conceding public notoriety to local qualified IT professionals.



6.3 Cybersecurity

Potential actions could be grouped along the four strategic directions: (I) Policy and Legal Framework; (II)
Awareness and capacity building; (III) Institutional strengthening (including CSIRT); and (IV) CIIP. Taking into
account assessment of the current situation Panama may wish to consider the following actions across those areas:

(I) Policy and Legal Framework:

(a) To take steps to ensure the continuity of the initiatives launched by the Policy beyond the 2015 and to
strengthen the monitoring of the Policy implementation through respectively establishment of the Policy review
framework and procedures and introduction of the coordination and accountability mechanisms.

(b) In order to establish sound legislative framework in the area of cyber security, to set up and to perform the
profound review process of the national legal base aiming to identify the legal gaps and in coordination with other
public institutions to develop a plan of adoption and (or) amendment of legislation base, in line with SDA 2012-
2014’s goal of passing regulations to fight cybercrime complying with international standards.

(II) Awareness and capacity building:

(a) To develop an awareness and capacity building action plan coordinating efforts across public sector, building
partnerships and synergies with private sector. Action plan could ensure that initiatives are targeting the most
relevant groups of the society and (or) aspects and there is no overlap between the initiatives. Better planning
could provide opportunity to joint forces among different initiatives, institutions, sectors, etc.

(III) Institutional strengthening (including CSIRT):

(a) To perform detailed assessment of AIG (including CSIRT) the context of the evolving situation, potential
implications and strategic planning (including mid and long term) in terms of administrational, financial and human
resources is essential for execution of assigned and foreseen functions. As implementation of the Policy will bring
even more functions to AIG, for instance, broader competences for CSIRT extending its discretion to private sector,



                                                        42
development and potential implementation of data protection and critical information infrastructure protection
frameworks, etc., in line with SDA 2012-2014’s goal of internalizing CSIRT functions.

(IV) CIIP

(a) To take advantage of an agreement and broad endorsement across public and private sectors and to launch the
development of the sound CIIP framework.



6.4 Broadband connectivity in remote areas

The country could put in place policies to determine conditions for infrastructure sharing, so that joint efforts to
bring services to remote areas become more feasible. The Government could encourage operators from different
sectors to deploy joint infrastructure especially in remote or with less populated areas. Strengthening
infrastructure sharing could allow Panama to bridge the remaining geographic gaps in electricity, telephony and
broadband communications, especially in the last mile section to reach rural and indigenous communities. Joint
rollout of telecommunications infrastructure would lead to an increase in overall coverage, significant financial
savings and environmental benefits, with fewer sites required to ensure country-wide coverage. However, there is
little indication that the operators are working together to expand telecom infrastructure in remote areas.
Consequently, government policies could unblock the situation by designing common rules for sharing
infrastructure and by managing taxes and funds to help financing the last mile connection.

Besides promoting cooperation between operators, the Government could design a sustainable institutional and
economic model to manage shared infrastructure and joint network deployment. Moreover, a law could be passed
to enforce the construction of common ducts in the construction of new roads and underground excavations; and it
could be included in the Broadband Master Plan as well.

In this regard, the Government of Panama should evaluate the long term economic sustainability model and
managerial structure of RNI. If this project reached stability, it could be expanded to provide free basic internet to
the remaining share of citizens that cannot benefit yet from this public service. As a result, it would contribute to
reduce the gap between remote and urban communities, and to achieve SDA 2012-2014’s goal of making
broadband available to 95 percent of population and at a cost of B/.10.00 for 20MB in rural areas.


Box 8. InterAmerican Development Bank support (IADB) on broadband

In 2012, IADB started the Broadband development for competitiveness and integration project in collaboration with AIG.
This 2 year project, named Desarrollo de la Banda Ancha para la competitividad y la integración , project pursues increasing
broadband penetration, as well as global and regional integration. Moreover, the project is intended to set the basis for a
Broadband National Plan.



By implementing the above-mentioned policies, the Government of Panama should be able to improve the
landscape in the ICT sector and leverage it for a more inclusive and transparent economic growth.


                                                                    43
7. POSSIBLE WORLD BANK SUPPORT

Given the proposed strategic directions, Panama can leverage the World Bank regional and international
experience on the four identified areas: (i) institutional, legal and regulatory environment; (ii) eTransformation; (iii)
cybersecurity; and (iv) broadband connectivity in rural areas.



7.1 Institutional, legal and regulatory environment

The World Bank Group could assist the government with institutional strengthening, legal development and
regulatory reforms. Areas of potential Bank support include enabling policy, legal, and regulatory frameworks for
open access, shared infrastructure, spectrum management, personal data protection, childhood protection,
cybersecurity, open data and eCommerce. This support on ICT policy and regulatory reforms and new legislation
aimed at strengthening the telecommunications environment that has led to a well-functioning sector.

The World Bank has ample experience at helping governments around the world to design and implement ICT
policy and regulatory reforms. Hence, Panama could leverage the Bank’s experience in the region, as well as its role
as catalyst in convening other multilateral institutions, to fulfill the requirements of a comprehensive and certain
institutional, legal, and regulatory environment that will promote competition and innovation in the ICT sector.



7.2 eTransformation

In addition, the World Bank recommends a comprehensive eTransformation strategy emphasizing online
applications and cross-cutting ICT-based infrastructure and services. Thus, Panama could benefit from the Bank’s
experience and its international experts network to develop eGovernment solutions, ICT skills training and open
data programs.

The Bank has wide experience in eGovernment projects in countries like Argentina, Moldova, as well as in countries
from Africa and OECS (Organization of Eastern Caribbean States). A governance eTransformation project for
Panama could transform the delivery of selected public services using ICT. This project could include eLeadership
capacity, sharing infrastructure, and developing eServices through multiple channels, including government portals
and mobile phones. Indeed, this project could create opportunities for citizens and business to interact with
governmental institutions using ICT instead of face-to-face contact.

Moreover, regarding the necessary ICT skilled manpower to execute those changes, the Bank supports several
successful ICT skills development in different regions. Examples include IT skills assessment and IT industry capacity
building programs in Nigeria; Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) and Software Developer Certification (SDC)
programs in Kenya; and IT training programs in Mexico. As an example, the program in Mexico established a new
organization called MexicoFirstxxxi as part of a World Bank financed project aimed a development of the local IT
industry.


                                                           44
In addition, the World Bank designed an innovative methodology to perform an Open Data Readiness Assessment
to accordingly provide recommendations for conceiving an action plan to develop an open data initiative in a
constantly increasing number of countries across the globe. Among them, Russia, Ruanda, Antigua and Barbuda,
Burkina Faso, Tanzania and Peru embraced this initiative only during the first semester of 2013.



7.3 Cybersecurity

The Bank is well positioned to provide Panama with the access to the global expertise and knowledge in the area of
cyber security applying it to the specific case of Panama. The Bank is partnering with both international
organizations, governments, for instance, the Government of South Korea, which are recognized leaders in that
area and could leverage its broad network of international experts across the different regions of the world.

Taking that into account the Bank could assist Panama in implementation of the actions (steps) formulated per
strategic directions in the area of cyber security (See section 5.3 of this Note) in particular:

(I) Policy and Legal Framework:

(a) To assist in ensuring of the continuity of the initiatives launched by the Policy beyond the 2015 and
strengthening the monitoring of the Policy implementation through respectively development of both the Policy
review framework and procedures, and coordination and accountability mechanisms.

(b) To assist in setting up and carry on of the in depth review process of the national legal base of Panama aiming to
identify the legal gaps and in development of a plan of adoption and (or) amendment of the legal acts;

(c) To assist in drafting (amending, adjusting) of the legal acts identified while carrying on the process defined in (b);

(II) Awareness and capacity building:

(a) To assist in development of an awareness and capacity building action plan coordinating efforts across public
sector, building partnerships and synergies with private sector. As part of that work, assistance in identifying the
initiatives, focusing then on most relevant groups of the society and (or) aspects of cyber security and identifying
the opportunities to joint forces among different initiatives, institutions, sectors, etc.

(III) Institutional strengthening (including CSIRT):

(a) To perform detailed assessment of the AIG (including CSIRT) in the context of the evolving situation, potential
implications and strategic planning (including mid and long term) in terms of administrational, financial and human
resources.

(IV) CIIP

work, the Bank would provide assistance in development of CIIP governance model, CII identification methodology,
principles, guidelines and coordination for public CII.



7.4 Broadband connectivity in remote areas

Equally important, Panama could take advantage of the Bank’s experience in the design and implementation of
broadband connectivity infrastructure. It could complement IADB projects on reinforcing the network backbone
with a project to make broadband accessible to rural and indigenous communities. Thus, a new project could
promote cross-sectorial infrastructure sharing by setting equitable conditions through specific regulation and by
designing the role and business model of the body in charge of managing the commons assets.

Based on its PPP experiences in the region and other parts of the world, the Bank can provide assistance to the
government for maximizing the impact and sustainability of public free internet services and infrastructure sharing
models. Thus, in order to target investments more efficiently and to ensure continuity in time, the project could
outline Terms of Reference and business plan for each initiative, as well as empower the institutions in charge of
managing them.

Another area where the Bank’s experience could be of help is the licensing the 700 MHz spectrum for the
deployment of 4G and LTE services in the country. This would allow government of Panama to respond to rapid
increase in the provision of mobile services and the introduction of new broadband wireless technologies, which
has greatly increased the demand for spectrum.

Box 9. Exploiting WB’s network of peers and experts

Due to its constant dialogue with governments across the globe, the Bank can serve as platform to establish international
bilateral collaboration. The Bank offers its support to continue catalyzing the exchange of best practices started during the
identification mission hold in Panama on May 2013. Indeed, experiences on a remote areas connectivity project that the Bank
carries out in Nicaragua could be of interest to Panamanian authorities. In the opposite direction, successful governmental
institution experiences on cloud computing management and sustainability could be shared with Nicaraguan authorities.
