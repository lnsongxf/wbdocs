Preface
Many clinical interventions for maternal and child health have been rigorously
evaluated in the laboratory or in efficacy trials of proof of concept under carefully
controlled conditions; there is a strong evidence base on what protocols and
procedures work biomedically. Yet utilization and provision of these measures is still
low, perhaps because there is less evidence on how to implement these interventions
in routine, nonclinical contexts. A systematic review can remedy this problem both by
synthesizing the available information to try to identify generalizable lessons and by
identifying key knowledge gaps (White and Waddington 2012; Mallett and others
2012).

As a rigorous methodological approach, systematic reviews exclude evidence unless it
meets explicit quality criteria. This systematic review by the Independent Evaluation
Group (IEG) uses evidence from rigorous impact evaluations to provide a thorough
assessment of attributable improvements in maternal and child mortality outcomes
from across the entire range of contexts and intervention types. By doing so, it
promotes a deeper understanding of the barriers to progress as well as the
effectiveness of different interventions in order to generate key lessons, guide policy
decisions, and orient future research. This synthesis of research-derived evidence can
be a tool to advance progress in these critical areas.

Although the strength of impact evaluations is their internal validity, or being able to
make unbiased causal claims on the attribution of outcomes to a specific intervention,
challenges of external validity confront every type of evaluation and synthesis when
applying lessons from one specific context to a different place, time, or scale. Though
the degree of generalizability of a study is never 100 percent, neither is it zero. The
transferability of impact evaluation lessons is a function of similarity to the target
context and means of implementation. Unfortunately, most impact evaluations,
having spent much effort in establishing internal validity, provide few details on the
contextual factors leading to observed outcomes—details that would help policy
makers seeking to apply the best evidence to their own local cases. Despite being
limited to the details offered in the individual studies, this review attempts to give
some sense of context to aid in the judicious application of lessons learned to other
environments.

Before establishing the research questions of this systematic review, the IEG team
checked 61 existing systematic reviews on some aspect of maternal and child health in
developing countries. Half of these reviews included causal attribution to both impact
evaluations (experimental and quasi-experimental) and less robust quantitative and


                                                                                       ix

qualitative methods. Many reviews lacked a method of measuring the quality of the
included evidence. Nearly all analyzed the effectiveness of one type of intervention
across specific outcomes; only two compared the effects of a range of interventions on
a single mortality outcome. This activity underscored the importance of avoiding the
use of low-quality evidence and inspired this review’s outcome-oriented approach.

This systematic review is special in two ways. First, where most systematic reviews
are intervention oriented in that they look at the range of outcomes produced by a
narrowly defined set of interventions, this review is outcome oriented. Included
evaluations cover any intervention within or outside of the health sector that
examines the effect on the selected maternal and child health (MCH) outcomes. In this
complex intervention and outcome space, where interventions and outcomes are
connected by dense and often unknown causal pathways, this framework allows
policy makers to explore the entire palette of options which may improve maternal or
child mortality.

Second, to understand what is actually known about causal impacts of interventions
on maternal and child mortality, this review is highly discriminating in the quality of
evidence it includes. The reviewed evidence comes exclusively from impact
evaluations that used experimental or quasi-experimental methods with a well-
defined counterfactual and that credibly established the internal validity of causal
claims of intervention impact.

Intervention impact is defined here as the difference in mortality (or skilled birth
attendance) outcomes between a treatment group that receives the intervention and a
statistically comparable control group that does not (the counterfactual). Impact
evaluations are a relatively new form of evidence designed to overcome many of the
confounding factors which limit the claims of causal attribution of other evaluation
methods. The purpose of reviewing impact evaluation evidence in this systematic
review is not to supplant existing evidence and received wisdom, but rather to
understand how impact evaluation evidence corresponds to current strategic beliefs
and the existing evidence undergirding current policy making for reducing maternal
and child mortality, and to add value by underscoring areas where causal attribution
of programs is beginning to be better understood.

With this review IEG aims to aid the World Bank and other practitioners in reaching
the Millennium Development Goals in maternal and child mortality by pointing to
promising interventions, raising a cautionary voice where evidence falters, and
highlighting gaps in knowledge meriting further investigation with impact evaluation
evidence developed within and beyond the World Bank. By addressing distal factors
affecting maternal and child mortality—such as education, governance, economic,
and environmental factors—this review complements both the evidence from health-

specific and biomedical reviews such as the Lancet series on maternal and child health
and complement other evidence on project performance to strengthen evaluation,
both within and outside IEG.

Overview

Delivering the Millennium Development
Goals to Reduce Maternal and Child
Mortality
Improved outcomes for women and children—more education, lower fertility rates, higher
nutritional status, and lower incidence of illness, among other outcomes—have broad individual,
family, and societal benefits. For nearly 15 years, the targets of the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs) have been a bellwether for progress, particularly for maternal and child health
(MCH)—a two-thirds reduction in under-five mortality in MDG 4 and a three-quarters
reduction in the maternal mortality ratio in MDG 5. After more than a decade of effort, these
goals have proved difficult to attain and are unlikely to be achieved by 2015.

Interventions that may improve maternal and child health are numerous and spread across many
development sectors. Even when such interventions are known to be effective in controlled
conditions, however, questions remain about implementation, delivery, and uptake. This review
gathers impact evaluation evidence of fielded interventions that aim to improve skilled birth
attendance and reduce maternal and child mortality rates. To aid policy makers, it reviews
effectiveness evidence from multiple sectors on the distal causes of maternal and child mortality,
complementing the body of effectiveness evidence from reviews specific to the health sector
(such as the Lancet series on maternal and child health) that focus on proximate interventions for
intermediate outcomes.

This systematic review by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) is a learning exercise that
looks beyond World Bank experience. In doing so, it draws on impact evaluations other than
those conducted by the Bank or on Bank projects. It is intended to be used a reference for
practitioners in the Bank and elsewhere with an interest in interventions that have demonstrated
attributable improvements in skilled birth attendance and reductions in maternal and child
mortality. This review also identifies important gaps in the impact evaluation evidence for
interventions that may be effective in reducing maternal and child mortality but whose impacts
have not yet been tested using robust impact evaluation methods.

Box 2. Criteria for Ratings of Study Quality
Impact evaluation strategies are often grouped into two families, each with multiple members.
Experimental includes randomized control trials, and quasi-experimental includes differences (second order
or higher), regression discontinuity, instrumental variables, or matching techniques.
The search process identified 95 studies that qualified as impact evaluations of field interventions from
developing countries with estimates of impacts on skilled birth attendance or maternal or child mortality.
These were subjected to a quality review to assess risk of bias. The process was based largely on strength
of the internal validity of the study’s identification strategy, that is, the degree of confidence that the
reported impact estimates are unbiased and consistent, such that they establish a credible counterfactual.
The quality review criteria were based on previous impact evaluation work by the Independent
Evaluation Group (IEG 2012) and over the following dimensions of internal validity:
       Establishment of identifying assumptions of the employed estimation strategy
       Alternative methods giving the same result
       Robustness checks to alternative specifications
       Representative sampling strategy
       Freedom from data generating and collection challenges
       Sufficient power and time to detect results.
Elements of construct validity (particularly with respect to mortality measurements) and external validity
(for example, having a representative sample of policy interest) were also taken into account. Impact
evaluations were rated AAA if all or nearly all of the criteria were met, the critical assumptions of the
identification strategy were well-established, and there were few if any remaining threats to internal
validity. Evaluations rated were AA if most but not all criteria were met and there were no serious
concerns with the identification strategy, although some may remain untested or unclear. Because impact
evaluations with an A rating retained major concerns with the validity of the identifying assumptions,
they are not used in the analysis of this systematic review.

The search exercises produced more than                 of the authors given the available data,

Box 3. Evidence for Large Global Strategies Is Thin and Mixed
Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses
   The Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI) program has been implemented in more
   than 100 countries, yet impact evaluation evidence of IMCI effects is both thin (only two studies
   included in the review) and mixed.[2,9] An AAA study on an IMCI program in India found significantly
   reduced early neonatal mortality and infant mortality in home births and no effect on facility births.
   No impact was found on under-five mortality from an AA quality study in Bangladesh.
Safe Motherhood Programs
   Though evaluations of safe motherhood programs (SMPs) in China and Indonesia found positive
   impacts on increasing skilled birth attendance, results were mixed for mortality outcomes.[23,4] In
   China, the program reduced maternal mortality through complementary and reinforcing strategies to
   promote skilled birth attendance. The program in Indonesia, which placed strong emphasis on
   community-based care, did not have evidence of effects on maternal mortality or neonatal mortality,
   although it did have a one-third decrease in child mortality and marginally significant effects on infant
   mortality.
Demand-Side Financing
   Conditional cash transfers (CCTs), vouchers, and other financial incentives significantly increased SBA
   in both low- and middle-income countries.[7,16,39,46,51,53,55,62] Only one AAA study of a conditional cash
   transfer included infant mortality as an outcome, finding a significant reduction from Mexico’s
   Progresa.[6] No impact evaluations of demand financing interventions demonstrated a significant effect
   on maternal or neonatal mortality or even included under-five mortality as an outcome.
Increasing the Proportion of Births Attended
   Although it is the main indicator for MDG 5, there is no evidence that solely “improving the
   proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel” improves mortality outcomes. Neonatal
   mortality was not significantly affected in India, as reported by an AAA and AA study. [46,39] The AA
   study also found no difference for maternal mortality outcomes, although statistical power may have
   been an issue. Still, combining skilled birth attendance interventions with quality and access elements can
   improve mortality outcomes.

do not, in themselves, constitute a strategy for
reducing maternal and child mortality. Rather,
this review is intended to be a key input to

encouraged to use these findings as a starting
point in exploring appropriate strategies.
Decisions to adopt a given recommendation
should be done with careful examination of
contextual similarities of the target area to
those impact evaluations reported here, to
encourage solutions that are technically
correct, politically supportable, and
administratively feasible.

1. Introduction: Background and Approach
Global Trends in Maternal and Child Health
1.1     Improved outcomes for women and children—more education, lower fertility
rates, higher nutritional status, and lower incidence of illness, among others—have
broad individual, family, and societal benefits (World Bank 2011). Although the
evidence is thin on the causal relationship from maternal and child health (MCH) to
growth or poverty reduction,1 it is robust in establishing the intrinsic importance of
general health to the individual and its instrumental importance as an input into the
accumulation of human capital—which in turn is a determining factor of economic
growth (WHO 2002). Several studies point to a strong correlation between health
and poverty, although the direction of causality is uncertain (Strauss and Thomas
1998; Bloom and Canning 2000; WHO 2001; Gallup and Sachs 2001; Sachs and
Malaney 2002; Madsen 2012). There is also evidence of a health-related poverty trap
(Gallup and Sachs 2001; Bonds and others 2010).[13]

1.2    Despite the lack of good studies on the existence of a potential causal
(instrumental) link between MCH and household or national wealth, maternal and
child health is intrinsically valuable not only to mothers and children but also to the
broader global community, as is evident from its prominent placement in the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Adopted in 2000, the MDGs aim to
achieve specific goals of human welfare in developing countries by the year 2015.
MDG 4 calls for a reduction in the under-five mortality rate by two-thirds between
1990 and 2015. MDG 5 calls for a reduction in the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) by
three-quarters between 1990 and 2015 and for universal access to reproductive
health care by 2015. Progress on MDGs 4 and 5 is closely coupled: improving
maternal health leads to reductions in deaths among newborns and young children.

1.3     Although improvement on some of the MDGs, such as poverty reduction
(MDG 1) and expanding access to water and sanitation (MDG 7), has been
significant, advances in the MDGs for maternal and child health have been far more
modest despite the increased efforts of developing countries and the international
development community (see figure 1.1).2

1.4    There are challenges in improving health services across the continuum from
pre-pregnancy through pregnancy, childbirth, the postnatal period, and into
childhood (PMNCH 2010). Factors influencing maternal and child health are broad
and complex, extending beyond the health sector to other sectors as well, including
energy, water and sanitation, and education. Understanding areas of success, their
determinants, and the constraints to more rapid progress is an important goal of the
international development community and of the World Bank.

1.5    To this end, this systematic review by the Independent Evaluation Group is a
learning exercise that looks beyond World Bank experience. In doing so, it draws on
impact evaluations other than those conducted by the Bank or on Bank projects. It is
intended to be used a reference for practitioners in the Bank and elsewhere with an
interest in interventions that have demonstrated attributable improvements in
skilled birth attendance (SBA) and reductions in maternal and child mortality. This
review also identifies important gaps in the impact evaluation (IE) evidence for
interventions that may be effective but whose impacts have not yet been tested
using robust impact evaluation methods. Finally, it is intended to complement other
evidence on project performance.3

CURRENT PROGRESS IN MATERNAL HEALTH
1.6    A recently released report from the World Health Organization (WHO),
United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Population Fund
(UNFPA), and the World Bank presents an updated look at global maternal
mortality rates (MMRs) from 1990 to 2010. Worldwide, maternal deaths have
decreased by 47 percent over this period, from 543,000 in 1990 to 287,000 in 2010.
Though impressive, this falls well short of the MDG target of a 75 percent reduction,
and substantial regional variation remains. Every MDG region has experienced a
decline in maternal deaths (WHO 2012), but the MMR remained 15 times higher in
developing regions than in developed regions.

1.7    Despite substantial decreases over the past two decades in Sub-Saharan
Africa and South Asia, these two regions still accounted, respectively, for 56 percent
and 29 percent of global maternal deaths in 2010. Of the 40 countries classified as
having a high MMR (≥300 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births), only four are
outside of Sub-Saharan Africa. The region also experienced 91 percent of worldwide
maternal deaths attributable to HIV/AIDs. Although the expansion of antiretroviral
therapy has contributed to a recent decline in MMR in several Sub-Saharan Africa
countries, regional progress is still negligible (for example, South Africa and
Zimbabwe) or insufficient (for example, Zambia and Kenya) to reach MDG targets.
Worldwide, among countries with 1990 maternal mortality rates labeled as
moderate or worse (≥100 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births), only nine
countries are “on track” to reach the MDGs, 50 countries are “making progress,” and
25 have made “insufficient” or “no progress” (WHO and others 2012).

1.8    The major causes of maternal mortality in developing countries are
hypertension and heavy bleeding after childbirth, which are responsible for 18
percent and 35 percent and of obstetric deaths, respectively. In combination with
infections, obstructed labor, and unsafe abortions, these five complications account
for 80 percent of maternal deaths. Indirect causes, including malaria and HIV/AIDS,
make up the remaining 20 percent (WHO 2012). The WHO asserts that most of these
deaths can be prevented with adequate equipment, drugs, and medicines and if the
woman receives the appropriate interventions from a skilled health provider
(PMNCH 2010).

1.9    Birth attendance by skilled health providers has been designated an
intermediate MDG, as it is believed to reduce maternal mortality. The proportion of
deliveries in developing regions attended by skilled health personnel increased from
53 percent in 1990 to 63 percent in 2008 (UN 2012). However, progress is still
insufficient to achieve MDG 5. The average annual decline in the MMR was 2.3


                                                                                     3

INTRODUCTION: BACKGROUND AND APPROACH

percent between 1990 and 2008, less than half of the 5.5 percent per year average
required to meet the goal.

1.10 Fertility patterns also affect MCH outcomes. Pregnancies that carry a high
risk (those that are closely spaced or occur at very young or older ages) can be
averted through contraception (World Bank 2010). Across the developing world,
women are having fewer children, although adolescent fertility remains relatively
high. Contraceptive use has increased, but its perpetuation will require a sustained
effort as the number of women entering reproductive age continues to grow
(PMNCH 2010).

CURRENT PROGRESS IN CHILD HEALTH
1.11 As with maternal deaths, progress has been made in reducing child deaths,
but much work is still to be done. Globally, the mortality rate for children under-five
has declined by 41 percent, from 87 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 51 in 2011
(IGME 2012). The infant mortality rate (deaths within the first year of life) dropped
from 61 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 37 in 2011, and the neonatal mortality
rate (deaths within the first 28 days) also dropped from 32 deaths per 1,000 live
births in 1990 to 22 in 2011 (IGME 201). However, under-five mortality continues to
be high in Sub-Saharan Africa, where one child in nine (109 deaths per 1,000 live
births) died before the age of five in 2011. South Asia has the second highest rate,
with 62 deaths per 1,000 live births. Similarly, neonatal mortality continues to be
high in these two regions (34 and 32 deaths per 1,000 live births, respectively).

1.12 Increasing evidence suggests that the MDG target can be reached only if
substantial and accelerated action is taken to eliminate the leading killers of children
(UN 2011): pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria, which accounted for 43 percent of
under-five deaths in 2008. Children under age five are the most vulnerable to
malaria, and approximately one in every six child deaths in Africa is due to malaria.
In countries where access to malaria control interventions has improved most
significantly, overall child mortality rates have fallen by approximately 20 percent.
Other major areas of concern are malnutrition, which contributes to one-third of
under-five deaths, and neonatal mortality. The proportion of under-five deaths
occurring during the neonatal period is increasing even as under-five mortality
declines (IGME 2011). This trend is intimately connected to maternal health; a third
of stillborn deaths in developing countries occur during birth, mainly due to
maternal conditions such as hypertension and obstructed labor but also partly
reflecting poor quality of care and management (PMNCH 2010).

                                                  INTRODUCTION: BACKGROUND AND APPROACH

Pathways of Interventions on Reducing Maternal and Child Mortality
1.13 Rather than focusing on clinical interventions, this review looks at the role of
governments, health and other sectors, communities, and households in population-
wide strategies to improve health service access and affordability, care-seeking
behavior, and healthy practices. Effective clinical interventions that reduce the main
causes of maternal and child mortality are generally known by the global health
community (for example, emergency obstetric care, immunization, or nutrient
supplementation). The current challenge is in implementation and scale-up, and to
that end, this review examines evidence of scaled, field-tested examples of these
interventions.

1.14 To aid policy makers who are seeking to reduce child or maternal mortality,
this review takes an outcome-oriented approach, focusing on the ultimate outcomes
of the MDGs: maternal and child mortality. Specifically, the review focuses on the
outcomes of skilled birth attendance, maternal mortality, neonatal mortality, infant
mortality, and under-five mortality (see box 1.1). Anchoring the review on the
ultimate outcomes of mortality rather than on intermediate outcomes of morbidity
or care-seeking behavior allows it to report on interventions for which there is direct
evidence of an effect on mortality. Intermediate outcomes still rely on theories of
change and correlations rather than causal evidence to make inferences on their
relationship to ultimate outcomes. This report will show that, in the case of the
intermediate indicator for MDG 5 of “the proportion of births attended by skilled
health personnel,” such inferences can be problematic.

1.15 By explicitly recognizing the multisectoral nature of maternal and child
health, this review aims to collect all impact evaluations that include MCH
indicators, regardless of the type or sector of intervention that produced them. This
approach also facilitates policy makers’ use of complementary evidence from health-
specific clinical reviews. This is in contrast to the intervention-oriented approach of
most existing systematic reviews, which examine the effects of a single intervention
type. Accordingly, this review aims to answer the following questions:

      What do we know about the attributable effects of available interventions on
       reducing maternal and child mortality and increasing skilled birth
       attendance?
      What do we know about the effects of increasing the number of births
       attended by skilled health personnel specifically, as indicated by MDG 5, and
       skilled birth attendance generally on maternal and child mortality and
       intermediate morbidity and health outcomes at the local or national level?



                                                                                      5

might affect the selected outcomes of interest (see Box   Infant mortality (0–12 months)
1.1). The intervention areas outlined in Figure 1.2       Under-five mortality (0–59 months)
present a taxonomy of intervention categories. The
structure of this taxonomy was developed from a review of World Bank and WHO
literature on MCH and was refined while gathering MCH-related impact
evaluations and consulting with Human Development Network representatives and
health economists during the planning stage.

1.17 Maternal and child mortality is described as a function of two complex sets of
causes. The first comprises proximate factors that have a direct effect on the
probability of dying (Mosley and Chen 1984).4 The second is a set of underlying
causes of mortality (poverty, low levels of education, poor water and sanitation) that
affect the proximate factors. This second set increases the likelihood of death by
limiting awareness of and access to health care and basic services, social networks
and coping strategies, and adequate nutrition. As a result of the quantity and
complexity of these two sets of factors, policies can impact health outcomes through
various pathways. Figure 1.2 outlines the conceptual links between the intervention
families included in this review and maternal and child mortality. Appendix D is an
extended discussion of the conceptual model.

1.18 As indicated in figure 1.2, interventions that aim to increase the demand of
health care and enhance health practices can be grouped into three primary
domains: governance (public policies and actions), provision, and utilization.
Governance is important because effective coverage and integration of maternal-
and child-care services require better policies and institutions. Through good
governance, sufficient resources are allocated to maintain a functioning health
service delivery system and to create appropriate legal frameworks and monitoring
systems. Therefore, this category has six intervention types that address the
stewardship roles of government and formal and informal oversight bodies at every
level from national to community, such as strategy planning and public financial
management.

1.19 The provision of services is deemed essential in reducing maternal and child
mortality. This category is grouped into three subcategories: donor support, the
health sector, and other sectors. Following the WHO (2007) convention, the health
sector is defined as the health system’s “building blocks”—service delivery, health
workforce, health information system, medical products and technologies, and
health financing. Health sector interventions are ones that aim to improve these
areas. They represent the bulk of health systems actions from the supply-side
(Graham and others 2006). Other sectors include education, energy, labor market,
agriculture, transportation infrastructure, and water and sanitation. The
differentiation between the health sector and the other sectors is based on where the
primary responsibility for an intervention lies. Dividing the interventions in such a
way is not meant to imply that other sectors are or should be outside of the influence
of health policy; health policy would likely benefit from greater involvement in
other sectors such as water and sanitation.5

1.20 The utilization category describes interventions designed to directly affect
actions taken by households as producers of health in terms of health practices and
lifestyles and as users of health services; the category is similar to the concept of
“health demand” elsewhere but without the implicit existence of a market. These
interventions play a unique role in perceiving risks and signs of disease, an essential
aspect of successful maternal and child health interventions. Moreover, households
and individuals are recipients of information and knowledge on health practices.
Ideally, increasing knowledge will translate into a change in behavior, although this
is not always the case. Consequently, an important aspect to influence mortality
outcomes is to identify the channels through which knowledge and information
translate into behavior change for both individuals and communities. An additional
element of utilization interventions is overcoming barriers to good health and access
to necessary care, whether financial, geographical, or cultural. Health education,
health insurance, and other financial incentives can be effective instruments to attain
financial protection and increase health outcomes.

1.21 Definitions and examples of individual interventions are given in Appendix
A. This taxonomy was used to classify all of the interventions found in the studies
included in this review and is used to frame the data analysis and discussion. Each
intervention could be classified in no more than three categories.


Maternal and Child Health Strategies at the World Bank
1.22 The World Bank’s strategy to reduce maternal and child mortality is implied
by the 2007 Strategy and the Reproductive Health Action Plan 2010–15, which

contains elements that lend themselves to supporting certain actions. Furthermore,
the Bank has published two strategies specific to MDGs 4 and 5 to improve maternal
and child health (see table 1.1.).

   These strategies line up with this report’s taxonomy categories of Governance; the
   health sector broadly—especially service delivery, health workforce, and health
   financing; and household ability to pay from the utilization family of
   interventions.


Box 1.2. Overview of World Bank Activities in Maternal and Child Mortality


To understand where the World Bank and its clients are concentrating support for maternal
and child health, IEG conducted a portfolio check of World Bank activities. A universe of
health projects was constructed using the database of World Bank project information. All
projects that were approved between FY03 and FY12 with the following sector or theme
codes selected:

INTRODUCTION: BACKGROUND AND APPROACH


This database was merged with an unpublished dataset of activities of the World Bank’s
Health, Nutrition, and Poverty (HNP) department in Maternal Mortality, Under Five
Mortality, Child Mortality, and Antenatal Care and Child Delivery Services. These projects,
excluding supplemental financing, were subsequently coded against the definitions of the
interventions in Appendix A.
Project Appraisal Documents and program documents identified by the HNP database as
Antenatal Care and Child Delivery Services were re-screened and coded specifically to
Skilled Birth Attendance as appropriate.
The projects with health coding from the Poverty Reduction and Economic Management
(PREM) Network, the Social Protection (SP) Sector Board, and water, energy and mining,
and social development projects within the Sustainable Development Network (SDN) were
coded as these, combined with HNP, were the sectors to which the vast majority of the
available impact evaluations included in the review pertained. The Project Appraisal
Documents and program documents were first screened for MCH involvement in both
project components for investment loans and prior actions for development policy loans.
Those with MCH involvement were also coded following the above protocol.
As seen in the table below, the portfolio review yielded 109 projects over the last 10 years in
HNP, PREM, SP, and the included sectors from SDN that seek to address at least one of the
outcomes of interest (MCH mortality or SBA), with 77 in HNP, 31 in PREM and SP
combined, and only 1 from the selected SDN sectors (in social development). Not
surprisingly, given the networks from which the data are drawn, these projects are
concentrated in the governance and health sectors.
An extended classification of World Bank maternal and child health activities is in Appendix
I.

Search Strategy
1.23 The data for this review originate from completed studies with findings on
the selected MCH outcomes. One study might include more than one impact
evaluation if it evaluates multiple interventions (most often through multiple
treatment arms). Included studies were identified through a detailed search strategy

that built on existing systematic review search frameworks consisting of electronic
database searches, screening and hand searches, and literature snowballing. Round
A served as the primary search period and included a pilot test of the electronic
database search to refine the search terms used, whereas rounds B and C served as
comprehensiveness checks. Table 1.2 identifies the resources consulted for each
round; Appendix B includes a more detailed description of the search process for
each source.

1.24 The search strategy included three rounds of data collection during which the
team reviewed more than 7,000 search results. These were winnowed to 445 studies
following a title and abstract review. These 445 studies were reduced to 95 following
a brief full text review to confirm that they qualified for the systematic review. The
selection criteria applied to these studies during the full-text review are in box 3.1.

1.25 The application of the selection criteria yielded 95 impact evaluations; of
those, 62 studies met the minimum quality criteria for inclusion in the analysis of
IEG’s review. A coding instrument with more than 300 fields was developed to
record information about the intervention program, findings, data, external validity,
cost analysis, and heterogeneous effects (see Appendix C). Figure 1.3 shows a flow
diagram of the search and sifting process.


Box 1.3. Selection Criteria for Study Inclusion
During the three search rounds and initial text review, a set of selection criteria were
applied to the titles, abstracts, and texts to generate a list of potential studies for inclusion in
the analysis of the review.
Study design: Studies that evaluate interventions based on a quantitative experimental or
quasi-experimental impact evaluation design with a well-defined counterfactual were
included. Accepted designs include randomized experiments, double or triple differences,
matching, instrumental variables, or regression discontinuity design.
Location: Studies of interventions that occur in a low-income or middle-income country,



                                                                                                    11
CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION: BACKGROUND AND APPROACH

based on World Bank classifications, were selected.
Language: The search focused on studies in English, although studies in Spanish, French, and
Portuguese were included.
Publication date: Studies concluded since January 1, 1995, were included.
Unit of analysis: Studies that use aggregated national or regional data, as in cross-country or
national interrupted time series analyses with few observations over multiple periods, were
excluded.
Peer review: Impact evaluations subjected to peer review (for example, published in a quality
journal or a book) or that are in the process of soliciting review from the research
community (that is, “grey literature” of informally published impact evaluations such as
working papers or papers presented in conferences) were included if publicly available.
Nonclinical interventions: The review includes effectiveness studies but excludes efficacy
studies as they are often too controlled to be generalizable. This follows the classification of
studies in the World Bank’s handbook Impact Evaluation in Practice (Gertler and others 2011),
which describes efficacy studies as being tightly controlled experiments in very specific
circumstances with heavy technical involvement from the researcher; effectiveness studies,
on the other hand, give results of interventions implemented in the field under normal
circumstances.


1.26 Impact evaluations were given quality ratings largely determined by the
strength of the evaluation’s internal validity: the level of accuracy and reliability of its
estimates of program effectiveness. Accuracy refers to having the point estimate
“correct” and unbiased from all potentially confounding factors; reliability
(alternately called consistency) is the notion that the variance caused by random error
of unbiased estimates is small, such that random error is not drastically affecting the
point estimate. To convincingly achieve high levels of internal validity, impact
evaluations use a counterfactual to compare observed outcomes of the treatment
group against what would have happened in the absence of the program. Several
impact evaluation designs exist to establish a counterfactual, each with its own set of
critical identifying assumptions. Impact evaluations are usually divided into two
families with several members: Experimental designs include randomized control
trials (RCTs) and their variants, whereas quasi-experimental designs include
differencing techniques, regression discontinuity, instrumental variables, and
matching.6 Natural experiments could also be included in principle, subject to the
credibility of the counterfactual employed. The review found none that met the other
selection criteria for this review. More discussion of impact evaluation methods and
challenges in implementation generally as well as for MCH-related issues specifically
is presented in the Impact Evaluation Toolkit from the Health Nutrition and
Population sector of the World Bank.7

1.27 Assessment of quality was determined by criteria established prior to the
review and based on previous IEG work (IEG 2012) to judge risk of bias in the effect
estimates. Foremost among these is the degree to which impact evaluations
established the fact that their identifying assumptions, or conditions under which the
estimation method is valid, were met. Existence and strength of robustness checks
were likewise assayed. Finally, serious issues were considered regarding data
collection, statistical power, external validity of sampling, and construct validity of the
outcomes (which is especially important with outcomes that are prone to
measurement error such as maternal mortality). Following these criteria, impact
evaluations were graded AAA if all or nearly all of the criteria were met, the critical
assumptions of the identification strategy were well-established, and few if any



                                                                                        13

INTRODUCTION: BACKGROUND AND APPROACH

threats to internal validity remain. IEG rated evaluations AA if most but not all
criteria were met and there were no serious concerns with the identification strategy,
although some may remain untested or unclear. Impact evaluations for which major
concerns remained with the validity of the identifying assumptions were rated A.

1.28 Because the reliability of policy implications hinges in large part on the
reliability of the internal validity of the evidence, this systematic review reports
quality ratings of the studies used throughout. In application, AAA connotes
established causality of the impact estimates, whereas those with an AA rating
connote that causal claims are likely if not incontrovertible. Although the external
validity of these studies depends on similarity to the target context, the causal
attribution is established. Evaluations graded A leave doubt as to the causal claims
of their reported associations, often in spite of the best efforts of the authors, given
the available data. Although these may yet be more reliable than other types of
evaluation (for example, multivariate regression or single differencing), they are not
used in the analysis of the systematic review, although they are listed in Appendix G
for reference purposes. Only the 68 impact evaluations rated AAA and AA were
deemed sufficiently high in quality to be included in this analysis.

DATA DESCRIPTION
1.29 The 68 AAA and AA impact evaluations included in this review cover all the
report’s defined outcomes of interest and 18 of the 27 established intervention types.
The World Bank was involved in 18 of the included evaluations, of which 9 had a
World Bank author or coauthor, and 15 were of World Bank projects or projects
supported by World Bank financing (see Appendix F). As seen in figure 1.4, all of
the world’s regions except the Middle East and North Africa are represented,
although there is just one impact evaluation on maternal and child mortality for
Europe and Central Asia.

METHOD OF ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS
1.30 The analysis of this report focuses on the AAA impact evaluations―those for
which the internal validity of the study is very reliable. Evidence from AA studies is
used to supplement those findings, but a distinction between the studies is always
drawn.

1.31 Even where there is coverage of impact evaluations over intervention types, it
is thin, and the evaluations are too dissimilar to allow for a credible meta-analysis:
Outcomes may differ in their units of analysis, projects may yet have different
elements, or context may be vastly different. Rather, IEG examines patterns of
significance for clusters of interventions within each outcome. This review reports
findings in which all or nearly all of the AAA impact evaluations within an
intervention family report statistically significant impacts on a given outcome.

1.32 Importantly, an AAA impact evaluation does not imply a high-impact
intervention. Similarly, a statistically significant impact does not necessarily connote
a large impact. The review notes those instances where an intervention has a rather
modest (or large) magnitude of the impact estimate. Moreover, standardized effect
sizes are presented graphically by outcome for all AAA impact evaluations in
Appendix J, allowing inspection of the magnitude of point estimates and standard
errors.

1.33 Because of the potential for bias of the field of studies included in the review
(see box 1.4), this report focuses on what seem to be promising avenues of
intervention, rather than calling attention to potential dead ends. IEG thus reports on
“what works,” based on the limited robust evidence available, rather than making
assertions on what does not work. Still, the review does point out where there is a lack
of high-quality impact evaluation evidence for important intervention types.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION: BACKGROUND AND APPROACH


Box 1.4. Challenges and Cautions for Systematic Reviews
Notwithstanding the thoroughness of the search strategy, there remain challenges to
representativeness and interpretation of results that are common to all systematic reviews.
This review meets or exceeds standard practice, such as it exists, in every instance.
Challenges to representativeness of the interventions arise from the fact that the process of
selecting interventions to be evaluated by an impact evaluation is purposeful rather than
random.
        Some types of projects are less amenable to impact evaluation methods and so will
         be underrepresented.
        Interventions that report on intermediate rather than final outcomes are excluded.
        Importantly, the lack of existing impact evaluations for a family of interventions
         indicates a need for evaluations in that area, not that the interventions are ineffective.
Challenges to representativeness of the impact evaluations are twofold.
        The review includes only concluded studies; it cannot use impact evaluations that
         are planned or in process.
        As with all reviews, the sample may suffer from file drawer bias or publication bias
         wherein studies that yield null results are not completed. Alternately, it has been
         hypothesized that only studies with experimental designs can be published with
         statistically insignificant results because of stronger internal validity; this may lead
         to a false conclusion that randomized trials are more likely to return null results.
Challenges to interpretation of results imply a need for thoughtful application of findings.
        Impact evaluations of projects funded by foreign aid likely underestimate the true
         effect of the intervention because they measure partial (or local) equilibrium effects
         rather than the general equilibrium effects resulting from the fungibility of
         government budgets, which allows countries to reallocate health funding away from
         of the foreign-funded activities (Wagstaff 2011).
        Null results must be interpreted carefully: they do not necessarily mean there is no
         effect. They may occur where there is measurement error, insufficient sample size
         (power) to detect an effect, spillover from treatment to the control group, differential
         attrition, insufficient behavioral incentives, or implementation challenges.
         Distinguishing the causes of a null result is often untenable.
        External validity is a persistent challenge. Applicability of results to a different
         context—time, place, or scale—is likely a function of project complexity (Woolcock
         2012), administrative capacity, political supportability, and alignment with the most
         important barriers of the target environment. The ideas and processes of an
         intervention may have greater external validity than the intervention itself.


1.34 Chapter 2 covers impact evaluations that report outcomes on skilled birth
attendance and maternal mortality. It also gives a review of impact evaluation
evidence of maternal and child health outcomes resulting from skilled birth
attendance. Chapter 3 relates impact evaluation evidence of interventions on child

mortality, expositing in turn results on neonatal, infant, and child mortality. Each of
these outcome sections in Chapters 2 and 3 is structured to first characterize the
issues around the outcome being reviewed, then describe the impact evaluations
that report results for that outcome, categorizing the evaluations according to the
three main families of interventions in the taxonomy—governance, provision (health
sector and other sectors), and utilization—plus an additional category for projects
that bundle components from different intervention types. Finally, each outcome
section discusses findings from these evaluations in terms of promising
interventions (what is known) and remaining knowledge gaps (what still needs to
be known). Chapter 4 is a broad-ranging discussion of trends observed over the
entire database of included impact evaluations, including comparisons of the
strength of impact evaluation evidence with the World Bank’s activities.

1.35 In some sense, this review is a baseline for impact evaluation evidence in
maternal and child mortality. As more impact evaluations are produced and the
evidence thickens and perhaps coalesces around particular results, key findings
reported here may become more certain. For now they should be taken as instructive
but still preliminary.

2. Mothers
2.1    Mothers undertake considerable risk at childbirth, the level of which varies
greatly across regions. The most recent accounting exercise estimated that 1 in every
4,700 mothers in developed countries will die during childbirth; that risk increases
dramatically in developing regions; for instance in Sub-Saharan Africa it is 1 in 39
(WHO and others 2012).

2.2      Most of the causes of maternal mortality are obstetric and preventable.
Clinical interventions to prevent or manage pregnancy and childbirth-related
complications are well known (Campbell and Graham 2006; Graham and others
2006; Nyamtema and others 2011). Among these key strategies are enhanced
maternal nutrition (increased food intake and supplementation with folic acid and
iron); disease prevention and treatment (malaria, hepatitis B, and HIV); quality
reproductive health services (family planning); adequate antenatal care (at least four
visits, including basic preventive measures); skilled assistance at delivery, in
particular active management of the third stage of labor; and basic and
comprehensive emergency obstetric and postnatal care (Campbell and Graham 2006;
Graham and others 2006; Wagstaff and others 2006).

2.3    Addressing factors that cause delays in identifying risks and in deciding to
seek care, reaching a treatment facility, and receiving high-quality care—the “three-
delay framework” (Thaddeus and Maine 1994)—is necessary to reduce maternal
mortality. In delivering such interventions, health systems can play a crucial role,
and their adequate preparation is essential to ensure that communities and women
have access to high-quality services (Campbell and Graham 2006; Canavan 2009;
Graham and others 2006).

2.4     Fostering skilled birth attendance (SBA) is believed to constitute a first step in
any strategy that seeks to reduce maternal mortality and is enshrined as the primary
indicator for maternal mortality in the fifth MDG. “Improving the proportion of
births attended by skilled health personnel” is also the only indicator that explicitly
refers to human resources in health.1 The promotion of skilled attendance at delivery
has been widely used in an effort to effectively manage delivery complications
(obstructed labor, eclampsia, puerperal sepsis, and obstetric hemorrhage).
Consequently, this chapter begins by examining 33 impact evaluations of the effects
of a range of interventions on the use of skilled birth attendants by expectant
mothers.

2.5   Yet rigorous field evidence on the effectiveness of skilled attendance in
reducing maternal mortality has been known to be limited for several years

                                                                               MOTHERS

(Graham and others 2006). Thus, the chapter explores the 25 impact evaluations with
evidence of attributable effects of SBA as an intervention.

2.6    Countries have pursued many strategies to reduce the risk of maternal death.
Essential services for mothers and newborns are considered to be most effective
when they are delivered in integrated packages through a functioning health system
(UNICEF 2009). In poor settings where access to health systems is limited, outreach,
family- and community-based interventions— particularly birth preparedness
counseling, clean delivery, and promotion of health-seeking behavior—may provide
an alternative modality to reach pregnant women and deliver these packages of
interventions (Campbell and Graham 2006; Kerber and others 2007). The chapter
culminates with evidence from eight studies on how these and other interventions
perform in the field to reduce maternal mortality.

2.7     Given the complexities of both childbirth and the decision to seek skilled
attendance, achieving the fifth MDG is likely to require complementary and
reinforcing strategies. The reviewed impact evaluations cover a wide array of
interventions, but they are particularly clustered around bundles of health provision
(service delivery) and health utilization (household ability to pay and diffusion of
knowledge and information). Findings of this chapter support the notion that
interventions that focus on improving accessibility and quality of health care
through combinations of health provision (health workforce training, delivery
modalities, service packages) and on health utilization (schemes to improve ability
to pay, diffusion of knowledge and information) tend to be associated with
significant effects on the analyzed outcomes. Conversely, across outcomes, stand-
alone interventions are less likely to yield significant impacts. As an important
example, this review does not find any evidence that interventions aimed
exclusively at improving the main MDG 5 indicator of increasing the proportion of
births attended by skilled health personnel has any effect on mortality outcomes.

2.8     Table 2.1 indicates the intervention type and quality of study of the 36 impact
evaluations used in the sections on maternal mortality and SBA as an outcome. The
section on skilled birth attendance as an intervention has its own table based on
seven AAA impact evaluations (see Appendix E). The numerator in each cell is the
number of impact evaluations of that level reporting a statistically significant effect
of that intervention on that outcome. The denominator is the total number of impact
evaluations.

Skilled Birth Attendance as an Outcome
2.9    Skilled birth attendance is considered essential to ensuring safe delivery and
care for a newborn (WHO 2005a). Skilled health personnel can save the life of the
mother or child by the timely detection of complications during pregnancy and swift
treatment or referral. Yet the proportion of deliveries in the developing world
attended by skilled health personnel has increased by only 6 percent over the last
decade, from 59 percent in 2000 to 65 percent in 2010 (UN 2012). This leaves more
than one-third of deliveries in the developing world unattended by skilled personnel.

2.10 This section reviews evidence from impact evaluations of interventions aiming
to increase SBA. Following the WHO definition, a skilled birth attendant is “an
accredited health professional—such as a midwife, doctor, or nurse—who has been
educated and trained to proficiency in the skills needed to manage normal
(uncomplicated) pregnancies, childbirth and the immediate postnatal period, and in
the identification, management, and referral of complications in women and
newborns” (WHO 2004).




                                                                                   21
CHAPTER 2
MOTHERS

2.11 Deliveries attended by a skilled professional can occur at home or in a health
facility; the latter is referred to as institutional deliveries. Skilled care also requires
adequate supplies and access to a functioning referral system. Many of the
definitions of skilled birth attendance in the studies are consistent with that of the
WHO, but in reality the attendants undoubtedly fell along a range of skill levels that
deviate in some degree from the WHO’s scenario. The specific skill levels of the
attendants cannot be determined, so it is necessary to accept that the attendants in
the interventions did in fact qualify as skilled personnel.

DATA DESCRIPTION
2.12 The review identified 28 studies of 33 interventions that had SBA as an
outcome. Nine of these were AAA studies (covering 10 interventions), of which 5
employed experimental and 4 used quasi-experimental methods. Five of the AAA
and 13 of the AA studies reported significant results. The geographic distribution of
the interventions is found in the map above. Most of the interventions targeted
specific groups, with rural populations being the most common. The details of these
studies are organized below according to the taxonomy of intervention families
presented earlier.

GOVERNANCE
2.13 The review did not find any study that focused on an intervention that was
exclusively governance related. Two studies that bundled components of
governance with other intervention types are further discussed in the Bundles
section.[12,54]

PROVISION: HEALTH SECTOR
2.14 The only health sector intervention evaluated by an AAA study combined
delivery modality, health workforce, and service packages. Female health workers
and traditional birth attendants in Pakistan were trained, and community health
committees were formed to promote maternal and child health within the villages.
The results were not statistically significant. Three AA evaluations found significant
effects for four different health sector interventions (Bloom and others 2003),[7,26] but
the remaining two health sector interventions produced null results.[50,44]

PROVISION: NONHEALTH SECTORS
2.15 An AA study evaluating an education program was the only nonhealth
sector intervention, and it found a significant increase in SBA.[59]

                                                                                 MOTHERS

UTILIZATION
2.16 Both utilization interventions were conditional cash transfers (CCTs) that
focused on increasing income to affect the ability to pay. The first was the well-
known Progresa program (now Oportunidades) in Mexico.[62] Health facilities were
required to provide delivery services for pregnant women enrolled in the program,
but this did not significantly change the proportion of deliveries attended by skilled
health personnel. Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY), a government initiative in India, gave
cash to women who delivered in a hospital or health facility.[46] The initiative also
gave health workers incentives with a cash transfer for every delivery they attended.
This combined effort led to a highly significant increase in both facility births and
skilled birth attendance in general. An AA-quality study also evaluated JSY and
found a significant increase in SBA.[39]

2.17 Three other AA-quality studies looking at the ability to pay, including
household spending, also found similarly significant increases.[53,55,51] Two
interventions that increased knowledge and information were insignificant.[48]

BUNDLED INTERVENTION
2.18 The remaining AAA studies evaluated interventions that bundled
components across the governance, provision, and utilization sectors. The first was
Comunidades Solidaria Rurales, a conditional cash transfer program in El Salvador,
that led to a significant increase in hospital deliveries. Unlike JSY and Progresa, this
CCT included health infrastructure improvements in all participating areas.[16]

2.19 The second study examined two interventions encompassing health
financing and strategy planning and policy. The Indonesian government identified
12 MCH and education outcomes of focus, and villages were given block grants to
allocate as they chose to improve these outcomes.[54] In the first intervention, the
amount of the villages’ second-year grant was the same as the first year. In the
second intervention, the second-year amount was dependent on the first year’s
performance (pay-for-performance program). Both interventions produced
statistically insignificant results. A community monitoring intervention in Uganda
combined monitoring and evaluation and accountability with service management
and significantly increased SBA.[12] Community leaders met with staff from public
health facilities to create action plans to improve health care in the facilities. Each
plan included a provision for community members to monitor compliance.

2.20 A health management and transportation intervention in Zanzibar also
significantly increased SBA by providing mobile phones to health facility workers so
they could call expectant mothers and send reminder text messages to women in the


                                                                                       23

treatment group who had their own mobile phone.[41] All women in the treatment
group were given vouchers with enough credit to call their primary care provider.
Midwives and ambulance drivers were also given mobile phones to improve
ambulance services.

2.21 Finally, two interventions used knowledge and information campaigns to
try to increase skilled birth attendance. The first focused on the delivery modality of
services by creating or expanding participatory women’s groups that taught women
about good delivery practices and care-seeking behavior.[61] The sessions
emphasized facility delivery and proper health care practices during pregnancy;
nevertheless, the evaluation did not find statistically significant differences.

2.22 The other intervention that addressed knowledge and information was the
Safe Motherhood Program in China, which also tried to improve both the ability of
households to pay and the health workforce in poor counties.[23] Subsidies for care
were provided directly to participating women, and obstetric experts were deployed
to support and train staff in primary health centers. This produced a highly
significant but relatively small increase in hospital births. An AA-quality study of
the same program found a much larger and still significant increase.[40]

2.23 Seven AA studies bundled components across intervention types. Six of the
seven, encompassing eight different interventions, used some combination of
delivery modality, knowledge and information, health workforce, and service
packages. Four of these interventions reported at least marginal increases in
SBA,[38,37,45,4] but the other four found null effects (see figure J.1 in Appendix J).[37,3,47]
The remaining study, which did not demonstrate a significant impact, was a
combination of health infrastructure and strategy planning and policy in Bolivia.[49]

FINDINGS
What Works To Increase SBA?

2.24 The evidence gathered from these different evaluations provides an
opportunity to synthesize knowledge about increasing skilled birth attendance to
highlight promising interventions and potential pitfalls in SBA.

2.25 There is evidence that interventions seeking to incentivize the behavior of
providers or users of care are likely to yield positive impacts on SBA. These include
demand financing programs (CCTs and vouchers) and interventions that reward the
good performance of health workers. Two of the three AAA-quality impact
evaluations that evaluated demand financing reported a significant impact on
SBA.[46,16] With both JSY and Comunidades Solidaria Rurales, SBA increased by


24
                                                                              CHAPTER 2
                                                                               MOTHERS

approximately 17 percent relative to the mean. In the case of JSY, however, the
authors attributed approximately 33 percent of the impact to substituting away from
private care. Eligibility for JSY was fairly broad: in high-performing states women
had to be below the poverty line and belong to a scheduled caste or tribe, but in low-
performing states, all women were eligible. The effect was larger among the poor,
the less educated, and those who belonged to scheduled castes or tribes.

2.26 In El Salvador, the Comunidades Solidaria Rurales program gave $15 per month
($20 for mothers with school-age children) to women conditional on prenatal care
visits or on growth monitoring and vaccination of children. The program targeted
the rural poor, a group in which less than 60 percent of births were attended by
skilled personnel, which is well below the country average. Progresa gave women a
similar amount of money ($17), but the results were not significant, although this
may be due to the relatively short evaluation period (18 months). All AA demand
financing studies, including a pay-for-performance program in Rwanda, also
reported significant increases.[53,55,51,39,7]

2.27 Although not as widely evaluated as demand-side financing, there is
evidence that suggests that the widely used Safe Motherhood Program (SMP)
produces consistently significant improvements in the proportion of deliveries
attended by skilled health personnel (see box 2.1). The AAA study of SMP in China
found a highly significant 6.3 percent increase in hospital deliveries, which is
reinforced by an AA study of the same intervention that found that hospital
deliveries increased by almost 150 percent relative to the baseline.[23,40] A second AA
evaluation, this one of SMP in Indonesia, found a marginally significant, but still
fairly large, 13 percent increase in SBA.[4]

2.28 Although these programs demonstrated successful results, supply-side
constraints such as quality of care may limit the effectiveness of demand-side
interventions, because people will be unable or unwilling to use health facilities
(Lagarde and others 2007). The public monitoring program in Uganda caused health
care utilization to increase dramatically, including SBA, which went up by almost 58
percent. The confidence interval on SBA is quite large, however, perhaps because of
the small sample size (see Appendix J, figure J.1). The authors theorized that the
substantial increase in utilization came from better quality of care.[12] This
intervention suggests that an effective way to improve quality of care is to hold
providers accountable by eliminating information gaps about aggregate health
outcomes, aligning the expectations of users and providers, and establishing a clear
monitoring mechanism. An AA evaluation of a CCT in Nepal also found higher
impacts in areas with better quality of care.[55]



                                                                                     25
CHAPTER 2
MOTHERS

2.29 There is little evidence that community-based interventions to improve SBA
are successful. The improvements to the Lady Health Workers Program in
Pakistan[10] and the creation of participatory women’s groups in India,[61] the only
two AAA evaluations of community-based interventions, reported insignificant
results. In the former, the government targeted rural communities where a majority
of births still occurred at home without any skilled attendant. In the latter, the
communities were located in areas of relatively high levels of maternal and neonatal
mortality and had a high percentage of scheduled castes and tribes.


Box 2.1. Promoting Skilled Birth Attendance through Health Education and Increased Access
Although a comparatively large number of impact evaluations address health education for
mothers, few yield significant impacts. All the community-based interventions included
educational meetings, and four other interventions included similar educational
components, such as awareness campaigns or formal classes.[23,40,4,48] Among these four
additional studies, the AAA evaluation of the SMP in China and the AA evaluation of the
SMP in Indonesia are the only two that reported significant results; the other two AA
studies were insignificant. When combined with the community-based findings above, the
SMP study remains the only one of the three AAA studies that was significant, and only five
of eleven health education interventions with AA evaluations were significant.
As with the community-based interventions, evaluations of these health education
programs are concentrated within a single geographic area of Asia. Finally, few of the
interventions were isolated health education programs, so it is not possible to determine
whether it was health education in particular or rather some combination of the different
components of these interventions that produced the null results.
Like quality of care, the evidence suggests that access to care is a potentially important
supply-side constraint. The only AAA study to address increased access was that of the
SMP in China, which established emergency medical centers.[23] It found a statistically
significant increase in SBA, as did three AA studies.[40,4,26] The other two AA studies,
however, produced null results.[49,50] These interventions undertook similar projects: they
built new health facilities and increased the number of medical personnel.


2.30 Moreover, four of the seven interventions from AA evaluations on
community-based approaches were also insignificant.[3,47,38,37,45] Yet because all
community-based interventions occurred in South Asia, it is unknown whether they
may produce different results in other regions.

2.31 There may be differential impacts across population groups, even if the
intervention itself targeted disadvantaged communities. Four interventions from
AAA IEs reported heterogeneous effects on individuals with different socio-
economic status, location, and baseline level of SBA. The JSY program in India had a
larger effect in the poorest locations and on the poorest women.[46] Although the full

                                                                               MOTHERS

sample estimates were not significant, Indonesia’s pay-for-performance program
had larger and marginally significant effects in areas with lower baseline values of
SBA.[54]

2.32 In Zanzibar, the mobile phone intervention had no effect on rural residents
but made urban residents almost five times more likely to deliver with a skilled
attendant, as compared to the control group.[41] The evaluation of Progresa did not
find a significantly different impact based on poverty status. However, it is
important to note that the sample size for testing heterogeneous effects was much
smaller than the original sample (N = 4,315 versus N = 446)[62] because the authors
only included women with a poverty score below a certain level.

2.33 Moreover, interventions may produce unintended consequences, whether
desirable or undesirable. Disregarding these effects may under- or overestimate the
overall impact of the program. The JSY program negatively affected private health
facilities by drawing to public facilities mothers who would have otherwise used
private care.[46] Evidence from an AA impact evaluation in Nepal also suggests that
women moved away from nongovernmental organization (NGO) facilities to public
ones.[55] In neither case, however, did the substitution account for the full impact of
the program.

2.34 For interventions to yield meaningful significant results, sufficient exposure
time may be necessary to create awareness of the programs and change behavior.
For instance, the Safe Motherhood Program in China had a greater effect on counties
with longer exposure to the program.[23] An AA-quality study on a voucher program
in Kenya found that participants in the group that had been exposed for two to four
years were significantly more likely than the control group to use a skilled birth
attendant, but there was no significant difference for those who had been exposed
for less than a year.[53]

What Do We Still Need To Know?

2.35 Despite the evidence from the reviewed studies, important knowledge gaps
remain. Recognizing these gaps is crucial for understanding the limits of the existing
evidence and for highlighting important areas for research.

2.36 There is little evidence on the cost of SBA interventions. Among all 28 studies,
three attempted an informal estimation of the cost per facility delivery. JSY in India
and the Safe Delivery Incentive Program in Nepal cost about $357 and $210,
respectively, but these were lower-bound estimates, because program
administration costs were not included.[46,55] The pay-for-performance intervention
in Rwanda cost only $4.59 per facility delivery.[7] Although providing incentives for
workers through pay for performance appears to be a more cost-effective approach,
the different contexts of the programs limit direct comparison between the

estimates. Additional cost estimates from AAA-quality impact evaluations are
needed as well as estimates drawn from comparable contexts.

2.37 The geographical distribution of evidence is unequal, and when compared
with the distribution of the problem’s severity, major geographical gaps emerge.
Sub-Saharan Africa is tied with South Asia for the lowest levels of skilled birth
attendance, but Sub-Saharan Africa has only five evaluations to South Asia’s twelve.
Neither has more than three AAA studies. Furthermore, there are no impact
evaluations from the Middle East and North Africa, the region with the third-
highest burden. More AAA studies are needed across these regions to identify the
best interventions to increase SBA.

2.38 Despite the growing literature on the role of health insurance on utilization of
health care (Wagstaff and others 2009), no evidence was found on the impact of the
insurance on SBA. Insurance can promote SBA by enabling access to quality health
care. Impacts are likely to be significant where the insurance allows mothers to
choose service from different providers. Additionally, evidence of the effect of
health and nonhealth infrastructure, such as the construction of roads and health
facilities, is very thin. Only one intervention, undertaken in Bolivia, estimated the
impact of health facility construction.[49] This AA evaluation found no significant
impact on SBA, even though infrastructure is believed to be crucial to improve the
availability of primary and emergency care. Evidence on the effect of nonfinancial
incentives on increasing skilled birth attendance was also missing and would be
worth exploring given the limited resources of many of these countries.

Skilled Birth Attendance as an Intervention
2.39 Where the previous section explored the ability of interventions to increase
the proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel, this section examines
the subsequent effects of births taking place in such a setting. Put another way, the
previous section looks at the effect of SBA-enhancing interventions on outcomes up
to and including birth being attended by skilled personnel, whereas this section
looks at the effects following the birth event of such interventions, including
maternal and neonatal mortality and intermediate morbidity and wellness
outcomes.

CHAPTER 2
MOTHERS

2.40 The “proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel” is one of the
two indicators for MDG 5; the other is the maternal mortality rate, for which the
attended births indicator is intended to proxy because MMR data are often unreliable.
Because it is intended to proxy the maternal mortality rate, it is natural to examine the
“downstream” (postbirth) effects of skilled birth attendance as an intervention.

2.41 Skilled birth attendance is often defined as encompassing a partnership of
skilled attendants and an enabling environment of equipment, supplies, drugs, and
transport for patient referral (see Graham and others 2001, for example).

2.42 According to WHO, most of the deaths and disabilities attributable to
childbirth are avoidable with the application of well-known medical solutions.
Immediate and effective professional care during and after labor and delivery is
critical in reducing deaths for both women and their newborns. Both maternal and
neonatal mortality are lower in countries where mothers giving birth get skilled
professional care with the equipment, drugs, and other supplies needed for the
effective and timely management of complications, based on evidence that includes
historical records from developed countries (for example, Sweden, Denmark, Japan,
the Netherlands) and case studies with a retrospective approach (Sri Lanka,
Malaysia, Honduras) (WHO 2005a). The joint statement by WHO, UNFPA, UNICEF,
and the World Bank also relied on the same historical records and stated that the key
to reducing maternal mortality was the institution of fully professional maternity
care (WHO 1999).

2.43 In contrast, Graham and others (2001) and MacDonagh (2005) caution that
such historical data may have failed to control for confounding factors such as
changes in other health care practices or the status of women in society. Moreover,
as far back as 2001 and soon after the MDGs were established, AbouZahr and
Wardlaw (2001) pointed out that unequivocal epidemiological evidence for the
impact of skilled attendants at delivery on reducing maternal mortality is lacking
and the evidence in favor of a causal link is still largely circumstantial. Being the
primary indicator of MDG 5 suggests improvements in SBA alone are sufficient to
reduce maternal mortality. The accuracy of that implication and the effects of SBA-
related interventions that improve SBA rates in conjunction with improving other
factors in maternal mortality logic models (for example, the “three-delay model”)
need to be understood.

2.44 The conceptual model shown in Figure 1.2 helps to understand the highly
complex pathways through which maternal and child mortality may be improved
by different interventions. In the conceptual model, the activities that concern skilled
attendants are labeled as health workforce interventions under the provision
interventions by the health sector. Within the same sector, the activities and
interventions that contribute to an enabling environment include medical products

                                                                               MOTHERS

and technology and health information, as well as transportation infrastructure
under provision of interventions by other sectors.

2.45 Although not part of the most formal definitions of SBA, the sociocultural
environment that surrounds women can also play a role in the provision and
utilization of SBA services. Efforts to empower women are important. Improvement
of their health is often impeded by the social and cultural environment and limited
access to educational and economic opportunities. There are multiple interventions
in the taxonomy to improve this: knowledge and information within utilization and
provision within the education and labor market sectors. Strategy planning and
policy of governance and other aspects of the political and policy context also play
important roles in creating an enabling environment (see Figure 1.2).

DATA DESCRIPTION
2.46 The construct of a “skilled birth attendant” is not binary; it is a proportion
along a continuum, with no meaningfully defined or generally accepted minimum.
Consequently, this section includes all impact evaluations of interventions that aim
to improve SBA generally, regardless of the absolute level of quality of the
attendants or the enabling environment they actually attain.

2.47 The search exercise of this review produced 25 AAA and AA impact
evaluations that assess SBA-related interventions of many of the intervention types
described earlier. Training for health personnel (both licensed and community
health workers and traditional birth attendants [TBAs]) and health education or
awareness campaigns for women are the most commonly studied interventions.

2.48      There are seven AAA studies; four employed quasi-experimental designs[23, 46,
52, 56] and three were randomized treatment designs. [10, 12, 61] Broadly, large-scale

programs were evaluated with quasi-experimental designs while RCTs were the
most common for smaller, local interventions. The lengths of evaluated exposure of
the seven studies range from two to eight years.

2.49 All seven AAA studies estimate program impacts on two to three mortality or
intermediate outcomes. In aggregate, the seven studies have results for the four
mortality outcomes covered in this report: maternal, neonatal, infant, and under-
five. These studies also cover eight intermediate outcomes: fertility, child
anthropometrics, immunization, infant morbidity, care-seeking behavior,
breastfeeding, postnatal visit, and family planning. Detailed descriptions of these
studies by intervention sector follow.

evaluation that explored the project’s impacts on under-five mortality as well as
fertility, anthropometrics, immunization, and family planning.[12] Each public
dispensary was given a report card based on a baseline survey of users and a review
of the dispensary’s records. The report card was disseminated through community
and staff meetings facilitated by local NGOs. Community representatives and
medical staff created a shared action plan with monitoring provisions that were left
to community members to enforce.

2.51 One AA impact evaluation in governance covers a public-private
partnership intervention in Cambodia. [13]

PROVISION: HEALTH SECTOR
2.52 Brazil’s Family Health Program is a service delivery intervention that sends
professional health care teams to communities to provide services such as
counseling as well as preventive and recovery care that focuses on family health.
Impacts on infant and under-five mortality as well as fertility were assessed in an
AAA evaluation.[56]

2.53 Six AA impact evaluations focus on health sector projects. They cover a wider
array of intervention types, including delivery modality, health workforce, service
management, service package, and medical products and technologies. [14, 20, 26, 29, 44,
50]


PROVISION: NONHEALTH SECTORS
2.54 The review found no impact evaluations of SBA projects identified as strictly
pertaining to provision of services from other nonhealth sectors.

UTILIZATION
2.55 The neonatal mortality, fertility, and breastfeeding impacts of the world’s
largest CCT program, JSY in India, were evaluated in an AAA study with nearly
430,000 observations.[46] The program is implemented at the district level to provide
a cash incentive to women who give birth in a public health facility or with an
accredited private health provider. The program is classified as an ability-to-pay
and income increasing intervention to increase utilization. It is available to all
women in low-performing states with low in-facility birth coverage and to poor
women, women in a scheduled caste or tribe, and women with less than two
children in high-performing states. The size of the transfer ranges from $13 for urban
mothers with fewer than two children to $31 for poor rural women. It also pays
health workers for delivery attendance. This is the only AAA evaluation that isolates
the effect of increasing the number of births attended by skilled health personnel,
keeping the quality of SBAs and the SBA environment at the status quo, as implied
by the SBA indicator of MDG 5. The results of the study are valid for married
women between the ages of 15 and 49 in districts where JSY has been implemented.

                                                                              MOTHERS

2.56 A knowledge and information intervention that promotes community
mobilization through participatory women’s groups implemented in three districts
in India was evaluated in an AAA study for impacts on maternal mortality and
neonatal mortality as well as infant morbidity, case-seeking behavior, and
breastfeeding.[61] Information about clean delivery practices and care-seeking
behavior was shared. Group members identified and prioritized maternal and
newborn health problems in the community, collectively selected relevant strategies
to address problems, implemented strategies and assessed results. The results are
valid for women between the ages of 15 and 49 years who resided in the project area
(Jharkhand and Orissa) and who had given birth during the study.

2.57 Four AA impact evaluations of utilization projects and programs cover
income increasing, household health spending, and ability to pay interventions. [18,
39, 51, 53]


BUNDLED INTERVENTIONS
2.58 Three AAA impact evaluations in China, Pakistan, and Ukraine measure the
effects of skilled birth projects that bundle components across provision and
utilization intervention categories.

2.59 China’s Program to Reduce Maternal Mortality and Eliminate Neonatal
Tetanus was implemented at the county level and evaluated on maternal and
neonatal mortality outcomes. [23] The program aims to reduce maternal mortality
through enhancing qualified hospital delivery with three bundled interventions: two
types of knowledge and information in health education and social mobilization,
and health infrastructure enhancement. The results of the study are valid for the
counties in China that implemented the program. The three criteria for selection
were (1) being national poverty counties; (2) having baseline maternal mortality
rates and neonatal tetanus incidence rates above the county’s provincial average;
and (3) having a budget provided by the provincial government capable of matching
the central government’s contribution at least one to one.

2.60 The Lady Health Workers Program in Pakistan is a health workforce and
knowledge and information intervention package implemented at the village
level.[10] Female health workers were trained in neonatal mortality, breastfeeding,
and postnatal visits. They then promoted antenatal care and maternal health
education, use of clean delivery kits, facility births, immediate newborn care,
identification of danger signs, and care-seeking behavior. The results of the study
are valid for married women in rural southern Pakistan with access to health
workers and health facilities.

2.61 The Mother and Infant Health Project in Ukraine was implemented at the
county level and bundles components from two intervention types: health


                                                                                      33

workforce through the provision of training on effective perinatal technologies for
the project’s maternities staff and knowledge and information through a health
awareness campaign. The impact evaluation examined maternal and infant
mortality as well as infant morbidity and family planning.[52]

2.62 There are seven AA impact evaluations of skilled birth projects with bundled
components. [3, 4, 35, 37, 38, 45, 47]

2.63 Despite only seven AAA studies, all of the mortality outcomes assessed by
this review are covered. Somewhat surprisingly, given that SBA falls within MDG 5
on maternal mortality, the most frequently assessed outcome of these SBA-related
interventions is neonatal mortality rather than maternal mortality.

2.64 Among the AAA studies, regional representation is fairly even. There is one
impact evaluation in East Europe (Ukraine), one in Latin America (Brazil), one in
East Asia (China), three in South Asia (India and Pakistan), and one in Sub-Saharan
Africa (Uganda). Taking together all 25 studies, the regional distribution skews
dramatically to South Asia. There is one study in East Europe; one in Latin America;
four in East Asia; twelve in South Asia; two in South East Asia; and five in Sub-
Saharan Africa.

2.65 As a whole, the seven AAA studies touch on all of the World Bank’s seven
successful approaches2 to improving maternal health outcomes but one. The seven
approaches include strengthening outreach services and community-based
approaches; improving education for girls and women; targeting public sector
subsidies to poor families and disadvantaged areas; improving quality and
availability of essential and emergency obstetric care services for the poor;
promoting affordable maternal health services and scaling up adolescent sexual and
reproductive health information and services; strengthening monitoring and
evaluation; and developing effective poor-friendly referral systems. When the AA
impact evaluations are included, all seven successful approaches are covered,
including developing effective poor-friendly referral systems.

FINDINGS
What Do We Know About the Effects of Skilled Birth Attendance?

2.66 It is important to distinguish interventions that solely increase the proportion
of births attended in a skilled birth environment from those that also include
complementary interventions. The concept that skilled attendance at birth is the
“single most critical intervention for ensuring safe motherhood” is based largely on
historical records.3 However, these historical data may have failed to control for
confounding factors. Therefore, in this review IEG collects all robust impact
evaluations that can answer this claim. IEG examines the results of evaluations that

can isolate the effect of increasing attendance at birth and explores the results of
evaluations of interventions that combine increasing births attended with other
intervention components.

What Do We Know About the Effects of Only “Increasing the Proportion of Births Attended”?

2.67 Despite an extensive search, this review identified only one AAA impact
evaluation, the India JSY study, that can isolate the effect of increasing the
proportion of births attended in a skilled birth environment (skilled health
personnel with appropriate equipment and referral ability).4 This illustrates that
little impact evaluation evidence exists on whether SBA itself is effective or not, and
thus there is little evidence on the effectiveness of the MDG injunction to increase
the number of births attended by skilled health personnel.

2.68 In spite of the fact that only one AAA study can answer this question, that
study covers a very important intervention: the world’s largest CCT program,
operating in the world’s second most populous country. The India JSY study finds
that the cash incentives do increase facility deliveries—and increase fertility— but
they have no discernible effects on neonatal mortality. This null result is unlikely to
be the result of the study being underpowered; there were more than 429,000
observations in the neonatal mortality specifications.

2.69 As indicated in the previous section, the authors of the AAA JSY study note
that the statistically significant impact of the program on increasing skilled birth
attendance as an outcome is driven by increased use of maternity services at health
facilities below the district hospital, and one-third of that increase is due to a
substitution from private to public providers. These lower-level facilities provide
only basic health services and are less able to manage emergency complications at
childbirth (however good the quality of care); the authors conjecture that this may
be affecting the null result for neonatal mortality.

2.70 The quality of care in India was highly variable at the time of the initiation of
the JSY program in 2005 (see, for example, Das and Gertler (2007) and Das and
Hammer (2007), and this may have affected health outcomes. Notwithstanding this
potential explanation, the India JSY study found that the null result persisted
regardless of local quality of health care. The authors find that a one standard
deviation increase in the quality-of-care index at primary health centers has no
statistically significant effect on reducing neonatal mortality. The authors conclude
that as of 2008, the end line in the instrumental variable-difference in differences
estimation strategy, no evidence suggests that the JSY led to reductions in neonatal
(within 28 days) or early neonatal mortality (within 24 hours), even in districts with
better quality of care. The authors do not provide an estimate of the effect on
maternal mortality citing a “lack of suitable data.”



                                                                                            35
CHAPTER 2
MOTHERS

2.71 This result is corroborated by an AA study on JSY.[39] Although the program
significantly increased the proportion of births in a health facility and having a
skilled attendant present at the time of delivery, the study reported null results for
neonatal and perinatal mortality at the district level.5 In addition, the study also
reported a null result in maternal mortality, although the authors wonder if that
result is underpowered. The sample size was as large as 182,869 households;
however, the authors infer that perinatal, neonatal, and maternal deaths occurred at
rates too small to be detected. Another AA paper on a voucher program in
neighboring Bangladesh indicates that vouchers can improve take-up of delivering
with SBA, which then affects the likelihood of postnatal care visits, but it gives no
evidence on mortality or other postbirth outcomes.[51]

2.72 Taken as a whole, there is no evidence that increasing the proportion of births
attended by skilled health personnel, as prescribed implicitly by the operational
indicator of MDG 5, reduces maternal or neonatal mortality. The thin but consistent
and internally robust evidence that does exist suggests that interventions that only
increase the proportion of births attended may not have any impact on maternal or
neonatal mortality. Thus, although increasing the share of attended births may be a
necessary condition to improving these outcomes, it does not appear to be a
sufficient condition. This does not necessarily suggest that SBA is not important, but
at a minimum it does suggest that the “proportion of births attended by skilled
health personnel” seems to be an unfounded, if not poor, proxy for maternal
mortality in MDG 5.

What Do We Know About the Effects of Skilled Birth Attendance Bundled With Complementary
Interventions?

2.73 Although there is no evidence that interventions that solely improve the
proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel reduce mortality, those
that combine components to improve the proportion of births attended with
complementary interventions to improve quality of care or patient knowledge can
improve neonatal and maternal survival.

2.74 Most SBA-related impact evaluations evaluate the effect of improving SBA
quality, rather than looking at the effect of giving birth in an SBA environment.
Although the individual causal effect of these multiple components cannot be
isolated, impact evaluations can indicate the effect of the overall intervention.

Impact on Maternal Mortality

2.75 Three studies estimated the maternal mortality impact of a combination of
interventions: Ukraine, health workforce and knowledge and information; China,
health workforce, knowledge and information, and ability to pay/household health

                                                                                MOTHERS

spending; and India, delivery modality and knowledge and information) on
maternal mortality.

2.76 The Ukraine and China evaluations reported significant reductions in
maternal mortality. Both employed interventions addressing the provider (supply)
and user (demand) sides. In Ukraine, being part of the program decreased maternal
mortality by 63.22 deaths per 100,000 live births. Since basic medical care has been
universally available, implementation of the project allows quality to be addressed
rather than the quantity of medical care, which may have led to the reduction of
maternal mortality.

2.77 China’s Safe Motherhood Program is a comprehensive package of
interventions that sought to improve hospital deliveries through health education,
health infrastructure enhancement, social mobilization, and a household’s ability to
pay for health services through a subsidy. Still, the mortality gains were much
smaller than in Ukraine: Seven years of exposure to the China program led to
reductions in all-cause maternal mortality of 1.84 deaths per 100,000 live births and a
reduction of 10.23 maternal deaths due to hemorrhage per 100,000 live births. In
rural areas, significant geographical inequalities persist, but the comprehensive
program may have helped physical and financial accessibility.

2.78 The India community study reported negative estimates for maternal
mortality but was not sufficiently powered to detect significant differences. The
program was predominantly user (demand) side intervention. According to the
authors, qualitative evidence from the assessment of the trial’s process showed that
community mobilization through women’s groups might have contributed to
avoidance of some maternal deaths.

Impact on Child Mortality

2.79 Three impact evaluations—China, India community, and Pakistan—
estimated the impact of a combination of interventions on neonatal mortality. The
India community and Pakistan interventions improved local capacity of health
providers within the target populations or remote regions with high gender
inequality by training local women or traditional birth attendants. These studies
further divided the neonatal period into three categories: perinatal, stillbirth, and 0–
6 days; early neonatal, 0–6 days; and late neonatal, 7–28 days, with slight variations,
and estimated the impact. Both the India and Pakistan interventions reported
significant mortality reductions in the perinatal and early neonatal periods—a 32
percent reduction in neonatal mortality for India and a 15 percent lower risk of
dying for newborns in Pakistan. But neither had a significant impact for late
neonatal mortality. With limited evidence, there is no clear effect of these
interventions beyond the first seven days of life.

MOTHERS

2.80    In contrast, China’s comprehensive program showed significant impacts on
neonatal mortality after two years of exposure and marginally significant results
after four years, but no results after three, five, six, and seven years. Though
reductions in maternal mortality were stable and consistent in the China
intervention, its neonatal mortality effects were marginal and unstable.

2.81     Ten AA studies estimate the impact on neonatal mortality. [3, 14, 20, 29, 35, 37, 39, 44,
45, 47] All of them show negative impact, but only four are significant. [29, 35, 37, 45]


2.82 Infant mortality impacts were explored in the Ukraine and Brazil studies of
bundled intervention types, but only the Brazil study showed significant reductions.
Two AA studies also estimated the impact of SBA-related interventions on infant
mortality, although neither found significant effects. [4, 13]

2.83 Under-five mortality effects were estimated in two AAA-rated impact
evaluations—Brazil and Uganda—both of which found significant impacts. Brazil,
with more focus on the provider-side interventions, had a highly centralized health
care system that was not reaching the poor, but the program’s family and community-
based health interventions effectively improved health in economically disadvantaged
areas. In Uganda, where traditional top-down supervision is ineffective, community
monitoring can play an important role in improving service delivery. The Uganda
intervention focused on user-side components and showed significant and large
effects of a reduction of 49.9 deaths per 1,000 live births. Two AA studies also
estimated the impact on under-five mortality, although neither was significant. [4, 18]

2.84 Three impact evaluations (Ukraine, China, and India community) assessed
both maternal mortality and either neonatal or infant mortality. In all three, either
maternal mortality was significant or the child mortality outcome was significant,
but not both, in spite of these outcomes being closely linked in the continuum of
care. Although this phenomenon certainly merits further IE research, these early
results suggest that SBA-related interventions may not be robust across the
continuum of care.

Impact on Intermediate Outcomes

2.85 If interventions with skilled birth attendance as a component have an effect
on mortality, naturally they should also have effects on intermediate outcomes. The
review finds that although evidence is consistent in finding a desirable effect on
breastfeeding, it is thin, mixed, or unsupportive of an effect on immunization,
anthropometrics, fertility, and infant morbidity outcomes.

2.86 Family planning and fertility are the most frequently studied intermediate
outcome. The Ukraine study found significant impacts on family planning including
on abortions and the use of contraceptive pills. The Uganda study also estimated

                                                                             MOTHERS

impacts of SBA with complementary interventions on family planning and found no
significant results.

2.87 Fertility was estimated and found statistically significant in three AAA
studies: Brazil, Uganda, and India JSY. However, although Brazil and Uganda found
significant reductions in fertility from interventions that bundled SBA with
complementary interventions, the India JSY study of SBA alone found significant
increases in fertility.

2.88 Somewhat surprisingly, the review found no AAA studies that assessed the
impact of SBA on maternal nutrition, although three AA studies found a significant
and positive impact.[3, 20, 26]

2.89 Anthropometric impacts are found in the Uganda study, which reported a
significant difference in means of weight-for-age z-scores of infants between the
treatment and the control group of 0.14 standard deviations.

2.90 Infant morbidity impacts were estimated by both the India community and
Ukraine studies. The Ukraine study found no significant treatment effect for total
infant morbidity; the only component being affected is morbidity deviations (such as
heart or lung abnormalities) in the perinatal period.6 The India study found a
significant and negative impact on cough, fever, and diarrhea.

2.91 The India study also estimated the impact on care-seeking behavior in the
event of infant illness and found no significant differences between control and
intervention clusters. The Pakistan study estimated the impact on the likelihood of
mothers receiving postpartum visits by female health workers within three days of
delivery and found a significant and positive impact. The Uganda study estimated
impacts on immunization and reported average standardized effects, which are
significantly positive for the younger cohorts (newborn, under 1 year of age, and 1-
year-old).

2.92 The Pakistan study estimated the impact on mothers initiating breastfeeding
within 30 minutes and on mothers secreting colostrum; both were significant and
positive. The India community study estimated the impact on exclusive
breastfeeding for the first six weeks and likewise found a significant and positive
impact. The India JSY study estimated the impact on breastfeeding within one hour
and found a significant and positive impact.

What Do We Still Need To Know?

2.93 Most important, more high-quality research is needed on the effects of
delivering with skilled birth attendance the key indicator for MDG 5. Although it is
widely believed that professional skilled care at birth can greatly reduce maternal


                                                                                    39

MOTHERS

and neonatal mortality, Graham and others (2001) and AbuZahr and Wardlaw
(2001) pointed out more than a decade ago that there was no high-quality evidence
to show that women delivering with skilled attendance have a lower risk of dying of
maternal causes than women delivering without it. The extensive search conducted
by this systematic review found only two studies produced since that time that
address this important question (both found null results).

2.94 There are no high-quality studies on SBA interventions that include
components of health infrastructure, health information, equipment and supplies,
communication, and transport. Similarly, no high-quality studies on SBA
interventions involve nonhealth sectors, including road infrastructure
improvements, even though travel to clinics is identified as the second “delay” in
the three-delay model of skilled birth assistance.

2.95 Most SBA interventions also affected one or multiple intermediate outcomes,
such as fertility, anthropometrics, immunization, infant morbidity, care-seeking
behavior, breastfeeding, postnatal visit, and family planning, which in theory can
affect the ultimate outcomes of mortality. Although family planning and fertility are
the most frequently assessed outcomes, maternal nutrition and maternal
morbidity—especially important intermediate outcomes as shown in the logic
model—are less frequently assessed (see Appendix E).

2.96 Eight studies[12, 23, 45, 47, 50, 52, 56, 61] of 25, including five[12, 23, 52, 56, 61] of the seven
AAA impact evaluations, conducted a cost analysis. However, most of them
reported costs or cost benefit results from a diverse set of methodologies and units
of analysis that are not directly comparable. Among the seven AAA studies, five
conducted a cost analysis, of which two are cost benefit, one is cost utility, one is a
simple calculation of the total cost of the program per county per year, and the last is
the intervention cost per household in the catchment areas. The China study shows
the total cost of the program per county per year. The Brazil study shows the
average costs per municipality. The study on the community participation program
in India calculated financial and economic costs of setting up the intervention and
running costs during the trial in relation to a do-nothing alternative. The Ukraine
study calculated the cost for tangible and intangible benefits. The Uganda study
estimates the intervention cost per household. None of them provides point
estimates, a range of return on investment, or valuation of a statistical life.

2.97 There were three AA studies with more useful cost analyses if the
identification strategy of the impacts had stronger internal validity; although none
of them provides point estimates or a range of return on investment. [45, 47, 50] As a
result of this heterogeneity of quality and approach, no comparisons of cost
efficiency can be made, and the gap in understanding the cost effectiveness of these
programs remains.

Maternal Mortality
2.98 Although maternal mortality is a rare event in developed countries, it is a
recurrent event in vast regions of the world. WHO estimates that 278,000 maternal
deaths occurred worldwide in 2010. That is, each day almost 800 women die as
result of complications related to pregnancy and childbirth. Yet the distribution of
maternal deaths is not uniform across countries. Nearly all these deaths take place in
developing countries. Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia account for 56 and 29
percent of them, respectively. The maternal mortality ratio for Sub-Saharan Africa
was estimated to be 500 per 100,000 live births, which is more than twice that of
South Asia, six times as high as in Latin America, and 36 times higher than in high-
income countries (WHO and others 2012).

2.99   Most maternal deaths are linked to obstetric causes in which hemorrhage,




                                                                                    41

hypertensive disorders, infections, obstructed labor, and unsafe abortions are the
leading causes of maternal deaths (Khan and others 2006). A third of maternal
deaths are also linked to medical conditions such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, poor
nutrition, and heart conditions (Hussein and others 2012). In addition, underlying
factors such as poverty, education, cultural and economic barriers, and institutional
arrangements also affect maternal mortality (see figure in Appendix D).
Consequently, no single intervention alone is thought to reduce the rate of maternal
mortality (Campbell and Graham 2006; World Bank 2009, 2010). Packages promoted,
along the continuum of care, by the WHO include family planning, safe abortion
care, antenatal care, skilled birth attendance, and postpartum care (WHO 2010). Yet
successful implementation of them requires functional and funded health systems,
long-term and sustained commitments, monitoring and evaluation initiatives, and
the existence of synergies with cross-sectoral policies (World Bank 2009).

2.100 Until very recently, there was a general perception that little progress had
been made in reducing maternal mortality (UN 2009). The 2005 estimates reported
by WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, and the World Bank depicted a quite compelling figure
of stagnation. According to these estimates, between 1990 and 2005 the worldwide
maternal mortality ratio only decreased 0.37 percent annually (Hill and others 2007).

2.101 Yet two new empirical studies assert larger reductions of maternal mortality
in the last 20 years, despite methodological differences between them. These new
estimates indicate that between 1990 and 2010, the worldwide mortality rate
decreased annually by 3.3 percent. Regional decomposition reveals a reduction by 5
percent in South Asia, East Asia and Pacific, and the Middle East and North Africa;
by 3.8 percent in Europe and Central Asia; and by 2.6 percent in Latin America and
the Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa. At the country level, however, the two
studies indicate that there is a large dispersion in the reduction of maternal mortality
across countries within regions (see figure 2.1).

2.102 Although these estimates are encouraging, they are still not large enough to
achieve the fifth MDG. Better and more accurate assessments of the progress in
maternal mortality call for substantive improvement in the quality of data upon
which the estimates of maternal mortality are based, especially in regions where
maternal mortality is highly prevalent.

DATA DESCRIPTION
2.103 Despite its high prevalence in vast regions of the world, very few studies
evaluate the impact of development interventions—even MCH interventions—on
maternal mortality. The search yielded only eight impact evaluations, three of which
are AAA and five AA. The regional representation of the body of evidence does not
reflect the distribution of the severity of the problem across regions. Among the
reviewed evaluations, five are from South Asia (India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan);
two are from East Asia and the Pacific (China); and one from Europe and Central
Asia (Ukraine). Evaluations from Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and the
Caribbean, and the Middle East and North Africa Regions are absent.

2.104 The evaluated studies are clustered around six types of interventions, as seen
in table E.1 in Appendix E, with several interventions types utilized in a single
study. Spreading knowledge and information emerges as the most common
intervention component, with five studies reporting its inclusion. Health workforce
training as well as delivery modalities are also core intervention components in four


                                                                                                                        43

studies. Service packages and health insurance schemes appear as components in
two studies. A conditional cash transfer scheme is considered in one study.

PROVISION: HEALTH SECTOR
2.105 Only one AA study falls exclusively in the health sector, and it focuses
primarily on training of traditional birth attendants. The evaluation followed an
experimental design and was carried out in rural Pakistan. The TBAs were provided
with clean delivery kits, and were asked to visit each woman at least three times
during the pregnancy (at three, six, and nine months) to check for danger signs such
as bleeding or eclampsia and to encourage women with such signs to seek
emergency obstetrical care.[35] Although the study reports significant effects in
reducing perinatal mortality, it does not report a significant effect on maternal
mortality.

UTILIZATION
2.106 Two AA quasi-experimental evaluations evaluate the effects of programs that
ease the ability to pay for health care services in China and India, respectively. The
study from China evaluates the impact of a demand-driven health insurance
scheme, the New Cooperative Medical System. This program was implemented at
the county level with local governments deciding premiums and benefits. No
significant effects in reducing maternal mortality are reported.[18] The study from
India evaluates the JSY conditional cash transfer program, in which the transfer
depended on giving birth in a public health facility or being attended by a skilled
health worker. The evaluations of the cash transfer scheme reported no reductions in
maternal mortality.[39] Yet this late result does not reflect the introduction of supply-
side complementary interventions, which were implemented under the National
Rural Health Mission.

BUNDLED INTERVENTIONS
2.107 Bundling health provision and utilization components is common across the
reviewed studies. Five unique bundles of interventions are included in the sample of
studies, as seen in table 2.2; three of the six were AAA and two reported significant
reductions in maternal mortality, while the other three were AA and reported
insignificant effects. The first AAA study evaluates China’s Safe Motherhood
Program. This program targeted rural areas and aimed to foster qualified hospital
delivery by combining health workforce training, knowledge and information
diffusion, and the introduction of an insurance scheme. The impact evaluation
reported significant effects in reducing maternal mortality.[23] The second AAA
study evaluates the impact of Ukraine’s Mother and Infant Health Program, which
combines health workforce training on effective perinatal technologies and the

                                                                                 MOTHERS

promotion of evidence-based knowledge and information. The impact evaluation
of this program reported a marginally significant reduction in maternal mortality
when the evaluation accounted for the training provided by the program to the
medical personnel.[52]

2.108 Among AAA evaluations of bundled interventions, one RCT studied an India
intervention aimed to improve maternal health by bundling delivery modality and
knowledge and information components. A community-based strategy with
participatory women groups was used to increase knowledge and information. The
impact evaluation reported no significant effects in reducing maternal mortality.[61]
Two AA experimental studies from Bangladesh and India also use community-
based strategies. [3,38] Those interventions bundle delivery modality and knowledge
and information; the Bangladesh also includes training of health workforce (here
TBAs) while the India intervention adds on a service package (home visits, active
pregnancy and delivery notification system, and birth preparedness). Both
evaluations reported insignificant effects in reducing maternal mortality.

FINDINGS
What Do We Know About Reducing Maternal Mortality?

2.109 MCH interventions that promote skilled birth attendance through
interventions that simultaneously affect supply and demand tend to yield better
results. Although the majority of studies report statistically insignificant effects (see
details of the size effect of the interventions in figure J.2 in Appendix J), two impact
evaluations of AAA suggest significant reductions in maternal mortality attributable
to integrated MCH interventions that promote SBA through complementary and
reinforcing strategies. More specifically, these successful interventions aimed to
promote SBA by bundling the training of health workers with increasing knowledge
and information, as in Ukraine’s Mother and Infant Health Project[52] and China’s
Safe Motherhood Program, by additionally bundling an insurance scheme.[23]

2.110 Both successful interventions were implemented at the county level and
aimed to improve the quality of birth delivery services (that is, increasing birth
deliveries attended by trained personnel using upgraded technologies and evidence-
based procedures). China’s SMP was implemented by local governments and
targeted poor counties with maternal mortality rates above the national average, but
with the capacity to carry out the program and match the central government
contribution. The program also switched from the traditional supply side
reimbursement scheme to one where pregnant women get direct reimbursements. In
addition, qualified obstetric personnel from provincial tertiary hospitals were



                                                                                       45

assigned for two weeks each year to primary maternal centers to help build local
capacity.

2.111 The seven-year treatment program in China increased the hospital delivery
rate by 3.9 per 100 live births and although it decreased all-cause maternal mortality
by a modest 1.8 deaths per 100,000 live births, reductions in the maternal mortality
ratio from hemorrhage were an order of magnitude larger at 10.2 deaths averted per
100,000 live births (a 12 percent reduction relative to a baseline measure).

2.112 In contrast, the Mother and Infant Health Project in Ukraine was
implemented by the JSI Research and Training Institute with funding from the U.S.
Agency for International Development and support from the Ministry of health of
Ukraine. It targeted urban maternity hospitals through the provision of training on
effective perinatal technologies, the development of centers of excellence to train
medical personnel, and awareness campaigns to promote evidence-based good
practices. The project also aimed to improve cooperation with local government
institutions and medical universities to ensure the long-term sustainability of the
project through the revision of national medical protocols and educational curricula
of medical students and health care providers. Once spillovers and training of the
medical personnel is accounted for in the impact evaluation specification, reduction
in maternal mortality moves from not significant to barely significant at the 10
percent level.

2.113 Evidence suggests that interventions that bundle the training of TBAs with
either a service package (home visits, active pregnancy and delivery notification
system, and birth preparedness) or community-based strategies with participatory
women groups may not be enough to reduce maternal mortality.[35,3] Stand-alone
strategies affecting only the provision or utilization of services have not
demonstrated a statistically significant impact on reducing maternal
mortality.[39,18,35] Likewise, neither of the two additional studies of community-based
strategies bundled with components of delivery modalities or knowledge and
information yielded significant results.[38,61] Impact evaluations that reported
nonsignificant effects on SBA outcomes were also unlikely to report significant
impacts on maternal mortality.

2.114 In all these studies, maternal mortality is a secondary outcome. This finding is
consistent with the common practice of interventions that aim at improving
maternal mortality by affecting intermediate outcomes. In addition, the very nature
of maternal death as a low incidence event, measured per 100,000 live births,
imposes real difficulties for researchers trying to detect significant differences in
maternal mortality, requiring the collection of large samples of data, especially in


46
                                                                             CHAPTER 2
                                                                              MOTHERS

countries where civil registration data is of poor quality. Out of a sample of 181
countries, only 16 percent have a civil registration data characterized as complete,
with good attribution of cause of death (WHO and others 2012). This constraint thus
not only imposes limitations for researchers but also demand from readers certain
awareness when analyzing impact evaluation results. Unsurprisingly, of the 33
impact evaluations reporting impacts on SBA, only five of them also reported
impacts on maternal mortality.

2.115 Overall, studies tend to be underpowered to detect changes in maternal
mortality, let alone to report heterogeneous effects across population groups. All
four cluster-randomized control trial studies produced imprecise estimates of the
impact on maternal mortality. All of them acknowledged that they lacked statistical
power to detect changes on maternal mortality. Although six of eight studies were
unable to detect significant effects on maternal mortality possibly because of a lack
of statistical power, three of them report significant improvements in maternal
health outcomes such as puerperal sepsis and hemorrhage,[35] moderate
depression,[61] and knowledge of danger signs, care practices, self-reported
complications, and timely care seeking.[38] These are some of the risk factors for
maternal mortality identified by the medical literature. It is reasonable to believe
that reducing these risk factors may reduce maternal mortality, even if changes in
the latter are not detectable.

2.116 None of the studies report heterogeneous effects, and only one study
provides a cost-benefit measure of averting a maternal death, although limited.
Also, the length of exposure to treatment across studies ranges from 0.75 to 7 years,
with experimental studies having on average the shortest exposure to treatment (2
years) compared to quasi-experimental studies (4 years). In addition, the length of
the exposure to treatment seems to be correlated with the significance.7 Sustained
interventions tend to yield effects on maternal mortality. The Safe Motherhood
Program from China, for instance, reported significant effects on maternal mortality
only after four years of intervention,[23] although they diminished in the last year.

What Do We Still Need To Know?

2.117 The body of evidence is not uniformly distributed across regions. Despite
being the region with the highest maternal mortality ratios and the largest share of
the world’s maternal deaths, Sub-Saharan Africa presents no impact evaluation
studies with maternal mortality outcomes. Similarly, no impact evaluation studies of
maternal mortality come from Latin America and the Caribbean or the Middle East
and North Africa Regions.

2.118 Important gaps still remain in the impact evaluation evidence regarding
which interventions are effective in reducing maternal mortality. The current body
of evidence is thin across all intervention types. In particular, little is known about
the impact of family planning policies on maternal mortality, despite declining
fertility being a potential factor in explaining the overall downward trend observed
for the maternal mortality ratio. Likewise, there are few evaluations on the impact of
universal health insurance policies and women’s education on averting maternal
mortality. Also, there is scant evidence to identify effective interventions associated
with referral systems, transportation, and infrastructure of health facilities.

reducing maternal mortality, list strategic support for family planning, SBA, spread
of preventive knowledge, training of health workers, and women’s education
policies (World Bank 2010). Yet AAA impact evaluations of the effects of such
initiatives by the World Bank or other institutions on maternal mortality are scant
across regions. To the degree that this paucity of evidence is a function of the lack of
suitable data, the Bank and its member countries in these regions may be well
served by strengthening the gathering of vital statistics.

3. Children
3.1    This chapter covers interventions that affect mortality from birth to five years.
Three child mortality outcomes are examined: neonatal (0–28 days old), infant
(under one year) and child (under five years of age). Thus, the interventions in this
chapter cover the continuum of care from birth through early childhood. Newborns
are primarily affected by circumstances at birth, whereas infant and child mortality
is heavily driven by disease—diarrhea, malaria, and pneumonia.

3.2     Notwithstanding significant recent progress in improving child health, the
majority of child deaths take place in poor, rural, and remote areas affected by
severe human resources shortages, minimal infrastructure, and inadequate health
service quality (UNICEF 2009). In such an environment, many children die from
preventable causes: sepsis, asphyxia, and prematurity for newborns, and diarrhea,
pneumonia, measles, malaria, HIV/AIDS, and underlying causes of undernutrition
for infants and children.

3.3     The Bellagio child survival study group estimated that if interventions shown
in efficacy trials to improve child health were universally available and used, 63
percent of child deaths could be prevented (Jones and others 2003). Among effective
preventive interventions are antenatal steroids, clean delivery, exclusive
breastfeeding in the first six months, complementary feeding, access to water and
sanitation, zinc and vitamin A supplementation, and measles and tetanus
vaccination (Jones and others 2003). Treatment interventions include oral
rehydration therapy; antibiotics for pneumonia, sepsis and dysentery; and
antimalarials. The challenge now lies in effective delivery and uptake.

3.4    Newborn survival benefits from interventions along the continuum of care
such as family planning services, antenatal care, and clean delivery. Because the
majority of newborn deaths occur in poor households with limited access to health
care services, family-community care of the newborn (exclusive breastfeeding,
warmth protection, clean cord care, infection prevention, and care seeking for
emergencies) is considered essential to prevent mortality in the first weeks of life
(Lawn and others 2005). Home-based care alone cannot effectively treat
complications of preterm birth and asphyxia or of neonatal tetanus and community-
acquired infections. Treatment for these illnesses should be provided jointly with
key clinical interventions such as neonatal resuscitation, extra care for low birth
weight babies, and access to emergency care. Diarrhea and pneumonia, the two
leading causes of death of children under five in developing countries, are
preventable with intersectoral action.

                                                                              CHILDREN

3.5    Poor-quality water supply and lack of sanitation in poor households and
communities are important vectors of water-borne diseases. Interventions providing
safe water sources, adequate sanitation, and the promotion of better hygiene
practices, such as hand-washing, can reduce child mortality. Gunther and Fink
(2011) estimated that universal coverage of water and sanitation infrastructure alone
could lead to a total reduction of 2.2 million child deaths per year in the developing
world. Yet to benefit from infrastructure and other health inputs, households must
have some health knowledge and information, such as knowing to boil piped water
for drinking (Jalan and Ravallion 2003).

3.6    Prevention of pneumonia starts by ensuring immunization (measles,
Haemophilus influenza type B, and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines), adequate
nutrition, and exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months, which reduces the
probability of infection (UNICEF 2008). Environmental factors such as indoor air
pollution can also cause pneumonia, so switching to cleaner fuels and using better
stoves to increase fuel efficiency can decrease the risk of dying from pneumonia
(Rehfuess 2006). Once a newborn is infected, survival depends on recognizing
danger signs of the disease, ensuring access to medical care and antibiotics and
monitoring effective treatment (Wardlaw and others 2006). Community-based case
management of pneumonia has been recognized to have a significant impact on
under-five mortality (Sazawal and Black 2003).

3.7     In addition, Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI), developed by
WHO and UNICEF, is considered an effective intervention to lower child mortality
rates. Integration of neonatal health into IMCI programs is widely considered an
essential instrument to reduce newborn deaths, although its integration is only in the
beginning stages. IMCI focuses on improving health workers’ case management skills,
strengthening the health system, and addressing family and community practices in
order to address the major causes of deaths in children (WHO 2005b). It has been
implemented in more than 100 countries, and the most recent multicountry study,
based on non-impact evaluation evidence, stated that it effectively reduced under-five
mortality (WHO 2005a). However, as reported in this chapter, impact evaluations of
IMCI or the integrated management of neonatal and childhood illness are few; the
evidence that does exist is mixed and far from conclusive.

3.8   This chapter reviews 49 studies with 53 impact evaluations, 17 AAA and 36
AA. The breakdown by specific intervention type can be seen in table 3.1. In contrast
to Chapter 2 on mothers, governance and nonhealth sector interventions are better
represented here. This difference is perhaps unsurprising, given the effect that
improving water and sanitation and reducing air pollution can have on decreasing
mortality. Energy interventions have also been evaluated to determine their effect on

Neonatal Mortality
3.9     Around 3 million babies annually die within seven days of birth in less
developed regions, and an additional 1 million die before one month of life (Lawn
and others 2005).1 Most infant and under-five deaths occur during the first month of
life. Newborn deaths represent 40 percent of under-five mortality (Black and others
2003). So reducing child deaths by two- thirds by 2015, MDG 4 will depend largely
on the extent to which countries can decrease neonatal mortality.

3.10 Even when a set of clinical cost-effective interventions has been shown to
prevent newborn deaths,[20] more than half of newborn deaths in the developing
world occur at home, without access to skilled care from preventable conditions
such as sepsis (including pneumonia and tetanus), asphyxia (lack of oxygen at
birth), and conditions from prematurity or low birth weight (WHO 2005a).
Consequently, although child mortality has seen a substantial and sustainable
decrease over the past 30 years, neonatal mortality improvements have been slow




                                                                                  53

and difficult to quantify, as the provision and utilization of interventions or
packages of interventions targeting the neonatal period is neither universal nor
comprehensive across regions and within countries. It will be essential to increase
use and access to postnatal care at home and at health facilities, including access to
emergency neonatal services, especially during the first days of life and for low-
weight babies for whom the risk of dying is even greater.

DATA DESCRIPTION
3.11 Reducing newborn mortality starts with ensuring maternal health during
pregnancy and delivery. The review includes a total of 23 studies – representing 26
impact evaluations – with neonatal mortality (early, late, or perinatal mortality) as a
primary outcome of interest. Only three of these studies have neonatal mortality as
an exclusive outcome of interest, as newborn health is intrinsically linked to
maternal interventions and child programs.

3.12 Nine of the 26 of evaluations were rated AAA and 17 were AA. The findings
of this section are based primarily on the AAA studies, which covered a variety of
intervention groups. Standardized effect sizes and imputed confidence intervals can
be seen visually in figure J.3 in Appendix J. The majority of AAA studies apply
quasi-experimental methods (6), mainly instrumental variables and difference-in-
difference approaches, as opposed to experimental designs (that is, RCTs) (3). The
converse occurs for AA impact evaluations, 14 of 17 are RCTs—random allocation of
treatment at the cluster, community, or health facility level.

3.13 The evaluations represent evidence from 11 developing countries, but the
majority of AAA impact evaluations (5/9) were concentrated in the South Asia
Region, followed by East Asia (3/9). Latin America and the Caribbean produced
only one AAA evaluation. Sub-Saharan Africa has three such studies. All but one
evaluation were carried out in low-income countries.

3.14 Most studies evaluate the following interventions: governance (1), provision
(2), and interventions aimed at increasing the utilization of health services (2). The
four studies left are concentrated on bundled interventions (numerous component
activities). The reviewed impact evaluations address strategies considered in
observational studies to reduce neonatal mortality (Darmstadt and others 2005),
including antenatal care, SBA, community health education on safe motherhood and
newborn care, maternal schooling, water and sanitation, and CCTs.

GOVERNANCE
3.15 The single evaluation that targeted the political agency of women
(governance) found a 24 percent reduction on neonatal mortality as a result of

                                                                                  CHILDREN

increased women's political representation, which was measured by women being
elected to state legislative assemblies in India. In addition to a significant increase in
health infrastructure in the states exposed to the treatment, the study found
improved probabilities of attending antenatal care, taking iron supplements during
pregnancy, giving birth in a government facility instead of at home, and early
initiation of breastfeeding.

PROVISION: HEALTH SECTOR
3.16 Two impact evaluations evaluate interventions that are exclusively under
health sector provision. One service management evaluation in Zimbabwe,
comparing a five-visit antenatal care model with the standard model in a rural area,
found no difference in perinatal mortality associated with reducing the number of
visits for women who visited a health clinic for antenatal care. This finding provides
evidence that a goal-oriented routine model was as effective as the standard model.
An AA evaluation of a health workforce program to train TBAs in the Democratic
Republic of Congo found, at a 95 percent confidence level, no reduction on perinatal
mortality associated with either essential newborn care or training in a newborn
resuscitation program. Other evaluations that examine health sector components as
part of a bundled intervention are discussed below.

PROVISION: NONHEALTH SECTORS
3.17 Three evaluations examine nonhealth sector provision interventions, two of
which fall in education and one in water and sanitation. Two maternal schooling
studies in Indonesia and Taiwan, China, consistently showed positive effects on
reducing newborn and infant mortality once endogeneity was taken into account.
The studies applied quasi-experimental techniques and analyzed two reforms to
increase the length of compulsory education, which as a consequence increased the
number of schools in treated provinces. These studies assessed the net effect of the
program; no sufficient information is provided on the causal chain. Using differing
seasonal prenatal exposure to agrichemicals, an AA evaluation of water quality
found detrimental effects of fertilizer on neonatal mortality among poor Indian
children. Children of uneducated poor women were more affected.

UTILIZATION
3.18 Three quasi-experimental evaluations on two large well-known income
increasing programs (CCTs and financial incentives programs) aiming to increase
health care utilization were reviewed: one in Mexico’s Progresa (now Oportunidades)
and two in India on the impact of the JSY project on neonatal mortality at the district
level. Although there are significant effects on infant mortality in Mexico associated
with Progresa, there was no significant effect on neonatal mortality. As discussed in


                                                                                         55
CHAPTER 3
CHILDREN

Chapter 2 on the effect of SBA, India’s financial incentive program was associated
with positive effects on women’s access to maternity services in both AA and AAA
studies, but neither of the impact evaluations found a positive impact at the district
level on improving neonatal or early neonatal mortality, even in districts with high
quality of care.[46]. The authors of the AA evaluation cited statistical power as a
potential explanation of the null result. This evaluation also used a less robust exact
match methodology for individual-level data and found a small but significant effect
on perinatal and neonatal mortality.[39]

BUNDLED INTERVENTIONS
3.19 Four studies are concentrated on bundled interventions between health sector
provision and utilization components across service delivery: delivery modality and
service packages; health workforce (for example, training); and knowledge and
information. Bundled interventions render mixed results. On one hand, two RCTs—
one carried out in Jharkhand and Orissa, India,[61] and another in Makwanpur,
Nepal45]—aimed to improve home newborn care practices through health education
(knowledge and information) delivered at the community level by women’s groups
(delivery modality) found a significant one-third reduction on neonatal mortality.

3.20 On the other hand, evidence on the impact of delivering newborn care
packages2 at the community level (delivery-modality) in large-scale trials gives mixed
results. One 24-month AAA study in Pakistan[10] and a supporting 30-month AA
study in Bangladesh[5] assessed essential care service packages through different
delivery approaches. They show a positive effect on reducing neonatal mortality by
promoting essential newborn care through home visits and community health
education. The evaluation in Pakistan noted positive synergies of linking and
delivering the package through female health system workers in collaboration with
voluntary community health committees and TBAs. Its results, however, were
affected by low coverage and take-up of the intervention and low follow-up rates
caused by the competing demands of the health workers. Half of the intervention
clusters (249) also established emergency transport funds. These community-based
interventions are implemented under different contexts, and components as well as
the quality of delivery might also vary.

3.21    Integrating newborn care into existing maternal and child programs, such as
Safe Motherhood and Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illness, is a
strategy believed to provide optimum care of newborns when health system
constraints exist (Knippenberg and others 2005). Two relevant studies were included
in the review. The Safe Motherhood Program in China[23] was implemented in
counties with high maternal mortality and neonatal mortalities levels. It does not

                                                                                   CHILDREN

demonstrate an impact on reducing newborn deaths, although, as discussed earlier, it
does show a significant impact on reducing neonatal tetanus and maternal mortality
through improving “health education, health infrastructure, and social mobilization.”
Another study evaluated the IMNCI large trial in India.[9] It showed a significant
effect on late and perinatal mortality, but not on early neonatal mortality, possibly, as
authors noted, as the result of misclassification between stillborn and newborn deaths.
However, it is important to note that the program’s effect was greater on home births,
not in facility births, which is consistent with its findings on improved home-based
care practices.
What Do We Know About Reducing Neonatal Mortality?

3.22 Overall, AAA studies with interventions that fall under the health sector and
provide knowledge and information demonstrate significant reductions on
neonatal mortality, in particular those associated with delivering a service package
at the community level. The only study targeting governance through an increased
political representation of women reported positive impacts on newborn survival.
Finally, evaluations aimed to increase women’s schooling reported significant
reductions in neonatal mortality.

3.23 The results indicate that investing in female education has a significant
positive effect on reducing neonatal mortality. Better-educated women are
considered to be more efficient in ensuring the health of their children and families
through promoting better nutrition, hygienic practices, and health seeking
behavior.[19,17] Findings from these two national school reforms illustrate the
intergenerational positive effect of schooling on neonatal survival. Similarly
important, the findings show that increasing governance and political agency are
extremely important instruments to reduce neonatal mortality.[8] Empowering
women and communities through promoting the political representation of women
is critical to improve policies and institutions, especially given that many countries
still strive to integrate neonatal care into their maternal and child national programs.

3.24 Based on three AAA [9,10,61] and four AA impact evaluations,[37,45,47] the evidence
also suggests that community-based approaches for delivering packages of neonatal
care can significantly reduce early and perinatal mortality through improved, home-
based, newborn care practices, such as exclusive breastfeeding, clean umbilical cord
care, thermal care for the baby (for example, delaying the first bath and promoting skin-
to-skin contact), and improved detection of danger signs and referral to skilled health
facilities. The impact of these strategies is strengthened by the inclusion of linkages with
trained community-health workers[10,9] or TBA training on safe delivery, such as the
availability of a safe delivery kit, recognition of common obstetric and newborn



                                                                                         57

emergencies, and treatment of newborn asphyxia.[47,3] Interventions that provided home
visits with community mobilization as in women’s group education sessions in
India,[9,37] Bangladesh,[5] and Pakistan[10] significantly reduced neonatal mortality.

Box 3.1. Training of Traditional Birth Attendants in Delivering Neonatal Care: Evidence from
Three AA Studies
Training of health workers, such as midwives, auxiliary nurses, and community health
workers, is an important component in delivering service packages at the home or
community level (WHO 2005a). Although most of the studies that include training are
bundled with other components of the intervention, training nonhealth sector workers in
delivering newborn care was the subject of three AA studies specifically targeting
TBAs.[14,35,29]
Two of these evaluations were carried out in rural poor settings in Pakistan and Zambia.
They found a significant impact of TBAs’ training on lowering neonatal mortality (30–45
percent decline). One focused on maternal care; the other targeted newborn care practices.
The program in the province of Sindh in Pakistan provided birth attendants with clean
home delivery kits and trained them in early recognition of obstetric danger signs.
Conversely, the community-based effectiveness trial in rural Zambia provided TBAs with
skills targeting birth asphyxia and sepsis using an adaption of the neonatal resuscitation
protocol as well as administration of antibiotics and referral.a
It is important to note that both studies build on an existing infrastructure for community
health care delivery. In Zambia, TBAs were part of the extended health care system and
have already received training in basic obstetric care and clean delivery. Similarly, the Lady
Health Workers Program facilitated the link with TBAs in Pakistan. Each of these lady
workers is attached to a government health facility, from which they receive training, a
small allowance and medical supplies.
In contrast to these evaluations, a third randomized study, carried out in the Democratic
Republic of Congo, where TBAs or nurse midwives are not as organized within the health
system as in other settings and have limited training in essential newborn care, found no
demonstrable effect of a newborn resuscitation program on neonatal or perinatal mortality.
In all of these settings, at least half of births occurred at home, mostly with the assistance of
traditional attendants.
a. Includes rapidly drying and warming the newborn, clearing airways, and evaluating respiratory effort, skin color, and tone.

3.25 The lessons from the evaluations of community-based interventions and
health worker training are likely broadly applicable to poor rural settings, where
most women deliver their babies at home with traditional birth assistance and
limited access to emergency obstetric care. These are settings where infections are
one of the main causes of newborn deaths and certain cultural practices, such as
bathing within the first six hours, can increase the risk of dying for newborns.

3.26  Demand-side barriers can directly affect the likelihood of mothers to seek
medical assistance for newborns. However, the review’s findings show that CCTs


58
                                                                             CHAPTER 3
                                                                              CHILDREN

and financial incentives, while having positive effects on increasing SBA and in
some instances reducing maternal mortality, do not reduce newborn deaths. Skilled
professional care at delivery can reduce mortality from birth asphyxia and sepsis,
treat premature babies, and manage complications (WHO 2005a). However,
programs that target mothers’ health may be missing the opportunity to affect early
neonatal mortality, a time when death can be mitigated through medical care. More
rigorous research is required on available demand-side interventions designed to
reduce neonatal mortality, in particular, other voucher maternal programs in place
in other regions such as Africa or Latin America and the Caribbean.

3.27 Integrating newborn care into the IMCI program, focused traditionally on
infant and child health, significantly reduced late neonatal deaths in India in
deliveries at home, but not those happening in the first days of life or in health
facilities. The study indicates that the impact of the program would be strengthened
by including prenatal care and referral systems, high-quality training to ensure
adequate supervision, and timely supplies and task-based incentives for community
health workers.[9]

3.28 Several studies included in the review highlight challenges that affect program
implementation and their effectiveness at scale. For instance, home-based postnatal
visits by trained workers can be seriously reduced as the result of poor geographic
accessibility, high workload, and difficulties in receiving timely notification of
deliveries because surveillance and registration systems are seldom in place to
identify mothers and neonates.[10,5] Given the short period when mothers who deliver
at home can be visited or treated by health workers and a newborn’s health assessed,
the lack of resources or coverage at the community level to monitor home births in the
first days might lead to the underreporting of mortality rates and an underestimation
of the programs’ effects.

3.29 Information systems and strengthening vital statistics would help improve
impact assessments. For instance, the evaluation of Progresa in Mexico[6] indicates
that the underreporting of child deaths can underestimate the reduction in infant
mortality at the municipality level.

What Do We Still Need To Know?

3.30 Important gaps exist in several types of interventions for neonatal mortality.
The systematic review identified only one study on strategy planning and policy.
Therefore, evaluations of interventions on decentralization, monitoring systems, or
public-private partnerships are missing. In addition, only one evaluation was
included on service management. Consequently, more evaluations are needed



                                                                                      59

associated with health sector interventions addressing health infrastructure and
health workforce, such as improvement of the quality and availability of health care
facilities for essential or emergency newborn care and the effect of increasing
specialized newborn care skills at the facility level.

3.31 Following an adapted framework of the three-delay model for newborn
mortality (Barnes-Josiah and others 1998), a vast majority of evaluations included in
the analysis provide evidence on interventions tackling the first delay on maternal
and newborn care: deciding to seek appropriate medical help for an emergency or
complication either by increasing knowledge and information, or by modifying the
behaviors or beliefs to delay care. Most birth and neonatal deaths occur at home in
rural settings with poor demand or lack of access to facility delivery and postnatal
services. However, reaching an appropriate facility (the second delay) and receiving
adequate care when a facility is reached (the third delay) are also important, yet only
two AAA and two AA evaluations addressed these factors. No evaluation was
identified that exclusively dealt with the availability of referral systems, including
improved communications and roads, in rural poor areas.

3.32 Another knowledge gap is related to health financing interventions, such as
performance-based financing, contracting, or incentives for improving the quality of
postnatal care except for those included in the packages (for example, safe
motherhood). Notably missing are evaluations that address the utilization of health
services, such as community health insurance and prepayment schemes, loan
schemes and revolving funds, and other innovative financial mechanisms.

3.33 More evidence is needed on the integration of newborn care in maternal and
child programs. The review only found two AAA and one AA studies. In addition,
more evidence is required on health systems’ capacity in delivering integrated
packages excluded from MCH strategies. Evaluations on promoting integrated
packages, such as community-based interventions that act in combination with
social protection and intersectoral action in education, water and sanitation,
empowerment, and poverty reduction are missing.

3.34 1.22 Even though half of newborn deaths occurred in South Asian countries,
the 10 countries with the highest neonatal mortality rates (NMR>45 per 1,000 live
births) are all in Sub-Saharan Africa. Yet only 12 percent of evaluations took place in
countries in the Africa Region (three studies). Two of them assessed the impact of
TBA training, and one evaluated a program that reduced the number of antenatal
visits. None of them was an AAA study. This evidence is needed on improving
newborn practices, demand for newborn care, and quality of care in Sub-Saharan
Africa.

3.35 None of the evaluations that were reviewed reported on heterogeneous
effects. Information available to assess the cost-benefit and effectiveness of strategies
is limited. Estimates from three studies show an incremental cost per newborn life
saved between $910 for a community-based participatory intervention in India[61]
and $3,442 for a similar intervention in Nepal[45] excluding health service
strengthening costs. The costs of health personnel training and procurement of
supplies for treating newborn infections at public hospitals vary between $2,995 for
a home care intervention in Bangladesh[5] and $4,397 for a women’s group
intervention in Nepal.[45]

Infant Mortality
3.36 Infant mortality rates have decreased worldwide during the past two
decades, from 61 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 37 deaths per 1,000 live births
in 2011 (IGME 2011). This progress is encouraging, but not sufficient to reach MDG 4
targets in most countries. An estimated 5 million children die during the first year of
life (3 million within the first month), comprising 72 percent of all deaths within the
first five years. Children born in Sub-Saharan Africa have the highest risk of death.

3.37 Deaths within the first year are generally classified by neonatal deaths (0–28
days) and postneonatal deaths (1–12 months), the causes of which are markedly
different. The majority of neonatal deaths are due to complications at birth, while
the leading causes of postneonatal deaths are pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria. As
neonatal mortality was treated separately in the previous section, this section
focuses more broadly on interventions to address causes of death within the entire
first year. It covers a wide spectrum of intervention types, including work in
governance, water and sanitation, energy, and education, that can inform the main

challenges in preventing infant and early child deaths: the scale-up, delivery, and
utilization of known interventions.

DATA DESCRIPTION
3.38 The team’s search yielded 23 impact evaluations (22 studies) with infant
mortality as an outcome, 11 of which are AAA and 12 of which are AA studies. Only
five randomized controlled trials were found, whereas the remaining 18 utilize a
quasi-experimental design (difference in difference being the most common). From
all 23 evaluations, 12 different categories of interventions are represented, 7 impact
evaluations report heterogeneous effects, and 3 offer cost analysis.

GOVERNANCE
3.39 Governance interventions are found in four studies, one of which is AAA and
three of which are AA. Only one AAA study evaluates the effects of strategy
planning and policy, and it is the only governance intervention to take place
outside of South America. In India, an increase in the share of female-held seats in
the state assembly reduced district-wide infant mortality by 1.4 percentage points, or
a 14 percent reduction, at a marginal significance level (see figure J.4 in Appendix
J).[8] For AA evaluations, one of two in strategy presents a significant effect and the
remaining public financial management study also lowers mortality.[11,33,30]

PROVISION: HEALTH SECTOR
3.40 No AAA and only two AA studies sit squarely in the health sector. The
majority of interventions bundle components of provision with household or
individual utilization, and are addressed separately. The first AA study is an
evaluation of a health financing intervention in Cambodia that tested two designs
for contracting management of public facilities to nongovernmental
organizations.[13] Neither treatment arm significantly reduced infant mortality,
although this may be a result of insufficient statistical power because of the small
sample size. Improvements to intermediate outcomes, such as diarrhea treatment
and breastfeeding, were observed. The second study examined the Village Midwife
program in India, combing delivery modality, health workforce and service
packages. Once again, there was not a significant effect on infant mortality.[57]

PROVISION: NONHEALTH SECTOR
3.41 IEG found nine evaluations pertaining to the nonhealth sectors of energy,
water and sanitation, and education. Six are AAA evaluations from interventions in
Latin America and Asia, all of which find substantive results. Two energy studies
find mortality reductions as a result of pollution regulation. In Mexico, the potential
advertising benefits of voluntary pollution reduction by firms led to a 16 percent

decrease in infant mortality from respiratory illness.[25] In China, across high-
polluting prefectures subject to a national pollution policy, there was a 21 percent
reduction in infant mortality (excluding death from poisoning and injury).[60] The
effect was stronger for daughters and all children of women with little education.

3.42 In the water and sanitation sector, a national piped water program decreased
infant mortality in counties in Brazil, and more so in areas with higher baseline
mortality rates.[28] In one district of Bangladesh, arsenic poisoning in backyard tube
wells prompted households to instead obtain water from geographically distant
sources. The evaluation found that this switch resulted in the usage of water
contaminated with fecal pathogens and increased infant mortality by 27 percent at a
marginal significance level (see figure J.4 in Appendix J).[24] Similar results were
found when the study was replicated nationally, giving field evidence and causal
credence to the importance of water and sanitation in infant mortality.

3.43    Higher parental education levels from a national school construction
program lowered infant mortality in Taiwan, China, by 13 percent and in Indonesia
by 43 percent.[19,17] In the latter program, the effect on mortality was smaller and less
significant for infant deaths before the mother reached age 25, and the authors found
that both the mother’s and father’s education levels were equally important.

3.44 Of three additional AA studies, another school construction intervention in
Chile found no effect on infant mortality.[1] One water and sanitation intervention of
improved infrastructure through a social fund in Peru found no overall effect,
although an evaluation of agrichemical water contamination in India reports a
significant increase in infant mortality levels.[15,33]

UTILIZATION
3.45 One AAA study finds that Progresa (now Oportunidades), the well-known
income increasing CCT program in Mexico, led to a 17 percent drop in infant
mortality. The reduction was even higher in disadvantaged municipalities. The
transfer was given to mothers and conditioned on school attendance and health
checkups for children as well as preventative health care for pregnant and lactating
women. An AA study of a household environment and infrastructure intervention
that provided clean cook stoves found no effect.[22]

components present positive results. A study on providing health workforce

and information to improve safe motherhood practices found significant decreases
in infant mortality.[52] An IMCI program in a northern state in India, which trained
the workforce to deliver a specific service package and also increased household
knowledge, found that infants who received the intervention faced a 15 percent
lower hazard of dying (see figure J.4 in Appendix J). The effect was stronger for
those born at home.[9] Two AA-quality interventions bundle provision components
with knowledge and information, one of which is significant (table 3.2).[4,58]

3.47 Two evaluations examine the same program at the intersection of governance
and service provision. Brazil’s Programa Saúde da Família decentralizes family health
services by assigning health teams to a geographical area that includes about 3,500
people. The AAA evaluation shows a small but significant 5 percent decrease in

infant mortality.[56] The AA study of the same program finds that a 10 percent
increase in coverage lowered mortality by 0.5 percent.[42]

FINDINGS
What Do We Know About Reducing Infant Mortality?

3.48 Overall, AAA evaluations of interventions that fall in nonhealth sectors offer
compelling evidence of reductions in infant mortality. The estimated effects from
interventions in energy, education, and water and sanitation are consistently large
and significant and directly address causes of pneumonia and diarrhea, which
together cause 29 percent of global deaths under the age of 5 (Liu and others 2012). It
should be noted that, with the exception of two water and sanitation projects, all the
other sector interventions were large-scale government programs that often required
significant planning, resources, and sustained involvement.

3.49 Pollution regulations were effective both when mandatory at the prefecture
level in China and when voluntary for firms across Mexico. The large effects of these
programs may be due in part to the high levels of pollution in these countries, and
less polluted areas might observe a smaller effect.[60,25] A primary school
construction program in Indonesia is notable for its large 43 percent reduction in
infant mortality. The authors of both school construction studies suggest that
educated mothers may be better able to take advantage of available health resources
for their children.[17,19] The results from Taiwan, China, also indicate that maternal
education may be of greater value in preventing post-neonatal deaths. The water
and sanitation evaluations emphasize this sector’s importance in infant health,
partially through reverse evidence of interventions that actually increase infant
mortality.[28,24,15,33]

3.50 An examination of all AAA and AA health sector studies highlights the
potential benefits of providing integrated family health care services at the
community level. Of the seven health sector provision interventions with similar
components, some commonalities arose from the three AAA evaluations and two of
four AA evaluations that were significant. Ukraine’s Mother and Infant Health
Program (AAA), India’s IMNCI (AAA), Brazil’s Programa Saúde da Família (one AAA;
one AA), and Indonesia’s SMP (AA) all aimed to increase the supply of trained health
workers providing services across the continuum of care.[52,9,56,42,4] Ukraine’s Mother
and Infant Health Project is a bit of an anomaly, as it provided technical training to
well-educated hospital staff, but the remaining interventions provided these services
directly to villages and communities, often making household visits.

                                                                                      CHILDREN

3.51 Further analysis of these health sector evaluations is particularly challenging
due to the complicated nature of health service provision. All of the above-
mentioned interventions bundle at least one (and generally more) of the following
four components: delivery modality, service package, health workforce, and
knowledge and information (see table 3.2). From this small pool of impact
evaluation evidence, it is not feasible to determine which component drives the
results in each study, nor one component that is sufficient for success across studies.
Two AA evaluations do provide one interesting piece of evidence by allowing a
comparison of Indonesia’s Village Midwife Program and its follow-up SMP.[57,4] The
SMP found a marginally significant effect on infant mortality, although its
predecessor did not. The programs were largely similar except for the lack of
household outreach activities in the initial program, which the authors note as a
potential reason for its failure. However, the knowledge and information
component is present in nonsignificant studies and not a sure path to an effective
intervention.


Box 3.2. Expanded Participation in Health Provision and Funding Decisions May Reduce Infant
Mortality
One AAA and several AA evaluations of governance interventions establish a potential link
between expanded participation in processes that affect the provision and funding of public
health services and reductions in infant mortality. The authors of a study in India assert that
female politicians are more likely to support policies and expenditures that favor public
health services. Increasing the share of female-held seats in state assemblies, where public
health provision decisions are made, lowered infant mortality by 14 percent.[8]
In regard to funding decisions, an AA study in Brazil shows that municipalities that
adopted participatory budgeting saw a 10 percent decrease in infant mortality, and spent a
greater proportion of the budget in health and sanitation.[30] Further, resources spent on
health and sanitation had a significantly larger effect on infant mortality when allocated
through participatory budgeting instead of non-participatory methods. The effect of social
investment funds is shown in two AA evaluations with mixed results: It led to marginally
significant decreases in infant mortality in Brazil but had no overall effect in a similar
program in Peru (although it was significant for households living in extreme poverty).[11,33]
This evidence on funding processes originates solely from AA evaluations in Latin America
and requires further evaluations to confirm the results.


3.52 Across multiple sectors, several studies point to a trend in which
interventions were more effective in poorer households. The evaluation of Progresa
in rural Mexico examined a number of heterogeneous effects, and found a larger
impact on infant mortality in more disadvantaged municipalities, or those with
lower rates of electricity coverage, higher rates of illiteracy, and higher household



                                                                                             67

occupancy levels.[6] However, the study also found the program to be less successful
in municipalities with lower levels of sanitation, as measured by access to piped
water, presence of dirt floors, and percentage of workers in the primary sector (who
are more likely to bring animal fecal matter into the home). The study draws a
distinction between sanitation levels and socioeconomic levels and concludes that
the rural CCT program required a minimum level of sanitation to be effective, and
once met, households in more disadvantaged municipalities realized greater
program benefits.

3.53 The positive impact of piped water in Brazil demonstrated similar results,
where counties of low socioeconomic status demonstrated a greater mortality
reduction, although only after a minimal level of development had been achieved.[28]
Further, among counties with similarly high or low development levels, the
provision of piped water had a stronger effect among those with higher baseline
mortality rates. An AA evaluation of Peru’s social development fund FONCODES
revealed a similar trend, as it reported a significant mortality reduction for
extremely poor households, although no effect was found for poor households.[33]

3.54 In the selected infant mortality impact evaluations, cost analysis exists in only
three AAA studies. The provision of piped water in Brazil was found to be more
cost effective when it occurred in areas with higher infant mortality compared to
low ($630 versus $2010 per averted infant death, respectively).[28] The evaluation of
the Mother and Infant Health Project in Ukraine found a cost-benefit ratio of 1 to 97
when it accounted for savings in delivery costs and the value of saved lives.[52] The
evaluation of Brazil’s Programa Saúde da Família asserts that the program is highly
cost effective, although the authors only provide the number of lives saved over
time and program administration costs per municipality.[56]

What Do We Still Need To Know?

3.55 Additional AAA studies are needed for all intervention categories. Within
health provision, evaluations of community-based programs, workforce training
activities, or health financing experiments would be particularly instructive.
Sophisticated impact evaluations that could isolate the individual and
complementary effects of the provision and utilization components of bundled
interventions would be especially welcome. Impact evaluations of the effect of
governance interventions on infant mortality are promising, but also quite sparse
and arise almost completely from Latin America. Moreover, it is remarkable that
more IEs of widely replicated interventions are not available. Of all the CCT, IMCI,
and SMPs around the world, the team’s search identified only one AAA study of
each of these types of programs that estimated impacts on infant mortality.

3.56 Finally, substantial gaps by geography also exist. Of 23 evaluations, 9 fall in
Latin America and the Caribbean (5 in Brazil) and 6 each in South Asia and East
Asia and the Pacific. No evaluations take place in Sub-Saharan Africa, despite the
significant number of global infant deaths occurring in this region. Across all
regions, only two low-income countries are represented (Bangladesh and
Cambodia). Furthermore, there is little information from the five countries that
contribute more than half of the global deaths of children under five: India, Nigeria,
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan, and China (Liu and others 2012).
Although India has relatively good coverage from four studies, there is only one
from China, and the remaining three countries have none. Knowledge of effective
interventions in these specific country contexts could have a considerable impact in
lowering global child mortality levels.

Under-Five Mortality
3.57 Globally, under-five mortality has fallen by approximately 20 percent in the
last decade; despite this progress, 7.6 million under-five children still died in 2010
alone (Liu and others 2012), and few countries are on track to meet MDG 4. Given
the inclusive nature of this indicator, which incorporates both neonatal and infant
mortality, there is a greater breadth of possible interventions, ranging from antenatal
care and birth attendance to infant care, nutrition and immunization programs, and
water and sanitation improvements to prevent waterborne diseases.

DATA DESCRIPTION
The review found 17 impact evaluations that addressed under-five mortality, five of
which were AAA and 15 of which reported significant results. The significant
studies covered 14 intervention types, and 8 of the studies (2 AAA and 6 AA)
bundled multiple interventions into a single program.

GOVERNANCE
3.58 Only one impact evaluation looked at an intervention that was wholly
governance focused. The AA evaluation looked at public financial management in
municipalities in southern Brazil and found a highly significant decrease caused by
increased water and sanitation and health spending.[30]

PROVISION: HEALTH SECTOR
3.59 One AA study evaluated an intervention that increased the availability of
medical products and technology, and made changes to service management. It
was marginally significant (see figure J.5 in Appendix J).[43]

PROVISION: NONHEALTH SECTORS
3.60 The three AAA studies in nonhealth sectors were significant, and two of them
evaluated water and sanitation programs. In Bangladesh, the government launched a
district-level campaign encouraging people to switch water sources, which resulted in
many families using contaminated water. This led to a large increase in child
mortality, illustrating the importance of water quality for child health.[24] In Argentina,
a national water privatization program led to reductions in under-five mortality, and
the effect was larger in the poorest districts.[27] The third evaluation was in education
and training. A nationally representative study, it evaluated the Indonesian primary
school construction program, implemented at the district level, and identified a highly
significant decrease in under-five mortality.[17] All three AA studies in water and
sanitation, education, and energy found significant reductions.[32,1,31]

UTILIZATION
3.61 The utilization intervention, evaluated in an AA study, aimed to improve
health insurance in China, but it was not significant.[18]

BUNDLED INTERVENTIONS
3.62 There were two AAA studies for bundled projects, and both were significant.
The first was an evaluation of a public monitoring program in rural Uganda, which
combined monitoring and evaluation and accountability with service management.
Community groups and public health facilities created action plans that included
provisions for monitoring the health workers’ compliance. This resulted in a
marginally significant decrease in child mortality (see figure J.5 in Appendix J).[12] The
second AAA study, which looked at Brazil’s strategy planning and policy, reviewed
Programa Saúde da Família, a nationwide initiative to send medical teams out to
communities in an attempt to change the delivery modality of health services. The
program has decreased child mortality.[56] Five of the six AA studies that examined

bundled interventions found significant decreases.[4,36,21,34,49] The sixth was
insignificant.[2]

FINDINGS
What Do We Know About Reducing Under-Five Mortality?

3.63 Only one of the five AAA evaluations directly changed health care provision.
The evaluation of Brazil’s Programa Saúde da Família covered 85 percent of Brazilian
municipalities across all five regions, sending new medical teams to communities in
an attempt to teach better health practices at the individual level.[56] Despite its direct
relation to the health sector, the program only reduced child mortality by 3.9 percent.

3.64 The other four AAA interventions were in nonhealth sectors and consistently
found large and significant reductions. The largest of these reductions, which was
also highly significant, was from the central government’s primary school
construction program in Indonesia.[17] The authors found that an additional year of
education in a household produced a 48.4 percent reduction in the number of child
deaths per household. Although the authors were not explicit in this study about the
casual link, they suggested that this reduction may be because educated women are
more likely to take advantage of available health care for their children, such as
immunizations. When analyzed for mothers younger than the age of 25, an increase
in average education still significantly reduced child mortality, although the effect
was smaller in magnitude.

3.65 Public monitoring of health facilities in Uganda was also successful in
reducing under-five mortality without any direct inputs or changes in the health
care system.[12] The intervention was essentially a nonhealth intervention in the
health sector, with its primary goal being to improve the governance of the public
health facilities. The intervention provided for community monitoring to ensure that
specific improvements were made in existing healthcare provision. This exercise
reduced under-five mortality by 34.7 percent, although the reduction was only
marginally significant. This was likely the result of a power problem, because the
authors used public health dispensaries as the unit of analysis and so had only 50
observations (see figure J.5 in the appendix). The authors hypothesized that the large
drop could be a result of better service quality, which encouraged the community
members to use the health facilities more. The project was large in scale—it covered
55,000 households—but it was limited to rural populations.

3.66 Additionally, water programs had a large impact on child mortality. This
finding is unsurprising, given that diarrhea is one of the main causes of under-five
deaths (Black and others 2003). As part of a larger structural reform program, the

                                                                              CHAPTER 3
                                                                               CHILDREN

Argentinean government privatized water companies that covered more than 30
percent of Argentina’s municipalities. This led to an 8.4 percent reduction,[27] which
grew larger in poorer districts when disaggregated by poverty level.

3.67 After finding arsenic in the shallow tube wells used by up to 15 percent of
Bangladeshi families for their daily water supply, the government of Bangladesh
and UNICEF started a public health campaign to convince families to use new water
sources.[24] The switch led to a 28 percent increase in child mortality, as the authors
predicted. Their logic was as follows: The new water sources often contained surface
water, which is heavily contaminated compared to tube wells, and the sources are
farther away, which increases the likelihood that families will let water sit because
they cannot fetch it as often. Longer storage times increase the likelihood of fecal
contamination, and therefore of diarrhea, because the water is frequently exposed to
dirty hands or utensils.

3.68 Studies rated AA on water provision in Bolivia and on mechanisms that
indirectly alter the provision of water supply in Colombia also found significant
reductions in under-five mortality.[32,49]

3.69    Not only did nonhealth sector interventions produce large effects on child
mortality, evidence suggests that they may be more cost effective than the included
health care provision interventions. After five years, Brazil’s Programa Saúde da
Família was estimated to cost from $21,976.78 to $34,766.91 per life saved, although
the number falls significantly over time.[56] An AA study on the Bolivian Social
Investment Fund, which gave money to communities to implement their own
projects, reported a similar cost at $20,000 per death averted for health-care
projects.[49] Conversely, the public monitoring program in Uganda was estimated to
cost $300 per death averted,[12] and the water projects supported by the Bolivian
Social Investment Fund were cheaper than their health care counterparts, costing
$15,000 per death averted.

3.70 A second trend is a geographical one. Interventions in Latin America, a
region with relatively low under-five mortality rates, were significant and often
quite effective.3[31,27,56,30,49,1,32] Latin America accounted for seven of the fifteen
significant impact evaluations—almost twice as many as any other region—and two
of the five AAA studies. Four of the seven interventions produced a substantial
reduction of 15 percent or more in under-five mortality. However, it is unclear
exactly what drives this success. All were government programs, but so were six of
the remaining eleven interventions. Only one of the seven interventions specifically
targeted children, and only two had any special focus on rural or poor populations,
which tend to have higher child mortality rates.[27,49] One might be tempted to



                                                                                     73

conclude that the interventions themselves were simply more effective, but although
none of the interventions in other regions were exactly the same, there were similar
water and educational programs in Bangladesh and Indonesia, respectively, which
were even more effective than those in Latin America. More data would be needed
to identify clear trends that could account for the singular success in Latin America.

Box 3.3. Results from AA Studies
Public participation can work to reduce under-five mortality. Besides the Ugandan public
monitoring intervention, the Bolivian Social Investment Fund[49] and Brazil’s participatory
budgeting program[30] were both successful interventions that relied on public participation.
In the former, intervention communities were too isolated for effective direct government
involvement, and the under-five mortality rate was quite high (94 deaths per 1,000 live births).
In the latter, participatory budgeting allowed citizens to negotiate municipality budgetary
allocations with elected officials, leading to significant increases in health and sanitation
spending; sanitation infrastructure was particularly bad in these areas. Average education
was low (3.1 years per person over 25 years old), as was per capita monthly income (R$2,000).
The under-five mortality rate was 50 deaths per 1,000 live births when the program started in
the early 1990s, and but it fell by over 16 percent as a result of the new budgets.
Service packages have also produced significant declines in under-five mortality. Service
packages combine interventions across the continuum of care, such as the Matlab program,
which encompassed maternal services and fertility planning with vaccinations for children.
Of the three interventions that rely on service packages, two of the three were significant,
and all three found that service packages lead to a decrease in child mortality.
The first significant study evaluated the program in Matlab, Bangladesh, wherein
community health workers were recruited for home delivery of family planning services
including educating women about birth control.[36] Matlab was a very conservative area
regarding the status of women, and educational attainment was low (an average of 1.4 years
of schooling for a person more than 15 years old).
The second significant intervention was the World Bank’s SMP in Indonesia,[4] where health
workers were trained and an education campaign was undertaken to increase residents’
awareness of what services were available to them. At the time, women had an average of
4.1 years of schooling, and nearly 60 percent were employed. The study population had an
under-five mortality rate well above the national average (70 deaths per 1,000 live births
instead of 38). In the intervention that was not significant—an IMCI program in
Bangladesh—over half the women has some level of education, and over half of child deaths
were caused by pneumonia, diarrhea, malnutrition, and measles.[2] The null result may have
been a power issue, however, as the baseline census showed a substantially lower mortality
rate than the authors had originally expected.
These packages often contain both health and nonhealth sector components, and the
existing impact evaluations cannot isolate their effects. Future impact evaluations with
multiple treatment arms to isolate these effects would contribute important policy
information.

What Do We Still Need To Know?

3.71 The many significant studies in Latin America highlight the lack of
evaluations where one would expect to find them. In 2011, about half of the 6.9
million child deaths occurred in only five countries (United Nations Inter-agency
Group for Child Mortality Estimation 2012): India, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic
of the Congo, Pakistan, and China. Notwithstanding, only one rigorous impact
evaluation was completed since 1995 that examined how to reduce mortality in
these countries. Yet even that study, an AA evaluation of health insurance in China,
found no significant difference in treated and untreated groups.[18] Moreover,
according to the World Development Indicators, the countries with the worst under-
five mortality rates in 2010 were Somalia, Mali, Burkina Faso, Sierra Leone, and
Chad (United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation 2012). Yet
not a single intervention evaluated impacts on mortality in any of these countries.
Policy makers are effectively left without any robust evidence on what to do to
combat under-five mortality in any of the countries where the most children die or
where they die most frequently.

3.72 In addition to the unexpected geographical gaps, there are noteworthy gaps
by cause of death. An analysis of causes of under-five mortality in the 42 countries
that accounted for 90 percent of such deaths in 2000 revealed that, after neonatal
disorders, the biggest child killers are diarrhea, pneumonia and malaria, accounting
for a combined total of over half of child deaths (Black and others 2003). While there
are established methods of preventing and treating these illnesses (Jones and others
2003), one would still expect to see impact evaluations examining the scalability of
these methods and which delivery modality has the greatest impact on under-five
mortality. Since 1995, two public campaigns to distribute insecticide-treated nets are
the only rigorously evaluated intervention that directly addresses one of these three
illnesses. Water and sanitation interventions affect diarrhea, but none were
undertaken with that as a specific goal, and there are no studies on the effect of
large-scale provision or utilization of oral rehydration therapy on under-five
mortality, which is the main antidiarrheal treatment. This indicates that there is still
much to prove regarding these three major illnesses.

3.73 One additional trend is notable for its absence. The 2012 Millennium
Development Goals Report (UN 2012) identified rural and poor children as the two
most vulnerable groups for under-five mortality, but very few impact evaluations
have been done on interventions that target either. In fact, only four of the evaluated
interventions targeted rural populations, and only of those evaluations was
AAA.[18,12,36,21] The single evaluated intervention that targeted a poor population—
the SMP in Indonesia—was an AA study.[4] However, four of the five were at least


                                                                                      75

marginally significant, and three of those four interventions led to at least a 30
percent reduction in under-five mortality among the target population.

3.74 These gaps and trends are important to inform future research and policy
makers. As demonstrated, however, key areas of missing information prevent
drawing more definitive conclusions or recommending more specific interventions.
Evaluators should focus on high-mortality countries and on the interventions that
could do the most to save children’s lives.

4. Conclusions and Lessons
4.1    This systematic review has explored interventions that can be effective in
increasing SBA, the effects of doing so, and interventions that can reduce maternal,
neonatal, infant, and under-five mortality, each in turn. Examining this evidence in
aggregate yields still more insights into potential ways to make progress toward
MDGs 4 and 5.


Findings
WHAT HAS WORKED IN REDUCING MORTALITY IN MOTHERS AND CHILDREN?
4.2    It is worth repeating that because of concerns about how representative
publicly available impact evaluations are of all interventions that may affect
maternal and child mortality, the findings IEG presents in this review are suggestive
of promising interventions. Yet, as this body of literature is in its early stages, the
findings in this review are instructive even if not conclusive. Policy makers should
judiciously apply lessons from these impact evaluations to the degree they believe
there is a contextual match for those evaluations described here.

4.3    Interventions across the continuum of care have demonstrated improvements
in SBA and reductions in maternal and child mortality. These interventions are often
particularly effective in reducing mortality rates and increasing SBA among the
poor. Interventions aiming to improve the quality, knowledge, and access to services
have been effective in improving prenatal, delivery, and maternal mortality
outcomes. Service packages can be effective in reducing neonatal mortality.
Interventions falling outside the traditional health sector can yield demonstrable
reductions in infant and under-five mortality.
Complementary and Reinforcing Strategies Can Be Effective Across All Outcomes

4.4    Interventions with complementary and reinforcing strategies are those that
improve quality of care, knowledge, and access to services. Integrated maternal and
child health interventions that promote SBA in this way can positively impact
maternal mortality,[52,23] while those that affect only provision or utilization have little
impact on maternal mortality.[39,18,35] There is some evidence that community-based
approaches are ineffective for promoting SBA.[10,61,37,3,47] However, those designed to
address neonatal care can also reduce perinatal and early neonatal mortality,
particularly when tied to health workforce improvements. The spread of knowledge
and information to households and individuals is often found bundled with



77
CHAPTER 4
CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS

interventions that reduce infant mortality. The specific effects of the SMP and IMCI
programs, both recognized service packages, are discussed in Box 4.1.

4.5     Importantly, the practice of bundling interventions creates a simultaneity
challenge in evaluation. By their nature, interventions with complementary and
reinforcing strategies are complex and generally include multiple components.
Because any one of the components or some combination may be driving the results,
attribution becomes difficult. Regression analysis of the most commonly bundled
interventions hints that combinations of delivery modality, service packages, and
household knowledge and information are associated with an increased likelihood
that an impact evaluation of an intervention with bundled components finds a
significant effect on SBA and mortality outcomes. Sample size limits the ability to
control for other explanations.

Box 4.1. Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses and Safe Motherhood Programs
The IMCI program and the SMP are the two main global strategies to provide essential care
for mothers and children. There are few impact evaluations on either of these strategies, and
the evidence of their effects is mixed.
Surprisingly for an intervention of such broad international application (Bryce and others
2004), impact evaluation evidence of IMCI effects is both thin (only two studies) and
mixed.[2,9] No impact was found on under-five mortality from an AA quality study in
Bangladesh. Yet an AAA study on an IMCI program in neighboring India reported
significantly reduced early neonatal mortality and infant mortality. The IMCI package
included management of diarrhea, pneumonia, and complementary feeding and
information on when to seek medical care. Interestingly, this intervention’s effect on
mortality outcomes was driven by changes in home births; no effect was found on facility
births. The authors also noted a higher prevalence of optimal newborn care practices and
increases in the timely seeking of health care from appropriate sources in intervention areas.
The two evaluations of SMP come from China and Indonesia and also provide mixed
evidence.[23,4] In China, the program reduced maternal mortality, in particular that caused by
postpartum hemorrhage, through complementary and reinforcing strategies to promote
SBA. The program in Indonesia did not find evidence of effects on maternal mortality or
neonatal mortality, although it did report a one-third decrease in child mortality and
marginally significant effects on infant mortality. The two programs differ in that the
Indonesia SMP places a strong emphasis on community-based care, including health and
family planning services, antenatal care visits, work with TBAs, and a large community
outreach and awareness component that aimed to address low demand for safe motherhood
services.

                                                                       CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS

Interventions That Incentivize Utilization Can Improve Skilled Birth Attendance and Infant
Mortality

4.6     The findings show that CCTs, vouchers, and other financial incentives can
significantly increase SBA and may reduce infant mortality. Two of the three AAA
evaluations report significant impacts on skilled birth attendance,[46,16,62] and this is
supported with evidence from all AA evaluations of demand financing
interventions.[53,55,51,39,7] Only one AAA study examined effects on infant mortality.[6]
Positive impacts were observed in studies from both low- and middle-income
countries with varying coverage of health care services, though there is evidence
that effects are stronger among the poor above a certain minimal threshold of
hygiene[6] and those who receive better quality of care.[55] Additionally, achieving
optimal impacts from demand financing interventions requires proper attention to
creating program awareness.[39,55]

4.7     There is evidence of significant effects on SBA and infant mortality, but no
AAA impact evaluations of demand financing interventions demonstrated a
significant effect on maternal and neonatal mortality or even examined the effect of
such schemes on under-five mortality. Because these programs often target mothers,
there is a missed opportunity to affect maternal mortality and neonatal mortality
within the first 24 hours, both of which are responsive to appropriate medical care.
Further evidence is required with respect to available CCTs and maternal health
voucher programs designed to reduce neonatal mortality.

Nonhealth Sector Interventions Can Reduce Child Mortality

4.8    Nonhealth interventions led to significant reductions in neonatal, infant, and
under-five mortality. There were 13 such interventions, half of which were AAA,
distributed among water and sanitation, 7;[15,33,28,24,27,32,49] education, 3;[17,19,1] and
energy, 3.[60,25,31] All AAA impact evaluations of interventions in nonhealth sectors
reported significant effects on child mortality levels, as did nearly all AA
evaluations; only one water and sanitation intervention failed to impact infant
mortality. Water and sanitation and energy interventions address pneumonia and
diarrhea, two of the largest child killers, whereas education interventions can have
large effects on all causes of child mortality.

4.9    Water and sanitation programs demonstrated effective reductions in child
mortality levels through privatization of water provision and infrastructure
improvement funded through social funds.[27,28,32,49] Two additional water and
sanitation evaluations tell cautionary tales: one from an arsenic mitigation campaign
in Bangladesh credited with saving lives that actually led to increases in infant and



                                                                                             79

CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS

under-five mortality, and another that exposed the impact of water contamination
from agricultural chemicals in India on neonatal and infant mortality.[24,15] Although
these latter studies do not provide evidence of an effective intervention, they
certainly underscore the importance of water and sanitation in child health and
point to areas in which future interventions should focus.

4.10 Energy sector impact evaluations shed light on the causal pathway by which
mortality rates were lowered and further demonstrate the beneficial outcomes of
utility privatization. The evaluations of the two pollution regulation interventions
demonstrated lower infant mortality from respiratory infections and internal causes,
and the electricity privatization evaluation decreased under-five deaths from
diarrhea and food poisoning.

4.11 Evaluations of education interventions showed significant effects on multiple
child mortality outcomes; one also increased SBA. For example, a school
construction program in Indonesia boasts incredibly large reductions across all three
child mortality outcomes: 53 percent in neonatal, 43 percent in infant, and 48 percent
in under-five.[17] External validity may be a concern, however, as the impediments to
better schooling and education often differ by country; merely building more
schools may not produce the same results in other countries. Nevertheless, the
effects of nonhealth sector interventions underscore the importance of improving
basic living conditions and highlight pathways to reduce deaths from two of the
leading child killers: pneumonia and diarrhea.

Heterogeneous Effects: Impacts Are Often Strongest Among Disadvantaged Populations

4.12 Among the 23 AAA and AA studies with heterogeneous effects on outcomes,
by far the most common measure of disaggregation was by socioeconomic status.
Included in socioeconomic status is any measure of poverty, income, assets, literacy,
or level of education. Across the SBA and child mortality outcomes, the
heterogeneous results support the same general conclusion: a program’s impact on
outcomes increases in more socioeconomically disadvantaged settings. The evidence
of this impact is seen from CCTs;[46,6] a social investment fund;[11] and even water
provision[27,28,15] and air pollution regulation.[60] Evaluations of Progresa[6] and piped
water provision in Brazil,[28] however, demonstrated the need for intervention areas
to reach a minimum threshold of sanitation and development before they
demonstrated effectiveness, although other studies did not report on this
relationship.

4.13 The lack of heterogeneous effects by rural versus urban location across
studies was somewhat surprising. A mobile phone intervention to promote SBA is

                                                                      CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS

heterogeneous effects on this                 Of 68 interventions, 53 were targeted:
dimension, finding that the                31 by gender
program improved SBA for                   32 by location (rural, urban)
urban but not for rural                    23 by age group
residents.[41] The virtual absence         14 by poverty
of heterogeneous effects by
location may be due to the fact that many programs were targeted to rural areas—
nearly half (29) of the 68 interventions that the team examined. For such studies, no
information on rural versus urban impacts would have been available. While
targeting of programs is common and useful, results should be interpreted and
applied with care.

External Validity: Results Differ By National Mortality or SBA and Income Levels

4.14 Interventions that yield significant results in one context may not necessarily
work under different circumstances. A probabilistic analysis of the 68 impact
evaluations used in this review sheds light on the relationship between the
likelihood of an intervention having a statistically significant effect and two
important contextual elements: the baseline levels of the country’s SBA and child
mortality rates and the country’s income level. The small sample of studies and use
of national data that may not fully reflect the location where the intervention takes
place may be a concern. In Figure 4.1, impact evaluations of interventions in
countries with lower percentages of attended births or higher child mortality
outcomes are more likely to report significant results; the sample size for maternal
mortality is too small. This may also suggest that in contexts where the severity of
the problem is not extreme, MCH interventions may need to be tailored to achieve
their goals of improving maternal and child health.

4.15 Together, these results imply diminishing marginal returns for SBA and
maternal and child mortality interventions. although making additional gains is
more difficult in areas already better at saving the lives of mothers and children,
making progress is more likely in areas with more room for progress.

Note: The figure shows the relationship of the 2000 national SBA and mortality rates with the probability of an intervention
causing a significant desirable effect. The figure is based on a probabilistic exercise where the dependent variable takes the
value of 1 when the parameter reported in the study is statistically significant and has the expected sign, 0 otherwise. The
exercise controls for type of evaluation and bias risk. SB = skilled birth attendance; NM = neonatal mortality; IM = infant
mortality; U5 = under-five mortality.


4.16 The importance of tailoring interventions to specific contexts is further
corroborated when analyzing the effect of country-specific income level and literacy
rates and the significance of the effects obtained. In the case of SBA and neonatal
mortality, interventions appear more likely to be effective in relatively poorer
countries. Conversely, for the case of infant mortality, policies applied in relatively
better-off contexts are more likely to yield significant results (see Figure 4.2). Under-
five mortality seems to be uncorrelated with wealth or literacy, which is surprising,
given its similarity to postneonatal infant mortality in causes of death.

Note: The figure shows the relationship of the 2000 national gross domestic product (GDP) and literacy rates with the
probability of an intervention causing a significant desirable effect. It is based on a probabilistic exercise where the
dependent variable takes the value of 1 when the parameter reported in the study is statistically significant and has the
expected sign, 0 otherwise. The exercise controls for type of evaluation and bias risk. SB = skilled birth attendance; NM =
neonatal mortality; IM = infant mortality; U5 = under-five mortality.


4.17 The types of interventions studied may explain these findings. There are
more impact evaluations of governance and nonhealth sector interventions in infant
and under-five mortality. They may require a higher level of capacity and
development as is more often found in relatively better-off countries. Alternately,
this trend may be explained by differences in the nature of outcomes across the
continuum of care: SBA and neonatal mortality may require less costly and a more
limited set of interventions time clustered around delivery—which are easier for
poor countries to tackle—whereas the more complex nature of infant and under-five
mortality requires more varied interventions—making it more difficult for poor
countries and more likely in relatively rich countries with better functioning health
and nonhealth sectors.

4.18 This result is corroborated by the similar pattern of relationships between
literacy rates and intervention effectiveness for SBA and mortality outcomes.
Interventions with a more compact causal density may be less influenced by
environmental factors such as mothers’ literacy, whereas outcomes with a longer
period of exposure to environmental risks may be more affected by environmental
factors. Mothers in more literate areas may be better able to benefit from
interventions affecting infant mortality, whereas mothers from less literate areas

may benefit disproportionately from interventions affecting birth and early neonatal
mortality.

4.19 Taken together, these correlations hint at an interaction between program
effectiveness and environment, suggesting a few factors that may affect the
transferability of effects from one setting to another: baseline mortality, poverty, and
literacy.

World Bank Projects and Financing

4.20 Of the 68 interventions evaluated in this systematic review, 15 were of World
Bank projects (4) or financing (11).1 As seen in table 4.1, SBA was the most frequently
evaluated outcome,2 and the World Bank has had partial success in improving this
outcome: six of the nine interventions produced significant increases, including two
of the four AAA evaluations.[49,4,54,12,26,7,39,46]

Note: The first number shows the number of significant studies; the second is the total number of evaluations of World Bank
projects or financing with the specified outcome. IE = impact evaluation; SBA = skilled birth attendance; MM = maternal
mortality; NM = neonatal mortality; IM = infant mortality; U5 = under-five mortality.


4.21 Bank projects and financing with an impact evaluation were unsuccessful in
demonstrating significant impacts in maternal or neonatal mortality,[57, 39, 46]
although again, the null finding in maternal mortality could be due to insufficient
power. There were promising results in infant and under-five mortality, where a
majority of the studies, including all three AAA evaluations, found significant
reductions.[28, 57, 11, 56, 12, 42, 4, 33, 49] Still, it is worth noting that two of the three impact
evaluations reporting significant point estimates indicated an effect of less than 5
percent reductions in infant mortality, as compared to an average reduction of closer
to 20 percent for significant non-Bank interventions affecting infant mortality
included in this review.

CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS


4.22 Only four of the 15 evaluated World Bank interventions were World Bank
projects rather than World Bank financing. AAA studies evaluated projects to
improve piped water provision in Brazil[28] and community monitoring in
Uganda[12], and two AA studies evaluated the SMP in Indonesia[4] and the Rural
Poverty Reduction Program in Brazil.[11] Of the two AAA evaluations of World Bank
projects, the Uganda study demonstrated a marginally significant but large
reduction on infant mortality (even with low power) and significant, large increase
in SBA, while the Brazil impact evaluation reported a significant reduction in under-
five mortality. When the two AAA evaluations are taken with the two AA studies,
the results mirror the general findings for World Bank interventions: significant
reductions in all four projects in either infant or under-five mortality and significant
increases in SBA for two of the three reporting on that outcome.

WHAT DO WE STILL NEED TO KNOW?
4.23 Though the global community has been working toward MDGs 4 and 5 for
nearly 15 years, important gaps still remain in the impact evaluation evidence
regarding which interventions are effective in reducing maternal and child
mortality. Gaps include coverage of impact evaluations over the broader
intervention space, gaps between evidence and the World Bank’s MCH strategy and
portfolio, and gaps in evidence by region. Other gaps exist in understanding the
mechanisms through which these interventions work and the effectiveness of
integrating them into current MCH strategies and evidence of similar interventions
over multiple contexts.

Gaps by Intervention Type

4.24 Significant research gaps over the intervention space remain, especially
regarding high-quality evidence. Even where there is evidence available on the
effect of a type of intervention, that evidence is typically thin, often with only one or
two studies, and drawn from a mix of AAA- and AA-rated studies. There are no
more than four AAA-rated evaluations of a given mortality outcome for any one
type of intervention—and even those are too disparate to make definitive
conclusions on whether or under what conditions a class of interventions works
generally. Worse, there are intervention families with no available evidence at all.
The determination of effective interventions requires a more robust and more
densely populated evidence base.

4.25 Particularly sparse are impact evaluations of interventions in governance,
health information systems, health financing, and certain nonhealth sectors: income-
generating or labor market interventions; agriculture, food security, and nutrition

                                                                CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS

interventions; and transportation infrastructure interventions. These areas have clear
theoretical underpinnings of how they could lead to lower maternal and child
mortality, but there is no impact evaluation evidence to support these models or
specify what types of interventions might be more or less effective.

4.26 For those interventions that demonstrate promising results, important areas
for further research still exist. Evaluators should investigate the further integration
of effective services into mainstream health systems and across the continuum of
care. For example, how can programs—like CCTs or the Integrated Management of
Neonatal and Childhood Illness—that have demonstrated effectiveness on SBA and
infant mortality outcomes improve neonatal health? Other research could include
the repetition of promising interventions in various contexts and comparison of
multiple interventions designs or delivery methods. For example, although some
elements of the nonhealth sector look promising, such as water and sanitation,
education, and energy, in reducing child mortality, still more studies are needed to
establish the applicability of these findings to other settings and to understand the
mechanisms by which they work.

4.27 Additionally, there is a need for evaluations that can tease out the potential
synergies and dense causal pathways of the complementary and reinforcing
strategies of bundled projects. Several studies in this review examine interventions
with multiple salient components that make attribution difficult. Health sector
interventions are unlikely to become less complex, but further evaluations of such
bundled projects could usefully inform policy makers of the critical components and
most advantageous combinations likely to yield results.

Gaps by Evaluation Components

4.28 The inclusion of additional components in impact evaluations in maternal
and child health can increase their relevance. Distributional impacts of interventions
on particularly relevant population subsets (those from lower socioeconomic
groups, rural areas, or places with persistently higher mortality rates) and cost
analysis are of significant interest to researchers, policy makers, and development
practitioners.

4.29 Just one-third of studies in this review provide information on heterogeneous
effects, although this is some of the most useful information an evaluation can
provide. Such distributional disaggregation of impacts would allow more effective
targeting of future programs.




                                                                                      87
CHAPTER 4
CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS

4.30 Impact evaluations can do more to unpack the black box of causal pathways.
The how and why of the intervention are as important as the estimated impact.
Evaluation design, particularly for RCTs, can partially address this by evaluating
multiple arms to understand behavioral response to different incentive structures.
Impact evaluations that report both intermediate and ultimate outcomes could
better establish the causal link between intervention and impact. By providing
evidence that links intermediate and mortality outcomes, such impact evaluations
could expand the body of available literature to be able to include evaluations that
only report intermediate outcomes.

4.31 Additionally, greater integration of mixed methods would increase
understanding of the causal pathways leading to observed outcomes. Process
evaluation, focus groups, and other qualitative methods can uncover issues in
design, implementation, or social context that affect a program’s estimated impact,
either positively or negatively. In addition to an improved understanding of the
causal pathway, mixed methods provide valuable information for scaling-up
programs or implementing them in a new context and telling the story of failure, or
why something doesn’t work. Mixed methods are particularly useful in these cases
when an impact evaluation indicates a null result; complementary evaluation
techniques can help tease out whether the findings is a function of challenges in
statistical power, implementation, attrition, incentives, and so forth.

4.32 Most IEs evaluate an intervention at a single point in time (China’s SMP
being a notable exception), implying implicitly that impact findings are temporally
stable. Yet, for nearly every outcome reviewed here, length of exposure is associated
with the likelihood of observing a statistically significant effect of the intervention
being evaluated. This has both internal and external validity implications. Impact
evaluations may be able to establish causal attribution at a specific point in time, but
their methods could be applied to elucidate the impact paths of an intervention over
time, which need not be monotonically increasing, much less constant. Still, the
finding that interventions are more likely to lead to desirable outcomes the longer
they are in place implies a level of required patience for policy makers. Most
interventions take time to deliver results.

4.33     Very few studies report cost analysis of any kind, and fewer still have any
cost-effectiveness data. Where it does exist, the quality is generally poor, amounting
to “back of the envelope” calculations, and disparate methods of calculation means
estimates are not comparable. Cost information is critical to sound policy decisions,
and its general absence in this pool of studies magnifies the call issued elsewhere for
its inclusion in impact evaluations. Impact evaluations can provide an accurate

assessment of the mortality benefits of interventions, however, more careful
accounting is needed on costs to aid policy makers trading off one set of
interventions for another. For the Bank, this underscores the importance of
strengthening cost-effectiveness analysis in project preparation, as highlighted in the
IEG report Cost-Benefit Analysis in World Bank Projects (IEG 2010a).

Gaps by Strategy: Leaps of Faith

4.34 The absence of evidence in certain intervention families points to a larger
problem of creating global strategies to improve maternal and child health when
there is such a thin evidence base on understanding the attributable effects of the
intervention set. Although addressing these gaps through more impact evaluations
will not in itself solve the challenge of MDGs 4 and 5, evidence in these areas can
increase the effectiveness of global strategies by enabling better decision making for
investments to reduce deaths of mothers and children.

4.35 For example, increasing the proportion of births attended by skilled health
personnel is an intermediate indicator for MDG 5, based on its role in helping to
reduce maternal deaths, yet there is no quality impact evaluation evidence of this
effect. The evidence is consistent regarding a null result on the effect of these
interventions on neonatal mortality, but this is based on only two studies. In child
health, the lack of sociobehavioral impact evaluations for popular strategies such as
immunization campaigns is surprising, and evaluations of the mortality effects of
standardized programs, such as IMCI and SMPs, are few in number. Impact
evaluations with mortality outcomes for interventions addressing some of the main
causes of child death, such as diarrhea or pneumonia, are also absent.

Gaps for the Bank’s Strategy

4.36 As indicated in Chapter 1, the explicit strategy of the World Bank is largely
reflected in the governance and health sector provision elements of this report’s
intervention taxonomy. The de facto maternal and child mortality strategy for the
World Bank can be proxied by examining the types of projects that the Bank funds.
The team executed a portfolio check of all projects approved by the Bank over the
past decade in the Human Nutrition and Poverty, Poverty Reduction and Economic
Management, and Social Protection sectors, as well as water, energy and mining,
and social development projects in the Sustainable Development Network that were
coded with health theme or sector outcomes. The project objectives were flagged for
mentions of increasing SBA3 or reducing maternal, infant, or under-five mortality
(omitting neonatal mortality as a separate outcome). These filtered projects’
components were mapped against the review’s intervention framework.


                                                                                     89
CHAPTER 4
CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS

Significantly, given the substantial effect that nonhealth sector interventions had on
infant and child mortality, none of the water or energy projects had explicit MCH
objectives. Project frequencies were compared to the findings in impact evaluation
evidence by intervention and mortality or skilled birth outcome. The results can be
seen in table 4.2; a detailed disaggregation is in Appendix I.

4.37 Currently, there are gaps between the body of IE evidence and the
distribution of Bank projects with maternal and child health objectives. Specifically,
the World Bank has been quite active in the governance sector, an area where there
are few impact evaluations. Within the health sector, the World Bank has funded
numerous projects for intervention types with little to no IE evidence on mortality,
such as health infrastructure, health information systems, and medical projects and
technologies.4 The Bank has had a nonnegligible number of activities with elements
of donor support and coordination with MCH goals (for example, budgetary
support, sectorwide approaches, basket funding, and direct bilateral funding of
government efforts); though there are no impact evaluations in this area, that may be
a function of inappropriate fit of impact evaluation methods to nationwide projects
where establishment of a counterfactual is less clear. Still, although World Bank
funding decisions should consider the full breadth of available evidence, these gaps
signal an unmet need for more impact evaluations in these areas to strengthen the
full body of evidence.

4.38 Although figure 4.4 shows significant regional gaps in the distribution of
impact evaluations of World Bank projects or financing, it masks the full extent of
the problem. Of the 15 interventions evaluated, 11 came from just three countries:
All five of the East Asian and Pacific interventions took place in Indonesia, both
South Asian interventions were in India, and four of the six interventions in Latin
America and the Caribbean occurred in Brazil. This extreme concentration is out of
harmony with the World Bank’s geographically diverse mission. It should actively
encourage evaluations in a more representative sample of countries. It is possible

                                                                                       CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS

that these gaps are caused by regional or country variation in data quality and
availability; measurement of maternal mortality in particular faces challenges in
data collection and measurement error. When possible, the World Bank should work
within countries to strengthen the measurement of vital statistics.

4.39 The Bank could benefit from not only more geographically diverse
evaluations, but from evaluations that examined a greater diversity of outcomes
across the regions. As shown in figure 4.5, South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa have
the highest burden of women delivering without SBA, but it is in East Asia and
Pacific—the region with the second-lowest burden—that the World Bank has the
greatest amount of evidence: four of the nine SBA interventions evaluated were in
Indonesia, as compared to two each in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.
Similarly, five of the seven interventions aimed at decreasing infant mortality were
in Latin America and the Caribbean, which has the second-lowest burden in that
indicator. This information is useful, but having so much of the evidence for Bank
projects and financing on these two indicators be concentrated in low-burden
regions leaves the World Bank without causal evidence in the most problematic
areas.




                                                                                                                    91
CHAPTER 4
CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS

4.40 As an organization with breadth and depth, the World Bank should also
work to contribute to thickening the evidence base in areas with numerous
interventions but few or no impact evaluations, as illustrated in Appendix I. This is
particularly true for evaluations in areas where the Bank has an advantage because
of its cross-sectoral work. Specifically, there are no or few impact evaluations with
estimated effects on maternal and child mortality in nonhealth sectors, such as
energy, agriculture and food security, and transportation infrastructure, but these
sectors have a clear logical link to health outcomes.

4.41 Fortunately, there is some recognition of this geographic imbalance. Of the 23
impact evaluations underway in Results Based Financing with the Bank’s Health
Results Innovation Trust Fund, more than half are in Sub-Saharan Africa. Outside of
health financing, additional impact evaluations are under implementation through
Strategic Impact Evaluation Fund and the Development Impact Evaluation
Initiative, including the initiative’s work with the government of Nigeria to evaluate
a series of MCH-targeted interventions. Where appropriate and sufficiently
powered, impact evaluations from these Bank groups would improve their
relevance if they estimated program impacts on mortality. More IEs on other gaps
would be welcome, be they by the Bank or others. Regions themselves are likewise
encouraged to work to fill these gaps; as they do so, they are likely to find useful the
Impact Evaluation Toolkit developed by HNP at the World Bank.5

Gaps by Region

4.42 While complete enumeration of the contextual factors affecting the
transference of impact evaluation implications from one context to another is
unknown, it is reasonable to believe that external validity is higher within regions
than across regions. Moreover, given the close relationship between maternal and
child mortality and the importance of interventions that incorporate the continuum
of care, evidence is needed across all outcomes in all regions of the world.
Disappointingly, some regions are vastly underrepresented by impact evaluations
on SBA and maternal and child mortality.

4.43 Across all outcomes, studies in Sub-Saharan Africa are few. Within the
region, studies examining SBA are most frequent, and even then West Africa is still
entirely absent. High numbers of infant and child mortality evaluations occur in
Latin America, but no studies exist in the Caribbean or on maternal mortality in the
Latin American and Caribbean Region. Studies in East Asia and Pacific are included
for all outcomes, but with generally low representation and concentrated in few
countries. There is only one impact evaluation in Europe and Central Asia, and none
in the Middle East and North Africa Region.

Gaps by Severity of the MDG Shortfall

4.44 Imbalances in regional representation of impact evaluation evidence take on
increased importance when considering current levels of SBA and mortality and
regional variation in the progress needed to meet MDG targets. Figure 4.5
juxtaposes SBA and mortality severity levels with the number of evaluations per
region. The lack of progress in these areas is clearly not because of the lack of impact
evaluations; where methodologically feasible, impact evaluations can indicate the
attributable impacts of interventions, including those aimed at improving
institutional quality, and thereby steer investment to more productive use.

Note: Numbers in brackets represent the actual (unindexed) percent of births attended by skilled health staff or standard
mortality ratios measured per 100,000 live births in the case of maternal mortality and per 1,000 live births for the neonatal,

Europe and Central Asia; EAP = East Asia and Pacific; LAC = Latin America and the Caribbean; MENA = Middle East and
North Africa; SA = South Asia; and SSA = Sub-Saharan Africa.

4.45 The low numbers of studies in Sub-Saharan Africa is particularly alarming
against the high child mortality and maternal mortality rates in many countries in
the region. Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest maternal mortality ratio, but there are
no AAA or AA impact evaluations with maternal mortality as an outcome in the
region. The top 10 countries with the highest neonatal mortality rates are all in Sub-
Saharan Africa, but only 10 percent of the 30 evaluations of neonatal mortality are of
interventions in this region. Of the five countries that make up more than half of
global child deaths, there are no impact evaluations in Nigeria, the Democratic
Republic of Congo, or Ethiopia.




                                                                                                                             93
CHAPTER 4
CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS

4.46 Sub-Saharan Africa is not the only region of concern. China, which with India
rounds out the list of five countries with the most child deaths, is particularly
underrepresented. Although there are no impact evaluations from the Middle East
and North Africa region it is in the middle of the distribution in mortality and SBA.


Conclusion
4.47 Progress in reaching MDGs 4 and 5 to reduce child and maternal mortality
has been slow. Overall, the evidence base on intervention effectiveness is
remarkably thin. Furthermore, gaps remain by region, specifically in Sub-Saharan
Africa; by outcome, particularly maternal mortality; and by evaluation components,
namely heterogeneous effects, temporal exposure, mixed methods, and cost
analysis. The World Bank, as a primary producer of impact evaluation evidence,
would do well to provide leadership in closing these gaps.

4.48 Impact evaluations presented in this report provide some evidence of
interventions that can accelerate progress in maternal and child mortality. Policy
makers must be judicious in application of these lessons, but there is reason for
hope. Provision of service packages that integrate care for mothers and children;
improvement to the quality of maternal care in combination with increased access
and maternal knowledge; vouchers and CCTs; projects improving governance; and
interventions in water, education, and energy all enjoy a near-consensus of impact
evaluation evidence for reducing maternal and child mortality.

4.49 Opportunely, the worst off may be easiest to help. Impact evaluations of
interventions in countries with worse baseline SBA and mortality rates were more
likely to find significant positive impacts of those interventions. Moreover, where
the disaggregation exists in the evaluations, households of lower socioeconomic
status experience greater beneficial impacts. Because households and countries with
low rates of SBA and high rates of maternal and child mortality are more able to
have their fate changed by appropriately designed interventions, MDGs 4 and 5 may
still be within reach, even if not by the 2015 deadline.

4.50 Finally, the findings in this systematic review do not, in themselves,
constitute a strategy for reducing maternal and child mortality. Rather, this review is
intended to be a key input to inform such a strategy. Decisions to adopt a given
intervention should be done with careful examination of contextual similarities of
the target area to those impact evaluations reported here, to encourage solutions that
are technically correct, politically supportable, and administratively feasible.

Appendix B: Expanded Search Strategy
Overview
The data for the systematic review originate from completed (or nearly completed)
impact evaluations with selected maternal and child health (MCH) outcomes:
neonatal, infant, and under-five mortality, skilled birth attendance, and maternal
mortality. Potential studies were identified through a detailed search strategy built
on existing systematic review frameworks (Card and others 2010; Drabo and others
2011; IEG 2010b, 2011). The search strategy included three rounds of data collection.
Potential studies were then submitted to a full text review and, if they qualified as
impact evaluations with the selected outcomes, to the coding process (see coding
strategy in Appendix C for additional information).

Three categories of search terms captured studies of interest, using a pilot test to
modify the terms as necessary. These terms provided the basis for the bibliographic
database search that took place during Round A and identified the majority of
potential studies. Round A also included searches of other research, evaluation, and
donor organizations, World Bank databases, top economic journals, and the curricula
vitae of top health economists. As possible, the search team looked at the title,
subject, and abstract for each result. After eliminating duplicates, 376 potential
studies remained after Round A.

Rounds B and C served as comprehensiveness checks. During Round B, reference
lists of systematic reviews were examined that focused on maternal and child health.
After looking at the title, then subject or abstract, 47 potential studies were
identified. Round C involved a snowballing activity, in which reference lists were
reviewed for all of the studies selected for coding and two comprehensive searches
of Google Scholar were performed, identifying 22 potential studies.

Search Terms
The creation of three categories of search terms allowed the capture of studies that
used appropriate experimental or quasi-experimental methods to estimate the
impact of an intervention on the selected MCH outcomes in low- or middle-income
countries: (A) outcomes, (B) methods, and (C) low- and middle-income country.

Each search term category has a universe of related search terms likely to be found
in the title, subject, or abstract of relevant studies. The search term categories should
be joined by AND, while the list of search terms should be joined by OR, as shown
below:

(already reflected in the terms shown above). In preparation for this systematic
review, the systematic review team had identified relevant impact evaluations that
satisfied the outcomes, methods, and country location criteria. A subset of these
studies were selected to pilot test the search strategy in the EconLit and Science
Direct databases. All seven pilot articles in EconLit were easily located, whereas
Science Direct required a combination of two separate searches to limit the total
results to a reasonable number that still captured relevant studies. Although only
four of the five pilot test articles were found in Science Direct using this strategy, the
fifth article was discovered through a search in another database.

Round A: Bibliographic Databases
The categories guided the search of relevant bibliographic databases. The ideal
search strategy was the combination of search terms A and B and C, although the
exact terms of the search were adapted to each database in order to exclude high
numbers of irrelevant results. The number of results yielded from each database is
provided in table B.1.

From the total results for each database, a review of titles, subjects, and abstracts
identified the relevant impact evaluations. The number of potential impact
evaluations reflects unique studies, as duplicates were eliminated using EndNote or
as they were otherwise discovered, and these numbers would vary if the databases
were searched in a different order. Searches were truncated if the previous 100
results had not yielded any relevant studies.

Round A: Supplemental Sources
The majority of results were expected to be found through the bibliographic
databases noted above; these were supplemented by a number of searches in other
sources. This method also served as an additional check on the comprehensiveness
of the initial bibliographic search strategy.

IMPACT EVALUATION-FOCUSED ORGANIZATIONS

Four organizations offered online databases of impact evaluations:

        Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL)
        Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA)
        International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3IE)
        Network of Networks for Impact Evaluation (NONIE)

All available publications were browsed. Thirteen relevant impact evaluations were
identified.

The curricula vitae of the top 10 health economists, according to Wagstaff and Culyer
(2011), were browsed in search of additional relevant publications. As several of the
economists identified in this list focus on U.S. domestic issues, eight economists who
focus on international health or impact evaluation were added (see table B.4). Three
new results were found.

WEBSITES OF DONOR ORGANIZATIONS

A search was conducted of other bilateral and multilateral organizations, including
DFID, Inter-American Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the U.S.
Agency for International Development. Search strategies varied based on the
website. No new results were found.

GLOBAL REPORTS

IEG also reviewed text and references of World Development Reports from the World
Bank and World Health Reports from the World Health Organization for relevant
publications.

World Development Reports: Potential impact evaluations were identified from the
references of the 2012 report on Gender Equality and Development and the 2004 report
on Making Services Work for Poor People. From the hundreds of references that were
reviewed, IEG only pulled three potential evaluations that the team had not already
identified.



                                                                                   115
APPENDIX B
EXPANDED SEARCH STRATEGY
World Health Report: The 2005 report on Maternal and Child Health generated one new
potential impact evaluation. Reports from 1999 and 2002-04 had sections relevant to
MCH, although a review of citations did not reveal any additional studies.

WORLD BANK DATABASES

World Bank databases were consulted to identify additional IEs with Bank
involvement. The primary source was a database compiled by IEG for the report
entitled The World Bank Group Impact Evaluations: Relevance and Effectiveness, which
includes IEs from the Development Impact Evaluation Initiative database, impact
evaluations identified by literature reviews for previous IEG reports, or other impact
evaluations provided to the IEG team by World Bank staff (IEG 2012). A search of
this database identified six additional IEs.

OTHER

Additional impact evaluations were discovered through seminars or conversations
with other colleagues.

Round B: Systematic Reviews
The reference lists of 61 systematic reviews focused on maternal and child health
were gathered. Each title was reviewed, followed by assessing the abstracts of those
that seemed relevant and eliminating any that were already included. Another 47
potential studies were found through this process.

Round C: Google Scholar and Snowball Sampling
GOOGLE SCHOLAR

After completing the first two rounds of coding, a final search used Google Scholar
to locate additional studies. The Google Scholar search mechanism’s character limit
makes it very difficult to narrow searches to a manageable number of relevant
results. After trying various searches, the team identified four searches that returned
a majority of the relevant articles. In total, the four searches returned 1,477,730
results; the second search made up the majority with 1,444,000 results. A search of
the first 200 in each of the four searches identified only two new potential studies.

SNOWBALL SAMPLING

As part of the coding process, the reference list of each impact evaluation was
reviewed. Similar to the approach for the reference lists of the systematic reviews,

the staff identified relevant titles, checked subjects and abstracts, and eliminated any
duplicates. Through this process, 22 potential studies were gathered.

Screening Studies
The following inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to the titles, subjects,
and abstracts of the studies to generate a list of potential impact evaluations:

      Outcomes: Studies that evaluate outcome indicators of child mortality
       (neonatal, infant, and under five), birth attendance, or maternal mortality
       were included. In addition, any studies that include skilled birth attendance
       as an intervention were included. A list of citations for studies that fall within
       the scope of our matrix of interventions and outcomes was maintained
       elsewhere.
       Study design: Studies that evaluate interventions based on quantitative
       experimental or quasi-experimental impact evaluation design with a well-
       defined counterfactual were included.
      Location: Studies of interventions that occur in a low-income or middle-
       income country, based on World Bank classifications, were selected.
      Language: The search focused on studies in English, although those in
       Spanish, French, and Portuguese were included.
      Publication date: Studies completed since January 1, 1995, were included.
      Unit of analysis: Studies that use regional or national time series data were
       excluded.
      Peer review: Impact evaluations that have been subjected to peer review (for
       example, published in a quality journal or a book) or are in the process of
       eliciting feedback from the research community (such as working papers or
       papers presented in conferences) were included.
      Nonclinical interventions: Following the classification of efficacy and
       effectiveness studies in the World Bank’s handbook Impact Evaluation in
       Practice (Gertler and others 2011), only effectiveness studies were included.
       Efficacy studies and evaluations of interventions of a clinical nature were not
       included.

The titles, subjects, and abstracts did not always provide enough information to
determine if the study met the selection criteria, particularly regarding outcomes
and study design. When it was unclear, the study was treated as a potential impact
evaluation to give it further consideration.




                                                                                       117
APPENDIX B
EXPANDED SEARCH STRATEGY

Search Results
In total, the team reviewed more than 7,000 search results across Rounds A, B, and
C. From a title and abstract review of these, 445 potential studies were identified.
After a further 10-minute text review of these studies, 95 studies were included as
impact evaluations of the selected outcomes on a representative sample, and 350
studies were excluded for not meeting these criteria. These 95 studies received a full
text review for quality. There were 21 AAA studies, 41 AA studies, and 33 A studies.
The 62 AAA and AA studies included 68 impact evaluations and were coded
according to the strategy identified in Appendix C.




118
Appendix C: Approach to Coding Impacts
Evaluations and Coding Instrument
After identifying studies based on title and abstract review and as outlined in the
search strategy (see Appendix B), they retrieved and read in full, and the following
approach was used to code the documents.

Step 1: 10-Minute Review
Each study received a 10-minute review, or a brief full-text examination, to find the
information described below. If the answer of any of the questions below was no,
the study was not included for coding.

      Outcome of interest: Does the study include at least one of the selected
       outcomes of interest: neonatal, infant, or under-five mortality; skilled birth
       attendance; or maternal mortality? Or does the study include an intervention
       of skilled birth attendance that looks at any outcomes within the MCH
       matrix?
      Counterfactual: Does the study use a counterfactual, that is, information on
       others who do not receive the treatment? Studies that use time-series or
       before-after observations on the same treatment group BUT do not have a
       control group are not to be included. Studies without a control group but that
       provide convincing exogenous variation in the treatment should be placed in
       a separate folder in EndNote for potential use.
      Impact evaluation method: Does the study utilize an appropriate impact
       evaluation method: randomized experiment, double or triple difference,
       matching, instrumental variable, regression discontinuity, or other method?
      Representative: Does the study take place outside of a controlled environment
       and in a real-world context (that is, not in a lab)?
      Effectiveness: Is the study an effectiveness study, rather than an efficacy study
       or an evaluation of an intervention of a clinical nature?
      Intervention: Does the study correspond to intervention types and constructs
       outlined in the approach paper and as defined (see box C.1)?




                                                                                     119
APPENDIX E
APPROACH TO CODING IMPACTS EVALUATIONS AND CODING INSTRUMENT
Box C.1. Defining “Interventions”

1. The treatment is a specific, time-limited purposeful public policy intervention. Most
impact evaluations fall in this category.
2. The treatment is a general public policy intervention. When it comes to impact
evaluations of general public policy interventions, one popular way to identify causal
impacts is through instrumental variable methods based on “natural” experiments or policy
reforms that change the distribution of the treatment in the sample without directly
affecting the outcome of interest.
3. The treatment is not a policy intervention, but is a natural experiment that can be
replicated by policy.


Step 2: Quality Rating
For each study that passed the 10-minute review, the full text was read and a quality
rating determined. Internal validity was the primary consideration, but also factored
in was any other major concerns with the study (for example, data collection
methods, sample size and representativeness, power, policy replicability).

Each study was double coded (two junior or one junior and one senior coder filled out
the Quality and Evaluation Design section and provided a quality rating) or double
rated (one junior coder filled out the Quality and Evaluation Design section with a
rating and one senior coder provided only a quality rating). Any disputes were
settled after a third reading and rating by a senior coder.

The attached coding instrument provides each variable included in the Quality and
Evaluation Design section, while key questions requiring additional guidance are
outlined below.

         Assessment of internal validity/quality of evaluation design is done vis-à-vis the
          estimation strategy used to evaluate impacts (see box C.2). The starting point
          is then to first identify the evaluation design (randomized or quasi-
          experimental) and IE methods (difference-in-difference, matching,
          instrumental variables, or regression discontinuity) used to identify impacts
          by the study. Subsequently, reviewers assessed whether the relevant
          identification assumptions have been satisfied or adequately discussed, and
          coded this information as all, some, or none (that is, all, some, or none of the
          identification assumptions have been satisfied) for each of the methods used
          in study. Note that in adjacent columns where reviewers coded the extent to
          which assumptions have been satisfied, they were expected to document the
          reasons why they coded it as all, some, or none.

                              APPROACH TO CODING IMPACTS EVALUATIONS AND CODING INSTRUMENT

Box C.2: Quality of Evaluation Design and Internal Validity
The quality of evaluation design is the most critical determinant of impact evaluation
quality; it is the linchpin for estimating the share of the change in outcomes attributable
to the intervention. The starting point for this exercise is identifying the evaluation
design (experimental or quasi-experimental) and method (difference-in-difference,
matching, instrumental variables, or regression discontinuity) used to identify program
impacts. The next step is assessing whether the report provides a discussion of the
assumptions or conditions under which the estimation method is valid:
      Assumptions under randomized experiment: (i) balanced treatment and control
       groups (the two groups having no statistically significant difference in main
       baseline or time-invariant characteristics); and (ii) noncompliance or attrition
       (minimal incidence of beneficiaries not receiving treatment or leaving the
       program, and vice versa).
      Assumptions under double difference: (i) parallel trending (the treatment and
       control groups progress similarly in terms of the outcomes of interests); and
       (ii) time-varying confounders (no time-variant variables that may affect the
       progress of the outcomes other than the intervention).
      Assumptions under matching: (i) common support (the overlap in terms of
       propensity scores or matching variables between the treatment and control
       group); (ii) balancing checks (the treatment and control groups having no
       statistically significant difference in main observable characteristics); (iii)
       matching on outcomes or covariates (the variables used to match are not
       affected by the intervention); and (iv) selection on unobservables (there
       should be a discussion of potential selection bias due to unobservable
       differences between the treatment and control).
      Assumptions under instrumental variables: (i) first stage tested (the relationship
       between the intervention and the instrument is statistically significant; F-test
       or Wald test); and (ii) exclusion restriction (the instrument affects the
       outcome only via the intervention).
      Assumptions under regression discontinuity: (i) sorting around the assignment
       rule (beneficiaries tricking the rule to be eligible for the treatment); and (ii)
       balanced covariates at discontinuity (the two subgroups above and below the
       eligibility cutoff have statistically similar characteristics).


      Assessment of the strength and stability of findings, usually achieved through
       various types of robustness checks. After determining the main impact
       evaluation method, robustness checks were coded based on the following
       questions:



                                                                                        121

          findings, and any other major concerns. Reviewers rated the impact evaluations
          as being A (not meeting most of the criteria), AA (meeting some, but not all,
          of the criteria), or AAA (meeting most of the criteria).

Step 3: Code Relevant Information
After determining a rating for each study, additional information from AA and
AAA studies was coded. Information was recorded in all of the following categories
for both AA and AAA studies, although all variables were only coded for AAA
studies.

         Study information:
                  Country, author, year and type of publication

Appendix D: Expanded Discussion of
Conceptual Model
Identifying pathways through which policies can reduce maternal and childhood
mortality is a complex undertaking as factors underlying these processes are
multiple. The figure below presents an extended conceptual model outlining the
inputs, activities, and outputs necessary to implement strategies aiming to reduce
maternal and child mortality.

Diseases and infections such as malaria, measles, pneumonia, or neonatal tetanus
coupled with obstetric and postnatal complications (birth asphyxia or untreated
eclampsia) for mothers and newborns are among the main direct causes of maternal
and child deaths (Black and others 2003; Graham and others 2006; WHO 2005a).
High prevalence of anemia and malnutrition also affect directly and indirectly the
possibility of survival by increasing the risk of illness as well as complications
during childbirth. Mothers´ undernutrition is linked with low birth weight in babies,
who are at an increasing risk of dying or developing chronic diseases. These deaths,
nevertheless, can be prevented with cost-effective clinical interventions proven to
reduce the risk of dying (Campbell and Graham 2006; Jones and others 2003;
Wagstaff and others 2006).

Following a continuum of care approach, essential services for mothers, newborns,
and children are most effective when they are delivered in integrated packages
through a functioning health system at critical points during the life cycle of mothers
and children (UNICEF 2009); no single intervention can effectively reduce the rate of
mortality alone (Campbell and Graham 2006). Among key strategies identified are
enhanced nutrition (increased food intake and supplementation with folic acid and
iron); safe water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities and practices (particularly
important for promoting clean delivery and prevention of diarrhea); disease
prevention and treatment; quality reproductive health services; adequate antenatal
care; skilled assistance at delivery; basic and comprehensive emergency obstetric
and newborn care; postnatal care and Integrated Management of Neonatal and
Childhood Illnesses (UNICEF 2009). Educating girls and empowering women are
potentially the core strategy for creating an enabling environment for promoting
maternal and child health.

These strategies impact indirect factors necessary to overcome the diverse barriers
that hinder good health and access to necessary care services such as poverty, low
education levels, poor roads and transport infrastructures, cultural norms, and lack
of awareness or confidence in health services. As indicated in figure D.1,

                                                 EXPANDED DISCUSSION OF CONCEPTUAL MODEL
interventions can be grouped into three primary domains: governance (public
policies and actions), provision of health services and other nonhealth services, and
interventions aiming to increase the demand of health care and enhance health
practices. Effective coverage of maternal and child care services requires policies
integrating MCH in their programs and allocating sufficient resources to maintain a
functioning health-service delivery system. By ensuring a legal framework and
promoting monitoring systems, countries can guarantee availability of a skilled
health workforce, vaccines and essential drugs as well as ensuring women and
children rights to access health services.

The provision of health services and their utilization are essential in reducing
maternal and child mortality. As such, health system’s actions from the supply-side
aiming to improve service delivery, through for example modernizing available
health infrastructure and ensuring the training, deployment, and adequate skills of
health workers in delivering such interventions, are essential. Similarly, health
financing strategies can improve access and efficiency by enhancing providers’
performance and optimizing the use of funds. Resources such as personnel,
facilities, equipment, supplies, or funds are necessary to deliver these interventions.

On the other hand, households are producers of health in terms of healthy practices
and lifestyles and are users of health services. Perceiving risks and diseases is an
essential part of the causal chain to health outcomes and necessary for maternal and
child health interventions. Individuals and households obtain information and
knowledge on health practices or incentives to utilize health services when needed.
Ideally, increasing knowledge will translate into a change in behavior, but this is not
always the case. Therefore, an important aspect to influence mortality outcomes is to
identify the channels through which knowledge and information is translated to
behavioral change not only at the individual level but at the community level. An
additional significant component of demand-side interventions is to provide
individuals with the means to overcome the diverse barriers hindering access to
good health and to necessary care (for example, financial, geographical, cultural).
Among these means are health insurance, cash transfers and financial incentives that
can be effective instruments to attain financial protection and increase health
outcomes.

Note: Numbers in brackets in the y-axis refer to the study number in the Reference list and Appendix F. World Bank involvement type is indicated by studies above the solid
horizontal line and with the ‡ symbol in the y-axis label. Effect size is given either as a standardized mean effect (SME), the impact effect expressed as percentage of a
baseline measure, or an odds ratio (OR) computed as the logarithm of the OR. The confidence intervals reflect the appropriately rescaled confidence intervals of the impact
estimates. Solid triangles indicate studies with an AAA quality rating; open squares indicate an AA rating. The dashed vertical line indicates the null hypothesis of no effect.

Notes
Chapter 1
1Thislack of evidence does not establish that there is no link between economic growth or
poverty reduction and maternal and child morbidity. Rather, there have been few reliable
studies done with an evaluation strategy which could credibly establish or refute such a link
(Greene and Merrick 2005).
2In comparison to the efforts made for combating communicable diseases, MCH received
relatively less attention from the international community until the 2000 Millennium
Summit where the MDGs were adopted. Since then, a number of global partnerships and
initiatives have been established. The Partnership for Maternal, Newborn & Child Health
aims to raise awareness and advocacy related to reproductive and child health. New
initiatives, including the Global Campaign for the Health MDGs, focus on MCH. The World
Bank has renewed its commitment to increase investments in gender through addressing
adolescent motherhood as a priority area for the sixteenth replenishment of Individual
Development Account resources (World Bank 2010).
3A systematic review is an overview of primary research on a particular research question
that tries to methodically identify, select, synthesize, and appraise all high-quality research
evidence relevant to the question in order to answer it. Systematic reviews may or may not
contain meta-analyses (the use of statistical methods to summarize the results of
independent studies), and meta-analyses may or may not be drawn from a systematic
review of studies.
4Mosley   and Chen (1984) suggest five groups: (1) maternal factors: age, parity, and birth
interval; (2) environmental contamination: air, food, water, fingers, skin, soil, inanimate
objects, and insect vectors; (3) nutrient deficiency: calories, protein, and micronutrients
(vitamins and minerals); (4) injury: accidental and intentional; and (5) personal illness
control: personal preventive measures and medical treatment.
5Some    interventions could have been categorized into more than three intervention types.
Coders took the three most relevant types. For example, Midhet and Becker[47] evaluated a
community-based intervention of men’s and women’s groups with additional training for
local health workers in Pakistan. This was coded as an intervention with important elements
of delivery modality as it was testing men- versus women-only groups; knowledge and
information as it was designed to teach men and women important maternal and child
health-related material; and health workforce as it trained health workers. The intervention
also provided means of emergency transportation, but because the evaluation gave very
little attention to this element and did not provide any information on its take-up within the
program, the coding limits the intervention types to the above three rather than supplanting
any of them with transportation.
6Other statistical methods, including multivariate regression using a single cross-section, are
generally not considered impact evaluations and are not included in this review.

Chapter 2

1WHO   defines a skilled birth attendant as “an accredited health professional—such as a
midwife, doctor, or nurse—who has been educated and trained to proficiency in the skills
needed to manage normal (uncomplicated) pregnancies, childbirth and the immediate
postnatal period, and in the identification, management, and referral of complications in
women and newborns.”

4The  study examined heterogeneity in the effect of the JSY program on mortality with
respect to the structural quality of care of health care providers. The measure of structural
quality of care is made up of six components: 24-hour service availability; staffing; training
of staff; basic infrastructure; equipment; and drugs.
5The  study used two impact evaluation methods: difference in differences at the district
level and exact-matching at the household level. Because the differences in differences was a
stronger, more robust identification method, the report used its result (nonsignificant
impact on perinatal, neonatal, and maternal deaths) The matching showed a significant
reduction in the probability of perinatal and neonatal deaths but a null result for maternal
mortality again.
As a matter of interest, the AAA study on JSY also used a difference in differences
identification strategy to estimate district-level effects, but also used an instrumental
variable to improve identification and construct validity of when the reform took effect.
The difference-in-difference strategies for both the AAA and AA JSY studies used repeated
cross section data to create a district-level panel.
6Other infant morbidity outcomes tested in the Ukraine Mother and Infant Health Project
study but found to be not significant include infection, nervous system and respiratory
system complications, congenital anomalies, and perinatal deviations.
7A simple mean-comparison test rejects the equality of time exposure between those studies
reporting significant and insignificant results (P value: 0.0055).

1Neonatal mortality is defined as those deaths occurring in the first 28 days of life. Deaths
occurring during the first week of life are referred to as early neonatal mortality, and those
occurring after the seventh day but before the 28th day of life are late neonatal deaths.
Prenatal mortality refers to deaths occurring between 22 weeks (154 days) of gestation and
seven days after birth (Lander 2006).
2Packages for essential newborn care includes birth preparedness, clean delivery, cord care,
thermal care (skin-to-skin care), breastfeeding promotion, and danger sign recognition.
3Granados   and Sánchez (2013) found a significant reduction in under-five mortality due to
infectious diseases, but there was heterogeneity in their results for overall child mortality.
Child mortality fell in municipalities that underwent reform before 1994 and those that used
private or mixed capital reforms, but it actually increased in reformed municipalities that
had more than 2,500 subscribers. The authors hypothesize that this may be due to the
smaller increase in water provision in the larger municipalities.


Chapter 4

1The most common intervention type among World Bank projects and interventions with
Bank financing was strategy planning and policy, which was used in 7 of the 15
interventions, including in the only intervention to focus uniquely on governance. It was
included in six of the eight bundled interventions; the remaining six evaluations were
divided between the health sector (3), other provision sectors (1), and utilization (2).

2Ofthe four World Bank projects, only two evaluate the effect on SBA, and only one of the
two explicitly lists SBA as a Project Development Outcome.
3This review has cast doubt on the assumption that the proportion of deliveries attended by
skilled health personnel is a robust indicator for maternal or neonatal mortality. As it is no
more of an intrinsically valuable outcome than other indicators (for example, mortality or
antenatal care), project designers may want to explore including more relevant indicators in
their project development objectives.
4Itis possible, especially for medical products and technologies, that the rigorous studies
that do exist are clinical evaluations or efficacy trials, rather than behavioral impact
evaluations.
