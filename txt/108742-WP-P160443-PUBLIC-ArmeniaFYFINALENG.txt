1   Armenia: Poverty Reduction and Shared Prosperity, South Caucasus Poverty team
Executive summary: patterns of poverty reduction and shared prosperity

 Economic growth translated into higher levels of consumption for all parts of the welfare
  distribution and lower poverty. Consumption growth for the bottom 40 was lower than for the total of
  the population.



 Between 2010 and 2014 poverty in Armenia declined. An international comparison shows that
  Armenia still has one of the highest poverty rates in Europe and Central Asia and only made limited
  progress after the global economic crisis hit the country in 2009.


 Despite positive consumption growth for all households, (i) regional disparities between Yerevan,
  other urban areas and rural areas remain high, (ii) vulnerability to poverty persists, and (iii) non-monetary
  measures of welfare highlight development gaps.

Executive summary: drivers of income growth and poverty reduction

 Income growth and poverty reduction: Decline in poverty benefited from (i) higher employment rates
  and wages, as well as growth in agricultural sales, (ii) remittances and (iii) social expenditure such as
  pensions.

 Labor markets: growth of services and manufacturing translated into additional employment
  opportunities and higher wages. Growth of sales in the agricultural sector supported rural areas.
  Individuals in poor households (i) are more often unemployed, (ii) work fewer hours, (iii) are more often
  temporary or seasonal workers, and (iv) experience less protection due to different type of contracts.
  Other urban areas do not create sufficient employment opportunities in the non- agricultural private
  sector to accommodate decreasing employment in agricultural sector.


 Migration: international migration creates employment opportunities for a landlocked country. At the
  same time, remittances are subject to substantial fluctuations triggered by shifts in the economic
  environment.


 Fiscal activity: overall, taxes and expenditure reduce poverty and inequality; pensions are an important
  source of income and transfers through the family benefit program (FBP) reduce the intensity of poverty.
  Yet, poverty impact of FBP is small as budget is limited.

Executive summary: policy agenda




Policy agenda: Patterns of poverty and shared prosperity suggest that policy agenda should
focus on inclusiveness of economic growth:

    (i) Supporting growth,

    (ii) Investing in endowment, and

    (iii) Protecting the poor and vulnerable.

 Poverty reduction: In 2014, 26.3 percent of the population lived below the international poverty line of 2.5
 USD PPP. Compared to 2010, poverty has declined, but the share of poor households is still higher than
 before the global economic crisis which hit the country in 2009.

 Poverty in Armenia declined from 35.8 percent in 2010 to 30.0 percent in 2014 (national poverty line).
 Over the same time period, poor households experienced positive consumption growth and moved
 closer to poverty line. But this pace of poverty reduction is slower than in pre-crisis years (2004-2007).

 their consumption levels. However, reduction in poverty could have been bigger if poor households
 would have grown at an equal pace as relatively richer households.

 Gini coefficient of 0.277 in 2014 indicates moderate to low levels of inequality: (1) inequality increased
 mildly between 2008 and 2014; (2) levels and change in inequality appear to be biggest for Yerevan; (3)
 inequality mostly within regions – not too much inequality between regions.

 Income growth and decline in poverty between 2010 and 2014 driven by (1) higher employment and
 wages, (2) increasing agricultural output but also employment in rural areas, and (3) additional
 remittances and (4) private transfers; also, (5) pensions helped households to escape poverty.

Structural transformation and labor markets

 Private sector growth has raised incomes
             for all households.


  Growth of services and manufacturing translated into new
   employment opportunities and higher wages.

  Increasing agricultural sales, high productivity services in
   Yerevan and limited job creation in other urban areas.

  Labor market outcomes for poor households: lower quality
   of employment and lower productivity of labor.
Structural transformation: growth of services and manufacturing (excluding construction) translated into
new employment opportunities and higher wages. Reallocation between different sectors of the
economy.

                       Migration


Internal and external migration extend
       domestic labor markets

 Opportunity for migration expands domestic labor market
  and generates additional income from remittances.

 Role of internal and external migration as an equalizer
  between locations (poverty in other urban areas).

 Sustainability: dependence on remittances also increases
  vulnerability through contagion of external shocks.
 Labor mobility characterizes small open economy: across all parts of the welfare distribution, 15.9
 percent of households receive remittances from international migration and 3.5 percent of households
 receive private transfers from within the country.

                       Fact 3

             Fiscal and social policy



  Social spending protect poor and
       vulnerable households


 Fiscal activity contributed to lower poverty
  and inequality.

 Pensions and family benefit program are
 important to lift households out of poverty.
 Fiscal policy redistributes income in Armenia (status quo): (1) reduces poverty, (2) decreases inequality,
 and (3) expenditures on social protection, health and education are progressive.

Policy Agenda
Basic policy agenda

Context: Structural transformation of the economy and poverty reduction, but challenges to
shared prosperity. Environment with global slowdown (in the short term), limited fiscal space
and demographic transition (in the long term).

1 Supporting growth
• Deepen structural transformation and promote productivity and employment growth
• Raise agricultural productivity and non-agriculture private sector growth in other urban
   areas

2 Investing in endowment
• Expand asset endowment (skills) and improve access to and quality of basic services
• Enhance connectivity (infrastructure and people)

3 Protecting the poor and vulnerable
• Strengthen safety nets (family benefit program) to reduce vulnerability to shocks and
   reforms (energy prices) while being mindful of fiscal sustainability reforms

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
ON DATA AND METHODOLOGY
SOUTH CAUCASUS POVERTY TEAM
POVERTY AND EQUITY GLOBAL PRACTICE
Data: Integrated Living Conditions Survey

 The National Statistics Service of the Republic of Armenia (NSS RA) conducts the
     Integrated Living Conditions Survey (ILCS) on an annual basis. The survey is the official
     source to monitor poverty and measure social indicators in the country.


 Analyses based upon household data inform decision makers in Armenia and serve as
     primary source of information on living standards for international organizations.
     Consequently, these data are heavily relied upon by the government.


 The NSSRA produces an annual publication - Social Snapshot and Poverty in Armenia -
     presenting analysis of poverty along with employment and other social indicators using the
     ILCS. This report is used by line ministries (such as the Ministry of Labor and Social
     Affairs) and members of the public. The ILCS data and documentation is available through
     the website www.armstat.am.

 Methodology: national poverty measurement methodology for
 Armenia

 Official poverty estimates for Armenia are based on the                National poverty measurement methodology for
      "Cost of Basic Needs" approach which determines three              Armenia
      different poverty lines: (1) the food poverty line which uses
      the minimum required level of calories; (2) the lower                  Metric and concept
      poverty line which refers to the "Consumption Basket                   • Absolute poverty using consumption
      Method;" and (3) the upper poverty line which makes use                   expenditure
      of the "Food Expenditure Method.“
                                                                             Welfare aggregate includes food and nonfood
 In 2014, the most recent year of published figures, the                     consumption
      three different poverty headcount rates were 2.3, 10.9 and             • Durables and own produced goods
      30.0 percent, respectively (exploring a consumption                    • Price adjustments: regional prices
      aggregate which is corrected using an adult equivalence                • Scaling: per adult equivalent
      scale).
                                                                             Poverty line (revised in 2009)
 The World Bank estimates a harmonized consumption                          • Cost of basic needs: 2,232 calories
      aggregate from ILCS data which is then used for                        • Consumption patterns of the 2nd to 4th decile of
      international comparisons (such as international poverty                  the welfare distribution
      rates). The welfare aggregate includes food and nonfood
      consumption, durables and health expenditure. For more

improved quality of employment, less employment opportunities create challenges for rural areas.
