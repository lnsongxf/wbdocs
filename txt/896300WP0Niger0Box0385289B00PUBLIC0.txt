    poverty rate could be significantly lower than
    indicated by the earlier HNLSS, and that the
    dynamic of poverty reduction in Nigeria may
    also be stronger than previously thought.
    Both the new GDP numbers and GHS-based
    poverty numbers also support the notion that
    growth and poverty reduction are primarily
    an urban phenomenon in Nigeria. It would
    appear that, in rural areas, growth is slower,
    poverty is higher, and poverty reduction is
    slower. The new living standards estimates
    contained within also imply an even stronger
    divide between the North and South in
    Nigeria than do previous figures, with the
    North experiencing significantly higher
    poverty and, with the exception of North
    Central, a lack of recent progress in poverty
    reduction. In addition, a large number of
    Nigerians are clustered around the poverty
    line, implying a high degree of vulnerability
    for a large part of the population.

  The Gini index is a measure of income inequality that falls between 0 and 1.
A higher Gini indicates more inequality, i.e. lower income groups consume a
smaller share of national income. A Gini measured by household surveys will
typically underestimate the actual level of inequality, as very wealthy people
usually do not participate in household surveys.
