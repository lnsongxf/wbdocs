SRI LANKA DEVELOPMENT UPDATE

Fall 2016
Preface
          The Sri Lanka Development Update has two main aims. First, it reports on the key
          developments over the past six months in Sri Lanka’s economy, and places these in a
          longer term and global context. Based on these developments, and on policy changes
          over the period, it updates the outlook for Sri Lanka’s economy and social welfare.
          Second, the Update provides a more in-depth examination of selected economic and
          policy issues, and analysis of medium-term development challenges. It is intended for
          a wide audience, including policymakers, business leaders, financial market
          participants, and the community of analysts and professionals engaged in Sri Lanka’s
          evolving economy.

 Executive Summary




                1. Recent Developments
Global economy is      In a year characterized by weak oil and commodity prices, slowing capital flows and
not yet out of         shrinking global trade; global growth continued to disappoint slowing to 2.4 percent
doldrums; however,     in 2015. Growth in advanced economies remained modest while China’s transition
South Asia remains a   to a more consumption oriented growth model decelerated its growth. Emerging
bright spot.           markets and developing countries are facing stronger headwinds, including weaker
                       growth among advanced economies and persistently low commodity prices, as well
                       as lackluster global trade. However, economic activity in South Asia has remained
                       relatively resilient benefitting from low commodity prices despite the signs of weak
                       capital flows and remittances.

Sri Lanka’s            With no exception, Sri Lanka also faced the challenges of a trying global environment
macroeconomic          in 2015. Uncertainties in an election year that saw a major political transition
performance            contributed to elevate the risks stemming from global context. The accommodative
deteriorated in many   policy choices supported economic growth. However, they were of little help in
ways in 2015.          addressing the global and domestic economic challenges; leaving the country with
                       higher public debt, lower external buffers and rising core inflation. Citing growing

                       one notch to B+ from BB- with a negative outlook while S&P kept Sri Lanka's long-
                       term sovereign credit rating at B+, but changed the outlook to negative from stable.

Authorities took       After passing the 2016 budget, the government proposed a few key revisions as
policy measures        measures to reduce the projected fiscal deficit from 5.9 to 5.4 percent of GDP. These
aimed at stability,    include increasing the (Value Added Tax) VAT rate to 15 percent from the existing
beginning 2016.        11 percent; imposing a capital gains tax; and revising personal and corporate income
                       tax regimes to yield more revenues. In parallel, monetary policy was tightened in the

                        reverse a longstanding decline in tax revenues as a share of GDP with a view to reduce
                        the fiscal deficit and return the public debt level to a sustainable path while making
                        the system fairer. Broad reforms on the state owned enterprise were proposed to
                        reduce fiscal burden, increase transparency and improve commercial viability of
                        operations.

Fiscal risks remain     The fiscal deficit rose sharply in 2015 due to increased expenditures in salary hikes
with larger deficit     and subsidies, one-off charges, reduced consumption taxes and increased interest
and debt.               costs on resultant deficit financing. Although one-off revenues and amplified motor
                        vehicle excise tax collection helped mitigate the impact, the deficit increased to 7.4
                        percent of GDP from a budgeted 4.4 percent of GDP for 2015. A persistently high
                        primary deficit, rising real interest rates and the exchange rate depreciation increased
                        the public debt to GDP ratio to 76.0 in 2015, while treasury guarantees are estimated
                        at 5.4 percent of GDP. The fiscal deficit in the first five months of 2016 marginally
                        improved on increased tax collection. However, a Supreme Court ruling halted the
                        implementation of new VAT proposals in July, one month after the introduction.

A new IMF program       The International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a 36-month Extended Fund
is providing a solid    Facility (EFF) for about USD 1.5 billion in June 2016. The program aims to provide
platform for macro-     a policy anchor for macroeconomic stability and structural reforms, while
fiscal stability        strengthening external resiliency in a challenging global environment. It is also
                        intended to add to the market confidence and catalyze additional financing from other
                        multilateral and bilateral loans as well.

World Bank supports Complementing the EFF, the World Bank approved a USD 100 million Development
the government’s    Policy Financing (DPF) operation. This facility supports the government to carry out
reform agenda.      reforms to eliminate obstacles to private sector competitiveness, enhance
                    transparency and public sector management and improve fiscal sustainability.

Growth decelerated      In 2015, economic growth marginally decelerated to 4.8 percent compared to 4.9
through to 1H 2016;     percent in 2014 mainly on account of the decline in the construction sector and the
inflation bottomed      increased base due to a GDP revision for 2014. The first half of 2016 saw the growth
and showed              further declining to 3.9 percent reflecting the impact of inclement weather in the
pressures since late    second quarter. Downward price revisions in key consumer items, including energy;
2015.                   low commodity prices in the global market; and overall improved domestic supply
                        conditions eased annual average inflation to 0.9 percent in 2015. However, the base
                        effect, adverse weather conditions and demand pressures pushed the inflation up to
                        3.0 percent by August 2016.

                         issuance of fresh Eurobonds.

                2. Outlook and risks
A relatively favorable   Monetary tightening and enhanced currency flexibility have contributed to improve
outlook is projected     short-term stability. Meanwhile, the IMF program will add to the confidence while
in the backdrop of       helping reform the tax system to generate more revenues with a view to ensure fiscal
policy reforms;          sustainability. The government has undertaken to implement a medium-term reform
downside risks are       agenda that aims to improve competitiveness, governance and public financial
substantial.             management that would bring in long-term benefits. These developments have
                         contributed to an improved outlook.

                         Growth is expected to remain unchanged in 2016 and grow marginally over 5.0
                         percent beyond, driven by private consumption and postponed FDI in 2015. The
                         reduced drag from imports thanks to low commodity prices and recent policy
                         measures to curb import growth will contribute to the increase in growth. The impact
                         of past currency depreciation along with the increase of VAT rate will increase
                         inflation in 2016 and 2017 although low international commodity prices will maintain
                         the downward pressure.

                         The external current account deficit is projected to reach its narrowest point in 2016
                         and rise thereafter due to the increase in global commodity prices. The reduction of
                         merchandise imports and strong tourism receipts will improve the trade balance in
                         2016; although, the cushion received from the remittances is projected to be subdued
                         with continued low oil prices affecting the Middle East. Inflows to the government
                         and FDI inflows will help closing the external financing needs with no Eurobond
                         falling due in 2016. External financing requirement is poised to increase in outer years
                         when state bank and government Eurobonds fall due.

                         The fiscal deficit is projected at 5.7percent of GDP for 2016 after considering the key
                         policy measures and related delays in implementation. Further revenue increasing
                         policy measures along with improved tax administration will help increase revenues
                         and reduce the deficit to 3.5 of GDP by 2020. The planned action on tax expenditure
                         analysis will improve tax policy making process and transparency while effective use
                         of information systems will help an efficient administration.

                         Key risks include a growth slowdown, which would lead to a fast rising public debt
                         burden. In such an eventuality, fiscal consolidation through strengthening revenue
                         and more efficient debt management will become key to reduce the public debt. While
                         the direct impact of a slowdown in China and the Brexit would be limited, continued
                         economic woes in the Middle East, the EU and Russia could adversely affect exports
                         and remittance inflows. Tightening global financial conditions could further elevate
                         capital outflows and currency pressure, and make borrowing more expensive.

                         The government policy statements have indicated the appetite to implement much
                         needed reforms in the areas of fiscal operations, competitiveness and governance.
                         These policy reforms, if successfully implemented while paying attention to the

                         related policy trade-offs could uplift the country into the Upper Middle Income state
                         in the medium term. Although a turbulent external environment and domestic
                         political considerations makes it challenging, a strong political will and the support of
                         the bureaucracy should help advancing the reform agenda. Steps are needed to ensure
                         the support of private sector and the civil society.

                3. Special focus
Systematic Country       The special focus section discusses the Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD)1 for Sri
Diagnostic provides      Lanka, launched by the World Bank in February 2016. The objective of the SCD is
a platform to identify   to identify the most critical constraints and opportunities facing Sri Lanka in
development              accelerating progress toward the goals of ending extreme poverty and promoting
challenges.              shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. The SCD is an objective, evidence-based,
                         candid assessment of the main challenges facing the country, without limitation to the
                         areas where the WBG is currently engaged.

                         The key development challenges identified in the Sri Lankan context are:
                            1. The fiscal challenge
                            2. Promoting more and better jobs for the bottom 40 percent
                            3. Inward versus outward orientation of the economy
                            4. The relationship between the public sector and private sector
                            5. Social Inclusion Challenges

 A. Recent Developments




South Asia               At 2.4 percent, the global growth remained sluggish and lower than expected in 2015
performed                and is expected to remain the same for 2016. The context is characterized by weak oil
reasonably well, but     and commodity prices, slowing capital flows and shrinking global trade. Growth in
the challenges are       advanced economies remained modest while China’s experienced deceleration in its
substantial going        transition to a more balanced growth path after a decade of strong credit and
forward.                 investment growth. Although emerging market and developing economies grew faster
                         than advanced economies, performance across countries remained uneven and
                         generally weaker than the historical performance. South Asia defies a sluggish world
                         economy and continues its path of gradual growth acceleration during 2016. Led by
                         a solid India, the region remains a global hot spot. South Asian economies proved
                         resilient vis-à-vis external headwinds, such as China’s slowdown or uncertainty
                         surrounding monetary policy in advanced economies. But some are beginning to feel
                         the sting from slowing remittance flows or waning oil price dividends. Against this
                         backdrop of relative stability but fading tailwinds, South Asia will need to activate the
                         full potential of two core growth drivers - private investment and exports - to sustain
                         and further increase its economic dynamism.2

 Growth decelerated in the first half of 2016 following moderation in 2015.

Inclement weather        Torrential rains and floods in the month of May took a heavy toll on economy’s
weakened growth in       performance in the first half.3 Agriculture sector suffered the most, reporting a
the first half of 2016   negative contribution to growth in the second quarter, for the first time in five years
                         while industry and service sectors also faced severe disruptions leading to subdued

                                                 decelerated growth in the second quarter to 2.6 percent. Despite the impact of the
                                                 disaster, the first half posted an overall growth of 3.9 percent thanks to the growth of
                                                 5.2 percent in the first quarter, which received a boost from strong expansion of
                                                 private credit.

Box 1: Sri Lanka’s growth has been driven by non-tradable sectors
  Led by growth in non-tradable sectors, Sri Lanka’s real GDP expanded by 34.4 percent from 2010 to 2015.
  The top six sectors contributing to 69.0 percent of the total growth during the period were all non-tradable sectors:
  transport, other personal services, construction, wholesale & retail trade, financial services, and real estate (see chart).
  Other personal services, a category added to GDP in the rebasing exercise in 2014, alone contributed to 13.3 percent
  of the total growth. Reflecting the performance of improving transportation network and an increasing motor vehicle
  fleet, the transportation sector contributed to 12.9 percent of the overall growth. The post-conflict infrastructure
  development thrust drove the construction sector’s contribution to gro wth to 12.1 percent of the total growth.
  Wholesale & retail trade, financial services and real estate sectors contributed to growth at 11.4, 10.6 and 8.7 percent
  respectively. However, the agricultural sectors contributed to only 6.4 percent of the growth while all other
  manufacturing/service sectors collectively accounted for 24.6 percent of the growth.
  The tradable sectors declined in importance, but can be important future drivers of sustained growth. 4
  Shifting resources into tradable sectors, led by manufacturing, is desirable for emerging markets because productivity
  gains are higher in tradable sectors than in non-tradable sectors.5 Sri Lanka’s share of manufacturing output, which
  was 18.7 percent in 2000, rose to 19.5 percent in 2005, and declined to 17.3 percent by 2015 due to faster growth in
  the services sector. The government’s vision recognizes that while the economy has grown rapidly in the last decade,
  the current drivers of economic growth are unlikely to remain adequate for inclusive and sustainable growth in the
  coming decade. Authorities have identified the need to strengthen competitiveness not only in traditional sectors such
  as apparel, natural resources transformation, and tourism but also to establish the necessary conditions for a thriving
  knowledge economy, the integration of productive local companies in global value chains, and the attainment of higher
  value addition in the manufacturing sector.

 The high fiscal deficit due to low revenues continues to be a key macro concern; meeting fiscal
 targets for 2016 will be challenging with some revenue proposals yet to be implemented.

In 2015, the fiscal    The fiscal deficit rose sharply as a share of GDP to 7.4 percent compared to a target

expenditures.          increased interest costs on resultant deficit financing elevated the current expenditure
                       by 2.6 percentage points to 15.2 percent of GDP. While public investment and net
                       lending was reduced to manage the deficit, the recording of an approximate volume
                       equivalent to 1 percent of GDP in the 2015 accounts, which represented cost
                       overruns of capital projects for 2013 and 2014 pushed up the recorded public
                       investment and net lending to a four-year high. With increased current and capital
                       expenditures, total expenditure rose to 20.5 percent of GDP. Although government
                       revenues increased by 1.6 percentage points to 13.0 percent of GDP primarily on
                       one-off revenue measures11 and increased motor vehicle excise taxes on a record high
                       motor vehicle imports surge, it was not sufficient to return the deficit to a
                       consolidation path in 2015 (Figure 5, 6 and 7).12,13

The deficit was        Foreign sources provided about 28 percent of net financing or LKR 237 billion, which

                       by the central bank mainly through purchasing of treasury bills in the primary market.




                       9 The 2015 deficit also represents a worsening vis-à-vis the previous year deficit of 5.9 percent of GDP.
                       10  Official provisional estimates. The IMF estimates the deficit for 2015 to be 6.9 percent of GDP
                          (Country report 16/50, IMF, June 2016) reflecting an accounting arrangement whereby cost overruns
                          for capital projects amounting to LKR 62 billion or 0.6 percent of GDP (which were paid but not
                          recorded in 2014) were recorded in the 2015 account.
                       11 Included was a retrospective super gain tax at 25 percent imposed on corporates that generated profits

                          over LKR 2.0 billion in 2013/14
                       12 Sri Lanka has one of the lowest tax-to-GDP ratios in the world at 10.1 percent for 2014. In the past,

                          between 2009 and 2014 in particular, the fiscal consolidation was mainly took place through
                          expenditure reduction leading to relatively low allocations for social welfare, public investment, and
                          expenditure on education and health. Although this consolidation effort is impressive, the total
                          spending at or below 20 percent of GDP seems low, given the needs of a middle-income country
                       13 The fiscal deficit in the first five months of 2016 marginally improved on increased tax collection.

                          However, a Supreme Court ruling halted the implementation of new VAT proposals in July, after one
                          month of introduction.
                       14 During the year, USD 2.15 billion maturing in ten years were issued at yields between 6.125 and 6.85

                          percent while USD 500 million issued in 2009 was repaid.

                         3.3 and 3.2 percent of GDP, respectively. The main drivers of revenue were an
                         increase of the Nation Building Tax rate and a revision of fees and charges while there
                         were proposals that effectively reduce the collection of VAT, personal income tax
                         and corporate income tax. Further, the proposed strengthening of indirect taxes while

                         Implementation of the budget could potentially have further increased deficit and

consolidation efforts.   objectives of the program relate to fiscal policy and the balance of payments, and
                         include measures to: (a) implement a structural increase in revenues, facilitating a
                         reduction in the fiscal deficit to 3.5 percent of GDP by 2020; (b) reverse the decline
                         in central bank foreign exchange reserves; (c) reduce public debt relative to GDP and
                         lower Sri Lanka’s risk of debt distress; and (d) enhance public financial management
                         and improve the operations of state owned enterprises. The program also aims to
                         transition toward inflation targeting with a flexible exchange rate regime and to
                         promote sustainable and inclusive economic growth. Although challenging, the
                         implementation of the program will help the government to return to a sustainable
                         fiscal path.19

Legal obstacles for      The key proposal announced for fiscal consolidation in support of the IMF program

                         environment. Delay or suspension of implementation of VAT proposals could
                         adversely affect the fiscal consolidation path of the IMF program. However, the fiscal
                         deficit of the first half stood at 2.7 percent of estimated GDP for 2016 compared to
                         the 3.6 percent reported for 2015.

 Fiscal risk has increased due to a sharp rise in public debt as a share of GDP and has led to a
 downgrade of credit rating.


                         17 Although the Prime Minister announced that the current ratio of indirect-to-direct taxes of 81:19 was
                            expected to change to 60:40 in the medium term, the budget plans would have led to a ratio of 85:15
                            for 2016. The budget proposed to raise the personal income tax (PIT) threshold from LKR 500,000
                            to LKR 2.4 million while unifying the rate at 15 percent. The new threshold would be about 5 times
                            the per capita income, and as such it could further erode the tax base of PIT. The changes to corporate
                            income tax (CIT) were also expected to reduce revenue.
                         18 The proposal in the 2016 budget to increase the tax-free threshold was withdrawn and the corporate

                            tax rates were increased on a few sectors that enjoyed concessionary rates.

Public debt rose        Currency depreciation, relatively slow growth, high primary deficit and rising real
sharply in 2015.        interest rates collectively led to a sharp increase in the public debt-to-GDP ratio to
                        76.0 percent in 2015 from 70.7 percent in 2014. Meanwhile, the debt profile also
                        indicated significant exposure to a variety of risks. A high proportion of foreign
                        currency denominated debt,20 a significant share of domestic debt in the form of T
                        bills and 1/3 of the domestic debt maturing within a year continued to expose the
                        public debt to exchange rate, interest rate and refinancing risks. These factors suggest
                        that, in the absence of high growth rates seen in earlier years, fiscal consolidation and
                        more efficient debt management are key to improving debt profile and bringing it
                        back debt to a sustainable path (Figure 8 and 9).

Fiscal risks            Treasury guarantees issued to State-Owned-Enterprises to borrow from the markets
emanating from state    increased from 1.4 percent to 5.3 percent of GDP between 2006 and 2015. While
owned entities are      this includes debt by state-owned business enterprises with own sources of revenue,
substantial.            increasingly guarantees have been given to entities with limited sources of revenue,
                        such as the Road Development Authority (RDA). In addition to guaranteed debt,
                        many of these entities have also borrowed without a guarantee. Moreover, the staff
                        estimates that the volume of non-financial SOE debt amounted to approximately 11.6
                        percent of GDP as of end 2015.21

Concessional            The country’s external concessional sources are being replaced by borrowings on
external borrowing      commercial terms, with its graduation to a lower-middle income country. In the recent
sources are drying      past, the authorities have been successful in tapping international markets consistently
up while debt profile   with sovereign bond issues. Between 2007 and 2015, the government sold USD 7.65
show some               billion of sovereign bonds. As a result of increased commercial borrowings, the non-
pressures.              concessional and commercial component of the government foreign debt rose from
                        1 percent in 2000 to 51 percent in 2015. Meanwhile, the interest rate risks on foreign
                        currency debt has risen while average interest rate also increased.22 Similarly, the debt
                        profile showed some deterioration in average time to maturity as well as reserve
                        adequacy in relation to share of foreign currency commercial debt component in the
                        recent years (Figure 10, 11 and 12).
Deterioration of        Growing external and fiscal vulnerabilities led to a credit rating downgrade by Fitch
public debt profile     Ratings and a negative outlook by S&P and Moody’s. Fitch Ratings downgraded Sri
adversely affected      Lanka’s long-term credit rating by one notch to B+ from BB- with a negative outlook
credit rating.          in February 2016. The key drivers of the downgrade were the increasing refinancing
                        risks, significant debt maturities, weaker public finances, a decline in foreign exchange
                        reserves and a high foreign-currency debt portion in the portfolio. At the same time,
                        favorable economic growth, human development indicators, a clean debt service
                        record and a smooth transition of power are identified as positive factors.23 S&P and
                        Moody’s kept Sri Lanka’s long-term sovereign credit rating at B+ and B1, respectively,
                        but changed the outlook to negative from stable for similar reasons in March and
                        June 2016, respectively. These rating actions can heighten the refinancing and interest
                        rate risks mentioned above. The trading spread for the country’s bond sovereign
                        bonds edged up in the recent months (Figure 14).

                        billion or one third of these liabilities represent swap arrangements with domestic

 The monetary policy was tightened belatedly to curb rapid credit growth and rising core inflation.

Rapid credit growth     In an accommodative monetary environment, private credit35 grew rapidly in 2015
exerted pressure on     while credit to government also soared due to a high deficit and the emphasis on
interest rates.         domestic sources for deficit financing.36 Consequently, the market excess liquidity
                        started declining since late 2015 exerting pressure on interest rates. In fact, the month
                        end excess liquidity was in the negative terrain in March 2016 for the first time in
                        more than two years. The central bank rejected the bids received at a few bill and
                        bond auctions, an indication of interest rates rising above its desired level. Some
                        liquidity injections came in the form of new money from the central bank reducing
                        upward pressure on interest rates while pushing up its holding of treasury bills to a
                        historic high in April 2016.37 Reserve money growth reached a record high at 26.8

                      policy instruments were reserved until January 2015, which came in an increase in
                      Statutory Reserve ratio (SRR) by 150 basis points. This was followed by two policy
                      rate hikes of 50 basis points each in February and July 2016, which is an important
                      step to contain core inflation and to become more attractive to non-resident bond
                      investors. Further measures may be needed if the rapid private credit growth
                      continues and core inflation rises while paying due consideration to long and variable
                      lags in monetary transmission (Figure 20).

                             sustain poverty reduction in the future. Growth in the agricultural sector during this
                             period largely reflected rising prices and an expansion in arable land, neither of which

                           into more productive work. Roughly 30 percent of the workforce, and about half of
                           the working poor, toil in the agriculture sector. Many of the poor live in peri-urban
                           areas – over half of the poor are estimated to live within 30 km of a main
                           agglomeration area. Policies that help connect these workers to productive
                           employment opportunities off the farm can contribute to sustainable poverty

                           about the underlying causes of the rise in labor demand – did workers’ skills improve
                           or was technology used more effectively? How much do labor regulations constrain
                           further growth in wage employment? Bridging these knowledge gaps and
                           documenting how public policies affect the poor can inform much-needed efforts to

Box 2. Sri Lanka Poverty Assessment

     Poverty Assessments (PA) are a key instrument of the World Bank’s country engagement strategy. They are
     designed to assess the extent and causes of poverty in a given country and to propose a strategy to ameliorate its
     effects. They review levels of and changes over time and across regions in poverty indicators, assesses the
     impacts of growth and public actions on poverty and inequality, and reviews the adeq uacy of a country’s poverty
     monitoring and evaluation arrangements. PAs generally feed into country-owned processes to develop strategies
     to reduce poverty, help build in-country capacity, and support joint work and partnerships

A further slowdown     If growth continues to be slow, a further fiscal adjustment might be needed to contain

could affect public    efficiency of collection, pressure to increase current expenditure or the realization of
debt.                  contingent liabilities could derail the debt sustainability. Such an eventuality could lead
                       to loss of confidence reflected in reduced consumption and investment, and
                       decelerating growth. SOE debt both guaranteed and non-guaranteed could pose a risk
                       to the fiscal position.

Risks to the outlook   External shocks could come from a number of sources (see Box 3): a further

                       are from this region). While it appears that remittances from Middle Eastern countries
                       are relatively insensitive to global commodity price fluctuations, persistently low

                            implications on exports, FDI, remittances and tourism flows in the medium-term.
                            Geopolitical tensions in oil producing countries could also spill over to other parts of
                            the world through disruptions in production or transportation and reverse the
                            commodity windfall. Finally, a further tightening of global financial conditions could
                            worsen capital outflows as experienced in the past few months. As a result, the
                            currency pressures could persist in the short to medium term and the debt roll-over
                            could become expensive, especially once the Eurobonds are starting to mature from
                            2017. Besides increased refinancing risk, increases in global benchmark interest rates
                            would directly affect the interest cost with the country’s growing share of variable-
                            interest rate debt.

Box 3. Global outlook
  Global growth: continued weakness. Global growth this year is projected at 2.4 percent, unchanged from the
  disappointing pace of 2015, and 0.5 percentage point below January forecasts. Emerging market and developing
  economies (EMDEs) account for about half of this downward revision, in large part due to the significant downgrade
  to growth forecasts for commodity exporters, and amid heightened domestic uncertainties and a challenging external
  environment). Advanced economies are projected to expand by 1.7 percent this year, 0.5 percentage point slower than
  expected in January. Investment continues to be soft, and export prospects have worsened. Despite a boost from lower
  energy prices and improvements in labor markets, advanced-economy growth is expected to level off in 2016, rather
  than strengthen further as previously envisaged.
  EMDEs: divergences. Growth disappointments have extended into 2016. Aggregate growth for EMDEs is projected
  at 3.5 percent for 2016, just above the post-crisis low reached in 2015. However, the overall forecast masks a marked
  difference between commodity exporters and importers. After stagnating last year, growth in commodity exporting
  EMDEs for 2016 is expected to be 0.4 percent—substantially below the 1.6 percent forecast in January, reflecting a
  significant downward revision in commodity price forecasts, weak global trade, volatile capital flows, and persistent
  domestic challenges. In contrast, growth projections for commodity importing EMDEs are little changed at 5.8 percent
  for 2016, and are expected to be broadly stable at that level through 2018. Policy buffers continue to erode in
  commodity exporting EMDEs, especially in oil exporting countries, reducing their ability to withstand further
  downside shocks.
  LICs: commodity exporters struggling to adjust. Low-income country (LIC) growth slowed to 4.5 percent in 2015,
  the weakest pace since 2009. Although output is projected to pick up to 5.3 percent this year in this group, lower
  commodity prices and nagging security and political challenges have trimmed 0.9 of a percentage point from the
  previous forecast (Figure 1.D). While the difficult external environment confronting LICs will likely continue, growth
  is still expected to be supported by resilient investment growth and implementation of reforms.
  Risks: tilted further to the downside. A sharper-than-expected deceleration in major emerging market economies,
  rising policy and political uncertainties, geopolitical risks and eroding confidence in policy effectiveness could set back
  global growth and trigger financial market turbulence, with particularly significant consequences for EMDEs. Rising
  private sector indebtedness has become a significant source of vulnerability in some EMDEs. Historically, countries
  with rapidly rising debt in the years leading up to a period of financial stress have experienced a more protracted
  slowdown in its aftermath.
  Policy buffers: limited. Limited fiscal and monetary policy buffers in many countries is leaving the global economy
  less prepared to cope with these risks. The room for policy accommodation has increasingly diverged between
  commodity importers and exporters. Diminishing foreign reserves and fiscal buffers have already forced many
  commodity exporting EMDEs to tighten policy pro-cyclically. In commodity importing EMDEs, even though low

  commodity prices have reduced fiscal and external vulnerabilities and inflation, the scope for expansionary fiscal policy
  remains limited because of weak starting positions. In advanced economies, actual and expected inflation are below
  targets. Large-scale unconventional monetary policy accommodation in advanced economies has to some extent
  bolstered demand, but may over time have diminishing returns and raise financial stability risks. Expansionary fiscal
  policy could support activity in a number of advanced economies in the event of an adverse shock.
  Policy priority: focus on structural reforms. In an environment of weak growth, rising risks, and limited policy
  buffers, growth-sustaining structural policies are urgently needed. These measures would boost medium- and long-
  term growth, reduce vulnerabilities, and signal to investors that authorities are committed to reinforcing long-term
  prospects. If well targeted, they could also support short-term aggregate demand. Greater investment—in
  infrastructure, productivity enhancing technology, and human capital —could lay the foundation for stronger growth.
  Policies should aim to fill public infrastructure gaps, encourage foreign direct investment, strengthen human capital,
  foster diversification, and reduce trade barriers. However, countries with diminishing fiscal space may be limited in
  financing such investments. International cooperation efforts could include commitments to undertake expansionary
  fiscal policies if large downside risks materialize, to channel pooled global resources into infrastructure and human
  capital investment, and to strengthen global safety nets for the most fragile countries.

Box 4. Support to improve competitiveness, transparency and fiscal sustainability

     The World Bank is supporting the government in its efforts to modernize the economy. A Development Policy
     Financing (DPF) operation, for an amount of USD 100 million, was approved in July 2016 to provide budget
     financing and to support the following reforms (1) eliminate obstacles to private sector competitiveness, (2)
     enhance transparency and public sector management and (3) improve fiscal sustainability. Section D discusses
     the World Bank Group’s country strategy and ongoing support to Sri Lanka. This operation was closely
     coordinated with JICA, which provided an additional USD 100 million budget loan supporting the same policy
     reforms.

Box 5. Fiscal policy options in South Asia

      As the global economy slows down, and some of the tailwinds that had helped South Asia rebound start fading,
      the overall fiscal policy stance at the national level may warrant reconsideration.
      A recent World Bank publication looks at fiscal policy options to find a balanced path towards fiscal consolidation
      in the four largest South Asian economies: Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The quality of fiscal
      consolidation will affect these economies and societies in a number of ways: (1) the pace at which they address
      their expenditure and revenue will have a large impact on economic stability; (2) the extent to which expenditure
      supports capital accumulation will matter for economic growth; (3) taxes, subsidies and spending on basic services
      will affect equity; and (4) reducing implicit energy subsidies and introducing explicit carbon taxation will have
      implications for environmental sustainability. The report shows, the window with strong tailwinds may be closing
      and reforms will be more difficult to introduce later on.

issue to address.                           decade. Two earlier rounds of economic liberalization introduced a series of reforms
                                            towards deregulating the economy, accompanied by a strong focus on export
                                            orientation and FDI promotion. The last decade has seen a noticeable shift towards
                                            protectionism. The introduction of para-tariffs has effectively doubled the protection
                                            rates, making the present import regime one of the most complex and protectionist
                                            in the world. Moreover the para-tariffs’ dispersion leads to prices that distort
                                            production and consumption patterns. Higher rates of protection on final products
                                            than on inputs used in their production lead to an anti-export bias, since producers
                                            have strong incentive to sell goods domestically even though their domestic costs are
                                            higher than their opportunity costs through trade. This is particularly worrying for the
                                            agricultural sector, where high protection of import competing crops along with
                                            fertilizer subsidies have created strong disincentives for crop and export
                                            diversification. Incentives are structured to expand production of import-competing
                                            crops (rice, maize) and discourage the production of exportables through the
                                            introduction of high export taxes (‘cesses’) on raw materials such as tea, rubber,
                                            cinnamon, coconut and spices, with the notion that this would increase value addition
                                            of exports. Revenues from cesses were supposed to be then invested in research and
                                            development for the corresponding sectors to encourage value addition, yet this has
                                            not been implemented.

                         precarious conditions. Wages of temporary workers are on average 33 percent lower
                         than wages of permanent workers; one-third of which cannot be explained by

                          g. Conclusions and priorities

Sri Lanka’s drivers of Solid economic growth, strong poverty reduction, overcoming internal conflict,
past progress are not effecting a remarkable democratic transition in recent months, and overall strong
sustainable.           human development outcomes are a track record that would make any country proud.
                       However, the country’s inward looking growth model based on non-tradable sectors
                       and domestic demand amplified by public investment cannot be expected to lead to
                       sustained inclusive growth going forward.

The SCD points to         The fiscal challenge is due above all to poor revenue collection, compounded by
fiscal,                   inefficiencies in public expenditures that result in rigidity and underinvestment in
competitiveness, and      human capital. The competitiveness challenge is a mix of several areas where Sri

Box 6. The Systematic Country Diagnostic: A New World Bank Group Tool for Country Engagement.
     Under its new approach to working with its country partners, the World Bank Group (WBG) requires the
     preparation of a Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) to precede the development of Country Partnership
     Frameworks (CPF) that guides programming. The objective of an SCD is to identify the most critical constraints
     and opportunities facing a country in accelerating progress toward the goals of ending extreme poverty and
     promoting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. The SCD is expected to produce an objective, evidence-
     based, candid assessment of the main challenges facing the country, without limitation to the areas where the
     WBG is currently engaged.

The SCD anchors         The Country Partnership Framework (2017- 2020) for the World Bank Group is
the new CPF.            anchored in the analysis of the SCD and consists of three major pillars. Interventions
                        under pillar one will seek to improve macroeconomic stability and competitiveness,
                        pillar two will tackle the promotion of inclusion and opportunities, while pillar three
                        will seek to enhance resilience and management of natural assets. The IFC will give
                        priority to sustainable infrastructure (through PPP’s), financial inclusion, and access
                        to input/output markets, products, services and jobs. MIGA will where possible
                        support foreign investment projects, across sectors.
