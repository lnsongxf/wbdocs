Executive Summary
The Government of Benin has requested an update of the 2005 Diagnostic Trade Integration Study1
and has asked the World Bank to take the leading role in this exercise. The update’s objectives are to
(a) take stock of progress in the mainstreaming of trade in the government’s national development
strategy and of implementation of the Action Matrix recommendations; (b) complement and deepen
the analysis in selected areas; and (c) revise and update the Action Matrix to take account of the
evolving context since 2006. The aim of the analysis is to assist the Government of Benin in defining
an overall competitiveness strategy for inclusive, job-creating export-led growth in accordance with
the key priorities identified in the 2013 Plan Stratégique de Développement du Commerce (PSDC),
and to further mainstream trade into the general policy orientation defined by Benin’s key policy
documents, including the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (GPRSP) update.

The DTIS Update (DTISU) offers a diagnosis, analytical framework and action plan, giving
trade expansion a key role in the reduction of poverty and vulnerability. As mandated by the
Paris Principles, the DTISU’s approach is strongly aligned with the MICPME’s Plan Stratégique de
Développement du Commerce (Trade Development Strategy Plan, henceforth TDSP) and draws also
from the diagnosis in the Government of Benin’s recent poverty assessment (INSAE 2014) as well
as the 2011 update of the GPRSP. It emphasizes the linkages between poverty, jobs, and trade with
two key objectives: (i) reducing poverty through trade-led growth, and (ii) reducing vulnerability.

The DTISU’s approach is also built around the role of the MICPME, focal point of the EIF
process in Benin. Because the DTISU’s Action Matrix spans areas that go beyond the strict
responsibilities of a trade ministry, the MICPME is viewed as having a twin role in the process: (i)
Action on a core set of measures falling directly under its responsibility; and (ii) Advocacy and
Proposal (A&P) for a wider set of actions falling under the responsibility of other line ministries or
belonging to higher-level strategic choices.
Three key messages emerge from the DTIS’ analysis of the challenges and opportunities facing
Benin’s trade integration:

    i.   Benin’s economy is largely dependent on rents derived from Nigeria’s trade policy.
         These rents are vulnerable. These informal flows amount to a total, according to our
         estimation, $5bn. A large part of Benin’s economy is involved in the re-export of imported
         products to Nigeria using parallel channels; similarly, 85% of Benin’s gasoline supply is
         imported informally from Nigeria by traders, taking advantage of Nigeria’s fuel subsidies. By
         some educated estimates, informal trade contributes up to 20% of GDP (Golub 2012). By all
         accounts these rents benefit many sides of the economy: government fiscal revenues through
         the taxation of informal transit, informal traders, and consumers of Nigerian subsidized
         gasoline. However, they are vulnerable to changes in Nigeria’s trade policy (see Benin 2013a)
         and to price convergence between ECOWAS member States, which will be accelerated by the
         implementation of the Common External Tariff. Moreover, while lucrative, the rents
         actually hamper the modernization of Benin’s economy. The informality of this parallel
         trade spills over to associated services such as transport and other associated services, leaving

        large parts of the national economy out of the reach of taxes and regulation and fueling a
        vicious circle of informality, distortions, and poverty.
  ii.   Benin is not “locked” in an informality trap: with appropriate reforms, the country can
        develop new ways to leverage its strong locational advantage. Benin is strategically
        located, as the crossing point of two regional corridors with substantial growth potential,
        Abidjan-Lagos and Cotonou-Niamey, with near-direct access to the large neighboring
        Nigerian market. Combined with appropriate reforms and investments, this locational asset
        can be a source of sustainable competitive advantage for formal trade-related activities,
        including logistics and a wide array of transport- and trade-related services. The development
        of a formal, modern trade services sector would bring a double dividend to Benin’s economy,
        providing a source of employment and growth on its own and securing a source of competitive
        advantage for future transformational activities including export-oriented light
        manufacturing. While the development of transformative activities will not happen overnight,
        Benin can kick-start the process around two entry points: (i) collaboration with reputable
        logistics operators to modernize the Cotonou-Lagos Corridor using information technologies
        that could lead to organizational reforms, paving the way for inter-modal, containerized
        logistics with support services meeting international standards; (ii) reform of the export
        processing zone (EPZ) emphasizing a rationalized and stable business environment with
        associated government services rather than costly fiscal incentives.
 iii.   Urgent reform is needed in Benin’s agricultural sector and should include the objective
        of diversification into new export crops. Reducing poverty in Benin will depend on the
        modernization of its agriculture sector, which represents 82.4% of employment and where
        38.9% of employed individuals still live in poverty (INSAE 2014). Lack of support, poor
        governance, and dysfunctional institutional arrangements in recent years have pushed the
        cotton sector to the verge of collapse. While various factors have contributed to the crisis,
        comparison with neighboring countries shows that it is largely home-grown. By contrast, the
        rapid rise of pineapple and cashew production demonstrates that successful diversification
        into non-traditional export products is possible. However, this growth has not been
        accompanied with the necessary support from government. The time has come for a change
        in the approach towards agriculture, with erratic regulatory changes giving way to a coherent
        modernization strategy based on workable institutional arrangements in the cotton sector, as
        well as a long-term vision for both traditional and non-traditional crops, the development of
        public services for non-traditional crops, and the re-establishment of trust and mutual respect
        between stakeholders.

A fully aligned DTISU complementing the national trade strategy
Benin faces a formidable employment challenge. With population growth standing at over 3%, the
national economy needs to create over 100,000 additional jobs every year in order to absorb new
labor force entrants. However, in spite of Benin’s prudent macroeconomic management, growth has
so far proved barely sufficient to keep pace with the expanding labor force and has not generated any
surplus through productivity growth to translate into higher incomes at the individual level. As a
result, poverty, , using the international poverty line at $1.25/day, still affects one in two Beninese
and has failed to recede significantly. The poor in Benin are also vulnerable, with agricultural
production strongly affected by weather events and a million people exposed to food insecurity.

                                                  xii
The DTISU emphasizes two key policy priorities:
1. Diversification building on the development of competitive logistics services and a conducive
   business environment,
2. Agricultural reform aimed at the provision of a stable institutional environment, the elimination
   of cross-cutting constraints (including deficient SPS infrastructure and logistics), and the
   promotion of non-traditional crops.
The development of formal activities to substitute for parallel trade would reduce one of the
root causes of the prevalence of informality in Benin’s economy. In so doing, these activities
would create the right incentives and conditions for the progressive formalization of the economy,
one of the TDSP’s core strategic axes, and would create the conditions for a progressive enlargement
of the tax base, which would itself contribute to the fulfillment of WAEMU’s convergence criteria.
Thus, the DTISU proposes a limited set of priorities but with powerful synergies, represented
graphically in Figure 1.
While reaching beyond the traditional areas of responsibility of a trade ministry, agricultural reform
is intimately linked to to the trade strategy because the performance of Benin’s agricultural sector
(and in particular of the cotton sector) largely conditions prospects for poverty reduction, economic
transformation, and trade performance. Figure 1 shows the links between the DTISU core priorities
and Benin’s broader development objectives. In this framework, there are areas of action for the
MICPME, but also areas where the MICPME can be an advocate for broader changes in the economy.

Based on this framework, the DTISU develops four axes for short-term action that provide the thread
of the action matrix:
1. Reinforce the export-promotion/SPS management nexus: Diversification into nontraditional
   products and transformation requires a joint effort of export promotion and improved quality
   management, as the two are strongly correlated; this will require coordination between the
   MICPME and SPS management agencies (recommendations A2, A3, D2, D4 to D6);

                                                    xiii
2. Pursue customs reform: Customs’ role as “doorkeeper” of Benin’s trade platform must be
   enhanced through better and more extensive use of ICT, as well as complementary and modern
   organizational reforms (for example, the use of performance contracts) aimed at improving
   client orientation, transparency, and accountability at all levels (recommendations B4-B9);
3. Pursue logistics/facilitation modernization, develop trade-related service activities around
   it, and make it a springboard for diversification: The elimination of informal trade may be
   difficult to achieve through the control/repression approach envisaged in the TDSP, as it
   imperfectly addresses the incentives (created by price differences with Nigeria). A more novel
   approach could be to establish a well-circumscribed area that offers a more collaborative
   approach between public and private sector, using the two entry points discussed above (EPZ
   and logistics). The EPZ should be re-energized through the provision of infrastructure at
   competitive price/quality levels, facilitated by efficient government services, in order to attract
   productive investments close to the border with Nigeria. The logistics sector associated with the
   Port of Cotonou should be used to focus government attention on a well-circumscribed but
   potentially transformative agenda that focuses on developing logistics around modern
   containerized traffic and using the future rail infrastructure, in partnership with a reputable
   international operator. A “clean channel” such as this could have a demonstration effect,
   providing a model to be extended step-by-step to other areas of the domestic economy and
   steadily bringing progressively in the mainstream smaller-scale players. The positive incentives
   created by this approach would entail cost advantages in having access to efficient and reliable
   services, as well as guarantees and predictability offered by a better business environment and
   government assistance (recommendations A1, A3, A4, B1-B3, C2-C4);
4. Seek improved relations with Nigeria: Once Benin has regained control of its trade flows
   through the establishment of clean channels and credible customs reforms, the Government
   could seek improved relations with Nigeria2 through the progressive elimination of rents based
   on tax evasion that are costly to the Nigerian treasury (currently estimated at $1 billion a year).
   This would allow both sides to develop collaborative modes of border management,
   consolidating Cotonou as one of the entry points to Western Nigeria’s markets
   (recommendations A2, A5, B1, B5-B6).
These four axes are closely aligned with the TDSP, as illustrated in Figure 2. The left-hand side
of the figure provides a visual representation of the TDSP’s structure , with “specific objectives” in
the left-most column, strategies in the second one, and a selection of key actions among the matrix’
proposed actions in the third one. On the right-hand side of the figure, the boxes summarize the
DTISU’s four key axes discussed above and red arrows show how they relate to the TDSP’s selected
actions.
In sum, the DTISU proposes a practical action plan organized around key axes in close alignment
with the TDSP’s action matrix. Each of these axes is in itself an ambitious, complex project which
will bear fruit only in the medium term. In this sense, there are no easy reforms in the implementation
of the TDSP/DTISU strategy. However, implementation should start on the ground, step-by-step,
following the detailed Action Matrix offered in the DTISU as a complement to the TDSP ’s own
Action Matrix. The existence of a costed action matrix in the TDSP can be expected to facilitate
implementation and should prove a useful starting point in the dialogue with donors.

We now turn to a more detailed summary of the DTISU’s main sectoral recommendations in trade
policy, trade facilitation, services, and agriculture.
Trade performance
Benin suffers from a chronic trade deficit. If there is some signs that Benin’s currency is
overvalued, the root cause of Benin’s trade deficit, which amounts to about 15% of GDP according
to official Balance-of-Payments accounts. This is due most of all to a structural lack of
competitiveness, which, in turn, has several facets, some sectoral and others more cross-cutting.

At the sector level, low export growth largely reflects the decline of the cotton sector and slow
diversification into new agricultural crops. The output of cotton has been shrinking over the last
few years due to a combination of factors, some institutional and some weather-related. The drop in
production tonnage has been partly compensated by the positive orientation of international prices in
recent years, mitigating its impact on the trade balance. On average, cotton represented about one
fifth of Benin’s exports in 2010-2012, so the 50% drop cotton tonnage between 2006 and 2011 would
have cut exports by 10% had it not been for the rise in prices..

Non-traditional exports such as cashews and pineapple have only partly offset the negative
effect of the cotton crisis. The main bright spot for Beninese trade is cashew exports, which have
grown by 40% in dollar terms over the last three years and now represent about as much as cotton in



                                                                  xv
Benin’s export portfolio (17% for cashew against 18% for cotton on average during 2010-2012).3
However, the commercialization of cashew is in the hands of foreign intermediaries and practically
no local transformation takes place, depriving Benin of most of the gains from trade. Pineapple
exports have failed to take off, despite their potential. This weakness is due to a combination of poor
SPS management, lack of market information and export promotion, and severely inadequate
logistics. In spite of the cotton sector’s decline and the progressive rise of non-traditional crops,
Benin’s exports remain fairly concentrated even compared to other low-income countries.

Cross-cutting constraints on export growth are highlighted by various governance indicators,
which show little progress since the 2005 DTIS. For instance, the Global Competitiveness Index
2013, constructed from large-sample surveys of traders, still identifies corruption as the main obstacle
to business, together with typical stumbling blocks such as poor access to financing and an inadequate
supply of infrastructure. Practically every dimension of the business environment is in need of reform
and modernization, including land titles, the establishment of a tribunal of Commerce, regulation, the
prevalence of informality (and concomitant heavy tax burden on formal enterprises), customs, and
both hard and soft infrastructure.

While formal exports face formidable hurdles, parallel re-exports to Nigeria thrive, amounting
to more than US$5 billion according to our calculations. These reexports are motivated by large
differences between Nigerian and international prices. These differences are the result of Nigeria’s
high tariffs and import prohibitions on some products that are considered strategic. On the other hand,
a large part of Benin’s fuel supply is imported through parallel channels by traders taking advantage
of Nigeria’s fuel subsidies. In total, informal trade makes up a substantial share of Benin’s GDP (20%
according to Golub 2012). These arbitrage opportunities, however, can vanish suddenly. For example,
several episodes of abrupt trade-policy changes in Nigeria, in the mid-1980s and mid-2000s, have
exposed Benin’s vulnerability to such changes. More importantly, with the progressive emergence of
an ECOWAS customs union, and more immediately with the impending alignment of Benin and
Nigeria’s tariff policies under the newly agreed ECOWAS Common External Tariff, the progressive
disappearance of large price differences between member States appears increasingly likely. Price
convergence, therefore, will gradually erode the rents from parallel trade.

Arbitrage rents, while lucrative, also hamper the modernization of Benin’s economy. The
informality of parallel trade spills over to ancillary services such as transport and other support
services, placing entire segments of the national economy largely (although not entirely) beyond the
reach of taxes and regulation. This deprives the State of much-needed tax revenue and hinders its
capacity to invest in infrastructure, education and public services, contributing to a vicious cycle of
poverty and informality. Rents generated by the private sector are also not likely to be reinvested in
the economy because of their informal nature. Until incentives shift decisively in favor of formal
activities, Benin’s economy will have difficulty modernizing.
Aside from parallel re-export to Nigeria, regional trade continues to perform far below its
potential. Formal trade is hampered by a myriad of non-tariff barriers including roadblocks, the non-
recognition of certificates of origin, protracted negotiations with customs officers at land borders, and
a general lack of information about and interest in ECOWAS’s Trade Liberalization Scheme (ETLS).
As a result, even without counting large-scale re-exports to Nigeria, according to a recent ECENE
survey of informal trade, over $800 million worth of goods cross Benin’s borders informally every

    Unless otherwise noted, trade statistics use mirror statistics.

year,4 mostly carried by small-scale traders (INSAE 2011), while half of formal regional trade takes
place on an MFN basis, which means it does not benefit from the tariff reductions available on paper.
For example, during the food crisis, substantial price differentials for food staples between production
and consumption areas within the region led to hardship and food insecurity in shortage areas.
Trade-policy issues
Benin is facing a significant change to its external-tariff from the WAEMU CET to the
ECOWAS CET as ECOWAS transitions to a free exchange agreement and a customs union .
The new ECOWAS CET includes a fifth band with a 35% rate for certain consumer goods,
substantially higher than the WAEMU CET’s highest band of 20%. The effect on average protection
is small when calculating the simple tariff average, as relatively few products are affected by the tariff
changes. However, using a trade-weighted average of Benin’s current import patterns, the effect is
no longer trivial — raising the weighted average tariff from 15.9% to 18.1% and affecting in
particular those products that matter the most in Benin’s household expenditure patterns, such as
animal products (including poultry), edible oils, and textiles and clothing.
The transition to the ECOWAS CET is forecast to raise tariff revenue by about 10% according
to the World Bank’s TRIST model. Imports will go down as a result of the tariff increase, but not
sufficiently to offset the increase in the tariff rate that will affect important consumption products for
households because of the low elasticity of Benin’s import demand. However, an examination of
Benin’s customs data shows that, as half of Benin’s imports from the region continue to enter on a
non-preferential basis because of poor implementation of rules of origin, the CET’s rise, instead of
favoring regional trade (a phenomenon known as trade diversion), will actually hamper it. Thus, the
rise in tariff revenue reflects that the transition to the ECOWAS CET is unlikely to result in any boost
to intra-regional trade flows, unless rules of origin issues in the ETLS framework are resolved (see
below).
The transition to the CET will also have a bias against the poor. An analysis of Benin’s household
expenditure patterns shows that products in the fifth band will have a disproportionate effect on the
income of households in the bottom 20% of the income distribution, raising the cost of living for
those households by 10-12% (against only 8% for the richest households). Measured in terms of effect
on household welfare, the CET is even more regressive, with a negative effect on poorer households
almost three times stronger than on the richest households.
A recommended approach to mitigate these regressive effects would be to reduce the impact of
other factors on prices, such as the cost of transport (in particular in rural areas where the
incidence of poverty is highest). In accordance with Objective 1 of the Trade Development Strategic
Plan, the Government should also encourage strong competition in distribution services so as to
minimize the passing on of higher tariffs to prices paid by consumer. Finally, the Government should
work with its ECOWAS partners to promote the effective use of the ETLS so that regional food
products circulate freely in the zone and are not affected by the CET (recommendation A1-A3, A5).
Benin’s tariff transition will also be affected by the implementation of the Economic
Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the European Union (EU), which will eliminate tariffs on
75% of the region’s imports from the EU over a twenty-year period. When the tariff phase-out
is complete, the increase in tariff revenue triggered by the creation of the CET’s fifth band will be




                                                  xvii
entirely offset. The Government of Benin should take the progressive transition to the EPA as a
prompt to rebalance its tariff structure away from trade taxes and towards a more broad-based taxation
regime, in parallel with efforts to bring the large informal sector into the mainstream.
Making trade facilitation a basis of the country’s comparative advantage
Improving trade facilitation is at the heart of the government’s strategy to position Benin as a
regional logistics hub. The interface between State administrations and the private sector, which
includes trade facilitation and needs improvement, as recognized in recent documents such as (inter
alia): the Growth Strategy for Poverty Reduction 2011-2015, the Strategic Development Orientations
2006-2011, and the 2013 TDSP. The modernization of customs and clearance procedures at the Port
of Cotonou has a key role to play if Benin is to develop as an entry point for neighboring markets, as
an estimated 80% of goods entering the port of Cotonou are destined for final delivery outside of
Benin, primarily to Nigeria and, to a lesser extent, Niger and Burkina Faso. However, the region
already has many medium-sized ports, and Nigeria is planning two greenfield port developments.
The race for the region’s logistics-hub position is likely to be result in a winner-take-all scenario.
With other countries investing in technology and procedural improvement such as single windows,
AEO, or geo-tracking of transit cargo in order to stay in the race, Benin can afford no delay in
modernizing.
Benin has made substantial progress in improving its logistics environment. Cotonou’s harbor
has been enlarged with a new container terminal, a two-berth wharf and a sand-stopping jetty that
reduces port dredging costs by over US$2 million a year. Five gates, 2.5km of road and 1.5km of
railway track have been added and the use of ICT has been enhanced. The coastal Abidjan-Lagos
highway has been improved on its Beninese segment. Finally, an MOU on the rehabilitation of the
railway line between Benin and Niger was signed in November 2013 in partnership with the Bolloré
group (recommendation B3).
Benin should build on these achievements to further reduce costs and improve the quality of
logistics infrastructure and services along the main two corridors (East-West and North-
South). There is strong competition in the sub-region for containerized traffic, which already weighs
on fee-setting. While this competition is good for trade, it may have implications for the financial
viability of infrastructure investments. Moreover, an examination of planned investments in the sub-
region suggests a serious risk of overcapacity if all projects go ahead, as most concessions are in the
hands of only two private operators, some promises are likely to remain unfulfilled. In order to be
among the winners of this competition, Benin needs to persevere with accompanying “soft”
investments in customs and regulatory modernization (recommendations A4, B2-B4, B6-B9).
Benin should engage its modernization effort by the creation of “clean channels”. The national
economy’s progressive transition into formality will be a complex and politically-challenging
process. There are two entry points into a clean-channel logic. The first one is the export-processing
zone, which should be re-energized through the provision of infrastructure at competitive levels of
price and quality. The second one is the logistics sector. The authorities should focus on containerized
traffic (where regional competition is most intense), putting in place formal ICT-based procedures
and effective dialogue and cooperation with a reputable private-sector operator. Trans-shipment of
transit traffic from the port to the planned railway is an activity that could be credibly monitored and
managed and should be accompanied by fair and transparent administration of customs transit
regimes, including the imposition of border taxes at official rates and fair values. If successful, the


                                                 xviii
“clean-channel” model could then be progressively extended to and replicated in other sectors of the
economy (recommendations A4, B1, B5-B6).
Benin needs to improve the regulation of its trucking industry. The industry is currently largely
informal and characterized by a plethora of small, substandard players. Reforms under way in Côte
d’Ivoire and Burkina Faso under the World Bank-supported regional program to develop a transit
corridor (DPO) provide useful blueprints. The ongoing trucking survey will provide useful
information on where to start the reform (recommendation B2).
In the last decade, Benin has made great strides toward better functioning customs. Between
2007 and 2014, Benin’s Logistics Performance Index (LPI) rose from 1.8 to 2.6, putting it ahead of
most countries in the region, and container dwell times have been cut from 28 days in early 2012 to
around 12 days at the end of 2013. A new Customs code was approved by Parliament in June 2014,
clearance procedures have been improved by the use of Asycuda++, a basic risk-control analysis
function has been introduced, and customs computer networks have been centralized on a single
server. A single window is also being deployed at the Port of Cotonou. All these measures have been
supported by donors and go in the right direction.
However, Customs improvements at the Seme-Krake border are progressing slowly. The project
of a single-stop border post has been stalled by a dispute with the contractor in 2012 and there has
been little progress since. Border crossing remains a complex process as merchandise is trans-shipped
from Beninese to Nigerian trucks at the border, usually by consolidation of about two Beninese trucks
on a single Nigerian one to take advantage of Nigeria’s lump-sum (per truck) formula for the
calculation of import duties. Alleged harassment of Beninese drivers suspected of smuggling, by
Nigerian authorities discourages border crossing by Beninese trucks. Moreover, disputes between
Benin and Nigeria lead to frequent and unpredictable closure of the border for Beninese trucks, which
occurred in September 2013 (recommendation B1).
Further modernization of Benin’s customs will require more and better use of technology.
Private sector perceptions reported by the Global Competitiveness Index of the World Economic
Forum suggest that after improving between 2007 and 2010, customs effectiveness has deteriorated
again, partly because of Benin Contrôle’s misguided procedures until 2012. Benin has also slipped
in LPI rankings since 2007, reflecting faster progress in neighboring countries. Escort systems at
Benin’s borders (which deal with documentation, not the trucks themselves) create queuing and
delays, as documents are physically forwarded in batches from one customs administration to the
other. This should be phased out and replaced by ICT connections between customs administrations
on both sides of the border. ASYCUDA could also be better used by recording not just activities but
also outcomes, allowing for an assessment of customs’ performance. ASYCUDA’s risk-management
module, furthermore, may be simple, but it can play a useful role if used systematically and can be a
tool to familiarize customs personnel with risk management before upgrading towards more
sophisticated systems later on. Migration to ASYCUDA World will also be a useful step
(recommendations B3, B7-B9).
Technology is not enough: high-level political support for reform is also needed. In spite of
progress, border management in Benin still offers poor support to the private sector. Contractual
arrangements with inspection companies should be stable and designed to properly balance the need
for effective surveillance against that of trade facilitation, so as to foster the perception of a stable
and predictable policy environment among private sector operators. This should be reflected in
transparent licensing/procurement processes, associated with a clear performance contract and the

                                                  xix
transfer of knowledge (on customs valuation) to the customs administration. The reported practice by
politically-connected traders of negotiating customs valuations in order to adjust the amount of border
taxes effectively paid should be eliminated; this would require a clear stand at the top. The
Government of Benin needs to make the collection of border taxes equitable and rules-based, rather
than negotiable for some and predatory for others.
Laying down the prerequisites for a competitive services economy
Benin’s services sector is a story of missed opportunities. Although the production of services
already contributes more than 50% of value-added in Benin, it has strong untapped potential. With a
privileged geographical location as a transit platform for two landlocked countries (Burkina Faso and
Niger) right next to the largest market in Africa (Nigeria), Benin has the potential to become an
important services exporter in the region. However, empirical evidence shows that Benin has been
underperforming, with services imports growing much faster than exports and an overall poor
contribution of services trade to the GDP. The current supply of services is considered by most
economic actors as an obstacle to business and trade, hampering the country’s competitiveness, and
the objective of universal (or wide) access to basic services is not met.
Four major governance issues will need to be addressed to unleash services trade in Benin :
1.   Transparency
2.   Legal security
3.   The role of the state
4.   The vicious circle of informality
The key constraint to the expansion of Benin’s service sector is not trade protection per se. While
some obstacles to trade remain (e.g. some monopolistic rights in key sectors like telecoms), the main
issue is not one of discrimination or lack of openness. The binding constraints are, in fact, in the areas
of infrastructure, size of market and governance, as well as the lack of an adequate regulatory
framework in the services sectors that would otherwise allow trade to bring all its expected benefits
to the country (recommendation C2 and C4).
In order to lift existing constraints, the Government of Benin should put in place a services
trade development strategy resting on three pillars (recommendation C1):
1. Improving the regulatory framework of services in Benin, including in the context of further
   multilateral and regional trade integration
2. Addressing the key governance issues that impair the development of an efficient and
   internationally competitive services sector;
3. Engaging reforms in priority services sectors where Benin has an export potential, including in
   particular transports, telecoms and tourism
Services trade integration, in particular at the regional level, has a role to play in addressing
those constraints. While trade-opening alone will not be enough to put Benin’s service sector on a
better growth trajectory, trade integration and its “capacity-enhancing” components, whether soft
(regulatory harmonization and/or cooperation) or hard (infrastructure), can play a significant role in
improving the country’s performance, in particular at the regional level.
At the subsector level, the government of Benin needs to implement (i) an up-to date tourism
development plan and (ii) a practical action plan to implement ICT-sector reforms
(recommendation C4). The tourism development plan should include transparent procurement

                                                   xx
procedures, clear mechanisms for the allocation of land for economic development, a clear and
credible legal framework, with dispute-settlement mechanisms, to protect both investors and local
populations, and a strong emphasis on sustainability and the preservation of natural sites and the
environment (recommendation C3).
Putting Benin’s agriculture back on its feet
Agriculture is and will remain the backbone of Benin’s economy in the medium term. Cotton is
the primary source of income for over 300,000 smallholders and, indirectly, for over three million
Beninese through its linkages to associated services and transformation activities. It is also an
inclusive source of income and a useful counterforce to the agglomeration forces that characterize
the modern sector, with activity spread over a large part of the country, in particular those with the
highest incidence of poverty.
However, Benin’s cotton sector is undergoing a severe and protracted crisis . After rising
spectacularly from 20,000 tons in 1980 to 350,000 tons in 1995 and 428,000 tons in 2004, cottonseed
production collapsed to 140,000 tons in 2010. Indeed, from West Africa’s premier cotton producer,
Benin is now out-performed by Mali and Burkina Faso. Moreover, it could not benefit from the 2010-
11 world price hike, as national production was then at its lowest.
The crisis of Benin’s cotton sector is home-grown, as world prices remained high at 90 cents a
pound until mid-2014. Structurally, the sector has failed to drive/achieve a transition from the
extensive-margin growth that characterized the expansion phase (surfaces under cultivation were
multiplied by ten between 1980 and 1995) to intensive-margin growth based on higher yields per
hectare. In turn, the lack of structural transformation and technical change is largely due to the
Government’s failure to put in place a good governance model.
The governance of Benin’s cotton sector has been dysfunctional for many years . In the 1990s,
the sector’s reform followed a “Beninese model” that split activities, starting with the privatization
of the input sub-sector in 1993, followed by processing in 1995. This structure led to widespread
inefficiencies, the establishment of dominant positions, in particular by the Talon group, overcapacity
(587,000 tons of capacity in 1998 for a production of 350,000 tons), and uneconomic investments in
processing facilities, with most plants located in the South, far from production. In the first half of
the 2000s, the institutional structure was reformed but new arrangements were no better. Input
imports were controlled and their allocation corrupt and incompetent; producers were paid late,
leading to the development of a parallel market and the Centrale de Sécurisation des Paiements et de
Recouvrement, the parastatal managing credit and producer payments, piled up deficits. Since then,
the sector’s governance has been characterized by ad-hoc government interventions driven by short-
term objectives and personal conflicts, and a near-complete absence of long-term vision.
Today, the crisis has reached boiling point. The State is heavily indebted to the cotton processing
sector, threatening the processors’ financial viability and that of the banks financing cotton
campaigns. Producers suffer from payment delays, forcing them to borrow and aggravating poverty.
New delays and the disorganization characterizing the early phases of 2013-14 harvest risk
jeopardizing the crop’s quality, leading to discounted prices on international markets.
Benin’s cotton sector must adopt a vertically-integrated structure — the only viable
arrangement in weak institutional environments. In an institutional environment with no credible
legal system to enforce contracts, moral hazard is prevalent and markets relying on forward
transactions and individual credit simply cannot function. Competitive input markets are

                                                 xxi
dysfunctional when counterfeit fertilizers and seeds circulate freely on the market and farmers have
no way of telling legitimate from counterfeit products at the time of purchase. Arrangements where
farmers get inputs on credit against a promise of exclusive selling are not time-consistent in the
presence of opportunistic cash buyers, especially in unpredictable environments where future
promises to pay are heavily discounted relative to hard cash. In such environments, a vertically-
integrated single-buyer structure, though second best in general because of the monopsony distortions
it generates, is the only incentive-compatible system.
The best option for Benin may well be to combine vertical integration with zoning, as occurs in
Burkina Faso. While zoning does not overcome monopsony distortions, it makes it possible to
benchmark the performance of vertically-integrated operators at the regional level against one
another. However, zoning requires the policing of contractual arrangements around zone “frontiers”
and the respect of zone monopolies. The first step in getting towards a workable institutional setup
for the cotton sector is to clarify property rights over SODECO and the legal uncertainty created by
the currently inextricable political situation (recommendation D1).
Benin’s agriculture also has substantial diversification potential outside of the cotton sector.
Cashew production is expanding very rapidly in Benin as in other West African countries. Although
numbers are uncertain, output is estimated at around 150,000 tons and the FAO ranks Benin as West
Africa’s 4th largest exporter. Benin’s cashew is among the best, ranking high in quality above Ghana
or Côte d’Ivoire. Cashew nuts are exported raw to Vietnam and India, with only small amounts
processed locally.
Benin’s cashew production suffers from a lack of support. Constraints to growth include reliance
on low-performance varieties, poor agricultural practices, a lack of adequate financing, and the high
price of capital equipment and conditioning (jute bags). The export value chain is informal and
dominated by a myriad of semi-professional individual collectors selling to Indian traders. As a result
of this informality, prices are volatile and practically no gains from the trade are appropriated by local
agents, with all the bargaining power concentrated in the hands of foreign traders who possess and
control all the information about market conditions.
Local transformation also faces formidable hurdles and its viability is uncertain . Cashew
processing remains embryonic, with just five plants in the entire country (four of which were set up
in 2011) processing in total about 5% of domestic output. The transformation sector suffers from its
small scale compared to Asia’s large processing plants, as well as all the familiar constraints that
weigh on industrial activity in Benin: lack of infrastructure (in particular transportation), lack of
reliable energy and water sources, high cost of capital, lack of skilled labor, the relatively high cost
of African labor compared to Asia’s, and a lack of market information. Moreover, Asian processors
market the byproducts of their processing activities, which reduces unit costs, while Beninese cashew
processors do not.
Pineapple production is rising fast in spite of low productivity and logistical constraints. Low
productivity (22 tons/ha in smallholder farms against 70 tons in modern ones) stems largely from
poor use of inputs, as pineapple farms often use inadequate cotton fertilizers that are inadequate.
Farming practices are equally unsuitable. Manpower is also a problem, as most production takes place
in the Atlantic province, where the proximity of urban areas attracts laborers away from relatively
hard work on the farms. Being extremely time-sensitive, the pineapple value chain also suffers from
Benin’s inadequate transport logistics. The fruit is loaded in bulk in non-refrigerated trucks and
damaged by the shocks on rough roads. Transportation is slowed down by dozens of roadblocks along

                                                  xxii
the way, each requiring lengthy bargaining. Air freight is irregular; when no cargo space is available,
the fruit is dumped on the local market at a quarter of its price. The regional market offers a small
additional outlet but here, again, transportation is extremely expensive. The Government of Benin
needs to improve outbound logistics for pineapple at all stages (recommendation D4).
Quality control needs to be improved. Quality checks are performed at the airport, once
transportation costs have been incurred, and are also limited to visual checks only. The Direction
Nationale des Produits Végétaux (DNPV), which issues export certificates, does not have the capacity
to detect pesticides residuals. Quality is also affected by the use of ethrel for fruit coloring. Benin’s
pineapple value chain, furthermore, is not equipped to deal with the management of such sensitive
additives.
Local transformation would have a chance if it were not hampered by the usual constraints on
industrial production. The cost disadvantage of Beninese pineapple juice relative to imported
products is estimated at 18% — nothing prohibitive, especially given that Beninese juice is produced
by direct squeezing rather than through concentration and is thus a higher-quality product. Smart
marketing and basic improvements in the currently poor production conditions (outdated capital,
irregular and expensive electricity supply, lack of financing, etc.) could eradicate this cost
disadvantage. Government authorities should put in place a strategy for the development of this
activity.
Finally, shea butter is, like the rest of the economy, in need of formalization. While strongly
supported by donors, production is still largely informal, relying on trees growing in the wild. Those
trees take 30-35 years to grow and are threatened by uncontrolled deforestation in the absence of
forestry management. Most of the laborers are female operating in very harsh conditions.
Transportation is disorganized, sometimes in recycled chemical containers that pollute the product.
Again, quality control is nonexistent and transactions are based on trust (recommendation D9).
Cross-cutting constraints to agricultural growth are well-known and largely caused by the
State’s failure to perform its basic functions. Metrology is inadequate and quality control is either
nonexistent or non-credible in the absence of certified laboratories. The Direction Nationale des
Produits Végétaux (DNPV) lacks resources and qualified personnel. The same is true of the Direction
de l’Alimentation et de la Nutrition Appliquée (DANA). Thus, informality in agriculture is not a
choice of the private sector: it is a penalizing consequence of the State’s incapacity to play the role it
would/ought to in any modern economy (recommendations D2 and D3).
The Government and donors must pursue policies that will reinforce professional organizations
in agriculture. Professional organizations have a role to play in the dissemination of information, in
the definition and enforcement of the “rules of the game” that well-functioning markets require, and
in overcoming key coordination problems in agriculture, such as the regulation of agricultural
campaigns (date and price-setting). Strong professional organizations are particularly important in
reducing the climate of distrust between various actors, as well as with the State (recommendation
D5, D6).
The Government of Benin needs to adopt an agricultural quality strategy in accordance with
ECOWAS’s ECOQUAL regional quality policy and ensure that it is effectively deployed on the
ground rather than remaining theoretical. This means investing resources in key agencies and
adopting realistic and non-predatory quality-control systems based on the separation of standard-
setting from verification functions.

Agricultural support services, upstream and downstream, must be reinforced. This includes
rural roads and tracks, technical training, basic infrastructure to encourage labor to remain in the
countryside (schools, health, transport), statistical information, and export promotion. In particular,
there is a strong demand from producers to be better informed about business opportunities in
Nigerian markets. ABePEC has a role to play in the production and dissemination of such market
information (recommendations D7-D8).

1.1 Introduction
Benin’s economy is highly dependent on neighboring Nigeria. Nigeria’s GDP is about 33 times that
of Benin, and at least 20% of Benin’s GDP is generated in entrepôt trade with its large neighbor.
Taxes on transit trade and re-exports are moderate (between 6% and 7% all included).
This dependence, however, is full of opportunities. Trade has always been a creator of wealth,
especially for countries which, for any number of reasons, have not established favorable conditions
for manufacturing. While dominated by large, well-organized networks of big traders, trade (legal or
parallel) also provides a living to small-scale operators, many of whom are women, and generates a
host of side activities.
 In spite of these potential benefits, Benin’s current situation remains nevertheless vulnerable.. The
profitability of entrepôt trade is based on price arbitrage which could evaporate if Nigeria abandoned
its highly distortionary trade policies. Even without major policy changes, the day-to-day operation
of import prohibitions is fraught with arbitrariness and uncertainty, with bans imposed and then
revoked regularly for no apparent reason.
Benin needs to put its relationship with Nigeria on a healthy, competitiveness-driven ground..
Transforming a rent economy into a competitive transit economy is a first-order priority for Benin to
ensure that it remains the region’s gateway for imported goods — whatever the policy environment
in Nigeria. This requires a concerted action plan, putting services competitiveness at the heart of the
government’s development strategy, and the abandonment of the short-term rent-grabbing tactics that
have plagued the country’s economy for years.

1.2 Background: A slow-growing, low-income economy
Benin is a small, low-income economy in West Africa. Relative to its ECOWAS partners, Benin’s
economy, with a GDP of US$7 billion and a GDP per capita of US$729 (US$1,654 at PPP), is small
and relatively low income. In size, it ranks # 7 out of 15, between Burkina Faso and Niger, and in
terms of income, it ranks # 6, between Senegal and Mali (Figure 3).

1.2.1 Macroeconomic management has remained prudent in a turbulent period
Benin has succeeded in maintaining prudent macroeconomic policies. Debt reduction under the
Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) and Multilateral Debt Reduction initiatives has enabled the
country to reduce its external debt to 18.4% of GDP in 2013 (IMF 2014) and to keep public debt
around 30% of GDP. A fiscal stabilization effort since 2010, together with the sale of a telecom
license in 2012 (1% of GDP), has allowed the country to keep on track with targets, with the primary
fiscal deficit of 3.5% of GDP in 2013 (IMF 2014).
Inflation has been contained in spite of a succession of external shocks. The first shock was the world
food price hike of 2008, which hit Benin very hard, as the country is an importer of foodstuffs. The
flood of 2010 delivered a second blow, crippling cotton production. Last but not least, in January
2012 Nigeria decided to reduce its fuel subsidies by half. While highly inefficient (fuel subsidies are
largely regressive, as fuel consumption rises with income), those subsidies were a boon to Benin,
which imports an estimated 85% of its fuel consumption from Nigeria through parallel circuits (IMF
2013). The subsidy cut was partially reversed a few weeks after being put in place, reflecting the
vagaries of the neighbor’s political economy. This triggered a 120% rise in fuel prices in Benin,
increasing inflation from about 3% to 7.4% by end-March, after which it receded. There were,
however, longer-term effects, with fuel prices 50% higher than before and transportation service
prices permanently higher.
 In addition, some effort is still needed to satisfy WAEMU’s convergence criteria. At 16.3% (IMF
2014), fiscal pressure is slightly below the 17% WAEMU convergence criterion (CC). At about
14.8%, the current-account deficit excluding grants is more of a concern. Current-account deficits
can reflect macroeconomic imbalances, rather than structural trade deficits; in the case of Benin, there
is evidence of some degree of real exchange overvaluation (Figure 5). But the real causal factor is a
structural lack of competitiveness, discussed below in general terms and in more detail in Chapter 2.
The ratio of internally-financed investments over fiscal revenue is within the WAEMU CC, as are
the variation of arrears (external and internal) and the debt/GDP ratio.

1.2.2 But structural competitiveness remains weak
Benin’s economy lacks competitiveness at both the macro and micro levels. At the macro level, IMF
staff analysis suggests that the real effective exchange rate (REER) was in 2012 overvalued by about
15% (Figure 5), resulting in a current-account (CA) deficit estimated at around 8.7% of GDP in the
latest IMF analysis (IMF 2013). The CA deficit was financed by a mixture of foreign direct
investment (FDI, 2% of GDP), short-term capital flows (1-1.5% of GDP), and other flows, including
project loans (IMF 2013).
                                                                           Benin’s lack of competitiveness is not just a

Given the limited skills available in the workforce, Benin’s labor costs are also not particularly
competitive. While unit labor costs are not available for most West African countries on a reliable
basis, the ILO has data on minimum wages, shown in Figure 7. Except for 2011 where the Nigerian
minimum wage stood, according to the ILO, at the equivalent of U.S. $115, Benin had the region’s
highest minimum wage.

Public services are also uncompetitive in Benin. Access to electric power, for instance, is substantially
lower than in Nigeria. Moreover, coverage is progressing slowly in Benin, while neighboring Ghana
races ahead (Figure 8).

Limited financial development in Benin translates into a relative lack of financial inclusiveness.
According to the World Bank’s Findex database, 90% of Benin’s adult population does not have
access to a bank account, although the figure is substantially less if one counts postal accounts and
micro-finance. Lack of access to bank accounts can hamper the ability of small-scale traders, active
in Benin’s cross-border trade with Nigeria, to access savings instruments. Even microcredit suffers
from governance problems in Benin, with only one third of microcredit schemes operating with a
license. The sector was affected by a crisis in 2010, which highlighted its inadequate governance and
lack of prudential supervision.
Weak financial inclusiveness and widespread informality are inter-related syndromes. Lack of access
to a bank account hampers formalization, but informality (and the lack of accounting transparency
that goes with it) also hampers access to bank credit. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the prevalence
of cash transactions is widely perceived by small-scale traders as not just tax avoidance, but protection
against the fiscal administration’s lack of predictability.

unchanged. Moreover, poverty seems to be linked to the high and accelerating rate of population
growth (2.8% per year between 1979 and 1992, 3.2% between 1992 and 2002, 3.5% since 2002), as
poverty correlates with household size (UNDP 2011).

Vulnerability remains significant, with about a fifth of all households temporarily dipping below the
poverty line each year and close to one Beninese out of seven suffering from food insecurity (UNDP
2011), two thirds of whom living in rural areas. Weather shocks have been a strong source of
vulnerability in rural areas, highlighting the exposure of Benin’s agriculture, where poverty seems,
according to government data, to have worsened substantially (INSAE 2014).
Against this background, the DTIS process (DTIS and DTIS Update) proposes a strategy of export-
led growth based on the strengthening of existing productive sectors and diversification into new

sources of job creation, based on a reform strategy aimed at leveraging the country’s comparative
advantage. We now turn to an assessment of the state of implementation of the original plan, its
integration into the country’s development strategy, and new leads to re-energize the process and
better align it with national priorities.

1.3 DTIS implementation: limited progress on an ambitious agenda

1.3.1 Mainstreaming trade in Benin’s development strategy
One of the key objectives of the 2005 DTIS was to mainstream trade in Benin’s national development
strategy. Given the small size of the domestic market and the particular role that Benin plays in the
region as a gateway for imports and a crossroads between two important regional corridors (Cotonou-
Niamey in the North-South dimension and Abidjan-Lagos in the East-West), it was clear to both the
Government of Benin and the donor community that the national development strategy had to put the
open-economy dimension at its center. Yet Benin lacked the necessary analytical tool to develop this
particular axis of its development strategy. The DTIS was to provide that analytical tool and had twin
objectives in that respect:
o To highlight specifically trade-related constraints to growth, both cross-cutting and sector-
  specific;
o To provide a trade-centered analysis on wider areas of Government and donor action such as
  infrastructure, governance, and the provision of public services.
Moreover, the DTIS was expected to provide a catalogue of practical measures to make progress on
the elimination of constraints. Section 1.3.2 below will provide a detailed assessment of the
implementation status at the measure level.
In terms of the general objective of mainstreaming trade in the national development strategy, the
Ministry of Industry, Commerce and SMEs (MICPME in its French acronym) produced in 2013 a
Trade Development Strategic Plan (TDSP) that laid out the Government’s priorities in terms of trade
development. The TDSP’s objective was to ensure the coherence of Government interventions in
trade-related matters and to the alignment of trade policy with the 2011-2015 Poverty Reduction
Growth Strategy adopted in 2011 and its Priority Action Program (PAP).
The TDSP proposes a global vision for the development of the country’s trade sector, articulated
around two “specific objectives”:
1. Ensure the supply of high-quality products for the domestic market,
2. Leverage opportunities offered by regional and multilateral trade.
Based on these objectives, the document lists several strategic axes. For objective 1, these are (i)
formalizing domestic trade, (ii) promote electronic trade, (iii) protect consumers, and (iv) reinforce
the capacities of trade-support institutions. For objective 2, strategic axes are (i) promote exports, (ii)
strengthen competitiveness, and (iii) leverage the opportunities created by regional and multilateral
trade agreements.
Based on its diagnosis objectives and strategic axes, the TDSP proposes an action matrix composed
of 40 actions with progress indicators, an implementation schedule, and designated responsible
structures in the government. It also proposes a tentative costing over the 2014-2020 period. The four
strategic axes falling into objective 1 add up to a funding demand of $2 million per year, or a total of

                                                    7
$14 million over the seven years of the strategy. The three axes falling into objective 2 add up to a
funding demand of $9.2 million per year, or a total of $60 million over seven years, the bulk of which
is accounted for by the “strengthening competitiveness” category ($6.2 million per year).
Looking beyond the TDSP, the mainstreaming of trade and competitiveness concerns in Benin’s
broader development strategy is reflected in key documents such as the 2012 update of the country’s
Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (GPRSP), whose Section III (diversification of the
economy) includes a discussion of reforms in the “trade-logistics nexus”. The document takes stock
of infrastructure improvements in the Port of Cotonou and of measures aimed at facilitating trade,
and goes on to list key challenges to be met in order to “energize” the trade logistics nexus. These
include:
1.   Reinforcement of EIF support to trade assistance
2.   Reinforcement of petroleum products storage and distribution
3.   Adoption of the Competition Policy bill
4.   Support for the enforcement of competition rules on the domestic market
5.   Setting up a strategic monitoring for export promotion
6.   Reinforcement of the metrology infrastructure
7.   Reinforcement of commercial fraud control
8.   Creation of a Tribunal of Commerce
9.   Reinforcement of the OCBN’s capabilities.
The list of challenges is broadly aligned with the 2005 DTIS priorities (see below for a discussion),
although with some important nuances; for instance, the list strongly emphasizes a control approach
(enforcement of competition rules, control of commercial fraud, etc.) whereas the DTIS took a more
skeptical view of the need to rely on controls in light of a weak state apparatus and discretionary
habits of control bodies.

1.3.2 Assessing impact: Broad outcome indicators
This section presents a “prima-facie” assessment of the 2005 DTIS action matrix’s impact by looking
for evidence of improvements in broad performance measures, keeping in mind that the causal chain
between actions on the ground and broad aggregate indicators is sometimes long and tenuous. The
DTIS action matrix singled out five areas for priority action:
1.   Improve trade facilitation
2.   Consolidate and reinforce export- and investment-support institutions
3.   Improve the legal and regulatory framework
4.   Reform the cotton sector
5.   Energize regional integration and improve relations with Nigeria.
Nine years on, evidence collected during the DTIS Update mission suggests that the priorities
identified in 2005 remain relevant, with limited progress in some parts of the agenda and none at all
in others, in particular the last three. Consider first broad outcomes: if the priorities were well-selected
and followed by concerted action, one would expect to see progress in measurable indicators linked
to those priorities. For each priority area, one can select one or a few proxy indicators that can be
expected to correlate with the intensity and success of reform.
For trade facilitation, these indicators include, inter alia, Doing Business “trading across borders”
scores and Logistics Performance Index (LPI) scores. For export and investment promotion, one can
                                                     8
take very broad proxies like the export-to-GDP ratio, measures of export diversification, and the ratio
of FDI to GDP. While the causal chain from limited-scale interventions to such macro indicators is
long and tenuous, these outcome indicators are nevertheless indicative of whether there is evidence
of a drastic change in the policy environment for the better. For the legal and regulatory framework,
appropriate indicators include standard governance and business-climate indices. For cotton-sector
reform, the most obvious performance indicator is the volume index of cotton production, although
one could look also at quality indicators such as the proportion of grade-A cotton and so on, which
are sensitive to the timing and management of harvest, collection and storage. Finally, for regional
integration and relations with Nigeria, one can look at the regional share in Benin’s trade as well as
the reduction of unrecorded parallel trade with Nigeria. While a detailed examination of trends in
these indicators will be the subject of Chapter 2 of this report, we can already take stock of big trends
in order to assess whether the picture that emerges is one of committed implementation of reforms.


Trade facilitation: In terms of trade facilitation Figure 12: LPI scores, Benin vs. ECOWAS
(priority area 1), the picture is one of progress, but a partners
failure to out-pace regional competitors. Figure 12 3.5
shows the evolution of standard trade facilitation         3        Benin

is available in the nine-year period since the DTIS. 1.5
The picture is nuanced. The cost to export as measured     1
by Doing Business indicators has been stable in Benin,
                                                         0.5

average. Finally, Benin’s LPI score, based on a larger sample of respondents than Doing Business,
shows early improvement between 2007 and 2010, but none thereafter, while the opposite is true of
regional competitors. As we will see later on in this report, this partly reflects unfortunate
experimentation with an inspection company.

Export and investment promotion: In terms of improved effectiveness of export promotion through
the consolidation and reinforcement of export- and investment-promotion agencies (priority area 2),
the evolution of broad outcome indicators since 2005 is not particularly favorable, although broad
indicators are distinctly difficult to interpret. Figure 13 shows that the ratio of non-commodity exports
to GDP fluctuates widely in the case of Benin, being affected by the price and volume of the cotton
harvest. The period after the DTIS (2006-2012) was characterized by large fluctuations which make
it difficult to identify a clear trend up. Nor did Benin clearly outperform the ECOWAS average.

Diversification has not made much headway either. Given the potential of non-traditional agricultural
exports such as cashews, pineapple or shea butter in Benin, one would expect more effective export
promotion to lead to export diversification. Figure 14 shows the evolution of Benin’s Herfindahl
index of product concentration over time. The concentration index first rises over 2006-2009 as a
result of higher cotton prices, then it drops between 2010 and 2013, but, as we will see in Chapters 2
and 5 of this report, this largely reflects the collapse of the cotton sector rather than growth in non-
traditional exports.

Thus, at this stage there is no prima-facie evidence that improvements in Benin’s export- and
investment-promotion structures have led to a visible improvement in broad, aggregate indicators of
export performance and diversification.
Legal and regulatory framework: Improvements in the legal and regulatory framework, the fourth
priority of the 2005 action matrix, do not seem to have had a large impact on indicators such as the
CPIA’s regulatory quality score or the time to resolve insolvency reported in the Doing Business (
Figure 15).

  exported to Nigeria. Indeed, the gross value of entrepôt trade with Nigeria is estimated at over two
  thirds of Benin’s GDP, and its contribution in terms of value added is estimated at about 20% of GDP
  (Golub 2012).
  All in all, the mapping of broad outcome indicators to priority areas of the 2005 action matrix is not
  suggestive of a strong, successful drive for implementation and reform. However, the causation chain
  between actions on the ground and broad outcome indicators is long and tenuous. Many confounding
  influences may blur the causal link from reform to performance outcomes. Thus, a more direct,
  output-based assessment of progress on the action matrix is necessary.

1.3.2 Action-matrix implementation
The 2005 DTIS Action Matrix was an extremely comprehensive and ambitious document, extending
to 17 pages, nine issue areas, and 70 discrete actions. Implementation on the ground has proved
challenging and action-matrix implementation has been highly uneven, with an overall take-up rate
of 39%.7

expected in the next few years. Port infrastructure has also improved. The Action Matrix
recommended moving oil tanks outside the port, enlarging warehousing capacities, liberalizing the
stevedores sector, privatizing the CNCB, and enlarging apron space for trucks. All of those
recommendations have been partially or fully implemented, although some tanks are still near the
container terminal. In particular, CNCB has been concessioned out. As will be clear throughout this
report, the port is very much the country’s spinal cord, and improvements in its governance and
infrastructure are critical to its overall competitiveness. In the related area of customs reform, progress
has been more uneven, partly as a result of the unfortunate Pre-Shipment Inspection (PSI) experiment
with Benin Control. The Action Matrix recommended a customs audit, which has been undertaken
as part of the current DTIS, better use of IT in customs and most importantly in customs-related
payments, better targeting of physical inspections, and the operationalization of the Single Window.
In other areas such as the use of IT (and, relatedly, the better targeting of physical inspections),
progress has been partial. For instance, ASYCUDA’s risk-management module is hardly used
although it is a simple “entry” tool into risk management.
In other areas, implementation has either not taken place or circumstances have deteriorated. For
instance, the cotton sector is in deep disarray. But in other key sectors such as road infrastructure or
trade-support institutions, progress has been slow. Thus, the highest implementation rates have been
achieved in areas where donors provided close technical and financial assistance to use technical

solutions to tackle technical problems. In areas where constraints were of a soft type and solutions
within the reach of the Government, such as governance, the legal framework, the institutional setup
of the cotton sector, or the setup of trade-support institutions, progress has been slow, suggesting a
lack of ownership of Action Matrix recommendations within Benin’s administration and at high
levels of the government.
Several factors have contributed to low ownership. One is the sheer number and extent of the
recommendations contained in the Action Matrix, and the difficulty of prioritizing them into short-,
medium-, and long-term actions. The issue of sequencing is important for reform, but was left
relatively unclear in some parts of the 2005 DTIS Action Matrix. A second reason is the need for
capacity building in the area of governance: political will is an important driver of reform and, in its
absence, it is difficult for individual actors to make significant changes. Third, and related to the
second reason, is the pervasiveness of rent-seeking in Benin, which makes the political economy of
reform extremely difficult. Individual actors have no incentive to move from a low-welfare
equilibrium to a welfare-superior one in a national sense. High level political impetus is necessary to
overcome this problem. At the same time, actions must be designed with political-economy
difficulties in mind, and focus on feasible actions with visible gains, suggesting an incremental
approach to DTISU recommendations, as opposed to designing “ideal” interventions unlikely to draw
sufficient support to ensure implementation.

1.3.3 A new approach aligned with the government’s priorities
As mandated by the Paris Principles, the approach of the DTIS Update’s (DTISU) is strongly aligned
with the MICPME’s Trade Development Strategy Plan (see above for a discussion) and draws also
from the diagnosis in the Government of Benin’s recent poverty assessment (INSAE 2014)8 as well
as the 2011 update of the GPRSP. It emphasizes the linkages between poverty, jobs, and trade, with
two key objectives: (i) reducing poverty through trade-led growth, and (ii) reducing vulnerability.
The DTISU’s approach is also centered around the role of the MICPME, focal point of the EIF
process in Benin. Because the DTISU’s Action Matrix spans areas that go beyond the strict
competences of a trade ministry, the MICPME is viewed as having a twin role in the process: (i)
Action on a core of measures falling directly under its competences; and (ii) Advocacy and Proposal
(A&P) for a wider set of actions falling under the competence of other line ministries or requiring
higher-level strategic choices. Based on its objectives and approach, the DTISU emphasizes, at a
broad level, two key policy priorities:
3. Diversification using the development of competitive logistics services as the entry point,
4. Reform of the cotton sector.
This report will show that Benin faces a large and potentially threatening source of vulnerability due
to the fact that a fifth of its economy is linked to the exploitation of price-arbitrage rents through
parallel trade with Nigeria, rents which are bound to erode progressively with regional integration.
Benin therefore needs to replace this fragile source of enrichment with a competitive advantage
grounded in real cost-competitiveness. Establishing modern logistics services (a wide range of
activities related to transport and transit) would facilitate job creation in other sectors and reduce
vulnerability. The development of formal logistics activities would create the conditions for the

progressive formalization of the economy, one of the TDSP’s core strategic axes, for a progressive
enlargement of the tax base, which would itself contribute to the fulfillment of WAEMU’s
convergence criteria, as well as the economy’s ultimate diversification into transformation activities.
Thus, the DTISU emphasizes a limited set of priorities but with powerful synergies, represented
graphically in Figure 19.

scope would mean ignoring the single most important determinant of many performance outcomes
against which the DTISU’s impact will be judged. Moreover, cotton-sector reform along the lines
recommended in Chapter 5 of this report would have, if implemented energetically, the power to
substantially reduce the economic vulnerability to which Benin’s poor are exposed. It is thus at the
center of the trade-poverty nexus.
The “diversification” box at the center of Figure 1 and Figure 19 falls within the area of competence
of the MICPME and should thus be an area for immediate action; while boxes in the figure’s periphery
clearly include a mixture of areas for action and A&P. Based on this framework, the DTISU’s
diversification strategy (at the core of the MICPME’s action) is based on four building blocks:
Reinforce the export-promotion/SPS management nexus: Diversification into nontraditional
products and first transformation requires a joint effort of export promotion and improved quality
management, as the two are strongly complementary; this will require coordination between the
MICPME and SPS management agencies;
1. Pursue customs reform: Customs’ role as “doorkeeper” of the Benin trade platform must be
   enhanced through better and more extensive use of ICT as well as complementary
   organizational reforms aimed at improving client orientation, transparency, and accountability
   at all levels;
2. Develop “clean channels”: Success in developing the formal economy may be achieved first
   within a limited, fenced area of transit via the container terminal and using the future rail
   infrastructure, in partnership with a reputable international operator. This “clean channel” could
   have a demonstration effect and provide a model to be extended step by step to wider areas of
   the domestic economy, bringing in the mainstream progressively smaller-scale players;


                                                           15
3. Seek improved relations with Nigeria: Once Benin has regained control of its trade flows
   through the establishment of clean channels and a credible customs reforms, it should attempt to
   improve relations with Nigeria through the progressive elimination of rents based on tax
   evasion that are costly to the Nigerian treasury (currently estimated at US$1 billion a year)
   using as an entry point the common management of the Sémé-Kraké border post (see Chapter
   3).
Alignment of the DTISU’s building blocks with the TDSP is illustrated in Figure 20. The left-hand
side of the figure provides a visual representation of the structure of the TDSP, with “specific
objectives” in the left-most column, strategies in the second column , and a selection of key actions
among the Matrix’ 40 proposed actions in the third column.9 On the right-hand side of the figure, the
boxes summarize the DTISU’s four key building blocks discussed above and show, with red arrows,
how they relate to the TDSP’s selected actions.

In sum, the DTISU proposes a practical action plan organized around key building blocks in close
alignment with the TDSP’s Action Matrix. Each of those four building blocks is, in itself, an
ambitious, complex project which will bear fruit only in the medium term. In this sense, there is no
“low-hanging fruit” in the implementation of the TDSP/DTISU strategy. However, implementation
should start on the ground, step by step, following the detailed Action Matrix offered in the DTISU
as a complement to the TDSP’s own version. The existence of a costed Action Matrix in the TDSP,
furthermore, should facilitate implementation and should prove a useful starting point to the dialogue
with donors.

Chapter 2: Harnessing trade policy for competitiveness

2.1 Introduction
Benin needs to create 100,000 jobs every year in the foreseeable future. Given the country’s current
population growth rate, failing to do that would imply inexorably rising unemployment. In order to
attain this minimal objective, a sustained increase in the intensity of economic activity will be
required in all sectors, those that already provide substantial employment—agriculture and services—
in the immediate future and, in the medium run, new industrial transformation activities.
Export markets are critical to providing the business opportunities required to generate such growth.
With a GDP of about US$8 billion, Benin has a limited domestic market whose size does not make
it a sufficiently powerful driver of growth. Thus, while retaking the home market is a first-level
objective for Benin’s firms, there should be no trade-off between import-substituting and export-led
growth: the two must go together through improved competitiveness at the firm level.
The analysis of trade data from various sources highlights the sheer size of parallel exports to Nigeria.
These flows are partly driven by comparative advantage and congestion at the Lagos port, but they
also reflect lost control over import valuations and the collection of border taxes. While contributing
powerfully to income generation in Benin, these flows rest on the arbitrage of price gaps that may
progressively vanish with regional integration. The fundamental objective of Benin’s development
strategy should be to replace rent-driven activities with alternatives based on genuine cost-
competitiveness. Given the constraints on Benin’s industrial development (lack of financing, weak
infrastructure, regulatory uncertainty, and moral hazard in business transactions), the first-order
priority for policy action should be the development of service activities linked to Benin’s location
as a gateway to landlocked countries (Niger and Burkina Faso) and to the large Nigerian market.
Trade data analysis in this chapter indeed confirms that Benin already plays the role of an import
gateway for the region, suggesting that a development strategy taking this as a starting point would
leverage already-existing competitive advantage. In turn, better logistics would improve the prospects
for diversification into light manufacturing and the first transformation of agricultural products.
In terms of trade policy, the analysis in this chapter shows that the transition to the higher ECOWAS
tariff will involve a regressive shock on the price of foodstuffs, with a rise in the cost of living close
to 10% for households towards the bottom of the income distribution. Given the creation of this high-
tariff band and its implications for the cost of living, Benin should work to improve the conditions of
regional trade in order to facilitate the movement of food staples in the region. Evidence during the
price hikes of 2008-2011 suggests that there would be substantial gains from better movement of
food staples between production regions and coastal markets. Better-functioning regional markets
could largely offset the shock of the higher tariff band on the cost of living while generating
employment and income creation in the region.
Relatedly, an analysis of customs data reported in this chapter reveals that almost half of Benin’s
regional imports still take place on an MFN rather than on a preferential basis. The evidence suggests
that the low uptake of regional preferences is likely to reflect the heavy, opaque and discretionary
paperwork associated with the eligibility requirements of regional preferences. In the context of
increased CET rates, therefore, it is particularly important for countries in the region to ensure that
regional trade take place effectively on a preferential basis. After all, the very purpose of a customs
union is to encourage regional trade and Benin has a stake in this.

2.2 A trade performance that largely reflects the cotton sector’s crisis

2.2.1 Formal trade
As noted in Chapter 1, Benin is running a persistent current-account deficit amounting to 8% of GDP,
which has widened since 2005 as the growth of goods and service exports has trailed that of imports
( Figure 21). The trade deficit is around 13% of GDP when measured by balance-of-payments
accounts. This external imbalance creates a need for external finance which may run into
sustainability problems in the long run.
As will become clear in                     Figure 21: Benin’s current account, 2005-2011

Keeping aside the price hike of 2011 which briefly took Liverpool Index A cotton prices to an
unrealistic high of over 200cts/lb, the long-term price trend for cotton has been clearly favorable,
rising from 40 cts/lb in 2002 to 90 cts/lb in 2013 (see Chapter 5).10

As a result of the slow growth of alternatives to cotton, Benin’s export structure remains highly
concentrated, with cotton accounting for over 50% of exports in 2013 according to Beninese Customs.
This data should, nevertheless, be interpreted with caution.

Concentrated export structures are common at low income levels , but Benin stands out in this regard
even after controlling for its low level of income. Using Theil’s concentration index,12 Benin appears
above the regression curve in Figure 25, suggesting that it is over-concentrated compared to
comparators at similar levels of income. Its level of concentration has come down substantially since
the mid-2000s, but this reflects the collapse of cotton exports more than a rise of non-traditional
exports (cashew nuts being the exception).

Benin’s imports are much more diversified than its exports (Figure 26). The diversity of Benin’s
imports demonstrates two distinct influences. First, it is a reflection of the country’s narrow
production base, as demand for consumption goods not produced domestically must rely on imports.

     Theil’s concentration index is a widely used alternative to Gini and Herfindahl indices.

                                                                        20
Second, it reflects the classification as imports of goods actually re-exported to Nigeria. Indeed,
Figure 26 shows that among Benin’s top import products, some of the products that figure
prominently fetch high import tariffs in Nigeria (rice, automobiles) or have import prohibitions (some
textiles, frozen poultry, conditioned edible oil, second-hand clothing). By contrast, products that are
known to be imported in large quantities, such as gasoline, do not figure in mirrored statistics, as
Nigeria does not record parallel exports of gasoline to Benin.

Informal trade in Benin is a very large part of the economy and a source of both employment and
wealth creation, though it does not contribute as much to tax revenue and therefore to the provision
of public goods as it could. Moreover, and most importantly, it is based on the arbitraging of price
differences between Nigeria and Benin, themselves largely due to the presence of distortionary
policies in Nigeria — a fragile source of rents. Abrupt (though short-lived) policy changes in Nigeria
in the mid-1980s and in 2003 translated into major shocks on the Beninese economy, underscoring
its vulnerability (Paquet and Savard 2009).
One can distinguish two main sources of rents due to distortionary policy interventions in Nigeria,
which together explain a large part of the informal trade in Benin:
o Energy subsidies, which reduce the price of gasoline and other fuels in Nigeria and encourage
  the enormous and illegal importation of hydrocarbons in Benin;
o Import bans and high border taxes on major items such as edible oils, rice and textile and
  clothing, which raise the price of those products in Nigeria (see Treichel et al. 2011 and de
  Melo and Ugarte 2012) and encourage the equally-large illegal re-exportation of those products
  through Benin.



                                                    21
The magnitudes are extremely large. On the import side, unofficial estimates for the “implicit
subsidy” of fuels in Benin via the incidental extension of the Nigerian subsidies put it at over 3% of
Benin’s GDP.13
On the export side, the regional Central Bank (the BCEAO) and the National Statistics Institute
(INSAE) have also independently assessed the possible size of informal re-exports to Nigeria (INSAE
2011). The BCEAO methodology is innovative and relies on tracing the origin of bank notes taken
in by the Central Bank’s branch in Benin (each member country issues notes with a different set of
trace codes). INSAE, meanwhile, has adopted a more traditional approach, using border surveys to
obtain a sample of informal trader behavior. Both initiatives make it possible, with some assumptions,
to provide magnitude estimates of the size of the informal trade sector in Benin. According to the
BCEAO, Benin’s official export statistics for 2011 might account for less than half (around 44%) of
actual exports, after accounting for informal trade and netting out re-exports. The INSAE survey
recorded 2.1bn FCFA of informal exports over a 10 day period in 2011, compared with a pro-rata
official figure of 4.6bn FCFA, this result suggests that the official figures might account for only 70%
of the true level of trade.
 Figure 29 revisits the issue by looking at unofficial imports into Benin — the “other side” of re-
exports to Nigeria — and suggests much larger orders of magnitude more consistent with those in
Raballand and Mjekiqi (2010), who estimate Benin’s informal re-exports to Nigeria to be US$5
billion (10% of Nigeria’s imports). A comparison of Benin’s trade data from various sources reveals
a striking discrepancy between, on the one hand, exports to Benin reported by other countries,
excluding Nigeria (the red column on the left of Figure 29) and, on the other, imports reported by
Benin’s customs authorities to Comtrade (full green column on the right in Figure 29). The
discrepancy between the two represents a whopping US$5 billion (the stripped green column labeled
“unaccounted for”), very close to Raballand and Mjekiqi’s estimate of parallel re-exports to Nigeria.
The “unaccounted for” imports can be understood as follows. Suppose that a trader imports a
shipment of consumption products — for example, cooking oil — through Cotonou, where roughly
a quarter of imports are destined for domestic consumption while the rest will be parallel re-exported
to Nigeria. Because the re-export is unofficial, all the shipment is registered as consumption in Benin
and liable to taxes, including border taxes, VAT and other levies, whose total is close to 45% for
products in the 20% CET band.14 By contrast, if the merchandise destined for reexportation were
taxed under the transit regime, the rate would be around 6.7%. Suppose that the trader negotiates with
customs an adjusted custom valuation so that 45% applied to that fictitious valuation is equivalent to
4.5% as a the quarter of the real imports to Benin and 6.7% to the remaining three quarters destined
for Nigeria. The adjusted customs valuation is what appears in Benin’s customs records forwarded to
Comtrade and the ratio between the real and declared values would be 0.36 – precisely what is
observed:
                                                    0.45
                                       x  746           5'010.
                                                   0.067
By this calculation, the true value of imports (official and “unaccounted for”) would be around $5
billion, explaining the unregistered imports in Figure 29. This very rough calculation thus seems
fairly close to the mark. The sheer size of these parallel flows, which largely escape taxation and cost

2.2.3 Regional trade
Benin is a member of two regional trade blocs: WAEMU, an eight-member customs and currency
union, and ECOWAS, a sixteen-member free-trade agreement currently undergoing a transition to a
customs union. The ECOWAS Trade Liberalization Scheme (ETLS) was set up to achieve free
movement of goods within the area via the elimination of customs tariffs and taxes as well as non-
tariff barriers (NTBs). Implementation of the ETLS on the ground, however, has been uneven and
marred by arbitrary policy reversals and poor information of traders, as further discussed Section
2.3.2 below.
Regional trade is weak and is not expanding as a share of the region’s total trade. Using mirrored
official statistics, the share of WAEMU and ECOWAS in Benin’s exports appears highly volatile ,
probably as a result of the uncertainties surrounding customs statistics in the region.Indeed, over the
last decade, WAEMU seems to have absorbed on average roughly a quarter of Benin’s exports, while
ECOWAS absorbed about a third (Figure 30). The high volatility of the series makes it difficult to
establish a trend, upward or downward. However, WAEMU’s 2014 surveillance report (WAEMU
2014) notes a downward trend in the share of intra-bloc trade in WAEMU’s total trade.
Comparing regional shares in Benin’s exports and imports (Figure 30 vs. Figure 31) highlights the
role of Benin as an entry door for the region’s imports, as the regional share is much higher for exports
(Figure 30) than for imports (Figure 31). This highlights a key argument of this DTIS Update—
namely, that Benin’s comparative advantage is in activities related to trade itself, e.g. logistics
services, and should be developed by appropriate investments.

households and also a source of export diversification, albeit unrecorded. Alleged plans by the
Government of Benin to buy staple food production and store it for intervention on the domestic
market, if confirmed, would be unlikely to help and should probably be scrapped. This would in all
likelihood add a confusion, price instability, mismanagement and arbitrariness to a market
environment that is already fragile.

regional imports paying tariffs as if
they were from the rest of the Source: Mission calculations using Benin customs data
world. For instance, almost half of Benin’s imports from ECOWAS partner countries still enter
without claiming any preferential treatment (Figure 32). Only 29% claimed WAEMU preferences
and only 6% claimed ECOWAS preferences.
As we will see in Section 2.3 below, the low rate of preference uptake in the region is likely to reflect
the hassle and difficulty in obtaining certificates of origin and other documentation needed to claim
preferential treatment. In the context of the transition to the ECOWAS tariff, this is an issue that
should be considered a priority one. The failure of West Africa to generate substantial intra-bloc trade
in spite of high CET rates is potentially of serious consequence. While poor households are hit by
higher prices, as the analysis in the next section will document, firms do not benefit from an integrated
regional market to develop their sales network. This hampers the ability of West African countries to
grow a fabric of SMEs capable of exporting a narrower range of products targeted at local consumers
and therefore prevents “learning by exporting”.

2.3 Trade policy: Update, scenarios and options for the future

2.3.1 A tariff environment in transition
A complex and regressive array of border taxes
Compared to other countries in the region, Benin still relies fairly heavily on trade taxes, which
represented in 2012 21.4% of total budget revenue and 4% of GDP (Figure 33). This relatively heavy
reliance reflects a rising share of border taxes in the total and underscores the need for a fiscal
transition toward domestic taxation in order to free trade policy from budget considerations and,
conversely, to free the State budget from dependence on the CET.

 Source: WAEMU (2014)                                           which has so far not been used by Benin.
In addition to the CET, Benin applies a “myriad of other taxes and charges” (Report on the
Examination of Benin’s Trade Policy, WTO, 2010), most of which are small, including the droit de
plombage, taxe fiscale de sortie, taxe spéciale de réexportation, redevance informatique (for exported
or re-exported goods, as well as those imported under border-tax exemption regimes), the statistical
tax (5% of customs value), and the taxe de circulation on vehicles. Merchandise in transit is also
subject to the escorte douanière at the traders’ expense.
A tax on used cars, the Acompte forfaitaire spécial (AFS), is levied on all vehicles that are imported
or in transit (except for Burkina Faso and Niger) at a lump-sum rate of FCFA 50,000, deductible from
corporate income tax payments.
Other charges are levied, depending on transport mode, including handling charges, port charges, and
a 0.18% commission levied by the Conseil National des Chargeurs du Bénin (CNCB) on all exports
and imports except those in transit or under full duty exemptions. The CNCB also charges €25 or
€100 per shipment in/out of the port of Cotonou for the issuance of a required Bordereau de Suivi des
Cargaisons (BSC), with the rate depending on shipment origin/destination (the low rate for Europe
and Africa, the high rate on other destinations) and a financial contribution of FCFA 400/ton at import
and FCFA 300/at export (FCFA 100/ton for bulk cargo) on commercial vessels using the port.
All told, border taxes add up to a little over 6% on merchandise in transit15 and up to 45% on final
goods (those with a CET at 20%) imported for domestic consumption if one includes the VAT at
18% (with de minimis thresholds of FCFA 40 million for goods sales and 15 million for services).
Benin also applies excise taxes on the consumption of cigarettes and tobaccos (10%), spirits and
champagnes (30%), wines (15%), beer and cider (10%), non-alcoholic beverages except water (3%),
wheat flour (1%), cosmetics (5%), and oils & fats (1%). Some of these rates were raised in 2009 in
conformity with the WAEMU directive. Exemptions from duties and charges are granted by the

   However, products in transit for Niger or Burkina Faso are exempted of all taxes and charges. This is said to give rise
to a traffic whereby products are imported in Cotonou, shipped on heavily loaded trucks toward Niger, where they are
redirected to Northern Nigeria, paying a 14% export tax upon crossing the Niger-Nigeria border. National authorities in
Benin have allegedly been considering a quantity ceiling on transit goods eligible for zero-rating in order to limit this
traffic.

         Toward the ECOWAS CET: Big bang?
         The transition from the WAEMU common external tariff (CET) to the recently negotiated ECOWAS
         CET involves a number of duty rate changes, the most important of which is the introduction of a
         new band with a rate of 35% on 130 items out of 5,899 (2.2%) at HS10.

         Out of those 130 items, 57 are animal products, 6 are edible oils, 36 are prepared foods and beverages,
         11 are chemicals, and 17 are textile & apparel products. At HS 10, the average and standard deviation
         of the WAEMU CET are respectively 12.06% and 6.87, against 12.25% and 7.47 for the new
         ECOWAS CET. Thus, the new tariff band generates slightly more dispersion and a slightly higher
         average. Once aggregated to HS6, the change is plotted in Figure 34 where bubble size is proportional
         to the number of HS6 lines in panel (a) and to Benin’s import value in panel (b). The 35% band, while
         accounting for a small number of lines, accounts for a far larger proportion of trade.
         Simple average rates by HS section are shown in Table 1, confirming the picture in Figure 34. While
         simple averages do not vary much, import-weighted averages (based on Benin’s mirrored imports)
         rise significantly for some categories of products where the 35% band hits, like animal products
         (including poultry), edible oils, or textile and clothing.

                These tariff changes are not without consequence for the cost of living in the region. Figure 35 shows
                how the WAEMU and ECOWAS CETs impact the cost of living along the income distribution, based
                on an analysis that combines CET rates with household expenditure patterns from Benin’s most recent
                household survey, EMICOV. Both are mildly regressive, showing a slightly downward-sloping
                pattern as a function of the level of household income.

               This regressivity reflects (i) the fact that any tariff, even if uniform, penalizes poor households more
               because the share of household income spent on goods (as opposed to services) goes down with
               income; (ii) the structure of the CET, whose escalating structure heavily taxes those food and clothing
               consumption items that represent a substantial share of household expenditure.
               The level of taxation under the ECOWAS CET is higher than the WAEMU equivalent across the
               board, and the slope is slightly more regressive. As a result, the transition has a regressive effect. This
               can be seen by plotting the difference between the two rates (ECOWAS – WAEMU) instead of the
               rate in a graph similar to that in Figure 35. This is done in Figure 36, where panel (a) gives the
               impact on the cost of living while panel (b) gives the impact on welfare, calculated as per the appendix
               formula.

               The impact on the cost of living is positive, suggesting that, when weighing tariff changes by
               household expenditures (rather than by the more traditional import values), the ECOWAS CET
               involves higher average rates than WAEMU’s old CET. Moreover, the effect of the transition is
               strongly regressive, as shown in the negative slope of panel (a) in Figure 36. In panel (b), the curve
               spans negative figures (welfare decreases) and, again, the decrease is larger for poorer households,
               confirming the regressive effect of the transition. Specifically, the most regressive CET rate changes
               affect food products such as meat, bread, and edible oils (Figure 37).

In sum, while the introduction of a fifth band at 35% in the ECOWAS CET affects only 2% of tariff
lines, when one takes into account either import patterns or household expenditure patterns, the effect
becomes non-negligible and the Government of Benin may want to consider accompanying measures
in order to mitigate the transition’s effect on the cost of living for poor households. One possibility is
to adjust internal taxation, but this may not be advisable on the ground of tax simplicity and
transparency. A better alternative would be to work on price transmission by working with the private
sector to reduce distribution costs and margins through better and more competitive intermediation
and transportation services.
EPA negotiations
As a member of ECOWAS, Benin is part of the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) that was
finally struck with the EU in February 2014. The logic of the negotiation was to put an end to the
asymmetric Cotonou Convention, which was incompatible with GATT Article XXIV and the
enabling clause. One of the African negotiators’ main concerns was the loss of tariff revenue
associated with the preferential elimination of tariffs on EU imports. In the case of Benin, the start of
EPA negotiations in 2007 coincided with a trend reversal in the EU’s share of total imports (Figure
38). Over the long run, one may expect Benin’s import sources to diversify further, reducing the
impact of tariff elimination on EU products, all the more so given that the transition period will be
very long.

preferential agreements with other countries would extend automatically to the EU, as long as the
“other countries” represent more than 1.5% of world trade and are sufficiently industrialized. This
clause would not cover preferences granted to other African or ACP countries, but would cover
preferences granted to, say, China, India or Brazil. On the divisive issue of agricultural subsidies, the
EU has accepted to eliminate export subsidies on farm products sold on West African markets. The
non-execution clause, which allows parties to suspend their commitments in cases of human rights
or democracy violation, was dropped; finally, the EU allows for some asymmetry in the rules of
origin applied to West African countries on account of their low level of development.
In order to improve the ability of LDCs to benefit from EU market access, the EU offers as part of
the EPA deal €6.5 billion in development aid over the period 2015-2019 (West African countries
initially requested €15 billion). Beyond the issue of WTO consistency, the EU sees EPAs as
development tools, nudging partners toward opening up their economies and reaping the efficiency
gains of openness. The EPADP (EPA Development Programme) will offer development assistance
in five strategic areas; (i) regional trade; (ii) the reinforcement of productive capacities; (iii)
infrastructure investment; (iv) assistance to the fiscal transition; (v) ownership and follow-up.
All in all, the simultaneous transition from the WAEMU to the ECOWAS CET and implementation
of the EPA can be expected to have (i) a depressing effect on imports due to the higher CET rates,
but (ii) a temporary boost to tariff revenue, due to the combination of higher CET rates and a low
elasticity of import demand. This is shown in Figure 39, based on the World Bank’s TRIST simulation
model. The reason for the transitory character of the tariff-revenue spike is that the added tariff
revenue brought about by the CET transition on out-of-bloc imports is progressively compensated by
the progressive phase-out of tariffs on EU imports. The smaller% for total border taxes is due to the
fact that other taxes levied at the border are largely unchanged. The absolute increases, however, are
similar.

2.3.2 Non-tariff measures
Benin prohibits the importation of a number of plants and vegetal products for phytosanitary reasons
(see WTO 2010). However, the scope of import prohibitions seems to be substantially wider than
would be justified by sanitary reasons alone.

In recent years, for instance, the Chamber of Commerce reported import prohibitions on food items
such as poultry, meat, refined vegetable oil, wheat flour, spaghetti, and bottled water. The rationale
for such prohibitions on health grounds is not clear (USAID 2011). In some cases the products are
banned when imported inland while allowed when imported through the port of Cotonou, where
controls are supposed to be more effective than at land posts ( Table 2). This penalizes regional trade
and is in conflict with Benin’s obligations under the ECOWAS ETLS. In the case of wheat flour and
rice, the sanitary argument is weaker than for refrigerated meat and fish and the result is, de facto, to

restrict intra-ECOWAS trade. Moreover, the ban on land imports of frozen poultry makes it difficult
to import it from Togo or Ghana into Benin and re-export it using parallel circuits to Nigeria — a
highly profitable trade. This also allows for a dominant position for those Beninese traders involved
in similar trade but using the port of Cotonou as their entry point.

inter-state transportation, axle load regulations, and a number of other key regulations. Benin has
made progress in reducing the number of roadblocks on the Cotonou-Niamey corridor compared to
other corridors in West Africa. The number of controls (and the total amount of irregular payments)
along the Cotonou-Niamey corridor are among the lowest surveyed by WAEMU (2014), as shown
in Figure 40.
However, a less rosy picture is painted by Benin (2013a) and ALCO (2012) for the all-important
Abidjan-Lagos coastal corridor, where Benin’s segment is shown to be one of the most difficult both
ways (Figure 40 and Figure 41), in terms of border-crossing times (Eastward and Westward) and
number of controls. Thus, paradoxically, progress in improving transit facilitation seems slowest on
the corridor that is most critical for Benin’s position as a regional transit hub.
As for technical regulations (SPS and TBT), their elaboration is under the authority of the Agence
Beninoise de normalisation et de gestion de la qualité (ABENOR), an autonomous agency placed
under the authority of the MICPME and operational, if one counts its previous avatar the CEBENOR,
since 2000. Benin also separates rule-making from rule enforcement, as verification of compliance is
under the authority of other agencies.16

 Source: Organization du Corridor Abidjan-Lagos       huge importance for agriculture. This hinders
the country’s ability to export agricultural products, due a combination of specific factors. First,
Benin’s export products are highly sensitive to the adoption of good agricultural practices. For
instance, the attractiveness of pineapple in sold in the supermarket depends on its color; but the
quantity of the chemical used for coloring must be carefully measured in order to avoid refusal at the
EU border. Similarly, the quality of shea butter depends heavily on its rate of impurity, moisture, and
acidity, which themselves are affected by harvesting speed, processing methods and storage.
However, Beninese farmers suffer from very low knowledge and capacity levels, with frequent
accidents in the handling of chemicals and generally poor agricultural practices due to ignorance. The
combination of these two factors would make the provision of an adequate regulatory framework,
verification and training particularly crucial.
However, as documented in Chapter 5, in spite of the proliferation of quality control agencies
(including, inter alia, the DNPV, DANA, and DPQC), Benin’s SPS management system is gravely
deficient in terms of capabilities and resources and cannot play its role, leaving farmers largely on
their own. For instance, the DNPV, which delivers phytosanitary certificates for export, has none of
the personnel or equipment that would be necessary to carry out its mission, and it therefore performs
a largely perfunctory “visual inspection”. Alert systems for the struggle against pests are inadequate,
relying on largely outdated stocks of phytosanitary products that cannot be deployed for lack of
equipment anyway. Similarly, the DANA is unable to conduct any credible analysis of pineapple for
lack of personnel and equipment, while the same observations apply to the DPQC in charge of quality
control for raw products such as cotton or cashew.
SPS agencies should be consolidated and endowed with qualified personnel and equipment. The
binding constraint to setting up a unique, well-equipped SPS agency is not a question of budget
resources, as it could primarily act as a “knowledge hub” — outsourcing verification functions to
accredited laboratories in the region and delivering training and capacity-building services to farmers
in close collaboration with donors, for whom agricultural support is often a high-priority item. The
constraint, rather, is the lack of a coherent strategy on the part of the Government. In this area as in

17
  Benin is currently developing a small number of standards; for instance on roofing tiles, in order to encourage local
production. It is also preparing a technical regulation on the labeling of bottled water to distinguish mineral (source) water
from “table” water. The regulation is favored by SOB EBRA, a producer of mineral water, which would then be able to
raise the unit value of its product.

                                                              34
others, reform would be a clear signal that the Government takes seriously the role the State has to
play in supporting agriculture.
Once Benin has put in place a credible SPS verification system, it should work at the regional level
to promote mutual recognition agreements in key areas relevant for agricultural trade. ECOWAS
could, for example, adopt a system of “green card” for regional SPS certification similar to that being
adopted by COMESA (Keyser 2013).
Rules of origin
Rules of origin take a common form in WAEMU and ECOWAS, stipulating that goods for which
preferential treatment is claimed while they are not wholly obtained should satisfy one of two
conditions:
1. Either a change of tariff classification at the heading level (HS4) compared to the imported
   inputs used in their production
2. Or a regional value content of at least 30% of the ex-works price (before taxes) of the goods.
However, the definition of the ex-works price differs between the two blocs in the treatment of the
wage bill, outsourcing expenses and financial charges which are subject to different ceilings. Thus,
harmonization of rules of origin is not complete and in some cases, the outcome of applications
differs.
Goods produced under partial or total duty exoneration regimes on imported inputs are not eligible,
except when inputs are taxed at a higher rate than the goods themselves. 18 This de facto scenario
excludes goods produced in export processing zones, where transformation activities typically take
place under duty-exemption schemes. As we will see, this has implications for Benin’s special zone
at Sémé-Podji.
Under rules common to both WAEMU and ECOWAS, the verification of eligibility at the border
entails a two-step process. Companies wishing to export within one of the zones and claim
preferential treatment must have registered with their national authorities. In principle, all WAEMU
members apply Regulation 14/2002/CM/COM/WAEMU, which sets up procedures for the issuance
of certificates of origin. According to the regulation, no committee should be involved in the review
of community registration applications. Benin, however, has set up a committee, comprising
representatives of the Direction de l’Intégration Régionale, the Direction Générale du Développement
Industriel, the Direction Générale des Douanes et Droits Indirects, the Direction Générale du
Commerce Extérieur and the Chamber of Commerce. Committee meetings are subject to a quorum
requirement. Notwithstanding its lack of alignment with community rules, this heavy procedure
delays the review of applications and, therefore, the registration of companies.
In addition to company registration, each shipment must be accompanied by a certificate of origin
delivered by the country of origin’s authorities in a standardized format common to the zone.
However, the production of certificates of origin has proved to be a bottleneck in regional trade. Paper
certificates of origin are easily falsifiable, and their non-recognition is a recurrent complaint of
traders. In order to remove this bottleneck, Benin should work with its WAEMU and ECOWAS
partners towards the creation of an electronic repository for certificates of origin which would have

18
  A 2009 revision of WAEMU rules made eligibility possible for firms operating under special regimes provided that
import duties were paid on inputs entering the production of the goods for which preferential treatment was claimed.
However, this revision does not seem to be applied.

                                                        35
the dual advantage of simplifying procedures and making verification easier and more reliable.
Finally, the Government of Benin put in place and then suspended an import-verification program
(IVP), discussed in more detail in Chapter 3.

2.3.2 Export & investment promotion
Benin’s Export Processing Zone
Benin has set up a twenty-year (1997-2017) project of provision of serviced industrial land. Like
many countries in the region, it also set up an EPZ in Sémé-Podji in 2002, located near Cotonou and
5 km from the Nigerian border, to offer better conditions to foreign investors. The EPZ is operational
since 2010 and offers a standard package of tax exemptions including, inter alia:
o A 10/12/15-year tax holiday on the corporate income tax (impôt sur le benefice industriel et
  commercial) depending on the sub-zone, followed by a 5-year period of preferential rate (20%)
o A rebate on the payroll tax (versement patronal sur les salaires)
o VAT exemption on inputs and conditioning materials for both investment and production
o Exemption of border taxes (droits et taxes d’entrée) on imported capital equipment, inputs and
  conditioning materials, except imported trucks (utilitaires) for which border taxes are reduced
  by 60%, for eligible production (see below).
In order to benefit from the special economic status, companies must export at least 65% of their
production outside of WAEMU or ECOWAS; rebates, exemptions and tax holidays apply typically
at the firm level, though duty exemptions or rebates typically apply only to eligible production (see
section 2.3.2 above). The private sector resents this exclusion, as much of the activities that could
take place in the EPZ would be for export to the sub-region. More generally, in light of the above
discussion of the structure of Benin’s trade, where imports are predominantly from outside the region
whereas exports are within the region, the exclusion of regional exports from EPZ treatment limits
the zone’s potential to attract investment. Indeed, as of 2013 the industrial park was still largely
empty, with one French-Lebanese company producing pasta, a battery recycling company and a
Chinese investment project that is underway.
SEZs in various forms (export processing zones, offshore assembly zones, zones franches etc.) have
spread widely, with close to 4,000 worldwide , accounting for one fifth of developing-country exports
(Farole 2011). SEZs account for a large share of the exports of many countries, including the
Philippines (78%), Bangladesh (75%), Morocco (61%), Nicaragua (79%) or even Madagascar before
the crisis (80%), although in the case of Madagascar, political unrest and the end of MFA quotas led
to the SEZ’s collapse. However, their record as “growth engines” is unproven. Backward linkages
are often weak except in a few cases like Korea’s Masan Free Zone, created in 1970, where local
sourcing grew from 3% in 1971 to 45% in 1986 (Farole 2011). Nevertheless, even some of the most
successful EPZs, like in Vietnam or Bangladesh, have had very weak backward linkages.
The contribution of SEZs to employment is also limited, except in a few small countries in Central
America. Ghana’s Tema SEZ accounts for 3.5% of national employment, Tanzania’s, 2.5%, Nigeria’s
Calabar, less than 1%, Kenya’s SEZ, 15%. Even highly successful and labor-intensive ones like
Bangladesh and Vietnam account for only 5% and 19% of national employment respectively. Wages
in SEZs are typically higher than economy-wide minimum wages, although in cases like
Bangladesh’s SEZ, they are still extremely low. Some SEZs come with anti-union legislation, seen
as an additional attractor to investors; for instance, until 2005 Kenya prohibited unions and collective

                                                  36
bargaining in SEZs, while Nigeria’s free zone prohibits strikes for ten years after the start of a
company’s operations, leaving labor disputes to be settled by the zone’s management. SEZs have also
made limited use of local skills, in particular in Africa—except for Tanzania and, to a lesser extent,
Senegal—and there seem to be widespread problems in generating job-advancement opportunities,
particularly for women. In sum, SEZs worldwide have failed to live up to their hype as silver bullets
to generate quality jobs and linkages to the domestic economy.
Most governments, in both developed and developing countries, try to attract Foreign Direct
Investment (FDI) by way of tax incentives, either through low statutory tax rates or through special
regimes. As one country’s tax cuts reduce the probability of another country being chosen by
investors, the result is a worldwide race to the bottom — benefitting the shareholders of multinational
companies at the expense of public goods in host countries. Yet, this race to the bottom is largely
fruitless, as FDI does not respond significantly to variations in either marginal or average tax rates
(Abbas et al., 2012). By contrast, host-country fundamentals such as macroeconomic stability have a
significant effect in attracting FDI. In sum, tax incentives should not stand in the way of the need to
broaden the tax base and collect sufficient revenue to ensure the adequate provision of public goods.
Against this backdrop, the potential interest of Benin’s EPZ is to focus the attention of national
authorities on the need to provide, on a manageable scale, a coherent package of supply-side
incentives including reliable energy, water and water treatment, road access, and the minimum level
of public utilities needed to attract labor (education, housing, and health services). EPZ promotion is
also an opportunity to engage in fruitful dialogue with multinational companies and learn what they
need in terms of business environment. Benin should therefore consider re-launching its EPZ through
the provision of enhanced infrastructure, a dedicated single window for all administrative procedures,
and a status enabling participating companies to export in ECOWAS markets.
Export promotion
The consolidation of various government agencies acting in the broad area of export promotion,
including, inter alia, the Centre Béninois du Commerce Extérieur (CBCE) and the Observatoire des
Opportunités d’Affaires (OBOPAF), into a single agency was one of the important recommendations
of the 2005 Action Matrix. The poorly-coordinated and funded activity of the various existing
agencies failed to provide effective promotion services to Benin’s actual and potential export
products. Yet international evidence shows that export promotion can be an effective tool to boost
export growth. Cross-country evidence in Lederman, Olarreaga and Payton (2009) suggests that
Export-promotion Agencies, on average, have a large and significant effect on export growth. Using
a similar methodology, Zoratto (2013) finds evidence that they matter also for export diversification.
The need for exporter assistance is particularly crucial in Benin’s nontraditional agricultural exports
such as the pineapple and shea butter subsectors, where producers are poorly informed of both
business opportunities and the quality and certification requirements needed to break into new
markets. Moreover, intermediation is often a bottleneck as capacity (trucks, personnel, storage) is
often insufficient for the potential export-oriented output, creating economically-inefficient
monopsony positions. Better information could allow producers to bypass inefficient intermediation
channels and reach out directly to potential buyers, and vice versa.
Created in 2007, the Agence Beninoise de Promotion des Echanges Commerciaux (ABePEC), under
the authority of the MICPME, is now in principle the sole agency in charge of export promotion,
although its mission to some extents parallels that of the Centre de promotion des Investissements
(CPI, under the Ministry of Development), and that of the Conseil Présidentiel des Investisseurs. Its

                                                  37
missions include the dissemination of market information, assistance to producers in the identification
of market opportunities, the promotion of Beninese products abroad through participation in foreign
fairs, and training. Mission interviews with the private sector suggested that the agency does a
competent job given its resources.
Export promotion has a key role to play in facilitating Benin’s diversification out of cotton, provided
that it is driven by an adequately-endowed single agency. In the fragile and opaque business
environment of Benin, export promotion should involve not just facilitating trips to foreign fairs (the
traditional role of export promotion agencies), but close professional coaching of producers in the
management of quality. Mission interviews revealed a number of instances of contacts between
buyers and Beninese producers that could have led to fruitful long-term relations had it not been for
quality mismanagement and opportunistic behavior on both sides. There is a wide gap between the
business practices prevalent in the local market and those that prevail in international markets and it
is difficult for Benin’s producers to close this gap without a long term effort in training and awareness-
raising. Export promotion in Benin should go beyond just match-making and emphasize the
management of quality products and quality business relationships.

2.4 Looking ahead
Benin faces formidable challenges but all of these can be tackled by appropriate reforms. All
necessary steps go in the same direction: less opportunism, less short-termism, more predictability,
and more investment in future opportunities and long-term relations. In order to make the business
environment evolve in the right direction, the Government of Benin should consider the following
steps in the area of trade policy:
Export and investment promotion
1. Strengthen ABePEC’s resource endowments, making it the sole agency in charge of export and
   investment promotion, and “deepen” its mission to the upgrading of producer managerial
   capabilities;
2. Invest in “broad infrastructure” (including the public services needed to attract and stabilize
   quality manpower) at the Sémé-Podji EPZ and promote it to reputable investors, with limited,
   transparent and non-renewable tax incentives;
Non-tariff measures
3. Consolidate all agencies in charge of SPS management into a single one, separate the rule-
   making mission from the verification mission, systematically outsource all testing to credible
   laboratories and agencies, and focus on training, information and awareness-raising;
4. Pledge the complete and permanent elimination of all temporary import bans and eliminate
   barriers to regional imports;
Business environment
5. Speed up the adoption of technological solutions to overcome regulatory uncertainty and
   arbitrariness; in particular, work at the regional level toward the creation of regional electronic
   repositories of documents in three key areas: SPS certification (“green card”), certificates of
   origin, and trucking documentation (“brown card”);



                                                   38
6. Work out a deal with large traders in order to phase out the informal negotiation of customs
   valuation against improvements in the transit infrastructure and the predictability of the business
   environment;
7. Initiate a dialogue with Nigeria on a long-term solution involving the recovery by Nigeria of
   some of the tax income lost to smuggling keeping in mind the preservation of some of the most
   important business opportunities for Beninese traders in selected sectors.

Chapter 3: Trade facilitation
Transport and logistics is a critical enabler for trade: efficient logistics gives a competitive edge to an
economy, while poor logistics can put such a burden on an economy that it negates all other possible
competitive advantage. In Benin, there is a definite potential for efficient logistics, but at the same
time, there are several important problems to fix, and possible threats to address.
From a transport and logistics standpoint, Benin is betting its future on transit to neighboring
countries. This approach does not ignore Benin’s trade itself: if the transport and logistics industry is
efficient for its neighbors, it will also be for the country’s own needs. To meet those neighbors’
demand, Benin offers good quality facilities: the port has recently been extended, the container
facilities are adequate and managed by competent operators, the interface between the port and the
trucking services has been improved, while the railway is going to be extended to Niamey and will
be managed by a competent operator.
Extension of the port alone, however, is not a sufficient guarantee that Cotonou will attract a large
market share for transit to the region’s landlocked countries, particularly considering the other
transport and logistics developments that are underway or planned in the neighborhood, and that the
promoters of possible competitors to Benin are the very ones involved in Benin. The future of the
corridor will therefore largely depend on the regional strategies that global operators pursue.
There is however, an encouraging sign, with the recent decision to extend the railway to Niger, as the
large investment will tie the Bolloré group to Benin, probably influencing the choice between the
maritime gateways controlled by the group in favor of Cotonou. The only unknown factor in this
equation is the actual availability of finance for the large investment.
This chapter proposes a diagnostic and an evidence-based set of recommendations organized around
three central recommendations:
1. Structural reforms that need long term efforts, but that can be supported by the donor
   community. These concern primarily the reform of Customs to simplify procedures, and
   introduce risk management and better ICT-capability and also the reform of the trucking
   industry
2. Governance reforms that need political support, and also the acknowledgement that the current
   environment is detrimental to long term development. These concern a more predictable
   environment and putting an end to predatory practices
3. Practical reforms that can be engaged in the short term to strengthen the regional position of
   Benin and preserve the future. This would entail, for instance, the development of ICT for
   logistics at the port and initiating a constructive dialogue with Nigeria.

3.1 Transport and logistics in Benin
Transport and logistics services are important for Benin and its neighbors: the port of Cotonou is the
main gateway for Benin’s external trade and handles significant volumes of the external trade of its
neighbors, mainly Niger and Nigeria. However, this position is fragile and can be contested: other
ports on the West African coastline are competing to serve as maritime gateways to the landlocked
countries of the hinterland — a significant portion of the transit to Niger is actually bound to Nigeria
and that portion plus the actual transit to Nigeria exists because of restricting trade policies in Nigeria
that are expected to relax with progress towards an effective Customs Union in West Africa.

                                                    40
3.1.1 Regional context
The West Africa region is irrigated by a network of trade and transport corridors structured by the
two main East-West routes and the North-South connectors linking them: the Trans-Sahel Corridor
from Dakar in Senegal to Niamey in Niger via Bamako (Mali) and Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso), and
the Coastal Corridor from Abidjan in Cote d’Ivoire to Lagos in Nigeria, passing through several major
cities, economic centers and ports – Takoradi and Tema in Ghana, Lomé in Togo, Cotonou in Benin.
Most coastal ports compete for the international transit traffic to the landlocked hinterland, while also
handling, on an opportunity basis, part of the maritime trade of their coastal neighbors — resulting
in a fluctuating pattern of trade flows throughout the region. In that network, Cotonou is positioning
itself as a major gateway for Niger and Nigeria, but this position is being challenged and is likely to
be increasingly challenged in the future.
Transit to the landlocked countries of West Africa is heavily congested around ports and efforts to
facilitate it are sometimes exceeding the actual gains. It is considered more in terms of regional status
than from a purely economic perspective, most port authorities, for instance, grant positive
concessions to the landlocked countries in order to secure traffic: lower handling fees, longer grace
period for storage, yard or warehouse space within port limits, etc. Port authorities also maintain
permanent liaison offices in the landlocked countries. Conversely, landlocked countries are present
in all or most coastal ports through permanent branches of shippers’ councils or through the dedicated
warehouses availed by port authorities.
Containerized traffic is particularly disputed. West African liner services on average cal at more ports
along the coastline than typically occurs in other regions. Some rationalization of the liner services is
inevitable, and the ports with the larger volumes are likely to remain mainline ports of call, whereas
the ones with smaller volumes are likely to become feeder ports or be relegated to secondary loops
with smaller vessels. This translates into higher freight rates for the feeder and secondary ports and
longer shipping time compared to mainline ports.
There are several container terminal projects along the coastline that will increase current capacity:
o Second terminal in Abidjan
o Extension of Tema port
o Extension of the container terminal in Lomé plus the creation of the second terminal
o The extension of the container terminal in Cotonou which has just been commissioned
o The planned extension of the container terminal in Lagos
o The plan to develop new ports around Lagos on greenfield projects (one in the West of Lagos,
  one in the East)
o The plan to build a new port at Sèmè Kpodji (Benin).
It is not easy to determine the adequacy between medium and long term container terminal demand
and offer. Indeed, there are a number of projects that are still at the drawing board stage and are
subject to speculation on the actual capacity or the time it may take to be operational, while are still
under development but with differences between announced and actual capacity, plus capacity
reserves for existing terminals, Only one fact is clear, the planned (or announced) container capacity
exceeds the demand in the medium term.

As most of the current concessions for container terminals are in the hand of two operators (Bolloré
Africa Logistics – BAL, and APM Terminals – APMT, a subsidiary of Maersk shipping lines) either
in isolation or in partnership, the actual capacity development which will take place is likely to be
decided with the main objective to prevent useless investments, while traffic growth is likely to be
directed to ports where the prospects for return on investment are the most attractive. However, the
possible entry of new contenders, China Merchant Holding and MSC for instance, for the new
container terminal in Lomé, or ICTSI for Lekki, may in the long run change the dynamic and
introduce some form of inter-port competition.

3.1.2 Traffic volumes
The role of Benin in the regional hinterland trade flows
The three landlocked countries of West Africa (Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger) enjoy several options
to route their overseas trade, with the major maritime gateways to West Africa being Dakar, Abidjan,
Tema, Lomé and Cotonou, and to a much lesser extent Conakry and Takoradi:
o Mali relies primarily on Dakar and then Abidjan, a situation which was inverted before the long
  political crisis in Côte d’Ivoire
o Niger relies almost exclusively on Cotonou, and very marginally on Lomé
o Burkina Faso has a more balanced mix of options


                                                 42
However, the respective use of the corridors varies over time, and the instability in Cote d’Ivoire has
been the main driver for the fluctuations in port transit for the past 15 years, as illustrated by the
routing of the Burkina Faso overseas trade.
The share of Abidjan was eroded over time, allowing for new players, such as the Ghana ports, and
Cotonou, according to the evolution of the political and economic situation in the region.

The landlocked countries are not
the only source of transit activity.
The fact that their overseas trade is
highly disputed among the ports, which all entertain commercial representations, tends to eclipse the
large volumes that are also transiting along the coastline between neighboring countries: Lomé for
Ghana (notably clinker) and Benin; Cotonou for Lomé and Nigeria.
Activity at the port of Cotonou
The port of Cotonou experienced a steady growth over the past two decades, increasing from around
one million tons a year to over 8.5 million tons for 2013 (provisional data).
    Figure 43: Evolution of Cotonou port throughput           The only pause in that growth was from

                                                              shifting them to neighboring ports.
                                                              Because of the close proximity in time of

impact of the BENIN CONTROL episode. Other ports in West Africa experienced an earlier return
to growth, but the situation in Côte d’Ivoire also contributed to increasing transit volumes through
neighboring ports as alternatives to Abidjan. With the end of the BENIN CONTROL contract, the
port of Cotonou managed to regain the trust of the traders from the hinterland and traffic growth
resumed in the second half of 2012. The contract with BENIN CONTROL was cancelled in May
2012, disrupting partly the traffic patterns, but unlocking the return to the growth path.


                                                             43
The accelerated growth of the port throughput in the early 2000 is linked to the increase of the transit
trade, particularly with Niger (according to port statistics): during the period 2000 to 2012 (detailed
data per country is available only for the first three quarters of 2013), Benin volumes increased by
82%, whereas Niger volumes increased by 437% and other countries (which includes transshipment
activity) increased by 272%. Consequently, the share of transit increased from a quarter to over half
of the total port activity.

Burkina Faso, meanwhile, is mostly in petroleum products. A possibly large, but difficult to estimate,
portion of the transit is declared as being destined for Niger but may in fact end up in Nigeria, with
importation followed by re-exportation in Niger.

that has taken place in the port of Cotonou is
the development of the container terminal. In 2006, the US Millenium Challenge Corporation (MCC)
funded an extension program for the port of Cotonou for $180 million including, inter alia, the
construction of a new two-berth south wharf for the development of a container terminal, the
extension of a sand-stopping jetty by 300 meters to reduce port dredging costs (by an estimate of $2.1
million annually), provision of a tugboat, and a number of other improvements.
The Container terminal located at the South Quays was attributed after an international tender to
Bollore Africa Logistics in September 2009. The concession is for a 25 years period and included a
commitment to pay $200 million in concession fees during the first eight years of operation and invest

$256 million in operating equipment and civil works over the life of the agreement. 19 With the
extension funded by MCC, the south quays have a draft of 15m, all overs are limited to 10m. COMAN
(subsidiary of APM Terminal) is operating container vessels on the north quays, with the terminal
yard located in the western part of the port. Combined with the port extension and the reorganization
of the truck movements in the port and the city, the main shortcomings of the port of Cotonou
identified in the 2005 DTIS have been addressed, with reserve capacity available to accommodate
future growth.
Road network
The total road network in Benin is defined in the Decree n°2001-092, dated February 20th 2001, and
comprises 6,076km of National roads -- comprised of Seven Inter-State roads for 2,178km, and 39
national roads for 3,898km -- Urban roads network for 55.6km (in Cotonou and Porto Novo), and
1,075.1km of rural roads. The inter-state network conforms roughly to a north-south and east-west
orientation:
o Part of the Abidjan Lagos coastal corridor for the east-west roads
o Serving primarily Niger (from Cotonou to Malanville) and branching to Burkina Faso (from
  Cotonou to Porga), for the north-south roads
The last status of the road network condition was published by the Ministry responsible for transport
is December 31st 2008. Since the 2005 DTIS, the World Bank program for trade and transport
facilitation on the Abidjan Lagos corridor contributed to the improvement of the road along the coast
line.

Trucking services in Benin are dominated by small size operators, a vast majority of individual
owners and very few trucking companies. The legislation for road transport services requires transport
companies to be registered as such. The registry of the companies was obtained from the Ministry of
Transport, first a version recording all companies up to 2008, then with an update. In theory, the
companies are expected to list their fleet during the registration, but this declaration is not updated to
reflect changes in the fleet.
Most of the companies have relatively modest fleets — a handful of trucks at most — and combine
transport services with other activities. This pattern is consistent with other observations of the

Tariffs are freely negotiated and the trucking tariffs reference grid issued in 2000 has lost its
relevance. For instance, reference rates for Cotonou -Niamey were published at 37,800 FCFA per ton
in 2000, whereas current rates are negotiated around 46,000 F CFA per ton. For Cotonou Arlit, the
2000 reference rate was 73,548 F per ton and is currently 85,000 F per ton. The Ministry of Transport

attempted to revise the grid to take into account evolution of cost factors since 2000, but the proposed
increased was cancelled due to its possible impact on consumer prices index.
Current prices are comparable for instance to East Africa: Cotonou Niamey represents a distance of
1,041 kilometers, for a break-bulk rate of 100$ per ton, similar to Mombasa Kampala with a rate of
105$ per ton for a distance of 1,137 kilometers. However, the trucking conditions are different, and
trucks are taking longer time to reach destination. Consequently, trucks in Benin are less productive
than their equivalent in East Africa and, at the same time, are far older (and therefore the vehicle cost
component is lower) and are combined with different activities (with possible cross-subsidization and
therefore potentially the requirement for instance to only cover direct voyage costs). The World Bank,
through a Trade Facilitation Facility (TFF) grant, has commissioned trucking surveys in Niger and
Benin that will be conducted during the second quarter 2014. The results will provide a better picture
of the trucking industry in Benin and the characteristics of the operations on the Cotonou Niger
corridor and shed light where there is presently very limited factual data.
Railway
The railway was opened in 1906 between the port of Cotonou and Ouidah, a distance of about 45km,
and then extended towards Niger but to reach only Parakou, 437km from Cotonou, in 1936. The rail
gauge is the meter gauge, similar to the other West Africa railways. Although the line is limited to
Benin in its extent, the railway company, OCBN (Office du Chemin de fer Bénin Niger), is a
binational parastatal.
In the last decades, the railway experienced a number of setbacks, with declining traffic, growing
debts and the Government of Benin was willing to transfer the management of the railway to the
private sector. However, because of the binational status of the company, the approval of Niger was
required, which was obtained on May 25th 2010 after a meeting between the two Governments.
Negotiations were initiated with Petrolin, a local investor, and a notification signed on July 22 2010
attributed the concession of the railway to the company, but never reached the concession stage. The
process was revived through the African Union project for closing the railway loop Abidjan
Ouagadougou Niamey Cotonou. A first concrete sign of change was the MoU signed between the
Heads of State of Benin and Niger on November 7th 2013 agreeing on the extension of the railway
line to Niamey, with Bollore as strategic partner. Construction of the new line was launched in April,
in Niger.20 The extension to a 1,050km railway link will cost an estimated €1bn and forms part of a
larger project intended to link the two countries with Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire.
Bolloré Group, the strategic partner for the project, is mobilizing funds to ensure the railway is
completed within four years. Up to 40% of the construction costs will come from strategic partners,
10% each from the governments of Niger and Benin, and 40% from private sector partners in the two
countries.21 The extension of the railway will provide some rationale for the Dosso dry port (140km
from Niamey on the road to Benin), which was initiated in May 2009, and until now has only
materialized by a fenced area of 100 hectares. The IFC is advising the Government of Niger on the
selection of an operator to develop the facility.

Land border crossing
The three main land border crossings are Hilla Condji (between Togo and Benin) and Seme Krake
(between Benin and Nigeria), both on the Abidjan Lagos corridor, and Malanville (between Benin
and Niger).
Hilla Condji (Togo / Benin):
The operating hours for the border are 7:00 to 12:00 then 14:30 to 17:30 during weekdays, 7:00 to
13:00 on Saturdays, and closed on Sundays. However, for movement of persons, the border is open
24/7. The Customs office is connected to the HQ in Cotonou for Customs declarations.
For goods destined to Benin, the standard practice is border clearance, except for a few products:
o Petroleum products, cleared for home consumption at the specialized office in Cotonou, and
  subject to escort between the border and there);
o Rice, cleared for home consumption in Cotonou, and also subject to escort.
Irrespective of the destination (Cotonou, Seme / Krake or Malanville) the escort is charged 99,600 F
CFA per truck. Escort days are Monday to Saturday. The escort concerns documents: trucks are
released, and proceed at their own pace, and a Customs officer is taking the bunch of documents to
the destination office. Usually, the trucks which arrived the day before are released for the escort the
next day. The Benin Single Window SEGUB is currently rolling out at Hilla Condji, connecting
Customs, CNCB, the African Development Bank , and the parking yard (DOMTRACO).
Seme Krake (Benin / Nigeria):
The border is currently being converted into a one stop border post thanks to funding from the EU
for physical infrastructure and the World Bank for soft issues. However, the contractor responsible
for building the infrastructure was fired due to poor performance in late 2012 and since then,
construction work has ceased although efforts are being made to identify a replacement contractor.
The situation at the border is very particular because the major part of the traffic is transshipped from
Benin trucks to Nigeria trucks. The reasons are multiple, and all linked to Customs and law
enforcement practices in Nigeria, and not for lack of proper agreement between Benin and Nigeria to
enable the movement of trucks across the two countries. The transshipment does not concern trucks
carrying goods coming from other countries further on the Abidjan Lagos Corridor, only the ones
loaded in Benin, with transit goods passing through the port of Cotonou. Reasons for this include the
following:
The application by Nigeria Customs of a per-truck lump-sum formula for duties (1.9 million Naira or
around US$11,400 per truck) creates a perverse incentive to overload specifically-reinforced,
oversized trucks. While the customary combination of three Beninese trucks into a single Nigerian
one (a feat, considering that Beninese trucks were already significantly overloaded) is being phased
out, it is still common to combine two Beninese trucks into one Nigerian truck. Law enforcement
officers in Nigeria tend to assume that Beninese trucks are carrying goods that have been diverted
from Lagos to Cotonou and therefore tend to harass Beninese truck drivers more frequently than those
from other countries. This may largely be an excuse, but according to truck drivers’ unions, the issue
of harassment by law enforcement is considered by most drivers as a sufficient threat to justify
avoiding driving in Nigeria. The fact that other drivers’ nationalities (Togo, Ghana and even Côte
d’Ivoire) routinely drive through Nigeria would tend to confirm that suspicion of smuggling, or at
least suspicion of diversion of traffic from Lagos, is at the root of this behavior.

                                                   48
In addition to the delays caused by the transshipment of the trucks, the frequent unofficial disputes
between Benin and Nigeria lead to partial or total closure of the border, preventing trucks from
passing. The last such closure happened in September 2013, and trucks were blocked at the border,
some for over two months, until the border was reopened. The reason for the closure was unclear, but
it seemed to be linked to the size of the trucks in Benin. This example illustrates the large
unpredictability of the prevailing conditions for trade. Under the current organization of the logistics
of trade, the benefits of a one stop border posts are almost non-existent. Starting a dialogue between
Nigeria and Benin on Customs and logistics issues will be necessary to identify a solution that will
prevent transshipment, and enable faster and more efficient border crossing procedures. Abandoning
the lump sum practice on the Nigeria side is probably the single most important measure that would
remove all financial justification to the transshipment.
Malanville (Benin / Niger):
Malanville, like Seme Krake, is also being converted into a one stop border post with EU funding,
and the physical facilities are complete: they have been officially inaugurated by the two countries in
April 2014. However, unlike Seme Krake, the funding for the soft issues depends on an additional
EU grant to support the regional facilitation program of the two RECs (WAEMU and ECOWAS),
which has not yet been finalized, and may delay the entry into service of the new border post. The
current situation is transitory and only two issues need to be flagged: the issue of escorting and the
over-reliance on paper instead of ICT (discussed in another section below) and the truck parking
yards.
In Malanville, the municipality and a private investor22 opened a parking yard for the transit trucks,
pending their release by Customs. A parking fee, collected at the port of Cotonou, is charged for the
trucks, irrespective of the duration of the stay (10,000 F CFA). The actual muscle of the beneficiaries
for the Malanville yard may be low, considering that the yard was close in June 2013 following a
decision by the head of State, and only reopened in March 2014. In the meantime, an alternative
parking yard was opened in town, and closed when the other reopened. On the Niger side, a similar
parking yard exists, owned by a local but influent businessman. The fee collected is lower: 4,000
FCFA for most trucks, 2,000 F CFA for sulfur, cement and clinker. Both parking yards generate a
steady revenue stream for their respective promoters, against minimal (and largely amortized, if any)
investment. In itself the parking fee is not abnormally high, but with the new border post, the rationale
for the parking yards will disappear, which may create resistance from the current beneficiaries of
the fee.
On the Niger side, most of the declarations are domestic transit to an internal destination in Niger,
and only goods for the Gaya area are cleared at the border. Some of the goods destined for the
Customs office close to the Nigerian border (Maradi or Zinder, for instance) are imported in Niger
and then re-exported to Nigeria. In the absence of information at declaration level for those offices,
estimating the actual volumes of transit to Nigeria falsely declared as transit to Niger is difficult.
With a predominance of transit at the border, crossing time should be limited. However, the escort
system, which also applies to Niger, create artificial queues and delays that could be suppressed. Until
the time there is an ICT connection between Customs in Benin and Customs in Niger, a phased
approach to simplified procedures could be adopted, which includes longer office operating hours,
and avoids batch transmission of documents from Customs to Customs.

Crossing delays at the land borders
The Abidjan Lagos Corridor Organization (ALCO) is monitoring border crossing delays as part of
the program indicators for the Abidjan Lagos Trade and Transport Facilitation Program (ALTTFP).

Not all borders are comparable. For instance, at Hilla Condji, the standard procedure is border
clearance, which implies valuation and verification of the declared value of the goods by the Customs
officers, and payment of the duties. At other borders, domestic transit regime only require verification
of the integrity of the seals and regular document check, before releasing the trucks for the rest of the
journey.
Traffic counts at the land borders
The busiest land border is Malanville, with an excess of 6,000 trucks crossing per month towards
Niger. The traffic in the opposite direction is negligible. The two other land borders at Seme Krake
and Hilla Condji are less active.

3.1.4 Transport costs and prices
Transport costs affect the price of goods imported by traders on two levels: (i) the financial cost of
logistics services (from gateway to final clearance) and (ii) the economic cost of delays and
uncertainties on delivery date (cost of excess inventory). Maritime gateway financial costs typically
include documentation fees paid to shipping agents and trade institutions (shipper’s councils, etc.),
handling, Customs declaration and freight forwarder’s fee. Land transport is typically trucking, or
rail/road intermodal combinations. It also includes documentation fees for crossing the inland border.
Inland destination financial costs include final clearance at destination and handling.
It is customary to include inventory costs in transport costs. However, in unpredictable environments
such as the one prevailing in West Africa, inventory costs do not take into consideration the impact
of uncertainties. The SSATP conducted an analysis of the total logistics costs (TLC) for selected
corridors in West and Central Africa in 2012. The sum of the two components is the total logistics
cost that were analyzed for typical goods traded in West and Central Africa. The tables below
compare the TLC for a 40’ container of household appliances without stripping in the port for the
first table, and for a shipment of bags of rice for the second. The land transport distances are similar
across the three corridors.

The Cotonou Niamey corridor is slightly lower than the Abidjan corridors, in terms of both gateway
prices and trucking prices. The time related component (inventory and impact of uncertainties) of the
TLC is higher, but this is because the survey for Cotonou was during transition out of PVI by Benin
Control, so delays were abnormally high compared to the other corridor. The current performance
would result in values for the time related component equivalent to the Abidjan corridors.

3.2 Modernizing customs to strengthen Benin’s regional competitiveness

3.2.1 The importance of customs modernization in Benin
Although customs modernization is essential for trade integration, it represents a considerable
challenge for Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries such as Benin. More than in other regions, the
adoption of the modern customs framework in Africa is hampered by factors such as insufficient
capacity and resources, poor infrastructure, frequent non-compliance with rules and pervasiveness of
informal trade, and serious governance issues. Moreover, trade taxes and other taxes collected by
customs (e.g. VAT) still represent a high share of revenue in most African countries. In Benin, they
accounted for around 53%% of the Government’s total tax revenue in 2012, 83% of which was
collected at the Port de Cotonou (PAC) (WCO 2013). This figure has remained stable in recent years,
placing Benin among the most dependent SSA countries for revenue collected by customs ( Figure
50). As a result of this dependency on trade taxes, customs administrations’ priorities are often more
influenced by political pressure to reach short-term revenue collection targets than by the objective
to modernize and facilitate trade. Reform efforts since the 1990s in SSA have yielded positive results
in some areas, although progress has been rather slow overall, especially concerning the most
advanced dimensions of customs modernization.

Benin occupies a central position in regional trade and transit. It is estimated that over 80% of all
goods entering the port of Cotonou are destined for final delivery outside of Benin, mainly for transit
and re-export to Nigeria and (to a lesser extent) to landlocked Niger and Burkina Faso. Trade with
Nigeria alone, informal or otherwise, is thought to represent around 20% of Benin’s GDP
(MacWilliam 2013). As highlighted in this DTIS Update, Cotonou’s place as a regional hub has to a
large extent been the consequence of the restrictiveness of Nigeria’s trade policy. High tariffs, import
bans and other barriers to trade in the region’s largest market have over the years encouraged massive
smuggling in this country of products imported through Benin but declared for home consumption or
transit to the hinterland. Benin has largely benefited from this activity in the form of income,
employment and fiscal revenue.

Planned changes to the status quo in the near future may affect Benin’s situation, making the customs
modernization agenda all the more critical. Although observers have long highlighted the artificial
and vulnerable nature of Benin’s position as a platform for trade with Nigeria, the adoption of the
ECOWAS Common External Tariff (CET) in October 2013 adds greater urgency to this warning.
Indeed, the implementation of the CET after 2015 implies that the rents derived from transit to Nigeria
could dramatically decrease in the near future, as arbitraging opportunities decrease. This would
result in a sharp drop in government revenue collected through customs, with adverse macroeconomic
consequences. In order to maintain its status as a regional trade hub, Benin will thus need to enhance
its real competitiveness as a trade and logistics platform. The strategic objective should be at the same
time to improve the transparency of exchanges between Benin and its neighbors, while
maintaining/developing trade volumes. Given the central place of customs in the logistics chain, this
necessity undeniably reinforces the relevance of the customs modernization agenda. As argued in this
chapter, it will notably require (i) moving forward with customs modernization, to the benefit of all
traders and of the Government, (ii) introducing measures to facilitate trade and strengthen the
attractiveness of Cotonou as a regional trade hub, such as an Authorized Economic Operator (AEO)
scheme, and (iii) facilitating and encouraging transit trade.

3.2.2 Current performances of customs in Benin
The available data shows a decrease of average cargo release time at the port of Cotonou since 2012,
including for customs clearance. The gradual improvement in performance is largely due to changes
in port procedures and operations. As a result, average container dwell time decreased from 28 days
in early 2012 to around 12 at the end of 2013, although it appears to have stagnated at this level since
the last quarter of 2012. Data from the port single window for container imports shows that most of
the improvement was achieved thanks to decreases in the average time taken by the two lengthiest
steps of the cargo release process, namely customs clearance and cargo loading/port exit (Figure
51).23 The main developments regarding port procedures and logistics have included:

  Unfortunately ASYCUDA, the automated customs management system used in Benin, does not allow computing
average dwell time because it does not register the exit date and time of goods. This information is recorded in the data
collected by the single window operator (SEGUB) used here, which however defines the customs clearance process as
the time between unloading and clearing of goods by customs. This is partly inaccurate, because declaration can be
submitted prior to physical arrival of cargo, which has contributed to streamlining the clearance process. Monitoring
average customs clearance time would be made easier if data were systematically exchanged between customs and
SEGUB, which is presently not the case.

inspect the goods. The majority of such shipments does not undergo inspection and is released
immediately. Advance declaration however has still affected a small minority of shipments in recent
years, accounting for around 2% of imported containers in 2012.
Payment of duties and taxes: the consolidation of the charges due in a single electronic invoice
through the Single Window and automatic notification of payment by the bank to Customs has
expedited this step of the process for import declarations at the port.
Port access and parking: trucks can now only enter the port when they are called to pick up/drop
containers from a well-organized parking lot outside the port. This system reduces access time and
congestion in the port area. More than the clearance procedure itself, delays for imports at the port
seem to be caused by the time taken for customs declarations to be registered after cargo arrival.
Based on a sample of around 45,000 containers imported at the port of Cotonou between mid-2011
and end-2012 for which customs and SEGUB data could be matched, the average customs clearance
time was around one day.24

However, a majority of declarations are only registered several days after cargo arrival at the port. A
significant number of declarations are only registered several weeks after arrival (with four imported
containers taking as long as 335 days to be declared to customs), delaying by as much the exit of
goods from the port. This could be explained by delays to obtain the necessary documents, or
practices by clearing and forwarding agents. The reasons for these delays should be further
investigated and incentives to reduce them should be introduced, which could significantly reduce
dwell time at the port.
Put in a regional perspective, the available indicators suggest that the overall performances of
Beninese customs are not particularly poor, but that there is room for improvement. Several public
sources of data on the environment for trade and customs can be used to benchmark Benin against
other West African countries, including the World Bank’s Doing Business and Logistics Performance
Indicator (LPI), as well as the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index (GCI). The
country’s ranking on these different indices show that its performances are intermediate to good
compared to other West African coastal countries with which it competes for the role of regional
trade hub, but are in all cases low on a global scale (Table 11).26

In terms of Doing Business, Benin appears to be in an intermediate position compared to other coastal
West African countries regarding the time, cost and number of documents required to export and
import goods (Table 12). While not all these transaction costs can be attributed to customs, this gives
a useful indication of Benin’s competitiveness in the region.27 In particular, Senegal (the best regional
performer) and Ghana do significantly better than Benin on most indicators. However, data for
previous years show that the time and number of documents required to trade in Benin have decreased
since 2005, though the cost to do so increased (Figure 53).

3.2.3 Main strengths and weaknesses of Beninese customs
An in-depth assessment of customs was recently undertaken in Benin, providing detailed insights into
the administration’s strengths and weaknesses. The Direction Générale des Douanes et des Droits
Indirects (DGDDI) employed a staff of 963 in 2012 and the administration operates 32 customs posts,
the largest being PAC’s (WCO 2013, WTO 2010). At the request of the Government, the World Bank
collected in mid-2013 comprehensive data on the processes and performances of the DGDDI,
following the Customs Assessment Trade Toolkit (CATT) methodology.28 This marked the first time
this tool, which was developed in Latin America, was applied in an African country. In Benin, a team
of local customs stakeholders and international experts worked together to collect and verify data for
120 high-level indicators, corresponding to as many good practices in a wide range of areas. In each
case, supporting evidence (e.g. regulatory document, activity statistics) was also collected to ensure
the objectivity of results. Evaluation sites covered by the project included the port and airport in
Cotonou, as well as Kraké at the border with Nigeria.
The results of this evaluation show that Beninese customs must be strengthened in several key areas
to get closer to best practices. While the scores are relatively low in most of the dimensions measured
by the CATT, this is especially the case for some critical dimensions, such as control (ability to
enforce compliance with customs law and assess risk through improved methods of control) and
strategic thinking (capacity to develop a vision for the modernization of operations and define core
improvement strategies). The evaluating team noted some strengths (e.g. good control over the
primary customs area at the port and airport; dedicated and trained personnel; introduction of pre-
arrival declaration at the port), but it also identified serious weaknesses, including:
o Excessive decentralization and autonomy of regional offices and of the customs brigade, which
  hampers the flow of information and central use of intelligence;
o Limited monitoring of the efficiency of surveillance and control activities and deficient
  consolidation of data at the central level, limiting the capacity to establish and update risk
  profiles;
o Irregular and incomplete exchanges of data between customs and the port single window;
o General under-utilization of ASYCUDA (recording of activities, but not of outcomes);
o Inadequate use of ASYCUDA’s selectivity module on the ground;
o Absence of a dedicated zone for inspection with surveillance equipment such as cameras at the
  airport and land border;
o Limited control of cargo crossing land borders (e.g. Kraké);
o Need for training on specific functions (e.g. audit);
o Limited options for, and monitoring of, administrative and judiciary processes;
o Insufficient internal and external publication of information about rules and procedures.


28
   CATT assessments gather objectively-verifiable data on customs processes and performances, and benchmark them
against internationally-recognized good practices promoted by organizations such as the WCO, the WTO, the World
Bank and the International Chamber of Commerce. This exercise provides a summary of a customs administration’s
strengths and weaknesses along seven key dimensions (process orientation, strategic thinking, control, efficiency,
effectiveness, facilitation, transparency), which are aggregated in two indices measuring the administration’s (i) practices
and (ii) performances. One distinctive feature of the methodology is that it allows for comparability across countries
(irrespective of the size of the administration) and over time (for more information, see: http://www.customscatt.org).
The publication of a CATT’s detailed results is subject to approval by the authorities of the coun try and only a summary
of the outcome is presented here.

                                                            59
In addition to its operational performances, the customs administration should increase its data
collection and monitoring capacity. For instance, one issue repeatedly encountered during the CATT
evaluation was the impossibility to assign a score to several indicators, due to the absence of
documentary evidence or monitoring of the related practice by the administration. This is an issue in
itself, as it is a sign of the administration’s limited capacity to get a comprehensive view of its
activities and performances. Serious gaps also persist in customs data collection, despite the
automation of operations (for instance, data obtained for the DTIS update showed no transit
transaction to Nigeria in 2012). As explained above, a large share of goods re-exported to Nigeria are
declared for home consumption in Benin. Clearly, the issue here is not just technical, and political
commitment is needed to improve the transparency of Benin’s trade through more accurate recording
of trade transactions.
Beside formal rules and procedures, the governance environment around customs remains
problematic in Benin. In the absence of sufficient incentives to comply and limited risk of sanctions,
fraud by declarants and corruption within customs are rife. Undervaluation and/or misdeclaration of
the import regime (e.g. home consumption vs. transit) by large scale actors, often with the complicity
of customs officials, are still frequently used to avoid full payment of duties and taxes due and
facilitate smuggling to Nigeria. This has justified the resorting to pre-shipment inspection, with
limited results (see below). There are also indications that bans or restrictions on imports from
neighboring Togo are used to preserve monopoly positions for Beninese actors involved in smuggling
to Nigeria. Finally, the operation of non-qualified agents as customs brokers has been reported.
Although not directly under the control of the administration, this phenomenon negatively affect
customs performance and should be tackled. In addition to better procedures and trade facilitation
measures, finally customs modernization will thus also require measures to increase compliance, curb
corruption and improve professionalism.

3.2.4 Benin’s Customs modernization efforts
The Government of Benin is committed to the objective of port and customs modernization.
Following the global trend towards customs modernization since the 1990s, most countries in SSA
have attempted to reform their customs administration. Benin has been part of this movement with
support from development partners,29 and participates in the international customs framework.30 The
objective to improve the administrative and regulatory environment for traders is mentioned in recent
strategic documents adopted by the Government (Growth Strategies for Poverty Reduction 2007-
2009 and 2011-2015, Strategic Development Orientations 2006-2011, etc.). Trade facilitation was
identified as a priority area in the first DTIS, which formulated recommendations endorsed by the
Government in 2006. The main challenges affecting customs and port operations identified in the
DTIS included:



29
   The Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) of the IMF has carried out 7 TA missions on customs in Benin since 2000. The
World Bank and cooperation agencies from Canada, France and the United States also carried out several customs
assistance projects in Benin in the 2000s (Montagnat Rentier and Parent (2012).
30
   Benin is a member of both the WTO and WCO and a contracting party to the HS Convention. Moreover, Benin applies
the WTO’s Agreement on Customs Valuation since 2003, signed the Revised Arusha Declaration, and declared its
intention to implement the provisions of the WCO’s SAFE Framework. However, Benin has so far not signed the Revised
Kyoto Convention.

                                                        60
o Costs/delays and quality of services at the PAC: limited competition in cargo handling,
  unnecessarily complex rules and procedures, limited automation of operations, high and
  numerous official and unofficial fees, etc.;
o Customs performances: complex procedures, incomplete automation and modernization of data
  entry and payment methods, deficient application of transactional valuation, absence of a single
  window in practice, high frequency of controls and lack of risk management practices, low
  integrity and opacity of operations, impunity for large smuggling networks, etc.
o Transit and re-export trade: redundant controls and costly escort procedure;
o Dependence on trade taxes and prevalence of duty exemptions.
Some reforms have effectively been carried out over the last decade, with noticeable progress in the
port of Cotonou. A revision of the 1966 Customs Code was launched in 2008 and the new code is
expected to be adopted by the Parliament in mid-2014. The DGDDI established a first strategic plan
for the period 2008-2010, but implementation was hampered by the lack of formal action plan to
strengthen customs essential functions. Positive operational measures were nevertheless taken,
notably to (i) improve clearance procedures through better use of ASYCUDA++, (ii) create a basic
risk analysis function for control selectivity, and (iii) centralize customs unit on a single server. In
2010, Benin implemented an electronic document (EDI) system, which improved customs clearance
time. The following year, an electronic single window was launched at the Port of Cotonou ( Box 1).
While the above represents welcome progress and has helped improve customs performances, these
measures often remain incomplete. Some functionalities of ASYCUDA++ (e.g. monitoring of transit
cargo) are not used. Likewise, recent technical assistance missions have shown that certain important
functions are at a very preliminary stage (e.g. post-clearance audits) or inadequately implemented.
For instance, there is insufficient capacity to update the criteria and weighing used for control
selectivity, based on rigorous risk analysis.


        Box 1: The electronic single window at the port of Cotonou and its link with customs
 The introduction of a single window at the port represented an important step forward for trade facilitation
 in Benin. With strong backing from the Government, the port single window (PSW) was developed by the
 inspection company BIVAC (subsidiary of Bureau Veritas) in partnership with SOGET, a firm specialized
 in port community systems. It was rolled out in 2011 and is managed by a public-private concession
 company, SEGUB (Société d’Exploitation du Guichet Unique du Benin), with around 20 staff members.
 The online system is designed to connect on a centralized platform all stakeholders involved in trade
 operations, both private (importers, exporters, customs brokers, freight forwarders, transporters, banks, etc.)
 and public (customs, port authority, ministries and government agencies, etc.). These actors can use the
 single window to provide and access the required information and documents, make decisions and pay all
 duties/fees, expediting, securing and improving the transparency of trade-related processes. Along with
 other procedural changes, the PSW is deemed to have contributed to a significant decrease of dwell time in
 the port. In May 2013, the International Association of Ports and Harbors (IAPH) awarded Benin a prize
 for having facilitated trade through the single window.
 The single window has implications for customs and it is important to guarantee full compatibility between
 the two systems. The interface for data exchange between the PSW and customs’ ASYCUDA is still
 limited. Audit missions noted that the fact that some functionalities were not supported by the single
 window or worked differently than in ASYCUDA has had a negative impact on certain customs procedures.
 This can hamper customs performances and will have to be addressed.

The most recent reform initiatives have been less successful and delayed needed structural reforms.
In March 2011, the Government contracted the local firm for a “new generation” PSI program, which
aimed at improving revenue collection, intensifying the fight against illegal trade, and facilitating
customs clearance. This program, which was not well accepted by the customs administration,
included several components in addition to traditional PSI services (e.g. valuation of imported goods
and certification of weight; scanning of cargo; GPS tracking of goods in transit; support for automated
management of warehouses, clearance areas and container terminals). However, its implementation
had major difficulties in practice. In particular, in the absence of a solid risk management system,
scanning of all containers at the port led to high fees for importers and severe disruption of traffic.
This undermined the competitiveness of the PAC vis-à-vis other ports in the region and resulted in
decreasing imports and revenue for the State, as well as social discontent due to increased prices for
imported consumption goods (IMF 2013). The program was thus discontinued in May 2012. Coupled
with improvements in port procedures (MacWilliam 2013), this triggered a marked decrease in port
dwell time, as well as a recovery of import volume and revenue collection.
Major challenges still face Beninese customs, and modernization will require a comprehensive
approach to reforms. So far, reforms in Benin have concerned the implementation of useful
operational tools, but they have hardly addressed the improvement of essential customs functions,
most of which remain deficient. As discussed above, key weaknesses include: (i) limited capacity for
operational functions of modern customs (e.g. valuation, risk analysis and control, post-control audit);
(ii) lack of central control over customs offices, and diverging performances of office at the port and
at land borders; (iii) limited capacity to monitor activities and use consolidated information; (iv) lack
of transparency and poor internal and external dissemination of information; (v) serious governance
issues within and outside customs. Reform efforts to date were undertaken on a discrete basis rather
than as part of a comprehensive and long-term modernization program, aiming at the structural
transformation of the way customs work. Moreover, reforms need to tackle not only challenges
internal to customs, but also issues in the broader customs environment, including non-compliance
and lack of skills by private partners of custom. Such as comprehensive strategy is required to
sustainably improve the performances of the customs and port administrations in Benin and to enable
the country to play its role as a regional trade hub.

3.2.5 Moving forward with customs modernization
More efforts are required to fully integrate customs as an element of Benin’s regional
competitiveness. As argued in this chapter, Beninese customs are operating relatively efficiently
compared to regional standards, making Benin’s claim to the status of regional logistics hub credible.
However, the competition is high along the coast, as other countries’ modernize their customs
administration (e.g. Single Windows, AEO, geo-tracking of transit cargo piloted in Ghana, Cote
d’Ivoire). Moreover, the efficiency of Beninese customs and capacity to perform customs essential
functions while facilitating legitimate trade is still undermined by serious inefficiencies. The
authorities are aware of these challenges and committed to reform. This section thus outlines some
considerations that should guide the implementation of the authorities’ reform program. The Action
Matrix featured in this report also contains recommendations for policy actions related to customs,
based on the conclusions of this chapter.
Beninese customs must maintain their reform momentum. Initial progress on several important
aspects of customs operations, such as automation and risk analysis, represent a welcome step and

                                                   62
should continue. The improvement of clearance performances after the cancellation of the “new PSI”
program in 2011-2012 is a positive development and the administration can capitalize on the
existence of a dedicated staff to continue this trend. Finally, the introduction of the single window at
the port of Cotonou paves the way for a better exchange of data with customs, which would facilitate
trade. Further efforts are now required to upgrade to a modern customs system and improve the trade
environment in Benin. The Government, which considered at a time a second PSI program with
another contractor, decided in July 2013 to adopt a new reform strategy for the period 2013-2016
(IMF 2013). A key feature of this ambitious strategy is the strengthening of customs capacity to
perform its essential functions ( Box 2).


                         Box 2: The Beninese customs reform strategy (2013-2016)
 The Government’s new reform strategy focuses on customs capacity building. The experience in Benin and
 elsewhere has shown that excessive reliance on private operators to compensate for the limited capacity of
 customs administration has not been a durable strategy to improve customs performances and revenue
 collection. The new strategy therefore aims at developing the customs administration’s own capacity, with
 a view to facilitating trade while guaranteeing revenue collection levels.
 The strategy covers the essential dimensions of customs performances. As presented by the Government,
 the new strategy has a threefold objective: (i) reinforcing the capacities of customs administration to fulfill
 its key functions; (ii) enhancing customs efficiency by equipping the administration with modern and
 effective-performance tools, including through capacity-building assistance from private operators for a
 limited period of time, and (iii) improving the mobilization of customs revenue. Capacity building efforts
 will be centered on five key customs functions, namely risk management, customs valuation, pre-clearance
 inspection, post-clearance inspection and customs regime control (e.g. customs exemptions, transit).
 Most components included in the previous program considered by the authorities will be maintained in the
 new strategy. This notably includes the use of scanners, verification of weight and GPS tracking system for
 transit goods. Regarding valuation, the PSI approach is intended to be replaced by a customs valuation
 certification program (Programme de Certification des Valeurs - PCV), which will include a temporary
 contract to assist the administration in certifying value for a list of products representing the majority of
 imports released for local consumption in the short term.31 In the medium term, it will aim at building the
 customs administration’s capacity to perform customs valuation itself. Finally, the strategy seeks to ensure
 optimal linkage of customs with the port single window. The first measures to be taken include the
 preparation of contracts for the scanning and valuation components, as well as the establishment of a risk
 analysis system and monitoring of inspection results. A convention with UNCTAD is also being prepared
 to introduce ASYCUDA World.

The authorities’ customs reform program is broad and will have to be supported by adequate technical
support to succeed. The Beninese customs administration has recently benefited from several national
and regional technical assistance initiatives by development partners, including the World Bank, the
IMF and the EU. In the context of the DTIS Update and at the request of the authorities, a mission
was organized in Cotonou in January 2014 to take stock of the remaining needs and identify assistance
priorities to implement the different aspects of the reform program and action plan in the short and

  Certain basic products (e.g. textile, vegetable oil, rice) destined for local consumption would still be submitted to a
special regime for valuation, based on predetermined and periodically adjusted reference prices.

actions and request support from the most appropriate international and national institutions. Ongoing
technical assistance and remaining needs for the different activities identified by the administration
so far notably include:
o Acquisition of technical tools, including scanners, weighbridges and a geo-tracking system.
  Technical assistance is provided by the WCO, and the Government recently requested the
  preparation of a call for tender to select a private company for the acquisition and exploitation
  of scanners at the port and airport of Cotonou.32 The National Directorate of Public Procurement
  Control (DNCMP) should provide training on the preparation of call for tender documents and
  on procurement procedures;
o Optimization of ICT, including improving ASYCUDA use and preparing the migration to the
  World version, developing the interconnection with the single window, and establishing a
  functioning intranet. UNCTAD could provide support to develop certain important functions
  which are currently underused (e.g. transit module, unpaid customs declarations, uncleared
  manifests, management of warehouses and clearing areas). The medium term objective should
  be to move towards paperless customs procedures.
o Risk management, e.g. improve risk management, strengthen the collection and use of
  intelligence, and introduce a central database on infractions. Capacity building is provided by a
  private company since the end of 2013 in the context of the World Bank’s Abidjan-Lagos Trade
  and Transport Facilitation Project and by the IMF’s West AFRITAC. The WCO could provide
  further training to implement its tools.
o Pre-clearance inspection, including training in reading and interpreting X-ray images to be
  included in the call for tender document for the scanners, while the Ministry of Transport can
  provide assistance for weighbridges. Improved risk management should also facilitate the
  segmentation of traders and introduction of a formal Authorized Economic Operator (AEO), a
  key to improve the attractiveness of Cotonou as a regional logistic hub. As in Cameroon, AEO
  status could be used as an incentive for compliance and linked to performance contracts signed
  with economic operators.
o Post-clearance audit (PCA), including the elaboration of a procedure manual for desk and on-
  site audits and to improve agents’ capacity to carry out on-site audits.
o Customs regime control, to ensure that exemption and special regimes are used transparently
  and for their intended purposes, and thus do not unduly erode Benin’s duty and tax base.
  Technical assistance will be necessary to improve the management of these regimes through
  ASYCUDA (e.g. transit module).
o Monitoring of activity and performance targets, including the adoption of objective result
  indicators and timely collection of related data to evaluate the impact of reforms.33 An initiative
  aimed at strengthening internal reporting at customs has been prepared under the Abidjan-Lagos
  corridor project, and a technical assistance protocol was signed at the end of 2013 with the
  Cameroonian customs administration, considered a leader in Africa for performance
  measurement.
o Transparency and access to information: The World Bank is providing support to develop
  regional trade information web-portals (TIWs) in the context of the WAEMU’s Regional Trade
  Facilitation Program.

  In this regard, conducting a second CATT at the end of the reform program period, and using the first assessment as a
baseline, could give the administration a sense of the progress achieved.

o Implementation of the modernization program: The modernization program underway will
  require simultaneous actions on several fronts, with appropriate sequencing and coordination.
  Customs has requested TA from the World Bank. One important condition will be to ensure that
  staff involved in the management of the reform are not reassigned to other positions before
  completion.
Finally, it will be important to insert customs reform in the broader context of (i) border management
modernization, and (ii) regional trade and transit instruments. Beside customs, many ministries and
agencies are involved in border management (e.g. immigration, transport, sanitary and phytosanitary,
standards, police). Full automation and the use of risk management by customs matter little if manual
treatment of paperwork and systematic physical inspection are still imposed by other agencies. These
actors should be included in modernization program, possibly building on the Port Single Window.
More generally, modernizing Customs should be carried out in conjunction with Benin’s compliance
with its various commitments under the WTO Agreement on Trade Facilitation in Bali in December
2013 (including availability of information, coordination of border agencies, transparency, freedom
of transit, etc.). This assumes in particular that the WTO will be notified on Benin’s catego rization
of measures (measures that can be implemented immediately, that require a delay and those that
require technical assistance).
As a member of ECOWAS and WAEMU, Benin must also comply with regulations regarding
procedures. Diagnostics have revealed major implementation gaps. Important issues remain in
valuation and the imposition of arbitrary “transit fees” on cargo crossing the country on the Abidjan-
Lagos corridor, amounting to several thousands of dollars per truck.34

3.2.6 Looking ahead
Benin has clear potential for efficient logistics, but several problems need fixing. From a transport
and logistics standpoint, Benin is betting its future on transit to neighboring countries. There are
clearly two different types of neighboring countries:
o Nigeria, with activity that thrives for all the wrong reasons and is not sustainable in the long
  term. The relationship with Nigeria has to be managed to plan for the future. The management
  of the common Sémé-Kraké could be an entry point for this dialogue involving Customs, law
  enforcement and trucking operators from both countries to define more effective border
  crossing procedures.
o Niger, even if a large portion of the transit to Niger is actually disguised transit to Northern
  Nigeria, imported by Niger but then re-exported.35 Putting aside policy-induced distortions,
  there could be sound logistics justification to adopt this route to serve northern Nigeria.
To serve these neighbors’ needs, Benin benefits from good quality facilities: the port has recently
been extended, the container facilities are adequate and managed by competent operators, the
interface between the port and the trucking services has been improved, the railway is going to be

34
   The imposition of such fees likely runs afoul of GATT Article 5 on Freedom of Transit, which states that traffic in
transit should be exempt from duties and charges not “commensurate with administrative expenses entailed by transit or
with the cost of services rendered”. It is also incompatible with Article 45 of the ECOWAS Treaty, according to which
“transit shall not be subject to any discrimination, quantitative restrictions, duties or other charges ”, except “charges
usually made for carriage and for any services which may be rendered, provided such charges are not discriminatory and
are inconformity with international transit regulations.”

   See Treichel (2010), notably Chapter 6.

                                                           65
extended to Niamey and managed by a competent operator. However, the extension of the port alone
is not a sufficient guarantee that Cotonou will attract a large market share for the transit to the
landlocked countries, considering the other capacity development already underway or planned in the
neighborhood and that the promoters of the possible competitors to Benin are the very ones involved
in Benin. The future of the corridor will largely depend on the regional strategies that global operators
will pursue.
In order to position itself as a credible logistics hub, Benin should:
1. Reform Customs procedures. As highlighted above, the documentation process needs to be
   reviewed to reduce the reliance on paper and take full advantage of ICT. Better support to
   selected traders must be developed, starting with the introduction of risk management, the
   development of ‘green channels’ for compliant operators to establish an authorized economic
   operator (AEO) type of scheme.
2. Fix the trucking industry. In its present condition, the trucking industry in Benin is more of a
   handicap that a facilitator, but reforming the industry to transform it into a professional one is a
   long process. The model currently being implemented for a similar reform for Côte d’Ivoire and
   Burkina Faso, under the World Bank-supported regional program to develop a transit corridor
   between Abidjan and Ouagadougou, will provide the blueprint for Benin. The ongoing survey
   will provide additional information on the exact status of the industry and can constitute the
   starting point to define an action plan for the reform. An important factor will be the extension
   of the railway to Niamey, which is likely to shake up operators and force them to adapt,
   providing the necessary incentive for the reform.
3. Improve the policy environment’s predictability. Many recent decisions were made without
   sufficient preparation or consultations (e.g. Benin Controle, the railway concession, truck traffic
   management at the port). Investors and operators dislike uncertainty and dialogue and clarity
   need to be established.
4. End predatory practices. Several abnormal practices in Benin are of a predatory nature,
   including the ad valorem levy on transit goods, which is contrary to WTO rules, the escort
   requirement (which should be addressed as part of the Customs reform) and the itching but not
   vital issue of roadblocks (decisions were made to limit the number but not yet implemented).

Services contribute to 54% of Benin’s GDP (Figure 56). While this contribution is slightly above the
average for low-income countries (49%) and for the region, it remains well below the world average
(70%) and levels reached in high-income countries (74%). Thus, the services sector still has major
growth potential for Benin.
With an average 4% annual growth between 2004 and 2010, Benin appears as an underperformer and
does not fully tap into its services sector’s growth potential. In the region, only Guinea systematically
performed worse than Benin over the period. With a growth rate of 3.2% in 2010, the services sector
grew half as fast in Benin as in countries like Sierra Leone, Mozambique, Nepal or Bangladesh. On
average, the same year, the services sector grew by 6.8% in low-income countries and 5.2% in Africa.

4.1.2 Services trade performance
In 2010, trade in services represented only 13.6% of GDP in Benin (Figure 58). While this
performance reflects the average for low-income countries (14.7%), it remains well below the best
performers in the region. These numbers suggest that services in Benin are mainly provided by
domestic suppliers for the domestic market.

Over the past decade, the Benin deficit in services trade increased steadily to reach a record US$ 284
million in 2009, before falling back to US$ 259 million in 2012. This is more than three times the
deficit observed at the beginning of the period (US$ 81 million in 2003), and is largely due to a surge
in imports (mainly in transport, which mirrors the value of trade in goods) that increased three-fold
over the period compared to only two-fold for exports (Figure 59).

Business and communication services represent 15 and 10% of the country’s exports respectively
(Figure 60). The picture is quite similar on the imports side, where transportation and travel represent
71% of total services imports and business and communication services account for 11 and 6% of
total services imports respectively. It should be noted, however, that the share of transportation
services is twice as important on the import side as on the export side, and that the sectoral
concentration of exports is much higher than for imports. Four sectors represent 97% of total services
exports in the country. In other words, there is still a need for diversification of Benin services exports.

had a significant trade surplus
in only one sector: travel (US$ 92 million). In all other sectors, trade remained balanced. While trade
in educational services remains marginal, it is an interesting case of intra-regional trade.
Untapped opportunities for travel and tourism in Benin
Benin has made GATS commitments in the travel and tourism sector that is largely open to
competition. A number of projects are currently underway in the country, including the ambitious
“route des pêches”, and the cultural scene is vibrant. As such, the sector is one of opportunit y for
Benin if the conditions for sustainable development are met.
About 500,000 passengers transit through Cotonou airport each year. The air travel sector is largely
open to competition with 20 companies operating in the country, only one of which is Beninese.
Foreign companies benefit from tax exemptions that facilitate their operations. The destinations and
origins of the flights from and to Cotonou suggest that Benin plays the role of a hub for the region:
Europe represents only 26% of the flights, compared to 39% for Central Africa and 24% for West
Africa (Figure 62). France remains the main destination, followed by Congo-Brazzaville, Gabon, and
Cameroon. This importance of passenger traffic contrasts with the poor development of freight traffic.
The state-owned airport is being upgraded, although some facilities remain in poor condition. Some
regulatory issues are still outstanding and the Beninese aviation code should be revised, among others
to include relevant regional regulations and directives. Security rules and controls could also be
improved.

                                                                               26%
relative to its potential and neighboring countries: Benin
is the fifth tourist destination in West Africa, well Source: Air France, 2013
behind Senegal, Burkina Faso, Ghana and Nigeria. Its
tourism arrivals and revenues have stagnated over the past decade with an average annual visitor
growth of only 2% compared to an average 15% growth for its neighbors; the total contribution of
tourism to the GDP stagnates at 6.5%, lagging 1.5 percentage points behind its neighbors and 7.5
points behind global averages and the sector contributes 5.6% of total employment, which is 1.4
points less than its neighbors and 8.3 points below the global average. In other words, unrealized
annual GDP gains range between US$ 113 and US$ 567 million and unrealized employment between
28,000 and 165,000 jobs.
The Government of Benin has recognized this potential and tourism has become one of the country’s
top-five priority sectors. It could indeed potentially become an important source of services exports,
as it is already the second largest sector in the country in terms of formal companies, the third largest
employer, and the second largest source of foreign exchange earnings. The most ambitious project
that was launched this year is the development of the “route des pêches” that should include several
zones along the coast (35 kilometers between Cotonou and Ouidah) dedicated to beach tourism,
ecotourism, and cultural tourism; the road would give access to beaches, sport and cultural
infrastructure, hotels (5,000 rooms) and commercial centers. This project could also have significant
spillover effects for the local economy: for instance, ADEOTI (a local engineering and construction
services firm) has been selected to do the first kilometers of road; a total 20,000 jobs should be
created: local communities (fishermen, villages) should be implicated in the project. Total investment
is planned to reach CFA 300 billion. The project also includes a plan for electrification and
reinforcement of security, in addition to the road infrastructure. There are also a number of concerns
that have been raised with regard the project, and wider consultation should take place to ensure
sustainability and transparency, as well as properly leverage its potential effects on the environment
and poverty alleviation.
Benin has a number of tourist and cultural attractions. Recently, the Zinsou Foundation opened the
first contemporary art museum in Sub-Saharan Africa that adds to the historical landmarks of Ouidah,
including the slave route and historical museums. Additional cultural projects in the city include
centers for the study of Voodoo and slave trade. Benin also has important national parks with wildlife
in the North of country, however access is difficult. The city of Abomey and the village of Ganvié
represent more landmarks. The country is yet to capitalize on the growing Nigerian market (with an
estimated middle-class of 40-50 million people), in particular in areas with the greatest potential:
meetings, conventions, incentives and events (MICE); business trip leisure add-ons and retreats; and
weekend middle class family leisure, shopping, and culture.

                                                   70
A number of obstacles remain. The bad quality of infrastructure, in particular, affects the country’s
immediate prospects for tourism development: the absence of domestic flights and the poor quality
of roads make access to tourist sites difficult; hotels remain of insufficient quality; access to water,
electricity and telecommunications is unsatisfactory. Skills development and marketing are the most
critical areas required for upgrading. Some other regulatory constraints remain, such as the high level
of taxes, the absence of visa procedures at the border, or cumbersome procedures for border crossing
and cross-border car permits. The question of environmental sustainability also remains open. With
a great potential for tourism, Benin will need to find the right balance between ambitious
developments and respect for its environment and communities. According to the World Bank,
destination-level investments in i) infrastructure, utilities and basic services, ii) sites/attraction
upgrades, and iii: local economic development to increase value chain linkages could be
geographically clustered, building upon Benin’s unique, endogenous natural and cultural assets along
the 2-3 tourism growth hubs of Ouidah, Natitingou and coastal areas.


Trade in educational services
Benin runs a small trade deficit in educational services (US$ 2.7 million in 2010). About 5% of
Beninese students study abroad. These statistics do not fully cover trade in educational services,
however. A number of initiatives have led to the establishment of Beninese institutions abroad. Trade
in educational services is vibrant in the West Africa region, and plays an important role beyond
economics by contributing to the movement of young people and intercultural exchanges. It also
helps increase the supply and quality of educational services in Benin. The trade potential of
educational services trade should therefore not be neglected.

Statistics on foreign direct investment (FDI) reveal the lack of attractiveness of Benin for foreign
investors. In the services sector, FDI helps measure trade under Mode 3 (establishment abroad). In
2007, FDI net inflows reached a record US$ 140 million (Figure 64), although this represented a mere

2.5% of Benin’s GDP. This level of investment is extremely low compared to other low-income
countries, including in the region (Figure 65). Over the same period, Benin also experienced a few
years of disinvestment with negative net FDI inflows in 2005, 2006 and 2009. Available information
is not detailed enough to determine the share of services in these investment flows.

With regard to trade under Mode 4 of the GATS (temporary movement of service providers across
borders), the low level of personal remittances in Benin suggests that services exports under this
mode remain limited (Figure 66). As a percentage of GDP, remittances are four times more important
in countries like Nigeria or Senegal.

4.2 The state of services trade integration in Benin

4.2.1 Openness and multilateral commitments
Benin has made limited commitments to the GATS that cover only four sectors: Business services
(conference centers only); financial services (banking only); tourism and travel-related services
(hotels and catering only); and transport services (maritime only). Thus, important sectors of the
economy, such as telecommunications or most business and transport services are not covered by
multilateral disciplines.

                                                             An overview of applied regimes in
selected services sectors of importance to the Beninese economy suggests that most services sectors
are still heavily and/or poorly regulated and subject to monopolistic rights. Examples include
professional services – nationality requirements (extended to ECOWAS citizens in the texts, though
not always in practice); postal services – monopoly (though express carriers operate);
telecommunication services – monopoly for key segments of the market (such as international
communications and Internet traffic, ban of VoIP); and transport – nationality requirements for road
transports (sometimes extended to ECOWAS citizens). Some sectors have been more widely open to
competition, such as financial services, air and maritime transport services (with remaining quotas
that the country cannot fill), and the tourism sector. Openness did not remedy legal insecurity,
however, and the implementation of rights remains problematic.
The above suggests that there is a strong correlation between international commitments and
openness in Benin. It is even more important, furthermore, to make international commitments in a
country like Benin where legal insecurity prevails. The objective is to increase the security and
predictability of transactions and to encourage both trade and investment to take place. Benin should
therefore continue to actively participate in multilateral and regional trade negotiations to promote
and lock in reforms necessary to improve the availability and quality of services provided in the
country. Benin is not covered by the World Bank Services Trade Restrictions Database. There is a
need for a more comprehensive regulatory diagnostic of the services sectors in Benin that would

                                                                     73
increase understanding of applied regimes and boost the level of openness of services sectors to both
domestic and foreign competition. This is the first step for Benin to be able to actively participate to
multilateral (or regional) trade negotiations and define its offensive and defensive interests in the
services sector.
The Government of Benin had established a Working Group on Services with representatives of
different ministries and agencies in charge of selected services sectors. This group used to meet once
a year and discuss the principal orientations of the country’s services trade strategy, in particular in
the context of the EPA negotiations. Studies were produced on the services export potential of Benin
and the optimization of its participation in the GATS and EPA negotiations. Due to budgetary
constraints, however, the group stopped meeting in 2013 and the work remains in progress. Benin
could benefit from technical assistance to remedy this situation, for instance along the lines of the
work done by ILEAP in Guinea, (with GIZ financial support) focusing on three aspects:
o A regulatory diagnostic that would assess the adequacy of the regulatory framework in place
  (including the institutional framework), as well as the country’s openness to foreign investment;
o A competition diagnostic that would assess the level of competition reached on the domestic
  market and Benin’s performance with regard to the objectives of widening access and
  quality/availability of backbone services and other services inputs necessary to the smooth
  functioning of the economy;
o A negotiation strategy that would include the definition of offensive and defensive interests on
  the basis of the country’s strengths and weaknesses, as well as global or regional markets
  opportunities and risks.
Saez (2010) provides examples of regulatory audits and related technical assistance, as well as
techniques for the formulation of requests and offers in trade negotiations. In the case of Benin, the
difficulty resides in the lack of regulatory transparency or, rather, the gap between de jure and de
facto regimes. Application decrees are sometime missing, and the status of implementation of some
laws is often unclear. Practice can differ from legal texts and change regularly, affecting the security
and predictability of transactions. A supplementary competition diagnostic is therefore necessary to
assess the reality of business operation and test the contestability of the markets.

4.2.2 North-South integration
There is no data available on the respective shares of Benin’s major trading partners in the services
sector. However, considering that services trade in Benin is largely related to trade in goods (see
above, share of transportation services in total services trade), and that most services trade nowadays
takes place through the provision of intermediary services (i.e. services that are often embedded in
manufactured goods), the destination and origin of traded goods could provide a good insight into
Benin’s major trading partners in services trade. It should also be noted that the prevalence of Nigeria
is probably underestimated, considering that two-thirds of total trade in Benin is informal and largely
dependent on traffic with Nigeria. Again, no data exists on informal trade in the services sector, but
it is likely to mirror existing informal trade in the goods sector.
Based on this information and available data on travel that represents 43% of exports and 11% of
imports (air transport traffic by geographical destination and origin, with Europe representing 26%
of total traffic and West and Central Africa 63%), one could estimate that the numbers in Table 13
below slightly underestimate the share of the European Union and West and Central Africa and

                                                  74
overestimate the share of the BRICs in both Benin services exports and imports. In other words,
Benin remains largely dependent on Europe for its services imports (probably half of the country’s
total imports originate from Europe), but West and Central Africa remain the main destination for its
services exports (probably around 60%). This imbalance might explain the dynamics of regional trade
negotiations with the European Union and the feeling that Benin has mainly defensive interests and
therefore limited incentives in negotiating an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA).

 Source: WTO Statistics Database, 2014                As part of the GATS negotiations
                                                      (European Commission, 2002), the EU
suggested that Benin undertake or improve its commitments in the following sectors:
o Business services – the EU suggested that Benin take full commitments in Modes 1, 2 and 3 for
  computer and related services (CPC 84), management consulting services (CPC 865) and
  services related to management consulting (CPC 866);
o Telecommunication services – the EU suggested opening a number of sub-sectors to full
  competition, particularly data-transmission related services which provide the key infrastructure
  that benefits the rest of the economy; to allow competition for voice services, and mobile
  services in particular; to commit to the reference paper of basic telecommunications
  negotiations;
o Transport services – the EU suggested a further opening of maritime services to competition, as
  well as storage and warehouse services (CPC 742), freight transport agency/freight forwarding
  services (CPC 748), and pre-shipment inspection (CPC 749); it also suggested the removal of
  the MFN exemption related to measures for various aspects of maritime transport that Benin
  had included in its GATS schedule on the basis of bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Under the umbrella of Mode 4, the EU also sought commitments from Benin in relation to intra-
corporate transferees and business visitors, to remove all quantitative restrictions or measures with a
similar effect affecting those two groups of Mode 4 suppliers.
While made under the GATS, these requests offer an insight into the likely offensive interests of the
EU in the EPA negotiations. At this stage of development, the best prospects for services exports
from Benin probably remain in West Africa, but it was observed that Benin lacked diversification of
its services exports and improved access to the EU market could help. In addition, the main
contribution of an EPA to the development of services in Benin would probably reside in the
regulatory convergence process or, more modestly, in the improvement of legal security in selected
sectors. Increased openness in some sectors where inefficient state monopolies or incumbent
domestic providers remain would also contribute to widening access to more efficient and better
quality services and, in turn, increase the competitiveness of the Beninese economy as a whole.

4.2.3 South-South integration
As discussed above, while the EU still represents the main source of services imports to Benin, West
Africa is the main destination of services exports from Benin. Thus, from a trade expansion
perspective, the further opening of regional markets has a crucial role to play. This could be explained
by the importance of standards and reputation in services trade that facilitate trade among countries
with similar levels of development and cultural and/or geographical acquaintances. Regional trade is
also essential to the development of backbone services (transportation, finance, telecommunications,
electricity, water) and regulatory and institutional frameworks that will, in turn, strengthen
infrastructure linkages among countries participating in the regional integration scheme, enhance
competitiveness of production, and facilitate the flow of goods and services (African Union, 2010).
Since 1975, Benin has participated in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS),
which made trade integration the primary objective of its 15 member states. It is also a member of
the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), which is a sub-group of ECOWAS
comprising eight countries that distinguish themselves by being a monetary and customs union with
a common currency, the CFA franc.
                          Box 3. ECOWAS provisions relevant to services trade
 According to Article 3.2(d) of the ECOWAS Treaty, the Community aims “to establish a Common Market
 through (…) (iii) the removal, between Member States, of obstacles to the free movement of persons, goods,
 service and capital, and to the right of residence and establishment”. The objective of services trade
 integration in ECOWAS is far from being achieved, however.
 Progress has been made towards the free movement of persons in the region, including through the adoption
 and implementation of the 1979 Protocol (A/P.1/5/79) relating to the Free Movement of Persons, Residence
 and Establishment. Phase I provided for the elimination of the need for visas for stays of up to 90 days with
 ECOWAS territories by Community citizens in possession of valid travel documents and international
 health certificate. Additional measures such as the issuance of ECOWAS passports (1985) and the mutual
 recognition of diplomas (1983) also facilitated the movement of persons in the region. Phase II, from 1986
 onwards, purported to extend residency, including the right to seek and carry out income-earning
 employment, to Community citizens in host ECOWAS states, provided they had obtained an ECOWAS
 residence card or permit; it also obliged member states to provide migrant workers equal treatment with
 nationals in a number of areas. Phase III, from 1990 onwards, focused on the facilitation of business through
 the right of Community citizens to establish enterprises (have access to, carry out and manage economic
 activities) in member states other than their states of origin. While Phase I was fully implemented within
 five years, the implementation of Phases II and II has been slower. Phase III of the Protocol (right of
 establishment, 1990 Supplementary Protocol A/SP.2/5/90 on the Implementation of the Third Phase) “has
 not yet been meaningfully implemented in the region.”

With regard to Mode 4, further trade liberalization could also take place through the establishment of
a single ECOVISA that would allow foreign visitors (including business visitors) to freely travel
within ECOWAS once admitted to the region.
Beyond the opening of markets, ECOWAS has contributed to the harmonization of policies and
regulatory frameworks in key infrastructure services. Progress has been achieved in particular in the
sectors of transport (Article 32), telecommunications (Article 33) and energy (Article 28), which are
essential to the country’s competitiveness.

                                                      76
Article 32 of the Revised ECOWAS Treaty introduced the objective of common transport and
communications policies, laws and regulations, and the development of an extensive transport
network within the Community. Conventions (A/P.2/5/82, A/P.4/5/82, A/SP.1/90) regulate inter-state
road transportation and transit of goods, and established a dedicated Community guarantee
mechanism. Article 33 introduced the objective of harmonization of national telecommunications
policies at the regional level, the establishment of regional telecommunications infrastructure, and
the establishment of a single liberalized telecommunications market within the Community. In 2007,
the member states adopted a Supplementary Act A/SA.1/01/07 which detailed implementation
guidelines. Article 28 called for the co-ordination and harmonization of member states’ policies and
programs in the field of energy. In 2003, member states adopted an Energy Protocol (A/P4/1/03) with
a legal framework promoting long-term cooperation; the West African Power Pool (WAPP created
by Decision A/DEC.5/12/99 and reinforced in 2006) was created to promote the power supply in the
region and to integrate the operations of national power systems.
 Both ECOWAS and WAEMU have already played an important role in promoting trade integration
and openness in the services sectors or modes of supply covered by the agreements. This also
contributed to the improvement of the regulatory framework of a number of key services sectors,
such as financial services. However, there is still a significant gap between the level of ambition of
the treaties and their implementation, which should be reduced.
Regional integration in banking services
In the banking sector, Benin has made some commitments in the GATS. Regional integration has
also helped improve regulation in the sector with the adoption of common WAEMU rules. Benin’s
banking sector, which includes 12 banks as of 2013, is now governed at the community level. Foreign
banks are present in Benin, but concentration remains high with the four largest banks accounting for
70% of assets. West African banks are well represented, with the three largest Nigerian banks holding
approximately 20% of assets.
The performance and asset quality of commercial banks has improved in recent years, although one
bank has been placed under provisional administration due to severe capital deficiencies and was
eventually forced to close in 2012 and was liquidated. Bank loan portfolios have been adversely
affected by government payment delays in early 2009; the ratio of non-performing loans to total loans
decreased to 8.1% in 2009, down from 9.2% in the preceding year, but deteriorated in the following
years to reach 18.6% in 2012, while the capital adequacy ratio of the commercial banks was 10.5%
(at the end of 2011) above the 8% regulatory threshold. In 2013, problems with payments in the cotton
sector resulted in an FCFA 50 billion payment gap that represented 30-40% of the banks’ reserve
funds and threatened their viability. Legal and regulatory frameworks regarding licensing, bank
activities, organizational and capital requirements, inspections and sanctions is in place and
underwent significant reforms since 1999. Access to financial services overall has increased in the
past years, with private credit by deposit money banks and other financial institutions passing from
14% of GDP in 2004 to 22% in 2010. However, interest rates offered by Beninese banks on loans to
companies and households remain the highest in the WAEMU. 70% of the Beninese firms have
identified access to finance as a major constraint.
Benin has developed a very active microfinance sector, which accounts for approximately 9.5% of
the total loans offered by the financial sector in the country and authorities have attached a high
degree of importance to the use of microfinance as a tool to alleviate poverty. The microfinance sector
is also subject to supervision through the Central Bank, as well as the responsible Ministry for

                                                  77
Microfinance and Employment of Youth and Women. However, a significant increase in the number
of unlicensed microfinance institutions in recent years, with a number of them offering unrealistic
deposit rates, represent risks of "ponzi-types" schemes and threaten to increase vulnerability in the
sector as a whole. While still relatively underdeveloped, regional capital markets have been
expanding in recent years. Payment and settlement systems were reformed in 2004 and Benin
participates in the regional stock exchange located in Abidjan.
Cooperation in the energy sector
The energy sector provides a good example of tentative cooperation at the regional level, with a
greater focus on infrastructure. It also reveals the limits of such cooperation, as the the “last lap” has
yet to be run and both the domestic infrastructure and regulatory framework do not allow for a better
harnessing of the benefits of cross-border connections and cooperation.

inhabitants still did not have access to electricity (World Development Indicators, 2014). Domestic
regulatory and infrastructure issues have affected the reliability and efficiency of electricity
distribution in the country, against the objective of universal access. The cost to obtain electricity (i.e.
the initial cost of connection to the grid) in Benin remains the highest in the region and about 14 times
the cost observed in Ghana, for example (Figure 68). The Société Beninoise d’Energie Electrique
(SBEE) is still fully publically-owned, with low financial and technical capacity.
The Government and donors have launched a number of projects to improve electricity access,
including the improvement of the Northern Togo – Northern Benin transmission lines. A new
Electricity Code was adopted in 2007 and a national regulatory agency was established in 2009. The
Government established the legal and regulatory framework necessary for private sector participation
in the sector, but did not actively pursue a privatization agenda, given the lack of private-sector
interest and unsuccessful attempts at power-utility privatization in the region, including in Guinea,
Togo, Senegal, and Mali.

Implementation gaps
USAID (2011) funded an ECOWAS-wide gap analysis of the ECOWAS Trade Liberalization
Scheme (ETLS) to identify which aspects of the ETLS protocols were being implemented in
individual Member States and which aspects were not, both from the perspective of the Government
and the private sector. Results for Benin show a significant gap between ECOWAS protocols and
domestic laws and practice. The report noted that two cross-cutting issues prevented the full operation
of ETLS protocols in Benin and directly impacted all aspects of intra-regional trade. There is a gap
between legislation and implementation — USAID pointed to the difficulty of finding updated
legislation, regulation or procedures that address many of the ETLS protocols and to the lack of
enforcement and consistency in the application of national or regional laws at the border, including
unofficial NTBs imposed at the border.
There is also a low private-sector awareness          Figure 69. Implementation of ETLS protocols on

4.3 Looking ahead: Promoting services activities in Benin

4.3.1 Cross-cutting constraints
Services value-added and trade remain limited in Benin despite major assets, such as its geographical
location (a gateway for landlocked countries and a neighbor to the largest African market) and the
availability of skilled workers. This could be explained by the combination of several factors,
including: the small size of the market; the prevalence of the informal sector; and the existing
constraints on public procurement.
Market size
With just above 10 million inhabitants and a GDP per capita of US$ 752 (in 2012, according to the
World Bank), Benin is a small market. As a consequence, domestic services firms have some
difficulty reaching critical mass and becoming internationally competitive. It is also harder for the
country to attract global services providers that contribute to capacity building and further integration
of major trade flows: today, about 75% of services trade is in intermediate services (i.e. services
which are used as intermediate inputs in the production of other goods or services), and the ratio of
FDI to services trade is significantly higher than for merchandise trade, about 250% compared to
                                                     79
50% (Miroudot et al., 2009). In other words, Benin’s small market size hampers its ability to attract
investment from global services firms and, in turn, leaves it at the margin of major services trade
flows. For example, in the food retail sector, main players like Carrefour need a critical mass of 20
to 25 million inhabitants to consider establishment. In the insurance sector, while foreign companies
are present, the small size of the market (exacerbated by the lack of adequate regulatory environment,
such as no mandatory insurances and price control) results in a very weak growth of business (Box
4)
                                    Box 4. Insurance services in Benin
 Insurance services have been excluded from Benin’s GATS commitments in the financial sector.
 Nonetheless, the sector is open to foreign competition with the presence of West African and European
 insurance companies on the market. Seven companies offer life insurance and the same number offer other
 types of coverage (casualty and property); the country also counts 13 insurance brokers. The two largest
 insurance companies control almost two thirds of the entire market, reflecting a high degree of
 concentration. The sector grows very slowly (+0.5% in 2013, compared to +5% in Ghana) and remains very
 small (FCFA 25 billion, compared to 140 billion in Ghana). As such it is not very attractive to foreign
 companies. Insurance premiums represent only 1.2% of the GDP, with 76.5% for accident and property
 insurance and 23.5% for life insurance. Total average spending per inhabitant is only FCFA 3,285, the
 equivalent of US$8.
 The small size of the market is due to several factors (population size, lack of investment, prevalence of the
 informal sector) that are aggravated by the poor regulation of the sector. Insurance coverage is not
 mandatory in most instances and when an obligation does exist, it is not always implemented (for example,
 the insurance of vehicles). Low premiums have resulted in insufficient quality of the services offered and a
 poor competitiveness of foreign companies. In 2013, the Government introduced a minimum level for health
 insurance premiums to ensure the financial viability of companies offering such services. It appears that a
 number of Beninese citizens contract health insurance from abroad in order to secure access to better
 coverage and health care. Insurance supervision is carried out through the Direction du Contrôle des
 Assurances, reporting to Benin’s Ministry of Finance and the Commission Régionale de Contrôle des
 Assurances. Companies must be incorporated in Benin.

On the other hand, the small size of the market is an incentive for export. Indeed, some of the lead
services exporters in the world (e.g. Dubai) or in the region (e.g. Gambia) are geographically small
countries. Benin could become a platform for exports if the right incentives and business environment
were in place. This tension is observable, for example, in the ICT sector: in order to scale up, a
company like COMTEL needed to export to Togo, Niger and Gabon – exports made the company
sustainable; a smaller company like MA Info has been trying to export for the past few years, but has
faced difficulties linked to its size and limited financial capacities. The lack of regulatory
harmonization and transparency at the regional level is considered by SMEs to be a major obstacle
to trade (e.g. difficulty in bidding for public contracts in other countries without local presence). A
greater emphasis should also be put on promoting exports and providing information to services firms
on regional and global trade opportunities.
The prevalence of informality
The lesser attractiveness of the Beninese market is exacerbated by the large prevalence of the informal
sector that reduces trade opportunities for services companies in the formal sector. For example, Total
closed its gas stations and left the country due to the unfair competition of informal gas distribution
channels smuggled from Nigeria. In the banking sector, major international banks cannot work with
                                                      80
the informal sector and therefore have limited scope for operation. In the automobile distribution
sector, only 800 to 900 new vehicles are formally sold each year, while an estimated 300,000 used
cars that are imported to Benin each year, most of which are then re-exported to Nigeria (about
280,000). The decree regulating the automobile dealership profession is apparently not enforced and
taxation levels are too high (20% tariffs + 30% various taxes + 18% VAT), creating incentives for
informality and used car imports; no new trucks are formally sold in the country. In the food retail
sector, meanwhile, only one supermarket with a foreign affiliation is currently operating
(Erevan/Super U) and must compete with informal retailers in the country; here again, the high level
of taxes encourages parallel, informal distribution channels (e.g. excise taxes of 45% on alcohol, or
7% on other drinks, in addition to the tariffs and VAT). According to the Government, 98% of
enterprises are micro-enterprises (individuals), 93% of which are informal and mainly in the
agricultural and services sectors. An “entreprenant” status was created that should incite those
individuals to join the formal sector.
In countries with small domestic markets, some services sectors heavily rely on public procurement.
This is the case, for example, in segments of the engineering and construction services sectors.
Procurement opportunities in Benin have, however, been limited in recent years due to budgetary
constraints. Public procurement rules also need improvement: for example, there is an average 336
days between the call for proposals and the actual contract; there are also suspicions of corruption
and a certain inefficiency of the judicial process (length and enforcement of the decisions). As a result
of this decline in significant public infrastructure projects, some major companies like Colas
(engineering and construction) have substantially reduced their operations in Benin and relocated
their personnel to other countries in the region.
Legal insecurity and governance
Other factors that explain the limited development of services trade in Benin include the prevalent
legal insecurity and the “predatory” role of the State. This is reflected in the relevant Doing Business
indicators: Benin ranks 179 out of 189 for “Paying taxes” and 181 out of 189 for “Enforcing
contracts” (IFC, 2014).
     Table 14. Enforcing contracts in Benin, Doing      Benin is one of the worst performers in the

                                                        been levied that were not in the original
license agreements. The banking sector faced the non-reimbursement of debts contracted in the cotton
sector, threatening their solvability and level of reserves. A ten-year dispute in the distribution of
medicines and pharmaceutical products concluded that procurement rules had been infringed. Some
foreign services companies established in Benin consider the rule of law to be under threat in the
country.
Taxes represent a severe burden for service providers in the formal sector, not only in terms of
amounts, but also in terms of administrative costs and time needed to deal with tax authorities. Due

                                                     81
to the prevalence of the informal sector in the country, furthermore, the tax base is very small while
those declaring their activities and income feel “harassed” by the tax authorities with unjustifiably-
frequent tax audits that affect the normal operation of their business. Indeed, some large services
companies have dedicated staff that deal exclusively with public authorities. This becomes a vicious
circle, since the high level of taxes and fiscal harassment (to compensate for the low tax base) create
an important comparative advantage for businesses in the informal sector and additional incentives
for firms to join the informal sector. Part of the solution to services trade development will therefore
be linked to tax administration reforms (see IMF 2013 for an overview of tax administration reforms
undertaken in West Africa over the past few years).

from business process outsourcing to knowledge process outsourcing), which would create thousands
of skilled jobs. So far, however, the policies needed to develop these activities have failed to be
implemented, and the sector has not taken off. The availability and quality of telecommunication
services themselves are not satisfactory, playing against the objective of universal access set by the
Government in its sectoral strategy.

4.3.2 Sector-specific issues
Telecommunications services in Benin
Telecommunications are an essential component of a country’s competitiveness and connectivity to
the rest of the world. Aware of this importance, the Government of Benin adopted an ambitious
Strategy for the sector in 2008 (Document de Politique et de Stratégie du Secteur des
Télécommunications, des TIC et de la Poste, 2008), which included a political vision, priority actions,
and a repartition of the roles among the different actors of the sector. It updated a sectoral policy that
dated back from 1994 and that was supplemented by a number of texts, including a 2002 Ordinance
on the fundamental principles of the telecommunications regime in Benin and a 2007 Decree creating
the Autorité Transitoire de Régulation des Postes et Telecommunications.
Benin has no GATS commitments in the telecommunications sector, but is largely open to
international competition, with 5 operators in the mobile sector from South Africa (MTN – 34% of




                                                   82
the market in June 2013), UAE (Moov – 33% of the market), Nigeria (Glo – 17% of the market),
BBCom (Canada – 13% of the market), and Libercom36 (Benin – 3% of the market).
Nonetheless, several segments of the telecommunications sector are still subject to monopolistic
rights. This is the case for landlines that remains a monopoly of Benin Télécoms. The penetration
rate is very low (1.66% in June 2013) with wide disparities among regions within Benin. On 13 May
2014, the Beninese Parliament adopted a Loi sur les Communications Electroniques et la Poste that
includes chapters on telecommunications, the information society, and postal services. While a
number of provisions are still archaic, the law recognizes the fundamental principle of open access
to infrastructure, which is essential to the development of the sector. Procedures to attribute licenses
will ultimately determine the level of effective competition. On the basis of this law, the eBenin
project supports the finalization of a number of laws pertaining to cybercrime, cryptology, e-
commerce, and the certification of intermediaries.
This progress in the regulation of the telecommunications sector has not been translated, however,
into new positions in the WTO negotiations – although conformity with the WAEMU
telecommunications framework was a clear motivation of the new law. An analysis of the market
potential for the Beninese ICT sector in the region is also lacking (e.g. SWOT analysis), that would
help define the interests of the country in trade negotiations.

Mobile telephony has contributed to significantly improving teledensity in the country, with 8.7
million mobile phone subscriptions in the country and a teledensity that reached 92% in June 2013
(Figure 71). Prepaid cards still represented 99.57% of the market in June 2013.
The main taxes imposed by the Government are: a FCFA 8 tax per minute for incoming international
calls (down from FCFA 15 in 2012) and a FCFA 2 tax per minute on all other calls; in addition, the
Government collects a 3% tax on telecom revenues to feed a universal access service fund; VAT is
at 18%. Benin Télécoms still benefits from some privileges and does not, for instance, pay

private equity.

interconnection rights. 3G licenses are sold at FCFA 50 billion, compared to FCFA 170 billion in
Nigeria for a market that is one 15th of the size.
In spite of this progress, the functioning of the telecoms market remains unsatisfactory, including in
terms of tariffs and quality of service (WTO, 2010). The government strategy pointed at an
incomplete legal and regulatory framework, including for operations (interconnection, frequency
management, dispute settlement). Benin Télécoms’ monopolistic rights on some key segments of the
market (e.g. international land connections) constrain the development of new technologies. VOIP is
not allowed. Finally, the implementation of regional rules (ECOWAS and WAEMU) is lagging. All
these reforms were considered priority actions in the 2008 strategy.
With regard to Internet access, Benin Télécoms’ monopolistic rights on land connections (in spite of
existing laws opening the market) have slowed down the development of broader Internet access. In
June 2013, only about 42,000 persons in Benin had a fixed Internet connection (6% of total Internet
subscriptions), compared to 700,000 mobile Internet connections (94% of the market). Demand for
Internet services has grown quickly, with an increase in mobile subscriptions by 69% over the first
half of 2013. Benin is still lagging behind its competitors at three levels: infrastructure (Figure 72),
technology (Figure 73), and use. These results and the absence of a comprehensive regulatory
framework for the promotion of the telecommunications and IT-enabled services, including the gap
in the implementation of ECOWAS and WAEMU rules, are in sharp contrast to the Government’s
ambitions, as expressed in the 2008 strategy.

1. A new regulatory and institutional framework that would facilitate the development of the
   sector and fill in the legal vacuum that existed in the ICT sector;
2. New infrastructure of world class and competitive standard;
3. Development of adequate qualifications in human resources;
4. Development of content adapted to market needs (education, health, agriculture, tourism, trade);
5. A competitive business environment supporting ICT services as a driver of growth and a source
   of FDI.
A number of priority actions were planned under each of the strategic axes, but fell short of
implementation, including the privatization of Benin Télécoms SA, which is still pending. By
contrast, telecom privatization has been a success regional neighbors, Senegal and Côte d’Ivoire.
Other examples include the implementation of ECOWAS-WAEMU rules or the liberalization of
market segments subject to monopolistic rights. Two on-going World Bank projects aim to enhance
international connectivity (submarine cable ACE to land in December 2014) in an open access
environment and to develop telecommunication and Internet usage through eGov and supporting the
IT/ITES service industry growth. After the adoption of the May 2014 law that allowed for more
competition and open access, the Government is now planning to build a national backbone with a
view to bring high speed Internet in the interior of the country. A second landing station for the cable
is also planned that will break the Benin Télécoms monopoly on high speed Internet and allow for a
better development of the ICT sector.
ICT-enabled services
ICT-enabled services are one of the fastest growing sectors in the world, with significant
opportunities in developing countries, including through the business or knowledge process
outsourcing (BPO and KPO) and the phenomenon of services offshoring at large. In Africa, a number
of countries have joined the race for services offshoring, including in West Africa region (e.g.
Senegal, Ghana, Nigeria). ICT-enabled services trade offers a wide range of job creation
opportunities, in particular for young and skilled workers (e.g. in call centers). According to the 2011
AT Kearney Global Services Location Index, Ghana and Senegal ranked among the top-30 most

                                                               85
attractive countries in the world for offshoring and were ahead of India and China in the financial
attractiveness component of the Index; Ghana also raked ahead of both India and China for the
business environment component. Nigeria has also hugely invested in the sector, with thousands of
employees in the BPO sector. In 2009, Ghana exported US$ 45 million in the BPO sector, with plans
to double or triple this figure and create 40,000 jobs over five years. Senegal also created 40,000 jobs
in call centers (68 call centers in 2012 compared to 1 in 2001) dedicated to the francophone market.
Cotonoushore, a technopole project, could be based in the free industrial zone and benefit from its
special conditions. The potential for Benin is large, and the country has significant comparative
advantages, including skilled workers and a mild accent in French language, which significantly helps
the call center business. The quality of education is probably Benin’s best asset to develop the BPO
business (as well as the weak point of its main competitors in the region). However, the quality of
infrastructure is a problem: while prices have declined, the quality of the Internet is unsatisfactory
and high speed Internet is available generally only in Cotonou and Porto Nove. The Government
created tax incentives as early as 2009, but the level of charges remains too high and the labor law is
not adapted to the sector’s needs. A decree (currentl y being revised) imposed a FCFA 300 million
deposit for new companies operating in the sector. With initially 4 call centers, Benin is left with a
single one (Mediapart) that is now exporting its services and is present in several countries of the
region. There is also no incentive mechanism to accompany companies starting their ICT operations
in Benin (e.g. through subventions).

Chapter 5: Agriculture

5.1 Why agriculture matters for Benin
Benin has considerable unexploited agricultural potential: Only 20% of arable land is cultivated and
crop yields have considerable margins for increase. Despite this, in 2012 the agricultural sector
contributed 32% to GDP, from 75 to 90% of export earnings, 15% to government revenue and
employed about 70% of the active population (APRM 2013). The agricultural sector still remains an
engine of economic growth in Benin. It directly contributed to 2.2% of total growth in 2012 and, in
addition, contributed to the growth of secondary industries by providing the raw material for the agri-
food and tertiary industry, particularly the transport sector and banking sector.

Nevertheless, the agricultural trade balance is heavily in deficit. In 2008-2012, agricultural exports
represented only 44% of food imports (APRM, 2013). Development of the agricultural export sector
is a priority for Benin, which aims to increase by 50% the volume of agricultural exports by 2015
(PSRSA / NIPA). Within the agricultural sector, cotton plays a dominant role. In the early 2010s,
cotton accounted for 40% of export earnings, 12-13% of GDP, about 60% of the industrial fabric,
and provided an income for more than one third of the population (PRSP, 2011). The Beninese
economy remains highly dependent on cotton, which is currently experiencing a new crisis that is not
linked to the international market but whose origins are internal. The decline of agricultural GDP
growth in the 2008-2010 period reflects the fall in cotton production. It rebounded in 2011-12 with
the resumption of cotton production.
The Government has initiated a policy of diversification of agricultural exports to reduce dependency
on cotton. This strategy is based on the promotion of new export sectors including the cashew nut
sector and the pineapple industry. The Beninese agriculture policy is set out in the Strategic Plan for
Agricultural Sector Recovery (PSRPA 2011). It is part of the regional agricultural policy, the
ECOWAP (Economic Community of West Africa States Agricultural Policy) which is itself the
regional embodiment of the Comprehensive Program for the Development of African Agriculture
(CAADP) (New Partnership for Africa's Development). The share of public expenditure in
agriculture is on average 6.7% over the 2008-2011 period, well below the 10% target established in
2003 in Maputo by the Heads of State and Government of the African Union within the framework
of the implementation of the NEPAD. However, private investment in the sector rose by 7.9% on
average over the same period, but represented a constant 14% share of total private investment over
the 2008-2012 period.
Exports of cashew nuts constitute the second largest source of agricultural export earnings in Benin.
These exports have been growing since the second half of the 2000s, reaching over 12% of export
earnings in Benin in 2012. Behind cotton and cashew nuts, other agricultural crops (shea nuts and
pineapple) are marginal, representing less than 1% of total exports37. These three sectors have in
common the fact that they have important potential for development of the local processing industry
and focusing on international markets (and / or regional for the pineapple sector). Exports of high
value Beninese agro-food (shea by-products, cashew kernel) are beginning to break into markets as
demanding as those of the USA, EU and Japan. This movement to diversify from agricultural exports
of cotton towards processed products with higher added value should be encouraged and supported

37
     These data should be treated with caution (see below).

                                                              87
by the Government. The development of sectors also contributes to balanced regional development
and the fight against poverty and inequality, still significant in rural Benin. Rural poverty has been
increasing in recent years, from 38.4% in 2010 to 39.7% in 2011 with growing inequality between
men and women in rural areas (APRM 2013, World Bank, 2014).

5.2 Cotton38
In 2011, cotton constituted 17% of exports from Benin. It is estimated that the cotton sector sustains
300,000 small producers directly and, indirectly, 3 million people through its drag effects on the
input, transport, industrial processing, banking and port sectors (transit, handling and warehousing
companies, etc. ). It is also a culture that contributes to the maintenance of a regional economic
balance. Part of cotton production is located in the northern region, where poverty is concentrated
and where there are few possibilities for diversification (Gergely, 2009).
Production of seed cotton expanded dramatically between 1980 and 1995 (Figure 75), from less than
20,000 tons to about 350,000 tons. It then levelled out between 1995 and 2004, before collapsing
between 2004 (428,000 tons) and 2010 (140,000 tons). It should be noted that the expansion of
production is partly the result of increased yields (0.78 tons / ha in the period 1961-1980 and 1.13 t /
ha between 1982 and 2009), but mainly due to higher acreage, which multiplied tenfold between 1980
and 1995.

These developments show a strong commitment to the cultivation of cotton in the mid-80s, which
was given a further boost in the 90s. Benin is now the largest producer of cotton in West Africa. The
system collapsed after 2005 and lost ground to Burkina Faso and Mali in the ranking of cotton
producers. In 2012/2013, the production of seed cotton from Burkina Faso was 440,000 tons and that
of Mali 330,000 tons (FAO data) against 240,000 tons in Benin.

  Information used in this section, as well as in the rest of the chapter, were collected in November 2013. According to
information provided by SONAPRA, the harvest for the 2013-2014 season rose to 307,355 tons and then again to 393,000
tons for the 2014-2015 season.

5.2.1 Developments since the DTIS
While other countries have sought to open up the cotton sector to private competition while
maintaining vertical integration, Benin has introduced competition at each stage of the supply chain,
privatizing it "by function". These reforms have resulted in an institutional landscape and a
particularly complex organizational mode that favor opportunistic behavior in a country characterized
by a weak state apparatus. The Beninese model remains unique in West Africa.

Cotton production, which collapsed in 2005/06 (from 428 000 tons to 191,000 tons), recovered in
2006/07, causing the Government to intervene directly in the sector through a series of orders from
2006 up to the present day (December 2013). In June 2010, a presidential decree shut down the
Conseil National des Producteurs de Coton and strengthened the powers of the main ginner (ICA
Group and SODECO), replacing the CNPC with the Comité Consultatif National Transitoire des
Producteurs de Coton (CCNPC), whose members were co-opted by the AIC.
The privatization process of the Société Nationale pour la Promotion Agricole (SONAPRA),
repeatedly postponed, was concluded in September 2008 and led to the creation of the Société de
Développement du Coton (SODECO), which took over SONAPRA's industrial infrastructure. This
process is described here for a better understanding of the current situation. In August 2008, an
international tender was launched for the takeover of SONAPRA's industrial infrastructure. The SCP
(Joint Stock Company), a subsidiary of the Talon group, won the competition. The agreement creating
the SODECO, a mixed economy company, was signed in Cotonou on 10 October 2008. The director
of the SCP, Patrice Talon, then became the chairman of the board of directors of SODECO.
The agreement between the State and SODECO provides that after a year of operation, the State will
sell 17.5% of capital to a domestic or international target39. If this clause is not respected, the 17.5%
will return to SODECO, which will sell those shares on the stock market (still with the same problem
of the 20%). After 5 years of activity, the State must withdraw completely by giving SODECO 15.5%
of bearer shares and transferring its remaining shares to it. For the assignment to be effective,
SODECO must produce 5 certified balance sheets. The 5-year term expired on the 1st of October

39
  Note that the exercise of this clause is a priori impossible because the IPO of a company involves the transfer of at least
20% of capital. But the State, aware of this impossibility, seeks to obtain a derogation.

                                                                  89
2013, but the 5th cotton season ended in June 2014. SODECO therefore had to wait until June 2014
to produce the 5 balances required for the State to completely withdraw from SODECO.
The institutional developments mentioned above, where one of the main objectives was to introduce
competition in the ginning industry and the distribution of inputs, have in fact led to a high
concentration of the sector in the hands of one private operator: the Talon Group. At the end of the
process of privatizing SONAPRA, the Talon Group, majority shareholder of SODECO, controlled
82% of the ginning industry (25.3% directly through the SCP, and 56.6% through SODECO). It
should also be noted that in 2013 the total ginning capacity in Benin was above 550,000 tons for seed
cotton, up from 174,000 tons in 2011/12. Ginning capacity is therefore 3 times higher than
production. In the end, the privatization process will not be concluded, as the Government reinvested
in the area before the end of the fifth cotton season..

5.2.2 The "transitional" season of 2012/2013
2007/08 saw a poor season, and production of seed cotton continued to fall to 137,000 tons in
2010/11. The State thus decided to intervene in the 2012/13 season: the framework agreement was
suspended and the State ordered contract ginning. Institutions managing the sector (including AIC)
were eliminated, and a wave of audits was launched covering all ginners. SONAPRA, which was not
liquidated, is responsible for the installation of inputs and the coordination of SODECO warehouses.
The State signs contracts with ginners in which ginning remuneration is, according to private
operators, set at a level lower than the retail price. In addition, the State is accumulating arrears so
that, by the end of 2013, ginners had not yet recovered the full amount owed. At the end of 2013, the
State's debt vis-à-vis SODECO amounted to 1.245 billion FCFA, and the resulting financial loss was
3.251 billion (i.e. above 4.5 billion in total). For the ginning industry overall, direct government debt
amounted to 3 billion plus 7 billion of losses induced. Note that VAT receivables uncollected total
3.104 billion.
Crushers, the main two of which are Fludor Benin SA and the Société des Huileries du Bénin (SHB-
Bohicon), are also in upheaval. In 2012/2013, a seed purchase price was imposed on them that was
well below their profitability threshold although it is one of the lowest in the sub-region according to
SONAPRA. In addition, the seeds delivered to them are of poor quality, further worsening the
profitability of mills. Finally, a Decree of 18 November 2013 suspended the agreement that created
SODECO. Besides the fact that the State unilaterally terminated the agreement creating SODECO,
another problem arose related to the fact that the 17.5% held in portage for the public, which was
never transferred to the SCP, was pledged by the latter. All in all, this created huge political and legal
turmoil, the consequences of which have been disastrous for the entire chain: producers, ginners,
mills, haulers, commercial banks, etc.
For the second consecutive year, ginners were ordered to carry out contract ginning in 2013/14 and
SODECO plants were requisitioned in January 2014. The co-dependent relationship between the
State and the cotton companies is paralyzing the sector. Planting was delayed, inputs (seeds, fertilizers
and pesticides) were not implemented on time and did not meet quality standards. The ginning season
was also delayed by almost two months. In February 2014, the bulk of the crop was still in villages,
exposed to early rains. Added to this in early 2013 was the lack of vehicles for the transport of seed
cotton to the port of Cotonou, causing the head of State to seek the assistance of Nigerian carriers to



                                                   90
transport Beninese cotton to the port of Cotonou.40 The army and young people were also mobilized
to build hangars and assist in the collecting, storing and unloading of cotton in plants (AFCOT).
Haulers were asked to offer their services to transport cotton from the field to primary and self-
managed markets, factories and then the Port of Cotonou.
Meanwhile, there was a showdown with crushers who refused to pay all sums owed to SONAPRA
for the 2012/2013 season and demanded a renegotiation of the price of seeds. Failing an agreement,
the cotton crisis could affect the livestock sector (including poultry) if SONAPRA decides to export
cotton seeds to Nigeria instead of processing them locally. The entire sector is also threatened by a
financial crisis. Since the 2012/2013 season, the State has accumulated debt vis-à-vis the ginning
industry, jeopardizing the financial survival of the crushing industry and the commercial banks that
finance the cotton seasons. Producers are also affected by late payments. The financial crisis may
worsen in 2013/2014 if the delay in the season has a negative impact on the quality of cotton and
export discounts.

5.2.3 Looking ahead
The many inefficiencies of the Beninese cotton model have led donors, including the World Bank
and private investors, to come up with stimuli for the sector since 2008, involving institutional
reforms. These plans favor a restructuring of the industry around a single operator within one or more
areas of production.
Moral hazard and contract farming41
In Benin, as in the majority of comparator countries, agricultural input markets are deficient42 (seeds,
fertilizers and pesticides), which has led the public sector to supplant the private sector in the supply
of inputs to cotton farmers. Market failures occur, notably because of the inability of the farmer to
distinguish good products from bad products leads to the disappearance of good quality inputs and
market collapse (bad products drive out the good). In this context, off-market transaction methods,
within an organization (vertical integration model) or through hybrid institutional arrangements can
help overcome market failures.
For instance, production contracts allow farmers access to credit, quality inputs and agricultural
advice. Farmers also undertake to implement, with the advice of the cotton company, effective
production techniques in terms of yield and quality, and agree to sell their output to the company
providing credit and inputs. Through this contractual obligation, the cotton company secures supplies
for its factories of products, whose production process and quality control it has ensured itself. In
turn, it is in the interest of the cotton company to supply its producers with quality inputs, because
the quality of the cotton fiber depends on this.
However, this type of transactions between farmers and cotton companies can develop only if
contracts are respected. This assumes an effective legal framework, which is rarely the case in
developing countries. Otherwise, farmers are encouraged to sell their output to the highest bidder,
that is to say, a competitor of the company that supplied the credit and inputs. Cotton companies,
seeking to exploit the industrial infrastructure to its fullest, fail to punish opportunistic behavior, and
sometimes even encourage it by buying products from farmers who are not under contract.

   The market is said to be deficient when the free market leads to an inefficient allocation of resources

                                                            91
Competition and ginning overcapacity worsen this moral hazard problem. Thus, in the absence of
contract enforcement, contract farming can only develop in a non-competitive environment, although
monopoly also entails allocative inefficiencies that result in low prices for cotton producers.
Two options considered by Beninese private investors and the World Bank are outlined below. The
first is that of a mixed economy company holding a national monopoly. The second is that of regional
monopolies within specific areas. These two options are intended to preserve the integrated nature of
the industry, within the framework of a public-private partnership.
Option 1: A mixed-economy company with a countrywide monopoly
In this option a single cotton company holds a legal monopoly over the whole territory for the primary
marketing of seed cotton. Compared to the historical model where a monopoly was held by a public
company, here capital is open to private ownership, farmers and the public. In this option, the State
is a minority shareholder. The cotton company works with producer groups under contract to which
it provides inputs (seeds, fertilizers, pesticides), credit, and agricultural advice. It is remunerated on
purchase of the product via a deduction on the purchase price. It acquires the entire harvest of seed
cotton. It gins and sells fiber and by-products on the local and international market and repays farming
loans taken out with the banking system. Management of the sector is defined in a framework
agreement between the State, the cotton company and professional organizations in the sector (cotton
growers, ginners, crushers, etc.). The agreement defines the relationship between the State and
operators in the sector and the missions of each of them (pricing, conditions of acquisition of the
product, etc.).
Besides the smooth running of transactions upstream of ginning, this option has several advantages.
Firstly, it enables exploitation of economies of scale in the ginning industry, primary marketing and
distribution of inputs. Above all, it allows farmers, through their shareholding in the company, to
access information on the conditions of sale of the fiber, the costs of the company, etc. and to exert a
degree of control. The State, also a shareholder, may also exercise this form of control of the
company. In other words, it is expected that the presence of farmers and the State allows for a
reduction of income from the monopoly and encourages the company to apply prices close to market
prices. Finally, this solution has the additional advantage of minimizing State intervention in the
sector. The practical implementation of this solution in the current context of Benin assumes that each
of the five ginners contributes its plants and equipment to the new cotton company and becomes a
shareholder of the new company. The State and farmers are shareholders of the new company through
SODECO. The participation of the State can be reduced by sale of part of its shares.
Option 2: A zoning system
In this option, adopted by Burkina Faso until 2004 and by Côte d’Ivoire between 1998 and 2002,
Beninese cotton basins are divided into two or three areas. Each zone is subject to a franchise contract
for the benefit of a private operator or a mixed economy operator. Each operator has a monopoly on
the primary marketing of cotton in its zone. Within each zone, specifications define the tasks of the
operator: methods for setting producer prices, terms of sale of inputs, management of critical
functions, duration of the franchise, conditions for its renewal, etc.
While zoning also entails local monopoly, zoning allows “indirect competition” in the form of
benchmarking, as each company must align itself with best practices in one or the other areas (in
terms of the price paid to producers). While it does not eliminate moral hazard (side selling) around
“frontier” areas, it does reduce it substantially. The zoning system is compatible with a minority State

                                                   92
stake in one of the cotton companies. It involves the establishment of a regulatory authority
responsible for defining and enforcing the specifications. This regulatory authority is intended to be
a tripartite body that includes the State, representatives of producers and ginners, and indeed other
professions in the sector (crushers, spinners, etc.). To be effective, a zoning system requires a stronger
institutional and regulatory framework than a countrywide monopoly. It is necessary for the
representative bodies of the various professions within the regulatory authority to be well-structured
and effective. It is especially important that zoning is observed, meaning the regulatory authority
must have the necessary coercive resources.
The implementation of this solution in Benin involves defining areas with equivalent production
potential and creating, as in the previous case, 2 or 3 new cotton companies, "consolidating assets"
of existing companies. Scenarios established in 2008 forecast cotton production of 600,000 tons,
divided into two zones of 300,000 tons or three zones of 200,000 tons. With production over the last
three seasons barely exceeding 200,000 tons, however, it seems difficult to go beyond two zones.
Another difficulty is related to the geographical location of the plants, far to the south and away from
production areas. Under these conditions, respect for collection areas will be difficult to guarantee.
The solution to this problem would be to move the plants, which is possible but obviously expensive.

5.3 Non-traditional sectors

5.3.1 Cashew
The cashew industry is one of the 13 priority sectors identified by the Beninese Government (PSRSA,
2011). Cashew is now the second agricultural export after cotton, accounting for 12.5% of total
exports in Benin in 2011. Benin exports mainly raw cashews. It is also an exporter of cashew kernels,
although to a much lesser extent. The Government's aim is to develop local production and
processing, an important source of female employment. Cashew plantations also contribute to the
fight against erosion and deforestation.
As in other countries in West Africa (Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana etc.), cashew production
has been growing in Benin since the late 90s, driven by global demand. Global exports of cashew
have soared since 2002 (Figure 5) and Benin was inundated with cashew plantations in fifteen years.
According to estimates provided by the African Cashew Alliance (ACA), the areas planted with
cashew trees multiplied twentyfold since the late 90s, from 10,000 ha to 200,000 ha in 2012 (ACI,
2012). Today, 8 of the 12 departments of the country produce cashew.43
However, the sector is poorly understood and the information available for various areas differs,
including the size of orchards and quantities produced. The reason for these differences is that this
new sector is totally ignored by agricultural statistics. The Ministry of Agriculture (APRM) does not
provide production statistics because there are not, to date, any well-established methods for
evaluating yields. Agricultural statistics nevertheless give a production of 140,135 tons in 2011,
which contrasts with data from the ACA which gives production of 90,000 tons in 2011 and 80,000
tons in 2012. 44 The FAO gives even higher production of 163,000 tons in 2011 and 170,000 tons in
2012. According to the Conseil National des Exportateurs de Cajou du Bénin (CONEC), Benin
produced over 155,000 tons in 2012 compared to 163,000 tons in 2011. Finally, the Fédération

        Export data is also imprecise. According to data from the INSAE based on customs statistics, exports
        increased from 36,000 tons in 2006 to around 51,000 tons in 2011. However the ACA gives 146,332
        tons of raw nuts exports in 2011 and the FAO 121,500 tons. It is therefore extremely difficult to make
        a diagnosis of the performance of this sector. In 2011, according to FAO data, Benin was the fourth
        largest exporter of cashew nuts behind three other West African countries: Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana and
        Guinea Bissau (Table 17).

Like its neighbors in West Africa, Benin is above all an exporter of raw products (nuts). Nuts are
exported by ship and processed mainly in India and Vietnam. 45 India is a major player in the
international cashew market, having been specialized in the processing of cashew nuts for several
decades. It is the largest importer of nuts and the second largest exporter of kernels (Table 5).
Vietnam, the leading cashew kernel exporter, has a large processing capacity and imports large
quantities of raw nuts in the event of poor harvests. In 2013, Vietnam's imports of raw nuts reached
333,000 tons.46 The United States is the largest importer of cashew kernels (Table 17).
Only a small part of Beninese production is processed locally and exported as kernels to European
countries and North America. According to data from the ACA, cashew kernels represent less than
2% of total exports of Beninese cashews. It should be noted that in the kernel market, the only African
countries that appear in the top 10 global exporters are: Tanzania, Mozambique and Burkina Faso.
This reflects the poor competitiveness of West African countries in agro-industrial processing.
Kernels machined in West Africa struggle to compete in the U.S. market against those machined in
India, having been imported raw from West Africa, and then re-exported to the USA ( Figure 77).

There is no organized market for nuts or cashew kernels. In general, the international market is very
volatile, based on the state of supply in major producing countries (India, Vietnam and Brazil). The
price of kernels and nuts soared in 2011 and remained high in 2012. They returned to a slightly lower
level in 2013 because of the good Indian harvest.
In terms of quality and export price, the quality of Beninese cashew ranks below nuts from Guinea
Bissau, which are of excellent quality, but above those from Ghana or Côte d’Ivoire (see below). The
high quality of Beninese nuts compared to neighboring countries is behind the phenomenon of
significant informal imports from Nigeria, Togo and Burkina Faso. These informal imports explain
the gap between production data (90,000 tons in 2011) and export data (120,000 to 140,000 tons).
They represent 25% to 35% of exports in Benin. These lower quality nuts are accused of lowering
the average quality of exports Benin. This information is impossible to verify.

  Another area of uncertainty, we have no reliable information on the destination of exports of cashew nuts and kernels.

The low profitability of plantations in Benin
Almost all cashew nut production comes from small plantations, whose surface varies from 1 to 1.5
ha. Yields are low, to the order of 300 to 500 kg of raw nuts per hectare (ICA 2009) — leaving farms
barely breaking even. However, orchards in Benin are young. Most plantations were established in
the late 90s and today are less than 15 years old (ACA). Reasons for the low productivity of farms
include the use of low yield varieties and the absence of inputs. The introduction of chemical inputs
is controversial, however, as it could create difficulty accessing developed country markets. Poor
farming practices (overly-high tree density, irregular maintenance, poor harvesting and post-harvest
practices) also contribute. One advantage of cashew is that it can be grown in association with annual
crops (soybeans, corn, etc.), but this assumes that plantations are properly cleaned and technical
schedules met, which is rarely the case. Finally, the impossibility of accessing financing is a major
obstacle, in particular in view of the high cost of equipment (graders, scales etc.), transport equipment
like tricycles, and packaging (jute bags), all of which are imported. In sum, one of the key challenges
for the sustainability of the cashew sector in Benin is to increase farm productivity while preserving
the sanitary quality of products.
After the production stage, the industry is divided into two: the vast majority of the product (98%) is
exported in raw form directly, while the rest is processed locally before export. Stakeholders in these
two sub-sectors are different and obey conflicting logics: seeking immediate profit without
investment upstream in the sector for nut exporters; long-term investment in infrastructure, tools and
cooperative relations with organizations of small farmers in the agro-industrial sector.
Raw nut export: an unregulated industry
70% of Beninese nuts are exported to India and the rest to Vietnam and other Asian countries. Exports
are mainly made by Indian exporters, who are relatively few in number but present in all the countries
of the sub-region. They are accused of behaving as a cartel, i.e. agreeing not to compete with each
other and instead putting pressure on producers. Raw nut exporting companies in Benin are mostly
of Indian origin or are subsidiaries of Indian multinationals, with some recycling CFA Francs from
imports of textile and other manufactured products. Other exporters, also from Asian countries,
operate in the informal sector, with practices sometimes deemed "non-professional". More recently,
Beninese companies have also started exporting cashew (Tandjiekpon, 2012).
Regulation of campaigns
Since 2000, the State through the Ministry of Commerce, has set a floor price for producers (200 F
CFA for the 2012/2013 season) and the timing of the season. According to the legislation in force,
only approved collectors are allowed to buy the product from growers. This regulation is intended to
protect small producers from the malpractices of some exporters eager to buy at low prices before
maturity in order to meet international demand. However, neither price nor regulations are respected.
Exporters continue to circumvent the rules and buy directly from producers or through unauthorized
collectors. Even before the official opening of the season, exporters from Asia had moved into hotels
and inns near production sites to negotiate the purchase of nuts directly with producers or groups of
producers (Tandjiekpon 2012). During the season, a myriad of non-professional collectors (tailors,
hairdressers, etc.) invade the sector to buy nuts from planters and sell to "pirate" exporters.
Formation of the producer price
The official floor price is indicative only. The effective field gate price is actually determined by
exporters in terms of the quality of the nuts and the international market. The price paid to the

                                                   96
producer is very volatile within the season. Generally the purchase price is lowest early in the season
(officially March) and higher at the end of the season (May). Exporters of raw nuts are keen to buy
the product before maturity (before the opening date of the season) from indebted farmers in a hurry
to sell. The price is then below the floor price. The price then rises gradually as the season progresses,
in line with the scarcity of the product. But the price cycle is irregular, depending above all on
demand. Thus, in March 2011, at the beginning of the season, the price paid to producers was in some
areas of the order of 400 FCFA/kg, twice the official price (Tandjiekpon, 2012).
From the point of view of producers, who do not know the international market and have no
bargaining power vis-à-vis exporters, the compensation system appears opaque and unfair. This
feeling is reinforced by the absence of a harmonized measurement system. The official price is
expressed in FCFA per kilo, but the measures used to evaluate the quantity of the product vary
according to the region or the buyer (weights, scales, bags bowls, cans, etc.). Unit prices are difficult
to compare and farmers are often victims of fraud concerning quantities. Faced with these
informational asymmetries between buyers and small producers, cooperatives require assistance to
equip themselves with scales from 500 to 1000 kg.
The average price paid to producers in 2013 (Table 18) represents a small percentage (46%) of the
CAF export price of nuts. By way of comparison, Côte d'Ivoire imposed a minimum price on its
cashew producers equal to 60% of the CIF price for the 2013/14 season. Products are collected before
being unloaded from 5 to 10 ton trucks. Transport costs are high because of the dispersion of
plantations and the small volumes (of the order of 300-400 kg per farm). Finally, a road tax of 0.8%
of the customs value is paid on export.
The quality of exported products
The price paid to the producer depends primarily on the quality of the nut, which is determined by
the shelling yield, KOR (Kernel Outcome Result)47 and the number of nuts per kilo. The average
KOR in Benin is around 48 lbs. The characteristics and quality of nuts in Benin vary from one region
to another and remain largely unknown.
On average, Beninese nuts are better than its neighbors, which allows them to be placed on the
international market at a relatively high price (Table 18). The farm gate price is also one of the highest
in West Africa. We note that the best quality is obtained in Guinea Bissau (but also Senegal and
Gambia). Nut quality is an asset for Benin that is important to preserve. Indeed, it seems that the
average quality deteriorates as a result of the importation of lower quality nuts from neighboring
countries (including Nigeria), as well as the bad practices of some traders who blend qualities.
Product quality also depends on harvesting practices. The nut quality is worse if the fruit is harvested
before maturity. The quality is better if the farmer waits for the fruit to fall to the ground before
collecting the nuts, rather than picking the fruit from the tree. However, fruit picking is a fairly
common practice because of the scale of theft and the monetary needs of farmers early in the season.
Indeed, the cashew season, which coincides with the lean period, is a significant source of income
for farmers in this difficult time of year.
To reduce the cost of packaging, Beninese cashew exporters use recycled jute bags imported from
various countries, including Ghana. The use of used bags that keep their original markings, is
detrimental to Beninese products. On the other hand, if contained in bags with no information on the

origin of the product Beninese cashew nuts are then presumed to be re-exports of Ghanaian products.
Beninese cashew products are generally not differentiated from those from other African countries
that are of lower quality, making the traceability and promotion of Beninese products impossible.

Local cashew processing: an embryonic sector
The share of processed production is low and difficult to measure precisely. As in most other West
African countries, the local processing industry is struggling to grow because it is not very
competitive. Shelling nuts is a very profitable business compared to the trade in raw nuts. Companies
are struggling to keep above water in this sector where turnover is high.
The atrophy of the processing sector is explained by the size of input and processing costs and the
lack of use of by-products of cashew. Processing capabilities have recently grown to 6,500 tons, or
nearly 5% of domestic production, with the recent addition of four modern processing plants48 which
were awarded the ACA quality and sustainability label. The Fédération Nationale des Producteurs
d’Anacarde du Bénin (FENAPAB) has 5 plants and 5 small processing units with a total capacity of
12,500 tons.49

13,000 tons.

In spite of tax concessions,50 investment costs remain high in Benin and compound with the weakness
of basic public services, for example the unsustainability of industrial sites. The inadequacy of road
infrastructure and facilities is striking. Connection of factories to the road network is difficult due to
the remoteness of plants, poor road conditions and lack of infrastructure (bridges in particular).
Connection to the national electricity grid is usually impossible in rural areas or too expensive. The
electricity supply is irregular, with frequent interruptions and factories are often forced to work with
their own generators. The workforce is unskilled, poorly trained in company working conditions, and
absenteeism is very high (field work, religious holidays, etc.). To reduce absenteeism and motivate
their employees, some factories have decided to offer a range of services to their staff - canteen,
crèche, first aid, preschool, and transportation services that they cannot find outside the company.
Financing difficulties are clearly a major constraint in the development of the cashew processing
sector. Funding requirements are particularly important in this area because of the concentration of
the harvest in a short period of the year. Processors must have the cash to buy the harvest and store
large amounts of nuts to be processed during the following months. Most processing units do not
have the working capital to enable them to optimally exploit the industrial infrastructure. In general,
bank financing is not adapted to the needs of agriculture and agro-industry. Involving banks in the
agro-industrial sector remains a challenge. There is therefore a significant demand for insurance that
is rarely satisfied or that comes at a very high cost.
There is no place for international trading of cashew kernels and price information is fragmentary.
According to UNCTAD, the average price of WW320 grade kernels (standard gauge corresponding
to whole white kernels) between 1981 and 2004 was approximately $2.49/pound. In March 2013, the
price of grade WW320 varied between 3.3 to 3.45 US$/Lb FOB or 3610-3770 FCFA/kg 51 or almost
10 times more than the price of the raw nuts.
The operators interviewed exported to the USA and Japan. Product quality is controlled by the
Directorate of Quality Promotion and Packaging (DPCQ) under the Ministry of Agriculture and
Fisheries (MAEP) (see below). Samples are sent to the DPCQ, which analyzes them and issues the
necessary certificate authorizing shipment of the products. Until recently, operators preferred to use
a private company, SGS, for the inspection certificate required by the importing country, SGS being
considered more appropriate for determining quality standards, including KOR. This should change
with the creation of the Central Laboratory of Food Safety Control, LCSSA (see below). Excluding
rare exceptions, processors have so far not encountered any problems related to the food quality of
exported products. But the prospect of the spread of chemical inputs among farmers is a real concern
for the future.
The lack of information among Beninese operators on foreign markets (price, tariff and non-tariff
regulations, quality control, etc.) is seen as a major obstacle to the development of their business.
Operators are also poorly informed about tax regulations and the benefits they could receive in tax
concessions (VAT, tariff exemptions, etc.). In addition, the lack of operator training in business
management and marketing is striking. It should also be noted that there is a Benin-Nigeria agreement

on a list of agricultural products and agro-industry that can be exchanged. Cashew is not included,
closing the door to the large Nigerian market for cashew and its derivatives.
The failure to use the by-products of cashew
One of the main factors explaining the better performance of the Asian cashew processing industry
cashew is the use of fruit and processing waste (shells) on the local and international market. This is
not the case in Benin, where only a small part of the fruit of the cashew tree is used for commercial
purposes.
The largest source of waste is probably due to the non-recovery of the cashew apple, which is left in
the fields. The cashew apple is edible and possesses great antiscorbutic qualities due to its high
content of vitamin C. It can be used for making juice, wine or alcohol, but also jams and preserves.
Finally, the rate of machining waste is extremely high. Only the best quality kernel is exported;
broken kernels are not used. Problems related to the non-recovery of the apple and waste are also
found in other countries in the sub-region (Côte d'Ivoire, for example). At the time of writing, there
is no local or regional market for apples or for broken or small kernels.
Part of the shells are recycled in processing plants as fuel, but Cashew Nut Shell Liquid (CNSL), the
liquid extract from the cashew shell, is not carried out in Benin or in other West African countries.
There is however an international CNSL market. The potential uses of CNSL are numerous. It can
be used as a fuel or additive in brake fluids or for the production of varnish and paint. It also has anti-
bacterial and insect-repellent properties and can be used in organic farming. Indians have long
specialized in the shelling of nuts and the CNSL extraction, which requires a certain technical
capacity due to its highly caustic nature. India is currently the leading exporter of this substance,
which it mainly exports to Korea, Japan and Australia.52
The search for sustainable coordination methods between stakeholders in the sector
Compared to the cotton sector where the official price for purchasing from the producer is more or
less met, there are significant coordination difficulties in the cashew sector where price competition
is very strong. Price volatility during the season significantly increases the opportunities for strategic
default on the part of producers (selling side) as well as buyers. Producers do not always come out as
winners in competition among buyers. Most want to develop stable relationships with a buyer, letting
them know in advance the purchase price, the quantity purchased and the quality requirements of the
product.
While the conditions for the development of contractual relations between producers and buyers are
still far from being met, the nascent organization of cashew producers is under way through the
FENAPAB. The FENAPAB, created on 27 January 2006, groups four Regional Cashew Producer
Unions53 (URPA), 43 Communal Cashew Producer Unions (UCPA), 33 of which are functional, and
860 Village Producer Cooperatives (CPV) representing 200,000 households. It is a cooperative
professional organization (OP) governed by the Ordinance of 59/PR/MDRC 12.28.56 and compliant
with the regulations of the OHADA on the right of Cooperative Societies (Uniform Act) in 2012.
The FENAPAB seeks to promote, in consultation with local processors and with the support of the
PROCAD program of the World Bank, the mechanism of grouping together in local Unions. It is
based on an initiative of the Ministry of Commerce in 2003, which until now has not been

developed.54 The principle of grouped sale is: farmers pre-collect, weigh and gather the product at
the level of the village or town. The goal is to sell wholesale to a single buyer and at an average price
higher than that offered to individual producers. It also means avoiding indebted producers having to
offload their product at the beginning of the season.
This mechanism is supported by processors who hope, through this sales system, to establish stable
relationships with producer groups and secure their access to the product. This mechanism also
reduces the number of intermediaries and the cost of collection, passes on a portion of the cost and
risk of storage to producers and makes it possible to handle larger volumes. Transformers and the
FENAPAB are willing to agree on a purchase price and tonnage to be delivered.
Producers have high hopes for grouped sales, but implementation difficulties are significant and
probability uncertain. This type of mechanism requires significant financial resources to cover
advances on sales, collection costs and storage costs. Financing needs can be covered by the use of
funding mechanisms secured by inventory credit (warrantage) or, more simply, by buyers of the
product (processors), something which requires mutual trust. From this point of view, it is not clear
that the grouped sale mechanism provides a solution to the problem of strategic default in an
environment where purchasing competition is very strong, and regulations not respected. Strategic
default or non-compliance by some members of the group may spread to the whole group. Moral
hazard is also on the side of the buyer who may be tempted to disregard its commitments vis-à-vis
the group, for example in the case of falling prices.
Outlook
The outlook for the international market is uncertain. After a boom in prices and global exports, the
market is returning to less rewarding prices. Cashew consumption stagnated for several years in the
USA and Europe, but it is increasing in emerging countries: India, China, Brazil, Russia, but also in
East Asia (Thailand, Pakistan) and the Middle East (Iran).
Demand for Beninese nuts is highly dependent on production in India (the world's largest producer)
and Brazil (fourth-largest). The withdrawal of Indian operators in cases of good harvests in India
could be offset by the slowdown of production in Brazil, whose presence in West Africa is increasing.
One can also expect, when there is a tightening of Indian demand, that Indian importers will favor
good quality nuts such as those from Benin. Moreover, we note that the price of sea freight from
Cotonou to India or Vietnam is no higher than from Maputo or Dar es Salaam, the two major
competing countries of East Africa (see attached table). It is hoped that nuts from Benin will continue
to perform well in the international market place, even if we expect prices to be below 2011 levels.
The decline in the kernel price, however, could seriously threaten the local nut processing industry,
which is already unprofitable, and keep producers in a state of under investment in farms. Productivity
gains must be sought at all stages of the supply chain - production, processing and marketing - which
will require the support of the state in investment and the search for private capital. In this perspective,
the structuring of the sector which has been underway since the mid-2000s is a positive element.
Under-investment in plantations and sub-optimal use of production facilities are not only the
consequence of a system of low-prices, lacking incentives, but also the weakness of institutions
resulting in non-compliance and commitments between sector stakeholders. From this point of view,
the creation in November 2011 of the Conseil National des Transformateurs du Cajou (CNTC) and
in 2013 of the Conseil National des Exportateurs du Bénin (CONEC) is an important step towards a

consolidation of the industry, the establishment of dialogue and relations of trust between
stakeholders. We also note that since 2006, the Beninese sector has been affiliated with the African
Cashew Alliance (ACA), whose current president is Beninese, strengthening Benin's standing on the
international scene. The ACA is a platform for dialogue, discussion and information and promotion
of the industry that gives operators visibility and access to information on the international market.

5.3.2 Pineapple
The pineapple industry is another priority sector for the Beninese government as part of its strategy
to diversify exports. Pineapple is one of the products that create the most added value. The
contribution of the pineapple sector to GDP and agricultural GDP was estimated at, respectively,
1.2% and 4.3% in 2006 (INSAE, 2007). According to data from 2007 (Anasside and Aivodji, 2009),
35% of pineapple production is consumed fresh locally, 15% is locally processed and consumed, 40%
is sold in the markets of the sub-region (Sahel and Nigeria), 2% is exported fresh by air to the
countries of the European Union (France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Italy, Germany, Holland, etc.),
while 8% is converted into dried fruits and exported to the EU
A substantial regional market
Southern Benin has a natural comparative advantage in the production of pineapple because of its
soil and climatic conditions and organoleptic qualities of the fruit. According to the Ministry of
Agriculture, pineapple production has grown exponentially since 2000, from 51,000 tons to 316,000
tons in 2012 ( Figure 78), but is still far from the government target of 600,000 tons in 2015 (PSRSA,
2011).55
Beninese exports of fresh and dried pineapple were 4,415 tons in 2011 (INSAE, according to customs
data), far behind Ghana's exports (46,000 tons) and those of Côte d'Ivoire (64,000 tons). Pineapple is
exported overseas by air, export volumes being too low to recoup the cost of maritime freight. The
construction of a fruit dock at the Autonomous Port of Cotonou (PAC) remains a long-term project
(see MCA). Weak export volumes do not justify investment in this type of infrastructure. In addition,
exports to neighboring countries (Nigeria, Burkina Faso, and Niger) fall for the vast majority within
the informal sector and are not recorded.
There is strong demand for Beninese pineapple in neighboring countries, particularly in Sahelian
countries, which are major consumers of pineapple. But these markets are not well-known to
Beninese exporters. Demand is also high in other countries in the sub-region but the length and / or
costs of transport are prohibitive. Thus, the cost of air freight from Cotonou to Dakar reaches 1,300
FCFA / kg, or more than double the cost of freight to the EU Added to freight costs is the lack of
refrigerated transport, which prohibits exports beyond neighboring countries. Local sales and in
neighboring countries is in bulk without packaging, which reduces the quality of the product
(ARMEN 2012). The main sub-regional market is the Sèmè-Krakè border market on the Benin-
Nigeria border, where Nigerian traders come to buy retail Beninese products. Nigerian wholesalers
also send vans to collect products. According to a survey by the ABEPEC on the border, 80-100
"sheeted vehicles" pass the border of Nigeria every day carrying 1.5 tons of products per vehicle.
Nigerian traders are more likely to buy directly from Beninese producers after ordering ethrelage, but
the risk of these traders breaching their commitments is high (COOPETAB, 2012). Purchasing

standing crop.

The data collected during the assignment allows for an approximate calculation of the remuneration
of different stakeholders in the export sector. The farm gate price of pineapple export at the end of
2013 is estimated at 120 F/kg (€ 0.18 / kg) for the Smooth Cayenne, per quarantine at export quality.
Sugar Loaf is paid less, around 90F/kg (€ 0.14). At the same time, the price paid by the Company
PromoFruit (processor) is 60 F / kg and the price of pineapples for the local market is estimated at 20
to 30 F/kg (Table 19).

According to these fairly rough estimates, the producer's share of the CIF price is low (13% of the
CIF price or 37% of the FOB price) but the export sector appears to be very profitable for the producer
compared to the cost of production and the price paid for pineapples intended for the local market
which is estimated at 20 to 30 F/kg. However, it is necessary to take into account the high quality of
the exported product and higher losses (sort rejects) for products for export, as well as the risk borne
by the producer (risk of the buyer's default).
Constraints
Farm productivity is low: yields of small farms are of the order of 22 tons of fruit per hectare, while
so-called modern farms achieve nearly 70 tons per hectare, according to a study by the Association
de Développement des Exportations du Benin (ADEX) in 2005. Low farm productivity due to
difficulties of access to waste management facilities (Anasside and Aïvodji 2009), the under-
utilisation of inputs and non-compliance with technical schedules.
In the absence of specific pineapple fertilizers, growers use cotton fertilizers (complex fertilizer
NPK). These fertilizers, that do not meet the K/N ratio required for pineapple, are unbalanced. They
affect fruit quality and accelerate the decline in soil fertility (Dagba, 2006). Farmers buy fertilizer
from SONAPRA at the same price as for cotton (two times cheaper than the market), but pay cash.
Their demand is not always met, the supply of cotton being a priority. In addition, they must collect
fertilizer from cotton zones, namely Malainville (Nigerian border) to bring it to the coast. The
fertilizer available on the market, unsubsidized, is considered too expensive, therefore inaccessible.
From the field to Cotonou airport
Pineapple is harvested a few hours before being shipped by air. Given the lack of equipment for
refrigerated transport and storage, time control is crucial. Any delay in harvesting or transportation
to the airport increases the risk of loss of the goods. Producers cut, brush and sort the pineapple.
Pineapple is calibrated before being boxed at the field gate. Crates are imported; they come mostly
from Ghana. The most popular pineapples on the European market are small in size. This results in a
high "sorting waste" which will be sold on the local or regional market at low prices. Pineapple is
transported by non-refrigerated trucks (15 to 20 t) to the airport. Transport of the product is difficult
because of the poor condition of the tracks that lead to the main road (the inter-state highway). It
takes up to three hours to cover 10 -15 km of bad roads before reaching the highway, and about two
hours by road to reach Cotonou (in the case of products from the Allada Plateau). In addition, trucks
cross many roadblocks before reaching Cotonou, and face police harassment at the airport and on the
interstate highway. From the production zone (Atlantique department) to the airport, there are
between 5 and 10 roadblocks. The average cost of a roadblock is about 2000 FCFA/truck (1% of the
value of the merchandise on the purchase price for 10 roadblocks). Added to this are payments in
kind, at roadblocks and the airport.
At the airport: a limited supply of air transport
Once at the airport, the exporter is not assured of being able to ship the product on time. Freight is
provided by "mixed" commercial aircraft (cargo / passenger flights) on scheduled flights (usually Air
France). When there is no space, pineapples must then be sold on the local market at a quarter of the
international export price. As in the cashew sector, the system of weights and measures has failed
entirely. Exporters buy at the farm gate without using a balance or scale for weighing fruits. The
weight is estimated by the buyer, who weighs the fruit by hand. A visual quality control is performed
at the airport by the phytosanitary services of the Direction Nationale de la Protection des Végétaux

                                                    104
(DNPV), which issues the analysis certificate necessary for export. Pesticide residues are not
systematically looked for. The main problem from the point of view of the sanitary quality of fruit is
related to the use of ethrel - whose active ingredient is ethephon - during the production cycle to
obtain the required EU coloring. In cases of overdose, the maximum residue limit (MRL) is exceeded;
in cases of under-dosing, the product lacks the required color. It should be noted that that exporters
are unfamiliar with export formalities (Phytosanitary Certificate and Certificate of Origin).
Local processing
There are a large number of artisanal and semi-industrial processors, but industrial transformers are
few. There is no packaging production unit in Benin for either fresh pineapple, dried pineapple or
pineapple juice. All packaging (bottles, cans, boxes, caps) must be imported, usually from Ghana and
Nigeria. The low productivity of industrial processing units comes mainly from dilapidated industrial
equipment. The juice extraction rate is relatively low and creates significant waste. Similarly,
infrastructure for storage before the processing of raw material is insufficient. The final price of a can
of juice produced locally is higher than a can of juice imported from Asia. The estimated additional
cost is more than 18%. Nevertheless, the product is not the same. Local juice is a natural product56
(100% pure without adding water or dye, sugar or preservatives), which is not the case with
competing imported juice. For now, Beninese juice is sold only on the domestic market. But the local
market in natural juice is limited, with only a minority of consumers appreciating the quality of
natural products. The need for information and training of processors in standards and quality
management, distribution channels and opportunities for pineapple by-products is immense.
Coordination methods in the pineapple sector
As in other sectors, coordination among producer organizations and between organizations of
producers, exporters and processors is difficult to implement. However, institutional progress has
been made since the mid-2000s. Producer Groups come together in Unions Communales de
Producteurs d’Ananas (UCPA), Economic Interest Groups (EIG) or other primary organizations
structured into umbrella organizations. Faced with the lack of effectiveness of the organizational
system, a new attempt at restructuring the sector was launched in March 2012 with the creation of
the COOPETAB (Coopérative de Producteurs, d’Exportateurs et de Transformateurs de l’Ananas et
dérivés du Bénin). This cooperative is the fruit of the project ARGON (CCI – ABEPEC). It is now
supported by ProCAD (World Bank project). COOPETAB is governed by the Uniform Act relating
to the right of cooperative societies of the OHADA. Finally, as in other sectors discussed previously
(cotton, cashew), difficulties of coordination between stakeholders, especially between producers on
the one hand, and processors and exporters on the other, are related to non-compliance with
commitments.
Outlook
International markets are rewarding but difficult to access for Beninese operators, who are penalized
by the cost and risk of air freight in particular. The European market is dominated by varieties from
Central America and Latin America at low prices. Because of its good taste, Beninese pineapple
certainly has the ability to gain export market share while remaining in a narrow niche. By contrast,
the regional market (Sahel, Nigeria) of fresh and processed products seems more promising and more
accessible. Obstacles to the development of trade remain numerous and are largely common to all
agri-food sectors: access to inputs, inadequate public services (roads, etc.), different stakeholders'

access to financing, training and information. Regulation of the sector by strengthening regulatory
and representative organizations is the start a secure business environment in this sector. There remain
significant financing needs, particularly for the fresh pineapple sector, in refrigerated equipment
(coolers, trucks, etc.).

5.3.3 Shea
Shea is among the 13 diversification products adopted by the Association de Développement des
Exportations du Bénin (ADEX). Shea is the 3rd Beninese export product after cotton and cashew. It
is a traditional production sector in Benin, until now mainly focused on the domestic market.
However, over the past ten years, due to the expansion of global demand, kernel and shea by-product
exports have grown. The sector, still unorganized, is poorly structured and suffers from the same
disadvantages as other sectors of Beninese agribusiness, and has its own specific problems.
Nevertheless, the potential of kernel is high and could have a potentially significant drag effect on
artisanal and industrial fabric. In addition, shea is notable for being an important source of income
and employment for women and contributes to the development of the northern regions of Benin and
to balanced regional growth. The sector, abandoned by the Government, has received strong support
from technical and financial partners including USAID and WATH, but also GIZ and HELVETAS
among others.
An unknown sector in statistical terms
Over the past 10 years, the shea sector has experienced strong growth in West Africa. Producing
countries of West Africa are, in order of importance, Nigeria, Mali, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Côte
d'Ivoire, Benin and Togo. For Benin it is estimated that only 40% of potential production is exploited.
There is no updated data on the shea trade since 2005-2006. According to UNCTAD, global exports
of shea nuts increased by 50,000 tons in 1994 to 250,000 tons in 2007. The price increased from $150
/ tons to $400 / tons during the same period. The top three exporters of shea nuts are Burkina Faso,
Ghana and Benin.
This data should be approached with caution because of the confusion often made in international
statistics between various shea products (nuts, kernels, butter), as well as the weakness of statistical
services in producer countries. According to the FAO, Beninese shea nut production was 14,000 tons
in 2012, while production from natural orchard is estimated at 85,000 tons per year, of which 42,000
tons were actually marketed (Riboux, 2012).

There are numerous uses for shea butter. At the local level, butter is traditionally used in rural areas
as kitchen fat. Shea butter is also used in cosmetics and pharmacology. The development of industrial
extraction of shea butter for food is a more recent phenomenon, a result of the change in European
legislation. Since 2003, regulations allow for the introduction of 5% of Fatty Vegetable (FVM) other
than cocoa butter in chocolate production.
Products for the cosmetic market are generally exported in the form of butter. By contrast, products
for the food industry are exported in raw form (kernels) and processed in the consumer countries.
Trade in raw materials accounts for the bulk of international trade in shea. The market for shea kernels
is highly concentrated. The main purchasers and processors of shea kernels are: AAK in Sweden and
Loders Croklaan in the Netherlands, who import 90% of shea kernels (Badini et al. 2011). The other
buyers are 3F in India and ADM in Germany. Finally, 90% of imports of shea nuts are intended for
the chocolate sector.57 The main difficulties the sector faces are related to the lack of organization of
the sector, low volumes, and lack of protection for trees
The upstream chain: gathering and traditional production of butter
Currently, there are no plantations of shea trees in Benin, which is a major problem for the
development of production. Production comes from trees that grow in the wild. The main production
areas are located in the departments of Atacora and Donga, as well as in the departments of Borgou and
Alibori. It is particularly important for the future of the industry to protect the natural park, which is
threatened by uncontrolled felling and forest fires. The varieties currently available take 30 to 35
years to mature, so the renewal of the park involves several generations of farmers. The first challenge
for sustainable development of the sector is to develop the practice of grafting (which improves yields
in the shorter term) to develop fast-growing varieties of trees and fire resistant trees. This type of
long-term investment requires significant involvement by the state.
Picking: very difficult working conditions for women
Across West Africa, gathering nuts and butter production are activities traditionally reserved for
women. From the gathering of nuts to butter extraction, the work done by women is long, painful,
dangerous and most often performed manually. Women must travel long distances to gather fruits in
the forest. Fruits are better quality when they are picked ripe, once fallen on the ground. The fruit is

                                                   107
then transported in baskets or bowls. The cost of collection is particularly high because of the
distances involved, the lack of suitable equipment for transportation (bicycle, tricycles etc.) which
prohibits the transport of large quantities. In addition, women have no means of protection, including
gloves or shoes, and are exposed to snake bites and other injuries when gathering the product from
the bush. The fruit must then be boiled for pulping, and the nuts shelled to extract the kernel. Kernels,
once washed and dried, are processed locally by the women who gathered them or are sold to women's
groups specializing in the transformation of nuts into butter. These groups transform kernels using
traditional methods, while some have some semi-mechanized units (cold pressing unit).
Artisanal processing
Part of the production is processed locally by women to cover the needs of the village in fat products
or to be sold. Kernels are crushed, roasted and finely ground to a paste. The paste is then mixed with
hot water and churned to obtain butter. These operations are also performed by women, often
manually with a pestle and mortar at the village level. There is equipment for the mechanization of
tasks (grinding) but not for churning, one of the most difficult parts of the butter extraction process.
But most nuts collected are sold to wholesalers and collectors, and will be exported raw or processed
in industrial or semi-industrial units.
The export of raw kernels
Wholesalers and collectors buy kernels from women through their network of brokers, directly at the
village level or at markets. The nuts are collected and stored before being sold to local processors or
to international buyers to be exported raw. These are agents or subsidiaries of international companies
in the food and cosmetics industry, based in Europe, Asia or America. The main shea nut exporting
company is Knar-Benin, a subsidiary of the Swedish company AAK, created in 2008, with export
volumes of 10 to 15,000 tons per year. In this sector, as in the cashew sector, Indian buyers are also
present. These are often the same companies that export cashew and shea. These trading companies
buy and sell through an export company. As with casher, buying shea nuts for export recycles
currency (CFA) from the sale of imported products.
Interior transport
The transport of products (kernels or shea butter) from production areas to factories or to the port of
Cotonou is long and expensive because of the poor condition of tracks and roads and numerous
roadblocks. Thus, it takes about 7 hours to cover the 400 km between the production zone in Parakou
and Cotonou, encountering 5-6 roadblocks. The length of transport poses a specific problem for the
conservation of butter because Benin has no transport companies that specialize in the transport of
fresh produce. The easiest and cheapest solution is to package butter in bags of 20 to 25 kg. Another
solution that limits loss during transport is packaging in cans of 25 liters. Unfortunately, cans are
usually recycled products that may have contained toxic materials. The risk of contamination of the
butter is too high for this solution to be widespread. The problem with packaging also arises with
packaging for kernels usually stored in plastic bags, which are unsuitable for this purpose. These
products should be packaged in jute bags. Importing new bags being too expensive, the jute bags used
are used bags imported from Ghana.
Industrial butter extraction
Industrial extraction of shea butter is carried out by using chemical solvents, which allows for higher
yields. Traditional extraction provides a yield of 30% while yield by chemical extraction is 45%
(Infocomm). The main company for the industrial production of shea butter for the food industry is

                                                  108
Fludor, an Irish-owned company, founded in 1996, whose factory is located in the southern part of
the country. Fludor originally specialized in the crushing of cottonseed and soybean for the
production of edible oils. Fludor moved into the shea crushing sector after the crisis in the cotton
sector and difficulties in accessing seed cotton. Shea crushing is now a major activity of the company,
accounting for about one third of its turnover. Fludor has received aid from USAID for its conversion
into shea crushing. It is currently a member of the Global Shea Alliance and is engaged in a process
of HACCP certification. Few operators are active in the exportation of shea cosmetic products to
overseas markets.
Constraints
Fragility of natural capital
Production potential is currently untapped, but it is threatened by logging, forest fires, etc. There is
also concern that pressure on the resource will increase with the opening up of new markets, resulting
in overexploitation of natural resource and land conflicts.
Regulation of campaigns
The State intervenes in the shea sector by setting the opening day of the season and a floor price, as
well as the regulation of various professions. The opening day of the season is considered to be too
late by processors. In fact the season is officially opened after the nuts have fallen, while women have
already started gathering them. Kernels are then stored in poor conditions at the village level, pending
the official opening of the marketing year. Poor storage conditions cause high rates of acidity in the
butter.
It should be noted that neighboring countries, including Ghana and Mali, there is no official opening
date of the shea season. Traders from neighboring countries have therefore already bought before the
season opens in Benin. The Government has also set a floor price for kernels. This price is only
indicative, and is generally not respected, with the price paid to the producer generally being higher
than the floor price. The actual purchase price of the kernel depends on the moisture content, one of
the essential quality criteria. As in other agricultural sectors, exporters cannot purchase the product
directly at the village level and must instead go through approved collectors. These professional
buyers are generally well organized. They organize the removal of products by truck. However, this
measure is perceived by exporters and industrial transformers as an obstacle to their business.
Difficulties in structuring the Beninese sector
The organization of the shea industry is in its infancy. There is no real coordination in the upstream
sector at the level of women's groups that gather and process shea using traditional methods. There
are also no specific organizations of cashew processors and exporters. These professionals are
nevertheless part of the ADEX. On the other hand, under the impetus of USAID, the Association
Karité Benin (AKB) was created in 2011 following the creation of the Global Shea Alliance (GSA).
The purpose of the Association Karité Benin (AKB) is to act as an inter-professional grouping. The
first national conference on shea was held in 2011 and was attended by over 150 industry
professionals. However, this association is struggling to structure itself due to internal conflicts. On
the ground, raw kernel exporters and processors are engaged in fierce competition for the purchase
of raw materials. Processors do not engage in pre-financing of producers. They struggle to secure
their supply in terms of quantity, quality and delivery times. In the end, they are struggling to meet
demand because of uncertainty about access to raw materials.


                                                  109
The positive externalities of the Global Shea Alliance
The Global Shea Alliance (GSA) was created in 2011 with the help of USAID. It brings together
industry professionals worldwide. The GSA is based in Accra, in the premises of the USAID West
Africa Trade Hub. It aims to promote shea and help SMEs improve the quality of their products and
access the international market. Each year, the GSA organizes an international conference on shea.
The fifth annual conference was held in Cotonou in April 2012, reflecting both international
recognition of Benin as a major shea producer and the involvement of Beninese professionals and the
Government (including the ABePEC ) in the development of this sector. Among the Beninese
members GSA are companies such as NATURA ANTEMANA and FLUDOR.
The outlook for the shea sector
Challenges for the sustainable development of the shea sector in Benin are in part the same as other
sectors and solutions will depend on the commitment of the State to support the sector through:
investment in infrastructure, support for the organization of stakeholders and the structure of the
sector, the adaptation of regulations, and support for strengthening the capacity of stakeholders. At
this stage of development of shea processing, the problem is less a matter of opportunities than of
operators' ability to respond to international demand, which requires control of quality, quantity and
deadlines. The need for security of supply and improvement of harvesting and post-harvest practices,
an essential quality factor, once again shows the importance of an effective organization.
However, the Beninese shea sector has at least two characteristics that require special vigilance. On
the one hand, growth prospects in the sector are totally dependent on the proper management of plant
resources, whose renewal period is greater than the life of a farm. It is therefore incumbent on the
State to make every effort to preserve and develop this resource. On the other hand, women are
historically and culturally at the heart of the development of this sector. It is essential for economic
and social reasons, including the fight against poverty and inequality, to ensure that women are not
marginalized or excluded from the process of developing the sector. There is a danger that the
development of the production of shea butter by industrial or semi-industrial extraction will act to the
detriment of production by women's groups. For the sector's growth to be inclusive it is important to
ensure the place of women in professional organizations and representative bodies of the industry.

5.4 Cross-cutting export barriers

5.4.1. Agricultural inputs
SONAPRA has been made responsible for the importation and distribution of inputs beyond the
cotton sector through CARDER and decentralized Ministry of Agriculture (MAEP) services. Inputs
are sold with the same subsidy rate as cotton inputs but they are sold for cash. Despite this, demand
is high and SONAPRA has no difficulty in selling specific inputs. SONAPRA did not have time to
actually redeploy its activities, because, as of the 2012/13 season, it was asked to resume its former
activities in the cotton sector. In 2013/14, SONAPRA was restored to its central role in the
organization of the cotton season (management of inputs, primary marketing, ginning and sales), and
can no longer fulfil its new missions. To fill this gap, the Council of Ministers of December 4, 2013
decided to accelerate the creation of the Centrale d’Achat des Intrants Agricoles (CAIA), in the form
of a mixed economy company, endowed initially with a simple operational structure. This company
will take over operations for the control and distribution of food inputs for the 2014-2015 cotton

                                                  110
season. It is too early to assess this new system’s performance in the purchasing and distribution of
inputs.

5.4.2 Quality control
Currently control of the sanitary quality of food products is divided between many services or
directions of the MAEP and other ministries (Ministries of Health and Trade and Industry in
particular). These services are being consolidated into a new agency, the ABSSA, but this process is
now at a standstill. At least 3 departments are involved in the process of quality control of agricultural
products and foodstuffs: the DNPV, DANA, and the DPQC.
The Direction Nationale de la Protection des Végétaux
This is a department of the MAEP based in Porto Novo with regional offices in CARDER and at
border crossings. Its agents are responsible for monitoring and inspecting all plants imported and
exported. DNPV issues the phytosanitary certificate required for export. This certificate attests to the
absence of parasites on plants and plant products. Because of its lack of resources, DNPV performs
a documentary and visual inspection of products.
 DNPV also has phytosanitary brigades responsible for overseeing risk areas and ensuring protection
against major health scourges (seed-eating birds, crickets, armyworms, etc.). These brigades are
responsible for alerts in case of infestations, the implementation of campaigns or sporadic actions.
There are stocks of pesticides in areas for rapid response but they are mostly obsolete. DNPV is also
responsible for the selection of pesticides and other cotton pests, and training in the use of pesticides.
It can also be mobilized for the distribution of pesticides.
 DNPV has a severe shortage of the necessary material and financial resources to enable phytosanitary
brigades to function effectively and to perform inspections prior to certification. Its premises are old,
it has few operating resources and few qualified personnel. As in the rest of the Beninese public
service, the age pyramid is imbalanced. Retirees are not replaced and public agencies are required to
work with contract staff (often interns).
The Direction de l’Alimentation et de la Nutrition Appliquée (DANA)
DANA, also based in Porto Novo, is responsible for monitoring the sanitary and nutritional quality
of processed food products placed on the Beninese market (locally produced and imported products)
and for the control of exported processed products. For example, it carries out checks for producers
of pineapple juice. It is also responsible for monitoring the nutrition of the population and providing
nutritional education, but has virtually no resources for performing these missions. Prior to export,
the exporter must send a sample to DANA, which performs tests and issues a health certificate.
DANA can also travel to assess hygiene practices during the manufacturing process.
Since 2010, DANA has had no analysis laboratory, the existing one having been demolished.
Physicochemical and microbiological analyses are performed by the laboratory of the Department of
Agriculture (DAGRI) or by IRGB-AFRICA or by foreign laboratories. Depending on the product,
analyses are designed to detect the presence of pesticide residues, food additives, plant protection
products, sulfites, etc. Soon, the samples will be sent to LCSSA for these analyses (see below).
IRGIB-AFRICA is the official partner laboratory of the APRM for pesticide analysis and tests on
fish products. It is supported by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Benin and supports
private sector operators in their agro-food analyses (pineapple, shea, fish, cereals) in formulations

                                                   111
and packaging. Following new EU regulations on pesticides, the IRGIB-AFRICA laboratory has
validated, as of the end of 2009, three analytical protocols and conducted 120 tests determining the
chemical profile of pineapple exported by Benin. It also conducts research and examines dosages of
veterinary drug residues, mycotoxins, heavy metals and physicotoxines.58
Note that there is no Beninese laboratory accredited by COFRAC in the food industry, which greatly
devalues the certificates issued by DANA or other quality control divisions, and is a source of dispute
in terms of results. DANA is present at the border alongside DNPV. It runs documentary checks on
health certificates accompanying the imported product and gives authorization to import. DANA’s
lack of resources in personnel, equipment, infrastructure, etc. is striking. Its place and mission under
the new system are unclear.
The Direction de la Promotion de la Qualité et du Conditionnement des produits agricoles (DPQC)
 DPQC is responsible for quality control of imported and exported raw materials (for example cashew
and cotton). The application for certification is made by the exporter. After testing, DPQC issue the
certificate of quality required for export. Checks are carried out in the region, by CARDER and / or
downstream in the sector in warehouses and stores.
For cotton, agents of the Direction de la Promotion de la Qualité et du Conditionnement (DPQC)
stationed in CARDERs check the quality of seed cotton in primary collection markets at the time of
weighing. Cotton is classified by DPQC as first or second choice. The cotton fiber is then, . ex works,
again classified into different types by SONAPRA grading services, which has the necessary
equipment. DPQC also has a laboratory for physico-chemical analyses, tests on seeds and plants,
aflatoxin of products of plant origin, and infection rates in cereals.
The Agence Béninoise de Sécurité Sanitaire des Aliments (ABSSA) and the Laboratoire Central de
Contrôle de la Sécurité Sanitaire des Aliments (LCSSA)
The Beninese government has decided to establish a single authority, the ABSSA, for the sanitary
safety of all foods (animals, plants, fisheries and processed products) with the support of the Belgian
Cooperation, the European Union (PASP) and the FAO. We note that there is no equivalent of such
an agency at the sub-regional level. This new system involves a major institutional reform. Indeed,
at least five directions or services must merge within the ABSSA: the Department of Farming and
Fishing, DANA, DAGRI and DPQC. In total, there should be 300 people working in this agency.
The process of creating ABSSA was launched in 2010 and its establishing Decree was signed in May
2012. Since then, the project has been suspended. The problems posed by the reallocation of State
agents in the new structure and the choice of management are the main reason for this suspension.
The place and missions of certain services or departments in the new structure is not well defined, as
is the case for example with DANA and ABeNOR (Beninese Agency for Standardization), which is
responsible for drawing up and defining standards. Finally, the independence of ABSSA is in
question. Originally, ABSSA was intended to be an independent agency, but it ultimately became a
sub-directorate of the APRM. At the same time as the creation of the ABSSA, the MAEP built and
equipped the Laboratory for Controlling the Sanitary Safety of Food (LCSSA), which served as the
benchmark laboratory for the ABSSA. The Strategic Plan for the Recovery of the Agricultural Sector
(PSRSA) plans to strengthen existing sectoral laboratories of the MAEP which should specialize in
their specific field.

The LCSSA was functional at the end of 2013. The staff is there, as is the equipment, but the
laboratory has not yet been accredited. With the support of the Belgian Cooperation, the LCSSA was
expected to obtain ISO 17025 certification in 2014. The LCSSA will be the first accredited lab in the
whole sub region, which will give it a regional remit. Its certificates will be valid throughout the sub
region. It will have to conduct analyses for all microbiology and physio-chemistry (pesticides, DDT,
heavy metals, mycotoxins, aflatoxin, etc.). At this stage of the project to create ABSSA, there remain
many grey areas concerning the further restructuring of services involved in quality control.
Currently, these services do not have the resources, manpower or equipment to perform the tasks
entrusted to them for food products: controls in the field, warehouse and point of embarkation. As
things stand, controls are not carried out and when they are, the certificates have little value.
Accreditation of the LCSSA will provide an answer to the problem of certification of exported
products. But a coherent sanitary and phytosanitary policy remains to be defined and the entire
institutional quality system is yet to be structured.

5.4.3. Metrology and packaging
The Agence Béninoise de Métrologie et du Contrôle de la Qualité (ABMCQ) is responsible for
ensuring the uniformity of measures and controlling measurement units. ABMCQ was created in
2009. The foregoing sectoral analyses channels also showed the weakness or absence of weighing
equipment for agricultural products (scales, balances, etc.) especially at the port and the airport, but
also at the level of producer organizations. When these exist, they are rarely checked. ABMCQ does
not have the resources to control weighing instruments used in food chains. The diversity of
measurement systems impairs the transparency of the market, i.e. the informational efficiency of the
market promotes fraud and trade disputes at the local level between producers and buyers, but also at
the international level between exporters and importers. It is also detrimental to the development of
reliable agricultural statistics. A first stage in the process of harmonizing units of measurement may
be to establish a conversion benchmark in weight of volumes sold, made freely available online. The
second would be to move rapidly towards the widespread use of weighing instruments through
financing facilities and investments in public infrastructure at the port and the airport.
Control over packaging of agricultural products exported is the responsibility of DPCQ. The analysis
of the cashew sector has shown that regulation, if it exists, is not applied. Cashew, like shea, is
exported raw in bags recycled from neighboring countries (mainly Ghana). Not only is marking on
recycled bags misleading as to the origin of the goods, but the image of the product is also affected
by poor or cheap packaging. The use of recycled packaging is primarily the result of economizing on
the part of operators. It is also the result of the lack of professionalism of some exporters, who seize
opportunities offered by the international market in the short term without investing in a development
strategy in the longer term. All in all, it is the image of Beninese products which is affected. However,
any development of the rules on product packaging should be performed in close consultation with
the various professions in the sector. It should not, however, burden the competitiveness of exports,
for example through the tightening of regulations on packaging

5.5 Looking ahead
The diversity of the Beninese agricultural sector offers strong growth potential for local industry and
agro-industrial exports. Historically, cotton has been the basis for the development of the Beninese

                                                  113
industrial fabric. Its drag effects on the ginning, crushing and spinning industries are very important
for the Beninese economy. More recently, the processing of fruits and vegetables (pineapples),
cashew and shea provides exciting new perspectives in terms of value creation and export. These
agro-industrial sectors remain fragile and vulnerable to international market fluctuations. This is the
case of the cotton sector, which suffered from low international prices during the 2000s. More
generally, all the markets of agricultural raw materials entered a period of high volatility in the late
2000s. In 2014, these markets were more profitable than they were ten years ago but uncertainty
about future prices remains strong.
Agro-industrial sectors in Benin are also undermined by the weakness of institutions and the legal
and judicial framework. This is particularly true in the cotton sector, which is threatened by the
collapse of the institutional arrangements put in place gradually since 1994, and the brutal eviction
from the private sector of primary processing in 2012/2013. In 2013/14, the entire cotton industry is
once again tightly controlled by the State, from managing inputs to supplying crushers with cotton,
and the organization of transport. Besides the fact that the current mode of organization of the cotton
sector is certainly not the most efficient, the insecurity of property rights created by the brutal
intervention of the State in the sector is not likely to reassure and attract future private investors.
The sustainable development of agro-industrial sectors in Benin therefore entails putting in place a
regulatory and institutional framework for the market to function efficiently. This also involves
strengthening the capacity of stakeholders and investing in public goods and services. The following
recommendations are along these lines, and specifically concern the cashew, pineapple and shea
sectors. The recommendations specific to the cotton sector were presented at the end of the analysis
section on cotton.

5.5.1. Institutions for the development of agro-food chains
The preceding analyses have highlighted a number of failures in the regulatory framework
surrounding transactions within the sectors studied. The areas for improvement that are set out below
should be discussed, clarified and developed for each sector within a framework of consultation
involving all stakeholders and public authorities.
Strengthening of professional and inter-professional organizations
The strengthening of professional and inter-professional organizations is a prerequisite for most
regulatory measures whose purpose is to define the "rules of the game" for the proper conduct of
commercial transactions within sectors. Professional organizations are places of dialogue within each
occupation (producers, processors, exporters). It is essential to strengthen them so that they can play
an active role with the Government in the definition of sectoral policies. Acting as a spokesperson of
interest groups in the sector before the Government, a strong inter-professional association is essential
to change regulations, implement quality discipline, promote products in foreign markets, develop
other sources of added value, but also develop contracts between partners in the sector.
Defining a national quality policy and streamlining the institutional framework for quality
Significant actions have been taken by the Beninese Government to strengthen the sanitary quality of
products placed on the Beninese market, and exported products, mainly through the creation of
LCSSA and ABSSA. It is important that the actions taken in this area are completed. In particular,
LCSSA accreditation allows exporters of food products to offer their customers an internationally
recognized certificate. It is also important that the creation of the ABSSA takes a concrete form. This
                                                  114
is an opportunity, in a context where public resources are scarce, to streamline the institutional
framework and to increase efficiency. Beyond that, it is important that Benin define a national quality
policy that fits into the regional quality policy (ECOQUAL) implemented at the ECOWAS level. The
quality of products is an issue from the field to the final consumer. It is therefore essential to review
the consistency of the overall regulatory and institutional framework for quality and clearly define
the respective roles of the various departments and agencies.
Statistical information system: strengthening agricultural statistics
It is fundamental for the definition and evaluation of agricultural policies to have reliable and efficient
statistical tools. However, the above sectoral analyses have shown that some sectors, such as cashew
and shea, fall totally outside the remit of the current statistical system. Due to a lack of human capital
and material resources, the data collection system is inefficient, and the data unreliable. Efforts are
underway to strengthen the current system with the assistance of the FAO. It is important to continue
to support these activities but also strengthen the collection of data on trade in agricultural products.
Indeed, inconsistencies are numerous depending on the sources (INSAE, Customs, CAP, etc.) so it is
difficult or impossible to properly understand agricultural exports.

5.5.2. Strengthening the capacity of stakeholders and promoting products
Training and information needs are huge and affect all stakeholders in the industry: producers,
processors, workers, traders and exporters. Farmers need to be guided in the choice of technical
pathways, and trained in new practices. The level of education and training of the workforce
employed in processing units is extremely low. Similarly, expertise in business management and
marketing is rare. The focus here is on building the capacity of agents downstream. Indeed,
development projects in the agricultural sector often focus too much on the upstream part of the
sector, the production stage, and ignore the area of marketing and processing. This is the case in the
field of training and access to information, though the needs of stakeholders in the commercial and
industrial sector remain extremely important.
Strengthening the managerial capacity of entrepreneurs
Information needs are immense in the field of tax regulations, customs, labor laws, etc. The poor
mastery of foreign languages, especially English, is also seen as a handicap by many exporters. The
State, with the assistance of ABePEC and / or the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Benin
(CCIB), could develop targeted training elaborated with representatives of professional organizations
that are open to private sector operators and cooperatives in order to strengthen management,
marketing and language skills, etc.
Strengthening systems for information on production techniques and markets
Access to information is a priority for most stakeholders in the industry: access to technical
information on best farming practices, access to market information and external market conditions
(prices, standards, consumer tastes, etc.). It is the responsibility of ABePEC and consular chambers
to provide professional organizations with as much information as possible on production techniques,
markets, etc. and to encourage fact-finding trips to foreign countries that include representatives of
all stakeholders in an industry.

Helping companies obtain quality certification
The Belgian Cooperation supports thirty Benin SMEs in the food sector in the introduction of
international control systems such as GHP (Good Hygiene Practices), GMP (Good Manufacturing
Practices), HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points) and traceability. Among these
companies are producers of pineapple juice, exporters of cashew kernel and shea by-products. This
type of action is obviously very important for their access to foreign markets and should be
encouraged.

5.5.3. Investing in agricultural support services
The development of the agro-industrial sector faces specific obstacles related to the fact that
processing units must, to reduce transport and storage costs, be located near production areas,
therefore in rural areas, where public services are particularly poor.
Strengthening infrastructure and public services in key areas of agricultural production will help meet
the need to not only encourage the establishment and development of food processing enterprises,
but also to increase the profitability of the activities of the sector overall.
