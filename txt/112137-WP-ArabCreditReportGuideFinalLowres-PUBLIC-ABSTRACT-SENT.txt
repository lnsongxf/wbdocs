                                                                The following sections (7.1 to 7.19) give an overview of

recognize that this is not a one-time exercise.

The index intends to:
n	Measure the credit information sharing industry
  development in the MENA countries;
n	 Focus on those parameters (for each country) that
   require attention and effort to progressing toward a
   more efficient credit information sharing  system.

Thus, it is extremely important that this index be maintained
on a regular and ongoing basis. Suggestions to maintain the
index are:
1.	 Work with each country to improve the overall index
    and also specific areas (as detailed in Chapter 8, under
    each country’s subsection);
2.	 Reevaluate the index every couple of years, to get an
    objective reading of progress in improving the credit
    information sharing industry for each country;
3.	IFC and AMF are best positioned to monitor and
   maintain the index;
4.	 Over the next two years, before the next review of the
    index is due (2016), IFC and AMF should continue the
    efforts launched in 2008, which will probably move
    country indices to higher levels;
5.	 There is a need to improve and refine the process of
    collecting information for the index;

n	 The participation and use of the PMACR by lenders
   and borrowers has been increasing over the years. This
   has improved underwriting and risk assessment of
   borrowers, indicated by a decrease in nonperforming
   assets over the years.

RECOMMENDATIONS
n	 Mandate sharing of all information on borrowers, and
   collect consumer consent on inquiries. Efforts should be
   undertaken to create awareness on the need and benefits
   of sharing data with the PMACR;
n	 In absence of a CB, efforts should be made by regulators
   to include as many lending sectors as possible, if
   necessary through a new legal framework, in order
   to give the most reliable and complete borrower risk
   profile.

probability of default (PD) of an SME. Considering the
relevant financial and nonfinancial data, an algorithm based
on a statistical model produces a score that represents the
PD. The model is a mix of quantitative and qualitative data,
with more weightage to quantitative variables.530 The data
used for scoring includes:

9.4.3 CONCLUSIONS
	 In order to increase the effectiveness of the I-Score
n

  initiative, more NGOs need to join the initiative, as
  the data included is marginal considering the size of
  microfinance industry.
	 It is essential to integrate group loans in the credit
n

  bureau as they constitute a significant portion of the
  microfinance portfolio in Egypt.
	 I-Score and MFIs need to reach a sustainable pricing
n

  agreement in order to ensure the continuity of the
  initiative.
	 MFIs should make inquiries to the credit bureau more
n

  frequently in order to see the benefits of utilization of
  the bureau’s services.
	 MFI data inclusion will not only help to strengthen
n

  microlending practices but will also benefit the Egyptian
  financial sector as a whole.
