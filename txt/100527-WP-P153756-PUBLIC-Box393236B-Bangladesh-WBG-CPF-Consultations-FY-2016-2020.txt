Bangladesh’s human development achievements


Bangladesh performed better than expected since independence in 1971
 It will partially achieve MDGs for poverty reduction and primary enrolment, and is on track for gender
  parity in education, child mortality, maternal health, HIV/AIDs and tuberculosis
 This resulted from attention to health outcomes, primary education, family planning, and gender
  equality (especially in education and workforce participation), supported by female grass-roots
  workers and organizers mobilized by the GoB and world-leading NGOs

• Acceleration of the growth rate will require a substantial increase in the rate of investment

• Much of the higher investment will need to be deployed to reduce the infrastructure

Key governance and public sector challenges


•   Divisive and confrontational politics can create policy uncertainty and impede efforts to
    address critical problems requiring long-term engagement
•   Bureaucratic red-tape and widespread rent-seeking impede growth and investment
•   Many Bangladeshi institutions, established when the country was at much lower levels of
    income, are not adequate for a country that joined middle-income status
      o   Many utilities do not operate on a commercial basis
      o   There is no integrated financial management information system
      o   State-owned commercial banks have recently been plagued with several financial scams

SCD Findings: More and Better Jobs Needed for Faster Progress on Twin
Goals

 Jobs top the development agenda in Bangladesh
   o Labor force growing by 3.1 percent per year
   o Output per worker nearly four times higher in industry, services vs. agriculture
       o 45% of workforce in agriculture (which contributes 20% of GDP)
       o 34% in services (contributes 50% of GDP)
       o 20% in industry (contributes 30% of GDP)
   o 21m people projected to enter work force 2015-2025

 Effective public policy needed to help create jobs with higher value
  addition in the economy by:
   o Removing binding constraints to growth
   o Promoting conditions for strong private sector-led growth job creation

 SCD identifies priority areas of action for policymakers:
   o Transformational Priorities: key public policy areas where concerted action over
     next 3-5 years could have marked impact on progress toward twin goals
   o Foundational Priorities: pre-requisites for faster job creation and growth--areas
     where Bangladesh has done generally well and must sustain that progress
