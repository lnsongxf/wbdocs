I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
       Assist the World Bank Group in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in
        Malaysia perceive the Bank;
       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Malaysia regarding:
             Their views regarding the general environment in Malaysia;
             Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in Malaysia;
             Overall impressions of the World Bank’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
              work and activities, and communication and information sharing in Malaysia;
             Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in Malaysia.
       Use data to help inform Malaysia country team’s strategy.


II. Methodology
In May-August 2013, 287 stakeholders of the World Bank in Malaysia were invited to provide
their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country survey.
Participants in the survey were drawn from the office of the President; the office of the Prime
Minister; office of a minister; office of a parliamentarian; ministries, ministerial departments, or
implementation agencies; local government officials or staff; bilateral and multilateral agencies;
private sector organizations; the financial sector/private banks; NGOs; the media; independent
government institutions; trade unions; academia/research institutes/think tanks; the judiciary
branch; and other organizations. A total of 74 stakeholders participated in the survey (26%
response rate).
Respondents received questionnaires via post and email and returned them accordingly.
Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Malaysia; their overall attitudes toward the
World Bank; the World Bank’s effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge work and
activities; the Bank’s future role in Malaysia; and the Bank’s communication and information
sharing in Malaysia.
Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the World Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are
identified throughout the survey report.
A. General Issues Facing Malaysia: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Malaysia is
   headed in the right direction, and what they thought were the top three most important
   economic and social development priorities in the country.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in Malaysia, Bank staff preparedness to help
   Malaysia solve its development challenges, their agreement with various statements
   regarding the Bank’s work, and the extent to which the Bank is an effective development
   partner. Respondents were asked to indicate the Bank’s greatest values and weaknesses, with
   which stakeholder groups the Bank should collaborate more, and to what reasons respondents
   attributed failed or slow reform efforts.
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps achieve economic and social development results, the extent to which
   the Bank meets Malaysia’s needs for knowledge services, and the Bank’s level of
   effectiveness across sixteen development areas, such as public sector governance/reform, job
   creation/employment, private sector development, education, and economic growth.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge: Respondents were asked to indicate how frequently they
   consult Bank knowledge work and activities, to rate the effectiveness and quality of the
   Bank’s knowledge work and activities, including how significant of a contribution it makes
   to development results and its technical quality.
E. The Future Role of the World Bank in Malaysia: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the Bank should play in Malaysia in the near future and to indicate what the
   Bank should do to make itself of greater value.
F. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, and their usage and evaluation of the Bank’s websites and e-
   services. Respondents were asked about their level of agreement that they know how to find
   information from the Bank, that the Bank’s websites are easy to navigate and useful, and that
   the Bank is responsive to information requests.
G. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, and their
   exposure to the Bank in Malaysia.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
       For further analyses, a small number of respondents from the financial sector/private
        banks were combined with those from private sector organizations; and the few
        respondents from the Office of the President, the Office of the Prime Minister, office of a
        minister, local governments, independent government institutions, bilateral agencies,
        NGOs, and the media were included in the “Other” category. There were no respondents
        from office of a parliamentarian, multilateral agencies, trade unions, or the judiciary
        branch.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank’s overall effectiveness
and ratings of its ability to help achieve economic and social development results in Malaysia,
bivariate correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty four
specific areas of effectiveness.
Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results increase.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results.
       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Malaysia. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
                The Bank’s effectiveness at job creation/employment;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at social protection;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at economic growth; and
                The Bank’s effectiveness at women’s economic opportunities.
       Achieving Economic and Social Development Results: Those specific areas with the
        highest Pearson Product-Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely
        related to perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in
        Malaysia, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of
        perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
                The Bank’s effectiveness at social protection;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at economic growth;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at job creation/employment; and
                The Bank’s effectiveness at women’s economic opportunities.
