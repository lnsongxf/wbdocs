Executive Summary

1.      The objective of this report, financed by the World Bank’s Energy Sector Management
Assistance Program (ESMAP), is to provide a deep analysis of two key areas of the electricity
sector in order to support the overall development of the sector and its institutions in the post-
independent Republic of South Sudan (RSS). The focus areas are:

   (i)     An analysis of the distribution network in Juba in support for possible support under a
           distribution network rehabilitation investment project, and

   (ii)    An investigation of the capacity building needs for sector institutions, including
           identification of short and long term training programs and associated activities.

2.      The two focus areas are described in separate sections of the report below. This report is
complimentary to the South Sudan Electricity Sector Strategy Note (ESSN, Report Number
ACS3585, April 2013), which describes the overall sector, the key challenges it faces, and
recommends measures to support sector development. As such, the scope of this report is limited
to description of the two areas, as above. These issues will be further investigated and support for
their development will be designed under the proposed Energy Sector Technical Assistance
Project (ESTAP).

Background

3.      As South Sudan embarks on a process of rebuilding its economy to foster growth and
development, the challenges it faces are enormous. Most of the development related indices in
the country are amongst the lowest in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and the core infrastructure is in
its infancy. South Sudan’s estimated gross domestic product (GDP) is about US$10 billion with
a population of 8.3 million. A large country of 647,095 sq. km, South Sudan possesses
considerable natural resources (oil and gas, hydropower, etc.). However, despite abundant
resources, at present, demand for electricity vastly outpaces supply (electricity access rate is
estimated to be around about 2 percent).

4.       Most of the electricity generation is based on thermal resources (diesel, heavy fuel oil),
which is very expensive (average generation cost is about US$0.70/kWh). Due to the low access
rate, most of the population relies on burning biomass as their primary energy source for
cooking, lighting, etc. Those who do have access to electricity experience unreliable quality of
service (outages and disruptions) and yet, end up paying some of the highest average electricity
tariff rates on the continent (average tariff is US$0.25/kWh) which is still below cost recovery
level. To promote growth and prosperity through efficient use of resources, the Government of
Republic of South Sudan (GRSS) announced the South Sudan Development Plan (SSDP),
including plans for key sector investments.

Key Findings for Distribution Network in Juba

5.      Presently, South Sudan has an installed capacity of 22MW in three isolated distribution
networks (in major commercial centers) totaling 15km in length which experiences high system
losses (around 35-40 percent). In FY2013, 22,000 customers consumed about 70GWh of energy
(per capita consumption of about 10kWh). The current demand including a substantial amount of
suppressed demand and the projected future demand cannot be met through the existing power
generation and distribution system in Juba. The near term supply prospect for power supply in
the Juba distribution area is based on the 40MW hydropower plant at Fula Rapids. As an
emergency measure to rehabilitate the existing network and to absorb the possible supply from
the Fula Rapids power, immediate investment is required. This report provides a
recommendation of the technical equipment and the size and scale of the infrastructure needed to
boost the Juba distribution network. Further analysis will be covered under a country wide power
sector least cost investment plan study, proposed under ESTAP.

6.      Based on the analysis conducted and discussions with stakeholder on the requirements, it
has been found that the main technical investment required would be: two 33/11kV substations
of capacity 2x10/14 MVA each. It is also necessary to take immediate action to replace faulty
equipment along with the installation of source lines, feeder lines, distribution transformers,
capacitor banks, service cables, meters etc. This should be supplemented by operation and
maintenance contracts, as well as training on system administration for SSEC and MoEDIWR
staff. There is also an urgent need to support further technical and commercial loss reduction and
efficiency improvement in the system, including new ecosystem of pre-paid meters.

Key Findings for Capacity Building

7.       The Ministry of Energy and Mining (MoEM), established in 2009, had the responsibility
of policy development and sector planning for the petroleum, energy and minerals sector.
However, in the post-independence era, the MoEM was changed to the Ministry of Electricity
and Dams (MoED) and was later merged with another ministry to form the Ministry of
Electricity, Dams, Irrigation, and Water Resources (MoEDIWR). The main sector utility is the
South Sudan Electricity Corporation (SSEC). An Electricity Bill was drafted; however, it is yet
to be updated and ratified in light of the new ministries and other institutional changes. The
clarity of roles and responsibilities of the institutions has not been achieved. Overall, the capacity
of all of the sector institutions is severely lacking.

8.       In order to investigate the specific capacity building requirements, a survey was
conducted of the main sector stakeholders that included both quantitative and qualitative
responses. The survey captured an understanding of the current operations and the need for
addressing training of the staff and officials. Based on the findings of the survey, high priority
areas were identified as: generation/transmission and sector planning, along with regulation,
distribution management, and human resource development. A large percentage of the
respondents gave the highest priority on establishment and implementation of modern
transmission systems followed by other areas such as operation and maintenance of generation
facilities, expansion of transmission and planning process of regional interconnections, and
establishment of grid network.

Section I: Analysis of Distribution Network in Juba

Introduction

9.      This section of the report aims to provide an analysis and propose specific technical plans
for investment in the Juba distribution network to carry out emergency upgrades (as a short term
measure) and to enable it to absorb possible power that is foreseen to be delivered from possible
increase in supply (such as, through the Fula Rapids HPP). The report firstly explains the current
Juba grid status, followed by the approach undertaken by the study. Then, it presents the result of
gap analysis, concluding with the distribution investment plan and its necessary measures to
achieve the target. It is to be noted that in the medium term, a detailed least cost investment plan
(LCIP) for the country (planned under ESTAP) will be developed which would provide
comprehensive methodology as well as an assessment of appropriate technical standards to be
incorporated in development of the South Sudan electrical grid network.

Current Status of the Juba Grid

10.      Juba is the capital of South Sudan as well as the nation’s center of economic activity. It is
situated on the banks of the Nile River with a population of 0.37 million. 1 Juba’s existing
electrical distribution system consists of 11kV overhead lines of about 15km and has connected
around 10,000 consumers through generally outdated post-paid electromechanical meters and a
limited number of pre-paid digital meters. At present, it has electric supply system is based on 13
fossil fuels (mainly diesel or HFO) based generators with rated capacity 17MW.

11.    Due to lack of spare parts and proper maintenance, many of the generation plants are out
of order and the existing infrastructure is unreliable with high system losses (estimated to be 35-
40 percent). As a result of this, the available generation capacity of SSEC is very limited
(estimated to be around 12MW). In addition, the distribution network’s coverage and capacity is
also inadequate. The meagre infrastructure of power distribution system, its operation and
schedule maintenance, and irregular supply of fuel are compelling the Juba’s electricity users to
rely on self-generation (using standby generators). This results in in high cost of electricity and
environmental pollution. In addition, the technical expertise required for installing, operating,
and maintenance of a proper electric distribution system is not sufficient.

Technical Assessment Approach

12.    To assess the present status and future need to improve power distribution system of
SSEC, an energy expert mission visited Juba twice, from April 26 to May 10, 2010 and from
July 14 to July 20, 2013. During these visits, the mission met with key officials in the relevant
government agencies – the Ministry of Finance, Commerce, Industry, and Economic Planning
(MoFCIEP), MoEDIWR, SSEC, as well as stakeholders from the private sector, the University
of Juba, and development partners. Specified questionnaires were prepared for all the relevant
stakeholders of electricity and systematic research on the findings from the visits were carried
out.

Issues and Challenges Related to the Sector

13.     A key shortcoming of the sector is that the only legal document for the electricity sector
is the Southern Sudan National Electric Sector Policy (NESP), 2007. There is another draft
document, namely, Electricity Bill 2013, which has not yet been enacted. There is no formal
Electricity Act, economic tariff structure, or power grid code. In the absence of legal and
regulatory underpinnings, an electrical distribution entity cannot run smoothly.

14.    In Juba, the overall electrical power system is owned by MoEDIWR and is operated by
SSEC. MoEDIWR has a total of 336 employees and SSEC has 745 employees. 2 There is a
general lack of clarity in roles and responsibilities of the sector institutions.

15.     The sector also suffers from the lack of financial / budgetary autonomy for sector
investments (both of the entities rely on central budgetary allocations for financial support for
capital and operational expenses). SSEC collects the revenue for the electricity consumers and
the revenue is then adjusted centrally within the MoFCIEP budget. When any kind of
expenditure is required, the fund is collected from MoFCIEP, causing delay in emergency
procurement of spare parts and fuel for generating plant, substations, and distribution lines.
These delays result in significant damages of plants and lines, cause power outages, and
complete dissatisfaction of consumers. To overcome these problems, SSEC must be autonomous
and have its own available fund to meet its operational and maintenance expenses.

16.      To develop SSEC as a profitable and autonomous electrical distribution entity, the tariff
structure needs to be prepared in such a way that it complies with the full cost of delivery. In
fact, if quality of electric supply is improved, the potential consumers must take the opportunity
to get connection from SSEC, as they are generating their own electricity which costs much
higher than that of a larger power plant. Existing electricity tariff is not based on full cost
recovery parameters. In addition, its collection ratio of bills falls below 50 percent due to various
reasons, such as inappropriate installation and improper maintenance of energy meters, irregular
maintenance of the meter readying system, and irregular distribution of bills.

17.     Presently, SSEC has only three prepaid card recharge point for the pre-paid meters in
operation. In the distribution system of SSEC, about 2,500 electro-mechanical meters have been
installed in consumer’s premises that generally suffer from poor maintenance standards. 3 For
these post-paid meters, the meter reading system is not maintained properly, causing delays in
preparation and distribution of bills.

18.     Due to lack of regular operational activities, consumers are not paying the bill but no
remedial actions are being taken against these consumers. There is a provision for imposing
penalty for adopting unfair means but enforcement is very rare. SSEC does not have sufficiently
trained human resource based to operate an electrical distribution system smoothly.

Grid Development Plan

19.    South Sudan could reach peak demand of nearly 100 MW with energy sales of nearly 200
GWh in the coming years (Table 1 below), based on the GRSS’s targets (from Electricity Sector
Strategy Note for South Sudan, 2013).

      Source: The World Bank (Data from SSEC and the South Sudan Development Plan)

20.     At present, the demand including a substantial amount of suppressed demand as well as
the projected future demand cannot be met through the existing power generation and
distribution system in Juba. As such, the near term supply prospect for power supply in the Juba
distribution area is based on the 40-MW hydropower plant at Fula Rapids. As an emergency
measure to rehabilitate the existing network and to absorb the possible supply from the Fula
Rapids power, immediate investment is required. This report provides a recommendation of the
technical equipment and the size and scale of the infrastructure needed to boost the Juba
distribution network.

21.     Based on the analysis conducted and discussions with stakeholder on the requirements, it
has been found that the main technical investment required would be: two 33/11 kV substations
of capacity 2x10/14 MVA each. It is also necessary to take immediate action to replace faulty
equipment along with the installation of source lines, feeder lines, distribution transformers,
capacitor banks, service cables, meters etc. This should be supplemented by operation and
maintenance contracts, as well as training on system administration for SSEC and MoEDIWR
staff. There is also a complementary need for commercial loss reduction and improvements in
efficiency of the system, including introduction of a new pre-paid meters with supporting
systems and procedures. These elements will be further investigated and designed under an
upcoming World Bank funded Energy Sector Technical Assistance Project (ESTAP).

Formulation of Technical Standards and Constitution for Grid Code Development

22.     As an electrical utility of a new nation, SSEC, as yet, does not have standards,
specification, design and drawing to provide quality electricity to consumers. During installation,
the supervisor of SSEC will ensure quality and standard of the materials and equipment.
Employees of SSEC should be well trained to do so. Technical standards and specifications of
distribution system components are of utmost need for this type of organization.

23.    In a power system, the Grid Code is an important document that establishes procedures
for operations of facilities that will be used in the power system. It lays down both the
information requirements and the procedures governing the relationship between the relevant


                                                6
entities. It is recommended that the development of a Grid Code be further investigated in the
ESTAP.

Key Findings and Recommendation

24.     By assessing the requirement of Juba’s electrical distribution system, it was found that
the establishment of a long-term LCIP (power sector master plan) is critical. In addition, the
improvement of the power generation, the development of technical and commercial loss
reduction practices, human resource, grid code, training manuals, and operation and maintenance
manuals, etc. are the requirements for efficient planning, installation, operation, and maintenance
of electricity distribution grid. The capacity development of SSEC as a good distribution entity is
very important to meet current market demand and future expansion of distribution system.
Following key technical measures in the short term are recommended:

    Retaining an Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contractor of
     distribution system in Juba for procurement of the 33/11 kV power distribution
     substation, 33kV source line, 11kV, 11/0.4kV, 0.4kV feeder line and installation of
     service cable and consumer’s meter through EPC contractor. At present, SSEC is not in
     the position to prepare engineering design, specification, estimate, procurement plan, and
     construction of such a system.

    Training and Development of Human Resource: Human Resource development for
     smooth operation and maintenance of distribution system. Professionalism for the system
     and commercial operation in SSEC has not been developed yet. As such, in Juba, there is
     an enormous scarcity of skilled human capital to operate and maintain a quality electrical
     distribution system. Many generating stations from past projects of SSEC in Juba are now
     out of order due to lack of maintenance and other issues. Thus, a human resource
     development plan should be implemented during distribution grid development project.
     As an electrical utility of a new nation, SSEC, as yet, does not have a technical standard
     design and specification.

    Consultancy support to prepare an organogram, grid code, distribution code, tariff rule,
     etc. for electricity generation, transmission, and distribution is required. Procurement of
     tools and equipment for power system operation and maintenance and software to project
     management, GIS and System analysis is also required.

25.     To achieve a base electrical distribution system to meet the preliminary demand of Juba’s
electricity market (Table 2). The total estimated cost of proposed project would be USD50.32
million (detail in Table A1, Annex A).

Expected Outcomes

26.    Should the recommendations be implemented, the SSEC’s distribution capacity will
increase to 56MVA which could serve about 25 thousand consumers of Juba with 150km of
11kV, 11/0.4kV, 0.4kV overhead feeder line from 2 units 2x10/14MVA substations with 20 km
double circuit 33kV Source line. In addition, under the scope of proposal, SSEC would also
procure certain management tools such as, billing software, project management software, GIS
software, and system analysis software for efficiency improvement. Training on relevant topics
for development of human resources of MoEDIWR and SSEC should also be incorporated.
Furthermore, efficient organogram, grid code, distribution code, tariff rule, training module, and
operation and maintenance manuals of the power system should be developed.

27.     Figure below shows a map of the proposed two distribution substations with overhead
33kV source. The 33kV sub-transmission line for the source of 33/11kV substations need to
cross the White Nile river twice, which may be problematic. A river crossed sub-transmission
line has been proposed. It needs to be further investigated during engineering part of the EPC by
using tower mounted overhead lines.

28.     To distribute electricity to the consumers of Juba, 33kV will require to be stepped down
to a distribution voltage level of 11kV. At the same time, an 11kV feeder needs to be constructed
around the city. The proposed 33/11kV substation may be designed as shown with the single line
diagram in Figure below.

Section 2: Capacity Building Needs Assessment

Objective

29.    This section of the report aims to provide a gap analysis of energy sector’s capacity in
South Sudan in order to increase the overall performance of the sector. The World Bank, in
collaboration with the GRSS developed an ESSN in April 2013 to provide a broad-level
discussion of key issues in energy sector, comprehensive analysis of development challenges,
and a structure for strategic interventions for sector-wide growth. The note identified capacity
building as a high priority area.

30.    The need for capacity-building in the electricity sector is a pre-requisite for efficient
addition of generation capacity, development of transmission and distribution networks, and
improvements in customer service.

Background

31.     The South Sudan Development Plan (SSDP) describes four pillars of the Government’s
growth agenda; energy sector related targets are outlined in the economic development pillar.
The objective of this pillar is to achieve diversified private sector led economic growth. The
target calls for an extremely ambitious investment program of US$0.7 billion for the electricity
sector as a key driver of growth in South Sudan. None or very little of the ambitious target has
been achieved due to lack of funds and lack of capacity to implement the programs.

32.    The MoEDIWR and the SSEC have requested funds from developing partners for the
following activities: for rehabilitation of existing but outdated power plants, for distribution lines
in Juba, for the development of Fula Rapids Hydro Power Project with an installed capacity of
40 MW. In addition, MoEDIWR is also seeking assistance with the Export-Import Bank of
China for the extension of power lines from Ethiopia to the eastern region of South Sudan, as
well as long-term plans to construct a dam south of Juba. MoEDIWR has also held discussions
with partners in India about building a 150-300 MW power plant in Wau.

33.     The MoEDIWR is responsible for overall sector policy and strategy and will also be
involved at a hands-on level for major projects in transmission (anything above 33kV) and other
large hydropower and regional integration projects. SSEC is deemed to be an autonomous
national utility acting as a public sector undertaking (PSU) – which is yet to be defined clearly
under prevailing law. At the moment, it functions as a unit of the MoEDIWR with all its
expenditures and revenues being rolled up into the Ministerial budget. SSEC will be involved in
electricity generation, transmission and distribution, and access related projects in South Sudan
along with its current role of operations and maintenance.

34.     The proposed Electricity Bill identifies and clarifies the roles and responsibilities of the
work institutions and will provide guidance on how to regulate the generation, transmission, bulk
supply, distribution, supply, export and import of electricity, and system operations within the
territory of South Sudan. The current organization of the sector institutions is presented below.

Assessment Approach

35.     The assessment was carried out over several missions during January and February 2013,
to carry out an assessment of capacity-building needs of the South Sudan Electricity Sector. The
mission met with key officials in the relevant government agencies – the Ministry of Finance,
Commerce, Industry, and Economic Planning (MoFCIEP), MoEDIWR, SSEC as well as
stakeholders from the private sector, the University of Juba, and development partners.

36.      A survey questionnaire was developed and sent to MoEDIWR, SSEC, and other relevant
organizations to assess the needs of capacity building in South Sudan’s electricity sector. The
questionnaire provided for both quantitative and qualitative responses. The survey included three
main groups involved in the sector: (i) MoEDIWR, (ii) SSEC, and (iii) off-grid utilities, such as
Kapoeta Electric Company limited (KAPECO) and Maridi Electric Company Ltd. (MECO). In
addition, faculty members from the University of Juba were included in the survey considering
their likely involvement in providing local training. The questionnaire attempted to capture an
understanding of the operation and potential of the human resource management by addressing
strategy and organization, training of the staff and officials at home and abroad and availability
of training facilities. The questionnaire asks the respondents to identify their priorities and to
suggest the resources required.

Identified Priority Areas for Capacity Building

37.    Based on the findings of the survey, high priority areas were identified as: improved
sector planning (generation and transmission), along with regulatory issues, distribution
management, and human resource development. A large percentage of the respondents gave the
highest priority on establishment and implementation of modern transmission systems followed
by other areas such as operation and maintenance of generation facilities, expansion of
transmission and planning process of regional interconnections, and establishment of grid
network.

38.     Institutional priority areas for future capacity building identified by MoEDIWR, SSEC,
off-grid Utilities, and University of Juba are mentioned below (The chart of each institute is
shown in Section 2, Annex A). The survey data show that MoEDIWR, SSEC, off-grid utilities,
and University of Juba respondents have some similarities in terms of high, moderate and low
priority areas for future capacity building, while each places its priority in unique areas.

39.     While MoEDIWR perceives overall electricity sector planning, transmission and
distribution of electricity, and generation capacity to be the highest priorities for future capacity
building, SSEC places highest priority on the operation of generation and transmission facilities
and their expansion and modernization according to the findings of the questionnaire. According
to the findings of the questionnaire, off-grid utilities place highest priority on establishment and
implementation of modern transmission system, along with other areas such as the overall
implementation of renewable energy systems and the establishment of procurement design and
process, while the University of Juba placed highest priority on electricity sector policy for
capacity building plans.

Key Challenges Facing the Sector

40.   Along with the above capacity development priority areas, some of the major institutional
weaknesses of South Sudan electricity sector were observed through the survey.

41.     The Southern Sudan National Electric Sector Policy (NESP) has been developed by the
Ministry of Housing, Lands, and Public utilities (MHLPU) and was approved by the Council of
Ministers on May 9, 2007, before the independence of the Republic of South Sudan. Its
objectives are to define effective electric sector institutional relationships, to establish a new
regulatory authority to balance the interests of the consumers and electricity service providers,
and to define funding mechanisms to finance electric investments by the Government of
Southern Sudan. Although the policy has been passed, it has not realized its objective, waiting
for the draft electricity bill to be enacted. There is also a lack of clarity on roles and
responsibilities of various agencies in the electricity sector of the country.

42.     Currently, there is no electricity sector master plan for South Sudan and the absence of
master plan can inhibit long-term, strategic decision-making as well as impede the expansion of
least cost power system.

43.      The electricity sector suffers from a massive capacity gap like many other sectors. In
South Sudan, the MoEDIWR is responsible for overall sector policy and strategy. On the other
hand, the SSEC is treated as an autonomous national utility acting as a public sector undertaking
(PSU) and reports directly to the minister. However, the overall capacity of all the sector
institutions is severely lacking.

44.     Since SSEC maintains single-entry bookkeeping system like most of the state owned
organizations, they are unable to produce final accounts such as Income Statement, Cash Flow
Statement and Balance Sheet. Unlike many other electricity sector companies, SSEC does not
report net profit or net loss. Preparation of a comprehensive financial statement and effective
financial management is also crucial for the SSEC towards corporatization.

45.     There is no particular training center or training school in South Sudan where the
electricity sector officials and technicians can be trained regularly on effective and efficient
operation and management of the electricity sector facilities. Further, inadequate supply of goods
and equipment for the trainees and the trainers hinder the opportunity to create competent pool of
electricity sector personnel.

46.     Many of the officials of various South Sudan Electricity Sector agencies lack proper
theoretical and practical field training, including on-job, and on-site training. The majority of
them have not attended any seminars, workshops, or other types of training programs related to
electricity generation and operation of facilities such as: online training, simulator training, or
management training either in South Sudan or abroad.




                                                20
Proposed Capacity Building Strategy

47.     The following summarizes the capacity building strategies recommended to remedy the
weaknesses identified during the assessment of the South Sudan electricity sector, using common
as well as institutional priority areas, which were identified by the sector’s organizations through
the questionnaire survey, as its guiding principle:

48.    Consulting services, training, and other capacity building measures together with the
necessary tools and equipment should be provided to:
     To build overall institutional capacity of the electricity sector at government, organization
       and institutional, service, and individual level.
     Create effective capacity within government, particularly Ministry of Electricity and
       Dams (MoEDIWR), to put in place electricity sector policies, electricity sector planning,
       and regulation strategy needed for the development of South Sudan electricity sector.
     Strengthen the management of South Sudan Electricity Corporation (SSEC) to manage
       and to operate the sector efficiently.
     Strengthen the management of off-grid utilities (as they develop) to manage and to
       operate the decentralized and off-grid electricity system.
     Create the competent personnel within the electricity sector related entities.
     Improve the internal financial controls within the entities of the electricity sector.

49.      The following major strategies for electricity sector are recommended:

       Better coordination among institutions between MoEDIWR and SSEC:
        Under the current laws of South Sudan, the roles of these institutions are not clearly
        defined and there are no coordination mechanisms in place. This issue needs to be more
        carefully examined, looking at the coordination between institutions involved in policy
        making and operation. Electricity sectors in neighboring countries such as Sudan,
        Ethiopia and Uganda should be studied as well.

       Establishment of a the Project Management Unit (PMU):
        Project Implementation Units are dedicated management units designed to support the
        implementation and administration of investment projects or programs. PMU should be
        made up of representatives from SSEC and MoEDIWR.

       Electricity sector policy:
        The focus should be on creation of adequate legal framework, preparation of power
        sector master plan, and other policy related issues.
        (i)     Preparation of adequate legal framework: A comprehensive and complete legal
                framework needs to be prepared focusing on public policy goals, drafting of
                legislation, contract and legal agreement for projects, increasing generation
                capacity etc. Enactment of the draft electricity bill through a consultative process
                involving key stakeholder needs to be accelerated. Additionally, the roles of
                various agencies in the electricity sector have to be clearly defined.
        (ii)    Preparation of electricity LCIP or sector master plan: An electricity sector master
                plan / least cost investment plan needs to be developed for South Sudan.

                                                 21
    Electricity generation from sustainable sources
     The country has high prospects of generating electricity from renewable and sustainable
     sources such as solar energy, biomass, wind power, geothermal energy, hydropower, and
     biogas. The cost of electricity generation as well as transmission will be minimized if
     sufficient amount of electricity can be produced from these renewable sources.

Human Resource Strengthening

50.     Support should be provided to SSEC to improve its overall financial and managerial
efficiency. Development of SSEC as a corporate structure should include the following.
     Prepare documents such as: business models, organizational structure, etc., highlighting
        the policy, regulatory and company level actions necessary to underpin the successful
        turnaround of the companies.
     Develop the actions necessary to revitalize the human resource base. An HR expert can
        be used to better define such roles of different staff levels.
     Design specific corporate and management structure and define competencies to improve
        the efficiency, accountability and customer orientation of the company.
     Secure the management expertise needed to improve enterprise performance under
        suitable terms and conditions).
     Restructure the financial reporting system to improve the internal control and public
        accountability arrangement.

Training and Other Capacity Building Needs

51.     Areas of training should include planning and design of infrastructure projects, project
implementation, procurement management, financial management, management tools and
systems, and environmental and social impact mitigation, etc. Establishment of training
infrastructure should be given the utmost importance.

    Training infrastructure: This facility will require a building, fixtures and fittings,
     equipment, computers (including software), air-conditioners, photocopiers, projectors and
     screens, consumables etc.

    Training of trainers (TOT): Training of trainers should be provided to help the
     development of necessary training programs, operation manuals, and guidelines. A list of
     important training centers in the region and the relevant courses offered by these
     institutions are attached in Annex B. Seminars, workshops or other type of training such
     as online training, simulator training or management training should be arranged for the
     trainers. Trainers trained abroad will provide in-house training for utility officials based
     on the training manuals and materials provided in the TOT courses.

    Training of power sector officials and technicians: Training should be provided to the
     power sector officials and technicians taking into account other on-going training
     programs. Seminars, workshops, and other type of training such as online training,
     simulator training or management training could be arranged.



                                              22
 Distribution network training: This can be divided into two parts: (i) management level
  training and (ii) field level training. Arrangement of management level training can be
  undertaken by both MoEDIWR and SSEC and would deal with topics like Utility
  management, which should include methods of energy procurement; energy
  management, such as efficient metering and consumption data; account management etc.
  The other topics would include reduction of system loss, calculation of account
  receivable, disconnection procedures, and complaint attendance. Field level training
  would deal with topics like substation maintenance, which should include how to
  properly take care of substations to ensure proper functioning and avoid unnecessary
  deterioration, dealing with faults that might arise, creating inspection schedules, etc. The
  other topics would include distribution line maintenance, trouble shooting, meter
  installation and maintenance, meter testing, cable jointing, and fault finding of cables.

 Renewable energy: The objective of the training on renewable energy/off-grid solution
  would be to promote a proactive attitude by creating awareness and building capacity
  among the stakeholders of the electricity sector to understand the importance of
  renewable energy and other off-grid solutions as a tool to achieve sustainability. The
  components of the training program should include overview of renewable energy
  planning and environmental management; project identification and formulation;
  economic evaluation of projects; environmental impact assessment; project monitoring
  and evaluation; dissemination strategies; and rural energy policy issues.

 Procurement: The objective of procurement training should be to assist MoEDIWR and
  SSEC staffs to increase their efficiency and cost-effectiveness in the procurement of work
  contracts funded by different financing institutions (such as the World Bank). The
  training should include: procurement and tendering product description; procurement
  resources; market condition; solicitation planning process of preparing; documents
  needed to support solicitation such as request for quotation, request for proposal;
  evaluation criteria; solicitation – the process of obtaining information (bids and
  proposals); source selection; and contract administration / award / closeout.

 Others: In addition to the above, one of the major problems of implementing a capacity
  building program is the availability of relevant electricity statistics. Thus, electricity data
  collection and reporting support/training should be provided to the appropriate staff
  members to ensure proper recording of data.

 Customized training: Training specifically designed for electricity distribution, renewable
  energy/off-grid solutions and procurement should be provided to the relevant staff
  members. The trainings can be provided through consultancy support, on the job training,
  regional training, study tours, twining arrangements, seminaries etc. depending on the
  specific requirements and availability of resources.




                                             23
Resources for Capacity Building Support

52.      Capacity building needs assessment indicates need for following types of support:

       Consultancy support for creating a legal and regulatory framework, prepare an electricity
        system master plan, corporatization of SSEC covering both human resource and financial
        management, and a renewable energy and energy efficiency plan;

       Training support for training of trainers, officials and technicians of the electricity sector
        both at home and regional training centers, study tours, seminars for management level
        officials; and

       Tools and related equipment for creating in-house training facilities for MoEDIWR and
        SSEC. This should also include appropriate resources for management information
        systems, information and communication technology tools, as necessary.

      A sample medium term plan of activities, year wise phasing of budget, and item wise
      expenditure list have been presented in Section 2, Annex C, D, and E. Annex F presents the
      suggested training modules based on the needs identified. If the capacity development plan
      proposed in this report is implemented properly, significant capacity in the electricity sector
      will be created to achieve the sector goals and objectives.

Section 2 Annex B: List of Possible Training Institutions and Courses

53.      Training can be provided in regional centers, as appropriate. The need for training
facilities with necessary equipment and supplies is essential for conducting training programs
and is imperative to the capacity building plan. This will help development of necessary
frameworks, operation manuals and guidelines. A list of important training centers in the region
and of relevant important training courses offered by these institutions is highlighted below.
