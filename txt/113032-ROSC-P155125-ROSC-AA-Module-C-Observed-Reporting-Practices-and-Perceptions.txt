INTRODUCTION TO THE MODULE

The objectives of Module C are twofold:
• To corroborate the findings from the assessments of A&A standards (Module A) and the institutional framework
for corporate financial reporting (Module B) with reference to financial statements issued and reports from the
regulators in the jurisdiction; and
• To gather perceptions on the demand for and quality of financial information from users of financial statements.

The module is divided into three sections, which correspond to the three approaches for assessing actual practices:


  C.1 Financial statements                                        C.2 Review of regulatory
  review                                                          findings



                                 C.3 Perceptions survey




C.1 Financial statements review

This exercise encompasses direct assessment by the ROSC A&A team of a sample of financial statements recently
issued in the jurisdiction to determine whether the statements largely align with the expected presentation
and disclosure requirements of the applicable financial reporting framework, and have been prepared without
significant errors or omissions. There are several advantages to this approach. It entails an independent review using
a sample selected by the ROSC A&A team of current financial statements and can provide useful insights into the
financial reporting practices in the jurisdiction, particularly when corroborated by the review of regulatory findings
(C.2) and the results of the perceptions survey (C.3). However, it can be a time-consuming approach, both in
accessing the relevant information and in conducting the review. In more sophisticated markets, this approach may
also be less effective.



C.2 Review of regulatory findings

This exercise comprises a review of the findings of regulatory bodies (i) in the financial sector and (ii) of audit quality
assurance and oversight, in respect of financial reporting. Financial sector regulators (e.g., the securities market
regulator, stock exchange and prudential supervisors of banking and insurance) can play a vital role in monitoring the
quality of financial reporting by regulated entities operating in the jurisdiction and/or enforcing financial reporting
requirements. There is also increasing focus by regulators on the quality of the audits of financial information.

The reports that regulators produce as a result of their monitoring and enforcement (M&E) activity can represent a
unique source of information on actual reporting practices, in particular if the M&E activity is performed according
to international good practice principles (e.g., the Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision issued by the
Basel Committee or the Core Principles for Independent Audit Regulators issued by IFIAR.).

This exercise can draw on the country knowledge and expertise of the regulatory bodies but may be less effective
where these bodies do not have robust M&E processes in place or where access to regulatory reports is limited.


                                                                                                                              3

C.3 Perceptions survey

As actual A&A practices cannot be observed as part of a ROSC assessment with a sufficient degree of reliability,
compliance with A&A standards is essentially assessed through the robustness of the institutional framework
underpinning the application of the standards. Therefore, perceptions from knowledgeable users of financial
statements and other stakeholders in the jurisdiction can provide useful, corroborating insights into the quality of
financial reporting by companies.

The perceptions survey can be circulated to users of financial statements such as credit risk analysts within financial
institutions, investment managers, financial analysts, relevant personnel within credit rating agencies, lenders,
chambers of commerce. However, this approach depends on the availability of knowledgeable users. ROSC A&A
teams are encouraged to circulate the survey via an online tool to facilitate participation from a wide range of users.


When should these exercises be performed?

• All three exercises should be performed by ROSC A&A teams depending on the reliability and availability of
information in the jurisdiction.
• Dependent on country context and the level of resources available, ROSC A&A teams should use professional
judgment to determine the priority for completing the exercises within this module.
• For example, for a ROSC A&A conducted in country A with a significant capital market and a securities market
regulator with robust M&E processes in place, it may be more appropriate to focus on C.2, C.3, and then C.1 in
that order. Whereas in country B, with lower regulatory capacity and a less active capital market, it may be more
appropriate to focus on C.1, C.3, and then C.2.


Who should complete the exercises?

• Sections C.1 and C.2 should be completed by the ROSC A&A team with validation from counterparts.
• Section C.3 should be circulated to selected users of financial statements for completion and reviewed by the
ROSC A&A team.

C.1 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REVIEW

The primary objective of the review of a sample of general purpose financial statements is to gain insights into
actual reporting practices which may also be corroborated by the review of regulatory findings (C.2) and the results
of the perceptions survey (C.3). There are, however, limits to the exercise. The appropriateness of recognition and
measurement practices can only be observed, not assessed – only an audit or a supervisory inspection can provide
such an assessment –unless the accounting policies or other areas of the financial statements contain a statement1
that directly violates one of the applicable financial reporting standards.


How should this exercise be performed?
The financial statements review comprises the following three components:


    1. Sample selection                                                                 2. Review of observed
                                                                                        reporting practices



                                             3. Review of auditing
                                             practices




1. Sample selection

The sample should desirably be selected from financial statements which are required by law or other regulation to
be independently audited, and should include entities that are significant in the jurisdiction including:
• Regulated entities such as banks, insurance companies and listed companies
• Large non-listed commercial enterprises
• State-owned enterprises (where appropriate)
• Small and medium-sized enterprises (or equivalent classifications as applicable).



      Box 1: Selecting SME financial statements for review

      Task teams may deem it appropriate to include financial statements of SMEs in this review. Heterogeneity
      tends to be much greater with SMEs and it may be difficult to conclude more broadly on the quality of
      SME reporting as a group. Useful sources of information on SME reporting include roundtables with the
      accountancy profession and meetings/roundtables with banks.

 General purpose financial statements are those prepared to meet the needs of a variety of users of financial statements as opposed
to those prepared for regulatory or other purposes e.g., prudential reporting for the banking supervisor.
                                                                                                                                              5
                                                              ROSC Accounting & Auditing Module C: Observed Reporting Practices and Perceptions




The composition and size of the sample are matters of professional judgment for the ROSC A&A team depending on
the country context. The typical sample size for the review of financial statements is between 25 and 50 and tends to
be proportional to the size of the jurisdiction or the significance of the securities market.

The team, in the concept document of the ROSC A&A, should propose the size of the sample and its composition
(e.g., 25 financial statements, of which 5 banks, 8 listed companies, etc.). The sample of financial statements selected
should be used in both the analysis of reporting and auditing practices as discussed in the subsequent sections.

Sources of information for the sample
Responses to the filing/publication sections in the Module B questionnaires should indicate where financial
statements for different categories of companies can be obtained. Typical sources include: directly from the
company’s website or from the website of the regulator for regulated entities; the central registry (or equivalent); and
the official gazette.

When financial statements are not publicly available, the ROSC A&A team can make an official request to the
Ministry of Finance or other counterpart to facilitate provision of the statements. The fact that it was not possible
for the team to obtain the statements without making such a request should be noted in the final report. Other
potential sources, when financial statements are not made available to the public, are chambers of commerce or the
companies themselves.


2. Review of observed reporting practices

In the analysis of observed reporting practices, ROSC A&A teams should review the financial statements in
the sample selected in section 1 above to determine whether these are significantly aligned with the expected
presentation and disclosures of the stated financial reporting framework.

To assist with the analysis and to ensure consistency in the review of the sample of financial statements, the ROSC
A&A team should use tools such as disclosure checklists for the applicable financial reporting framework where
available. International networks of audit firms2 often provide comprehensive checklists online indicating the
relevant disclosures for financial statements prepared under IFRS. These checklists are usually updated regularly to
reflect changes in the standards. ROSC A&A teams should select one of these checklists to assist with the review of
the IFRS statements selected in the sample.

Similarly, local affiliates of the international networks of audit firms or the local professional accountancy
organization may have developed disclosure checklists where full and current IFRS is not the national GAAP. Such
checklist(s) should be obtained during the scoping mission where possible. The same checklist should be used for
the review of all the financial statements in the sample prepared under national GAAP.

The types of financial reporting topics that the ROSC A&A team should consider when reviewing the sample of
financial statements are summarized in Table 1 below. Please note that this is an illustrative list only. Teams should
note that the absence of a disclosure does not necessarily imply that a disclosure was needed.

    For example, firms such as Deloitte, EY (formerly Ernst & Young), KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers.

                                                                                                                                             6

 Topic                         Questions for consideration


 Presentation of the           • Is the set of financial statements complete? For statements prepared in compliance
 financial statements          with IFRS this includes:
                                    ▷ a statement of financial position at the end of the reporting period;
                                    ▷ statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income;
                                    ▷ statement of changes in equity;
                                    ▷ statement of cash flows;
                                    ▷ notes of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information
                               • Are the main classes of assets and liabilities presented?
                               • Are the classifications appropriate and consistent?
                               • Is there any undue aggregation?
                               • Is netting of assets and liabilities permitted?
                               • Is there an appropriate distinction between current and non-current assets and
                               liabilities?

 Disclosure of                 • Are the policies in each set of statements:
 accounting policies               ▷ described clearly;
                                   ▷ not in conflict with the relevant standard;
                                   ▷ specific (i.e., not using boilerplate language or text lifted directly from the
                                   standards)
                                   ▷ providing meaningful information to users; and
                                   ▷ appropriate for the industry? For example, when reviewing statements of
                                   companies in the financial sector, one would typically expect to see notes on
                                   the accounting policies in areas such as loan loss provisioning, derivatives and
                                   hedging instruments, liquidity, market, current and other relevant risks.

 Other disclosures             • Have all expected disclosures (e.g., on receivables, directors’ remuneration,
                               related-party relationships, contingent liabilities, and events after the financial
                               year-end) been made given the requirements of the applicable financial reporting
                               standards and other regulations?


 Auditor’s opinion             • Are there qualifications or emphasis of a matter in the auditor’s report? This may
                               indicate departure from a financial reporting standard



When analyzing the results of the review of financial statements, the ROSC A&A team should consider the
following:
• Were any discrepancies noted between actual and expected disclosures in the financial statements? How significant
were the discrepancies?
• Were there any identifiable trends? For example: higher or lower instances of discrepancies within industries,
or between PIEs and non-PIEs; or discrepancies related to limited or incomplete disclosures, such as lack of
appropriate disclosures for related parties.




                                                                                                                            7
                                                                 ROSC Accounting & Auditing Module C: Observed Reporting Practices and Perceptions




In the first instance, teams should discuss the findings of the analysis with appropriate counterparts such as the
relevant sector regulator, the audit regulator (or equivalent), and/or recognized experts in financial reporting (e.g.,
personnel from the local professional accountancy organization) for additional context. A summary of significant
findings with context/responses from counterparts (where appropriate) should be included in the final report.


3. Review of auditing practices

Given the inherent limitations (resource and time constraints as well as potential issues relating to confidentiality
in requesting to see audit files), the focus of the analysis of auditing practices is on the alignment of the auditor’s
report with the expected requirements of ISAs or national auditing standards. ROSC A&A teams should review the
auditor’s reports corresponding to the financial statements in the sample used in the review of reporting practices in
the preceding section. Table 2 summarizes the key topics that ROSC A&A teams should consider when reviewing
the auditor’s reports.

Table 2: Summary of topics to consider when reviewing the auditor’s report

  Topic                                      Questions for consideration


  Form of the report                         • Does the auditor’s report comply with the requirements of ISA 700 Forming an
                                             opinion and Reporting on financial statements and other extant ISA3 or equivalent
                                             national standards?

  Appropriateness of the                     • Considering the issues identified as part of the analysis of accounting practices
  audit opinion                              (if any), does the auditor’s opinion seem appropriate? For example, if the team
                                             identified a departure and the auditors did not raise the issue in the report or
                                             modify the opinion and qualification may have seemed more appropriate.
                                             • Teams should note that a qualification in the auditor’s opinion may be a good
                                             sign in the sense that the auditor raised an issue which might otherwise have been
                                             omitted.



As with the results of the review of financial statements, the ROSC A&A team should discuss findings from the
review of auditor’s reports with counterparts such as the audit regulator or personnel from the local PAO for
additional context. A summary of significant findings or trends with context/responses from counterparts (where
appropriate) should be included in the final ROSC A&A report.

C.2 REVIEW OF REGULATORY FINDINGS

As discussed in the introduction to the module, the ROSC A&A team may decide to perform the following two
exercises to determine the key financial reporting and auditing issues from a regulatory perspective, depending on
the reliability and accessibility of information available:
• firstly, a review of findings from monitoring and enforcement (M&E) activity performed by regulators in the
financial sector and,
• secondly, a review of regulatory activity in respect of audit quality assurance.

The primary sources of information to complete these exercises are the interviews conducted with the regulators as
part of the due diligence mission. Responses to the sections on M&E activity by the financial sector regulators, and
on audit regulation, quality assurance and public oversight in the Module B questionnaires, (and other relevant data
collected) should provide useful context on the regulatory environment for financial reporting to assist with these
exercises.


1. Review of findings from M&E by financial sector regulator(s)

The guidelines for the ROSC A&A diagnostic tool provide template agendas and discussion points for meetings with
counterparts, including the financial sector regulators, during the due diligence mission. To perform the review of
M&E by financial sector regulators, the ROSC A&A team should:
• Determine the expected nature and extent of the regulatory M&E activity for the securities market regulator,
stock exchange, banking supervisor and insurance supervisor based on the interviews with counterparts and
also the responses to Module B questionnaires for listed companies, financial sector (banking and insurance) and
commercial enterprises.
• Obtain recent copies of M&E reports issued by the regulators. These reports may include annual reports and/
or strategy documents. M&E activity in respect of financial reporting may be included with reports on prudential
reviews or other supervisory activity. ROSC A&A teams should obtain copies of reports from the regulator’s website
or request directly from the regulator. In some jurisdictions, the relevant source of information is referred to as
“comment letters”.
• Review the aspects of the regulator’s report(s) related to financial reporting and discuss with the regulator.
For example, the regulator may report on identified instances of non-compliance with IFRS/national GAAP or other
applicable financial reporting requirements in the inspection of financial statements. Such findings/trends as well as
actions being taken to address the issues identified should be discussed.
• Prepare a summary of the key findings and trends identified by the regulator(s) for inclusion in the ROSC
A&A report. This summary is dependent on the completeness of the information included in the regulator’s
report(s) and on the robustness of the underlying process to identify issues. Teams should use professional judgment
in determining which regulatory findings and observations should be incorporated into the ROSC A&A report.

2. Review of findings from M&E by the audit quality assurance body

There is also increasing focus by regulators on the quality of the audits of financial information. In the ROSC A&A
diagnostic tool, quality assurance (QA) refers to the system in place in a jurisdiction to monitor compliance of the
work performed by independent auditors with applicable auditing, ethical, and other professional standards via on-
site inspections and other activities.

The term QA body is used in the assessment to refer to the organization conducting QA and applies irrespective
of the entity conducting the QA e.g., a professional accountancy organization (which in some circumstances has
been delegated this responsibility by a government body or regulator), or by an audit regulator independent of the
accountancy profession. In jurisdictions with an established QA system, the audit regulator or body responsible for
QA may issue a report on the inspections of audit firms and other activities.

Similar to the review of the reports of the financial sector regulators, the guidelines for the ROSC A&A provide
a template agenda and discussion points for the meeting with counterparts from the QA body during the due
diligence mission. When performing the review of M&E activity by the QA body, ROSC A&A teams should:
• Determine the expected nature and extent of the QA activity based on the interviews with counterparts and the
responses to the Module B questionnaire on audit regulation, quality assurance and public oversight.
• Obtain recent copies of QA reports issued by the QA body. These reports may include annual reports and results
of thematic reviews. ROSC A&A teams should obtain copies of reports from the website or request directly from the
QA body.
• Discuss the main findings in the report with the regulator/QA body. In addition to the findings, teams should
also discuss the actions being taken to address the issues identified. For example, if the inspection findings indicate
challenges in implementing a particular standard, it may be appropriate for additional training or guidance to be
provided to audit firms.
• Prepare a summary of the key findings and trends identified by the QA body for inclusion in the ROSC A&A
report. This summary is dependent on the completeness of the information included in the regulator’s report(s) and
the robustness of the underlying process to identify issues. Teams should comment on the methodology used by the
QA body in conducting QA (for example, if the approach to conducting QA is aligned to international good practice
principles such as the Core Principles of Independent Audit Regulators) as well as the number of suitably experienced
inspectors. Professional judgment should be used in determining which findings should be incorporated into the
ROSC A&A report.

C.3 PERCEPTIONS SURVEY

In order to gain an understanding of how the financial reporting environment and the quality of information
available in a jurisdiction are perceived, the ROSC A&A team is encouraged to perform the following:
• Circulate a survey drawing on the questions in the following template. The survey should be circulated via an
online tool to a broad sample of identified users, such as credit risk analysts within financial institutions, investment
managers, financial analysts, relevant personnel within credit rating agencies, lenders, chambers of commerce etc. and,
• Hold focus group discussions with users of financial statements during the main field mission. The discussions
can be organized under the auspices of the local stock exchange, bankers’ association, financial analysts’ association,
professional accountancy organization or other relevant institution.

The results of the survey along with the key messages from focus group discussions will be used to provide an
overall context on the demand for quality financial information in the jurisdiction as well as perceptions on the
quality of financial reporting. This will form part of the ROSC A&A report.
