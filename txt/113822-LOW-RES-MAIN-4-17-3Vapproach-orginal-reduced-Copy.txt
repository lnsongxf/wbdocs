Message to City Leaders


Imagine a city that is more competitive, with higher-quality neighborhoods, lower
infrastructure costs, and lower CO2 emissions per unit of activity. This city has lower
combined transportation and housing costs for its residents than other cities at
similar levels of economic activity. Its residents can access most jobs and services
easily through a combination of low-cost public transport, walking, and cycling. Its
core economic and population centers are resilient to natural hazards. It is able to
finance improvements to public space, connectivity, and social housing by captur-
ing value created through integrated land use and transport planning. Such a vi-
sion has never been more relevant for rapidly growing cities than it is today.
    Transit-oriented development (TOD) can play a major role in achieving such a
vision. It is a planning and design strategy to achieve compact, mixed-use, pedes-
trian and bicycle-friendly urban development closely integrated with transit sta-
tions. It embraces the idea that locating amenities, employment, shops, and hous-
ing around transit hubs promotes the use of public transit and nonmotorized
travel. Well-planned TOD at the city level is inclusive, because it focuses on ensur-
ing access to jobs for all social groups through public transit.
    TOD is often considered an effective way to create value through good design
combined with good planning at the neighborhood level. Good urban design sup-
ports increased density and ensures that people do not feel oppressed by conges-
tion and density. It requires significant streetscape improvement to turn streets into
places for people. It creates a spirit of place; makes a city more “legible”; and
evokes a feeling of enclosure, human scale, coherence, image, and linkage.
    For rapidly growing developing cities, TOD needs to go beyond the mere re-
development of specific neighborhoods. It must create an urban space able to
accommodate hundreds of thousands or even millions of new residents in a way
that provides high accessibility to jobs at the city level combined with amenities,
services, and good-quality environment at the neighborhood level to give a sense
of community. In such a context, TOD becomes relevant at the metropolitan and
city scale.
    Observation of large sustainable cities reveals wide variation in densities, which
                                                                                          Opposite page:

            Mass transit systems shape the city form and the distribution of its economic
        densities for decades. Stations that are more central, are more connected to oth-
        ers, and have more traffic play a special role in such process, which needs to be
        reflected in TOD planning. Feedback loops between transit network characteris-
        tics and density patterns tend to be self-reinforcing and appear to create a lock-in
        effect. Cities can thus be described as networks from which locations emerge.
        Accordingly, determining the shape of the mass transit network becomes central
        to creating a compact urban form combining core and polycentric centers well
        linked by transit.
            Applying the concept of integrated economic, transport, and land use planning
        is often complex, because different agencies do not understand it in the same way.
        The use of clear objectives for accessibility at the city level can facilitate such inte-
        gration. Singapore, for example, decided that by 2030, 80 percent of residents will
        live within 10-minute walk from a train station and 75 percent of peak-hour trips
        will be made by public transport. Such objectives can be achieved only through an
        integrated interagency approach, applying TOD principles for job and housing
        concentration around stations.
            Based on an observation of methodologies applied in different countries, the
        Bank’s Community of Practice on Transit Oriented Development has developed a
        methodology called the 3 Value (3V) Framework, which considers the node, place,
        and market potential value of each station. The 3V Framework outlines a typology
        to facilitate TOD implementation at the metropolitan and urban scale in various
        contexts as part of a methodology that aims to:

        • identify the economic development potential of different transit corridors and
          different areas around mass transit stations in terms of type, scale, and timing,
          considering the level of connectivity and market demand through quantified
          indicators
        • develop planning and implementation measures and prioritize limited public
          resources to create such value through coordinated interagency measures
        • develop and communicate with residents, government agencies, and private
          developers a vision for the city that articulates development around its mass
          transit network.

           By doing so, the 3V Framework can facilitate an alignment of TOD strategies at
        the metropolitan, city, network, and local levels.
           The 3V Framework equips policy and decision makers with quantified indicators
        to better understand the interplay between the economic vision for the city, its land
        use and mass transit network, and urban qualities and market vibrancy around its
        mass transit stations. It enables agencies in charge of transport, land use, and eco-
        nomic planning to identify misalignments and to select measures to address those.
        On the basis of such a vision, planners can provide the necessary service infrastruc-
        ture to support higher densities in priority areas and analyze the specific economic
        returns of different programs, considering all related social and environmental as-
        pects, responding in particular to the challenges of an equitable urban growth.
           This book provides examples of approaches taken by cities like London and
        New York to align their economic, land use, and transport planning to generate

plans for the city of Zhengzhou, in China. We hope the book will help readers
develop a coherent vision, policies, and strategy to leverage the value created
through enhanced connectivity and accessibility and make cities even more ap-

Agglomeration effects: Benefits from concentrating output and housing in par-
ticular areas.

Air rights sale: Sale of unused development rights on a given property to another
developer allowing it to go beyond the limits specified in land use regulations (for
example, FAR). Such sale, often by the government, allows funds to be raised to
finance public infrastructure and services.

Betweenness centrality: Number of times a node in a network acts as a bridge
along the shortest path between two other nodes. The concept, introduced by
Linton Freeman in 1977, quantifies the control of one person over communication
between other people in a social network. Nodes that have a high probability of
occurring on a randomly chosen shortest path between two randomly chosen
nodes have high betweenness. In transit networks, a station with high between-
ness centrality has greater influence over the transfer of passengers through the
network. These stations areas have high development potential.

Building coverage ratio: Size of constructed buildings’ floor in relation to total
size of land plot. Building area is the floor space of a building when looking down
at it from above (aerial view). The formula for building coverage ratio (BCR) is as
follows: BCR (percent) = (building area)/ (site area) × 100.

Catalytic development: Holistic development to revitalize the urban fabric
through a series of projects that drive and guide urban development.

Central business district (CBD): Areas where cities’ major businesses (financial
institutions, stores, convention and sport facilities, hotels, and so forth) are concen-
trated. CBDs produce agglomeration economies.

Centrality: In graph theory and network analysis, indicators of centrality identify
the most important nodes. Centrality can be used to identify the most influential
people in a social network, key infrastructure nodes in the Internet or urban net-
works, and superspreaders of disease. Betweenness, closeness, and degree cen-
trality are the three most important indicators for transit networks.

Closeness centrality: A measure of accessibility to a node within a network that
measures the inverse of the sum of the distances of a node from all other nodes.
                                                                                    xxi

         Compact city: Urban planning and urban design concept that promotes city with
         short travel distances. Compact cities are usually based on concentrated residen-
         tial density, mixed land use, an efficient public transit system and an urban layout
         that encourages walking and cycling, low energy consumption, and reduced pol-
         lution. A compact city provides opportunities for social interaction as well as a
         feeling of safety. It is more sustainable than urban sprawl, because it is less depen-
         dent on the car and requires less (and cheaper per capita) infrastructure
         provision.

         Degree centrality: Number of ties a node has with other nodes in a network. In
         transit networks, interchange stations between many lines or modes (hubs) have a
         high degree centrality.

         Density gradient: Spatial variation in density over an area.

         Employment density: Number of jobs in an area.

         Enclosure: Degree to which buildings, walls, trees, and other vertical elements
         define streets and other public spaces.

         Floor area ratio (FAR): Ratio of a building’s total floor area to the size of the land
         on which it is built. The higher the FAR, the higher the density. Also referred to as
         floor space ratio (FSR) or floor space index (FSI).

         Floor space index (FSI): See Floor area ratio (FAR).

         Greenfield development: New development that takes place on lands that were
         not previously developed as urban land, including agricultural, rural, and unused
         land.

         Human density: Total number of people and jobs in an urban area divided by the
         land area.

         Infill: Rededication of land in an urban environment, usually open space, to new
         construction or construction on any undeveloped land.

         Intensification area: Built-up area with good existing or potential public transit
         links that can support redevelopment at higher than existing densities.

         Intensity of node activity: Strength of traffic flows in a node; can be described by
         frequency of departures by public transportation and/or ridership.

         Intermodal hub: Place where passengers can switch between different lines or
         transport modes. Intermodal hubs include large subway stations with multiple
         lines, train stations, rapid transit stations, bus stations, tram stations, and airports.
         Some complex hubs combine several modes in a single integrated multimodal
         station or complex of stations.

Land readjustment scheme: Scheme in which landowners pool their land for re-
configuration and contribute a portion of it for sale to raise funds to partially defray
the costs of developing public infrastructure.

Land value capture (LVC): Public financing method in which governments (a) trig-
ger an increase in land values through regulatory decisions (for example, the
change in land use or floor area ratio) and/or infrastructure investments; (b) insti-
tute a process to share the land value increment by capturing part or all of the
change; and (c) use the proceeds to finance infrastructure investments (such as
investments in transit and TOD or other improvements required to offset impacts
related to the changes (for example, densification) and/or implement public poli-
cies to promote equity (for example, provision of affordable housing to alleviate
shortages and offset potential gentrification). There are two main categories of
LVC: development-based LVC and tax- or fee-based LVC. Development-based
LVC can be facilitated through direct transaction of properties whose values have
been increased by public regulatory decisions or infrastructure investment. Tax- or
fee-based LVC is facilitated through indirect methods, such as extracting surplus
from property owners through various tax or fee instruments (such as property
taxes, betterment charges, and special assessments).

Legibility: Ease with which people can create a mental map so that the spatial
structure of a place can be understood and navigated as a whole.

Local value recycling: Reinvestment of revenue generated by a development in
that same development, to further increase asset value and positive socioeco-
nomic impacts.

Market potential value: Unrealized market value of a station area, sometimes
measured through a composite index considering major drivers of demand, in-
cluding current and future human densities, current and future number of jobs
accessible within 30 minutes by transit, and major drivers of supply (including the
amount of developable land, potential changes in zoning, and market vibrancy).

Mixed-use development: Pattern of development characterized by diversified land
uses, typically including housing, retail shops, and private businesses, either within
the same building space (vertical mixing) or in close proximity (horizontal mixing).

Node value: Measure of importance of a public transit station based on passenger
traffic volume, intermodality, and centrality within the network; measured through
a composite index.

Opportunity Areas: London’s major source of brownfield land. Most can accom-
modate at least 5,000 jobs, 2,500 new homes, or a combination of the two, along
with other supporting facilities and infrastructure.

Pareto distribution: Inverse power law probability distribution used in the descrip-
tion of social, scientific, geophysical, actuarial, and many other types of phenomena.

         Sometimes referred to as the Pareto principle or the 80–20 rule, which states that
         20 percent of a given statistical population represents 80 percent of the total value.

         Permeability: Extent to which urban forms permit the movement of people or
         vehicles in different directions.

         Place value: Determinants of the attractiveness of a place, including amenities;
         schools; health care facilities; type of urban development; local accessibility to
         daily needs by walking and cycling; quality of the urban fabric around the station,
         in particular its pedestrian accessibility; small size of urban blocks and fine mesh of
         connected streets, which create vibrant neighborhoods; and mixed pattern of land
         use. It is measured through a composite index.

         Population density: Number of people living in an urban area divided by the land
         area.

         Power law: Functional relationship between two quantities in which one quantity
         varies as a power of another. The distributions of a wide variety of physical, biologi-
         cal, and manmade phenomena approximately follow a power law over a wide
         range of magnitudes. Quantities following power laws lack well-defined average
         values, making it incorrect to apply traditional statistics that are based on variance
         and standard deviation (such as regression analysis). Appendix A shows that most
         quantities in urban space (densities, network centralities, economic productivity,
         and so forth) that are the core indicators for applying the 3V Framework are not
         distributed around average values but follow power laws.

         Public-private partnership (PPP): Formal partnership between a public sector
         entity and a private corporation often used to construct and operate infrastructure
         facilities or develop certain urban areas.

         Public realm: Publicly owned streets, pathways, rights of way, parks, publicly ac-
         cessible open spaces and any public and civic building and facilities.

         Redevelopment/regeneration: Type of development that seeks to reinvest in al-
         ready developed areas, typically targeting parcels that are underutilized, such as
         vacant or abandoned properties.

         Transit-adjacent development (TAD): Development located near a transit node
         that fails to leverage on such proximity because it lacks key characteristics of tran-
         sit-oriented development, such as pedestrian-friendly development or mixed use.

         Transit-oriented development (TOD): Planning and design strategy to ensure
         compact, mixed-use, pedestrian- and bicycle- friendly, and suitably dense urban
         development organized around transit stations. TOD embraces the idea that lo-
         cating amenities, jobs, shops, and housing around transit hubs promotes transit
         usage and nonmotorized travel. Well-planned TOD is inclusive and integrates re-
         silience to natural hazards.

TOD typology: Tool for prioritizing where and when to make investments, deter-
mining the types of investments that are appropriate in different communities, and
guiding the timing and scale of those investments. Provides a means of classifying
and differentiating transit communities in a city by grouping them based on shared
characteristics. A TOD typology aims at creating an aspirational vision of future
land uses, prioritizing stations for investment, providing guidelines and actions for
implementation, and measuring performance on a range of metrics.

Transit core: 400-meter radius area immediately surrounding a premium transit
station.

Transit neighborhood: 800-meter radius area surrounding a premium transit
station.

Transit supportive area: 1.6 kilometer-area immediately surrounding a premium
transit station.

Transfer of development rights: Ability to buy and sell air rights (within the limit
of their floor area ratio allotment or the unused development rights that remain
when a building does not use up its FAR allotment). Typically applies only to cer-
tain parcels that often can be transferred only to specific “receiving” parcels.

Urban block: A city block, urban block, or simply block is a central element of
urban planning and urban design. A city block is the smallest area that is sur-
rounded by streets. City blocks are the space for buildings within the street pattern
of a city. They form the basic unit of a city’s urban fabric.

Urban fabric: Physical aspect of urbanism, including building types, thorough-
fares, open space, frontages, and streetscapes.

Urban morphology: Study of the form of human settlements and the process of
their formation and transformation that seeks to understand the spatial structure
and character of a metropolitan area, city, town or village by examining the pat-
terns of its parts and the process of its development.

Urban realm: Spatial components of a metropolis.

Value capture finance: Appropriation of value generated by public sector intervention
and private sector investment in relation to an underused asset (land and/or structure)
for local reinvestment to produce public good and potential private benefit.

Zoning: Control by authority of use of land and the buildings on it. Areas of land
are divided into zones within which various uses are permitted. Zoning aims to
promote orderly development and to separate incompatible land uses, such as
industrial uses and homes, to ensure a pleasant environment.
Introduction

Transit-oriented development (TOD) is a planning and design strategy for achiev-
ing compact, mixed-use, pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly urban development
closely integrated with transit stations. It embraces the ideas that locating ameni-
ties, jobs, shops, and housing around transit hubs promotes transit use and non-
motorized travel and that careful place-making softens the perception of density
and facilitates the emergence of vibrant communities. It can be applied to me-
tropolises like Hong Kong SAR, China, as well as smaller cities like Copenhagen, a
municipality of about 592,000 people.



Benefits of Transit-Oriented Development

Making Cities More Competitive, Raising Real Estate
Values, and Contributing to Growth
Transit-oriented cities are more competitive than other cities, as a result of ag-
glomeration effects. Doubling job density increases economic productivity by
5–10 percent (Salat and others 2017). In New York, the world’s most competitive
global city, 60 percent of office space is agglomerated on only 9 square kilometers
(1 percent of the city’s land area) (Salat 2017). This concentration offers opportuni-
ties to reinvent urban spaces with high-quality public and green areas. Copenha-
gen and Stockholm (box I.1), both of which have embraced TOD principles, rank
among the world’s top cities in terms of per capita GDP, the Green City Index, and
the UN-Habitat City Prosperity Index (UN-Habitat 2015).
    TOD increases and concentrates real estate value in the best-connected areas.
Since 1996 the growth of home values in TOD neighborhoods in the United States
has outpaced the growth of home values nationally by a margin of nearly 2 to 1;
in 2014 the average home in a TOD neighborhood was worth 3.5 times more than
the average home (Infrastructure USA 2015).

                                    Saving People Time and Money
                                    Transport and housing are traditionally the largest expenditures for households,
                                    often accounting for more than half of their income. Inclusive TOD plans for low-
                                    income and affordable housing near mass transit stations enhance access to job
                                    opportunities for all. In the United States, people living near TOD stations spend
                                    37 percent of their income on transport plus housing against 51 percent for other
                                    people (Reconnecting America 2009).


                                    Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Increasing
                                    Resilience to Natural Hazards
                                    TOD can reduce infrastructure costs and CO2 emissions per unit of activity (ESMAP
                                    2014). Hong Kong SAR, China, for example, increased gross value added per capita
                                    by 50 percent between 1993 and 2011 while reducing its CO2 emissions for transpor-
                                    tation per capita and road gasoline consumption per capita by about 10 percent
                                    (Rode and others 2013). Copenhagen and Stockholm also achieved this decoupling.
                                        TOD can also make cities more resilient to natural hazards than other kinds of de-
                                    velopment if implemented strategically. Because TOD leads to a concentration of
                                    activities and housing at the city level, it allows cities to locate such areas of high
                                    density in lower-risk zones, address risks in those areas more systematically, ensure
                                    that peak concentration occurs primarily in areas with high levels of network redun-
                                    dancy, and turn those areas into well-connected refuge zones in case of emergency.

                                    cial, and land specialists working in or with the World Bank on TOD projects. It has

summarized eight key principles for implementing TOD, based on international
experience in TOD:

1. Align human densities, economic densities, mass transit capacity, and transit
   network characteristics for greater accessibility.
2. Create compact regions with short commutes.
3. Ensure the resilience of areas connected by mass transit.
4. Plan and zone for mixed-use and mixed-income neighborhoods at a corridor
   level.
5. Create vibrant, people-centric public spaces around mass transit stations.
6. Develop neighborhoods that promote walking and cycling.
7. Develop good-quality, accessible, and integrated public transit.
8. Manage demand for private vehicles.



Transit-Oriented Development at the City and Station
Level

Many rapidly growing developing countries are investing massively in transit sys-
tems. China, for example, adds on average 450 subway stations every year. By
2020 Beijing will have 1,050 and Shanghai 970 kilometers of subways, making their
networks among the longest in the world. In India, cities are constructing more
than 600 kilometers of metros and planning another 250 kilometers.
    The best-planned cities set specific objectives quantifying how such systems
will connect households to jobs and services and provide the backbone for peak-
hour transport. Singapore’s masterplan targets for 2030 include ensuring that 8 in
10 households live within a 10-minute walk of a transit station, 85 percent of public
transport journeys are completed within 60 minutes, and 75 percent of all journeys
in peak hours are undertaken on public transport (LTA 2013). Such accessibility
targets provide clear guidance to transport, land, housing, and economic agencies
and require them to work together, because the targets can be achieved only
through combined and aligned interventions.
    Concentrating development in the one-kilometer radius around transit stations
offers a unique opportunity to shape cities and make them more livable, efficient,
and inclusive. Cities can take supportive measures to prioritize development around
stations. They can take as a core performance benchmark the percentage of jobs
and residents within one kilometer of mass transit stations and the percentage of
new development taking place in those well-connected areas as opposed to other
parts of the city. They can support such concentration by placing priority on new
public infrastructure in those well-connected areas while restricting development in
other areas. At the level of corridors, cities can encourage greater economic op-
portunities by supporting a mix of uses and income groups. Around stations, cities
can facilitate the creation of health, education, shopping, and recreation facilities to
enable communities to thrive locally. Such approach has long-term impact on reduc-
ing energy consumption, CO2 emissions, and transport cost as a share of GDP.
    However, not all stations are equal in terms of development potential. The
number differs from city to city, but generally about 15 percent of station areas are
4   O                                                         Transforming the Urban Space



        expected to achieve very high densities (World Bank and Development Research
        Center of the State Council, P.R. China 2014). Other areas may not have the com-
        mercial value required for such development.



        Typologies for Identifying Where, When, and How to
        Create Economic Value

        There is no one size fits all to TOD throughout a city. Early projects often focus on
        greenfield sites, where development is easier, or at central locations and highly
        accessible transit hubs, where high-density development is supported by high
        land value. But other types of opportunities exist outside these major areas. They
        require tailored approaches.
            Understanding where, when, and how potential value can be created requires
        tools that help differentiate the opportunities offered by different stations in a
        mass transit network. Improving transit at a location creates conditions favorable
        to its development. In turn, development of a location creates conditions favor-
        able to the further development of the transport system.
            A TOD typology differentiates transit station areas based on their suitability for
        accommodating growth. It links regional and local public policy recommendations
        to support the type of development that is best suited for a specific site and com-
        munity. A TOD typology aims at creating an aspirational vision of future land uses,
        prioritizing stations for investment, providing guidelines and actions for implemen-
        tation, and measuring performance on a range of metrics.


        Traditional Transit-Oriented Development Typologies
        Academics have long developed TOD typologies based on their observations of
        past TOD development in cities. Bertolini (1999) introduced a node/place model
        (see chapter 3) seeking to explore the underlying relationships between node and
        place values, with a focus on station areas. Such model was further supported by
        the transport land use feedback cycle developed by Giuliano (2004), Meyer and
        Miller (2001), and Wegener and Fuerst (1999). Cervero and Murakami (2008) de-
        veloped a typology drawing on the experience of Hong Kong SAR, China; Singa-
        pore; and Tokyo.
           More recently, cities have developed such typologies to support their strategic
        planning. Baltimore developed a typology to identify and assign station area in-
        vestment needs to a broad range of TOD actors and stakeholders (CTOD and
        others 2009). Its plan was folded into a broader TOD strategic plan that has en-
        abled Baltimore to fund transit-supportive projects more systematically rather than
        through a usual piecemeal approach.
           Denver created a typology to provide a vision (Transit-Oriented Denver) for the
        appropriate density and land use mix in each of the city’s existing and planned
        light rail station areas. Its plan served as a guide for subsequent detailed station
        area planning studies.
           Portland developed a typology for identifying overall needs related to imple-
        menting TOD regionwide and determining where TOD development is most ap-
Introduction                                                                               O 5



propriate (CTOD and Nelson/Nygaard n.d). The typology and recommendations
of the cost-effectiveness model helped evaluate not only where investments
should be made but what types of investment made most sense. Portland’s typol-
ogy strives to leverage opportunities by strategically targeting TOD investments
and helping public agencies and programs with an interest in TOD understand the
types of investments that are appropriate given variable local physical and market
contexts. It aims to ensure an investment response to changing market cycles and
variable local market conditions.


Going Beyond Traditional Typologies: The 3V Framework
The 3 Value Framework, or 3V Framework, generalizes these international ap-
proaches based either on the node/place model or a market/place model (such as
the Baltimore and Portland typologies) by identifying the three values that can
characterize a transit station:

• Node value describes the importance of a station in the public transit network
  based on its passenger traffic volume, intermodality, and centrality within the
  network. Node value is measured through a composite index.
• Place value describes the urban quality of a place and its attractiveness in terms
  of amenities, schools, and health care; the type of urban development; local
  accessibility to daily needs by walking and cycling; the quality of the urban
  fabric around the station, in particular its pedestrian accessibility, the small siz-
  ing of urban blocks, and the fine mesh of connected streets that create vibrant
  neighborhoods; and the mixed pattern of land use. Place value is measured
  through a composite index.
• Market potential value refers to the unrealized market value of station areas. It
  is derived through market analysis (the study of demand and supply). It is mea-
  sured through a composite index that includes major drivers of demand includ-
  ing current and future human densities (residential plus employment); the cur-
  rent and future number of jobs accessible by transit within 30 minutes; and
  major drivers of supply, including developable land, potential changes in zon-
  ing (such as increasing floor area ratios (FARs)), and market vibrancy. The ap-
  proach looks forward rather than backward.

   The 3V Framework is a methodology for identifying economic opportunities in
areas around mass transit stations and optimizing them through the interplay be-
tween the node, place, and market potential values. It provides a typology to
cluster stations based on the three values. It equips policy and decision makers
with quantified indicators to better understand the interplay between the eco-
nomic vision for the city, its land use, its mass transit network, and its stations’ ur-
ban qualities and market vibrancy. It outlines planning and implementation mea-
sures for the different clusters of stations that can help prioritize limited public
resources and create value through coordinated interagency measures.
   Such analysis enables a city to develop and communicate a vision that articu-
lates development around its mass transit network and facilitates the alignment of
TOD strategies at the metropolitan, city, network, and local levels. The 3V Frame-
6   O                                                              Transforming the Urban Space



        work can be used to engage with citizens, private developers, investors, financiers,
        companies, and other stakeholders to develop, refine and advance such a vision
        and update it regularly. On the basis of such a vision, cities can develop plans to
        provide the necessary infrastructure to support higher densities in priority areas
        and analyze the economic returns of different programs, considering all related
        social and environmental aspects, responding in particular to the challenges of
        equitable urban growth.


        Applicability of the 3V Framework
        The 3V Framework is applicable to large cities with extensive networks and smaller
        cities with only a few mass transit lines or a bus rapid transit system. The model
        works for growing cities and declining ones. It seeks to determine the relative ar-
        eas of potential within a city rather than across cities.
            The examples presented in this book are mostly urban regeneration of previ-
        ously stagnant areas (King’s Cross, Hudson Yards, the redevelopment of docklands
        in Sweden). In all of these settings, planners spurred urban growth at the local
        scale, using a strategy that could be applied at a larger scale to foster growth in
        declining cities through urban catalysts.
            The 3V Framework presents two main interests for policy makers. First, it allows
        them to build a typology of stations that classifies all stations in a mass transit
        network into clusters, to which different development strategies can then be
        applied.
            Second, the framework allows policy makers to identify the imbalances between
        connectivity, accessibility, place quality, and market potential values at a given sta-
        tion by plotting those across the three values (figure I.1). Addressing these imbal-
        ances creates high potential for economic value creation—by, for example, creating
        place value around an important connective node or bringing additional connectiv-
        ity to a booming area. Quantification allows the various government agencies deal-

ing with urban, transport, and economic planning to start a conversation and to
synchronize high peaks of node value (major connecting hubs) with high-quality
place-making to create spikes of market potential value (figure I.2).
   Several levers can be used to increase individual node, place, and market po-
tential value (table I.1), keeping in mind that the greatest impact is achieved when
addressing imbalances between those values.

        public and private investments in underutilized assets. Chapter 4 describes in
        more detail one key lever of value creation: good urban design of the public realm.
            Chapters 5–8 are detailed case studies. Chapter 5 describes the strategies ap-
        plied by to redevelop the massive Hudson Yards project, in New York. Chapter 6
        describes King’s Cross, an urban regeneration project in an area of London with
        exceptional connectivity that was once a railyard land. Chapter 7 examines the
        new subway line in London (Crossrail), showing the differentiated strategies used
        to increase place and market potential value depending on the location and cen-
        trality of stations in relation to the London subway network and its economic cores.
        Chapter 8 shows how the 3V Framework can be applied to integrating the space
        economy of an entire city (Zhengzhou, China). It highlights the potential misalign-
        ments between the increases in accessibility and centrality created by investments
        in the subway network and the projected decentralization of people and jobs at
        the periphery of the city in areas less accessible by subway.
            Two appendices complement these chapters. Appendix A describes how
        mathematical regularities (power laws) structure the distribution of urban values
        across urban space, network centralities, and the intensity of passenger flows in
        stations and commuting lines. Appendix B provides definitions and calculation
        formulas for the key metrics of each value.

Transit-Oriented Development
Strategies at the Metropolitan,
Network, and Local Levels



By 2050 the world urban population is expected to nearly double, making urbaniza-
tion one of the most transformative trends of the 21st century. Such transformation
will place a high demand on new infrastructure and good planning to address the
challenges many cities face in terms of pollution, congestion, and social inequity.
    Rapidly growing cities can learn from cities that applied transit-oriented devel-
opment (TOD) principles in shaping their urban space and transport network at
the metropolitan, city, network and neighborhood levels. They can create urban
spaces able to accommodate hundreds of thousands or even millions of new citi-
zens of different income levels in a way that offers high accessibility to jobs city-
wide. They can design their mass transit network to match the diverse densities in
jobs and housing across the urban space. They can build thousands of new com-
pact communities with amenities, services, and good-quality environment cen-
tered on rail, subway, urban rail, and bus rapid transit stations. Cities that have
followed such TOD principles have managed to spur economic growth, contribute
to inclusive development, and decouple their economic growth from their trans-
port greenhouse gas emissions per capita.

       Nations 2014). As witnessed over the past two decades throughout the world, in
       particular in Asia (World Bank 2015), this urbanization is likely to be accompanied
       by a rapid expansion of urban land, with a potential trebling of urban land in devel-
       oping country cities between 2005 and 2030 (Shlomo, Sheppard, and Civco 2005).
           The McKinsey Global Institute (2013) estimates the cost of global infrastructure
       between 2013 and 2030 at $57 trillion (3.5 percent of global GDP)—$3.2 trillion a
       year simply to keep up with projected global GDP growth. An estimated 40 per-
       cent of these needs consist of transportation infrastructure (roads, rail, ports, and
       airports). The center of gravity of this global infrastructure spending has already
       shifted to developing economies and cities, following the path of economic
       growth.
           Funding the world’s infrastructure needs is likely to become more difficult for a
       variety of reasons. The growing level of indebtedness since the 2008 financial crisis
       will place constraints on public sector budgets. More volatile resource prices have
       made long-term budget planning more complex for many developing countries.
       At the same time, countries face additional costs to make their infrastructure resil-
       ient to climate change.
           Well-planned cities are engines of growth. Urbanization therefore presents an
       opportunity to lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. But rapid and
       fragmented urban growth can adversely affect economic output, by reducing po-
       tential and actual economic agglomeration, increasing inequalities in housing and
       access to jobs, and raising infrastructure costs. Worse still, it can lock cities into
       inefficient paths of dependence on high resource consumption and low productiv-
       ity combined with severe externalities like congestion and pollution.



       Impacts of Transit-Oriented Development

       TOD is a policy framework for urban spatial development with long-term structural
       impacts. Transport infrastructure is the single most important determinant of urban
       expansion; land-use patterns, in turn, directly shape mobility behavior (LSE 2013).
       Land-use and transport policies are central tools for city governments; they should
       be better integrated, in order to enable agglomeration economies through better
       job matching, knowledge sharing, and networking opportunities (Cervero 2001;
       Fallah, Partridge, and Olfert 2011); reduce carbon emissions and resource use
       through efficient public transit; and improve social inclusion with more accessible
       urban form.
           The actions of a multiplicity of stakeholders and consistent policy frameworks
       across many geographical scales are needed to leave a long-term positive impact
       on city form and maximize economic efficiency. One city that has been successful
       in doing so is Copenhagen, which has shaped its urban form and achieved high
       levels of green growth through TOD (box 1.1).
           Living near public transit saves both time and money. TOD planning can en-
       hance social inclusiveness at the city level by increasing accessibility to jobs, par-
       ticularly for the urban poor, as New York has done (box 1.2).1 TOD planning allows
       policy makers to consider both transportation and housing costs by developing
       inclusionary housing policies (box 1.3). In Portland, for example, combined hous-

       Transit-Oriented Development Strategies at the
       Metropolitan/City Level

       International experience suggests that the intensity of land use should not be
       evenly distributed across the city but should instead peak where accessibility to
       jobs is greatest. Firms locate where they can increase their productivity through
       agglomeration and localization effects (Salat 2017). Manufacturing firms locate
       where they can connect to large logistics infrastructure and land is cheap. In con-
       trast, providers of high value added activities (finance, research and development,
       professional services) locate where they can access large number of similar firms.
       In Manhattan, for example, 60 percent of all office space is concentrated in only 9
       square kilometers (1 percent of land area), despite high land and real estate prices
       (Salat 2017).
           High concentrations of economic activity foster local economic development
       through economies of urbanization and localization (Rosenthal and Strange 2004),
       which attract skilled workers and more productive entrepreneurs and firms (Beh-
       rens, Duranton, and Robert-Nicoud 2014). Higher densities of people and firms
       allow for ideas to flow, giving birth to innovation. Density also allows firms to
       benefit from economies of scale and links to input and product markets. Research
       shows that doubling job density increases economic productivity by 10 percent

           Agglomeration economies made London outperform the rest of the United
       Kingdom in terms of economic productivity in 2015—something it did not do in
       the 1990s. On only 0.2 percent of Greater London’s land area, the Square Mile of
       the City of London produces 14 percent of the city’s GDP—equivalent to 3 percent
       of the United Kingdom’s total economic output. Job density in the Square Mile
       increased 30 percent in the last 10 years, to 150,000 per square kilometer. As a
       result, productivity per job in the Square Mile is twice that of Greater London and
       three times that of the United Kingdom (Salat 2017). The quality of public transit
       connections has a strong effect on business location choices in Central London
       (Sivaev 2013).
           Job concentration in the city core and a dense urban form aligned with the
       transit network are key factors of competitiveness (Jenks, Burton, and Williams
       1996). Hong Kong SAR, China, illustrates how the coordination of transit infrastruc-
       ture provision, land use planning, and economic policy has shaped urban forms for
       economic efficiency, social inclusiveness, and environmental impacts (box 1.4).
           Positive agglomeration effects concentrating jobs at high densities are driven
       by transit accessibility both to a large number of other jobs and other firms and to
       a large pool of workers. International research suggests a 30-minute threshold for
       these effects: People and jobs tend to concentrate at high density in areas where
       a high number of jobs, firms, and people can be accessed (Salat and Bourdic
       2015b).2 Restrictive zoning policies should not constitute a barrier to these con-

centrations or to densification of the most accessible urban areas around the most
important and most central transit stations. Box 1.5 shows how transit accessibility
to a large number of jobs determines firms’ locational choices in Paris.
    This book underlines the agglomeration benefits of concentrating jobs in the
city core, but the city core in large cities is often based on compact polycentric
development.
    In London, New York, and Tokyo, the core is made of several growing subcen-
ters linked by transit. The case studies on London describe subcenters like King’s
Cross (considered a fringe location by London planners) and Canary Wharf (about
a 20-minute transit ride from the City of London). In New York they include Mid-
town, Lower Manhattan, Downtown Brooklyn, and Long Island City. In Tokyo, the
Yamanote line links a ring of rapidly growing subcenters along a 33-kilometer circle
line around Tokyo.



Transit-Oriented Development at the Network Level

The layout of transit networks, often in the form of a core-and-branch system, plays
a key role in shaping forces of agglomeration and the distribution of densities
across the urban space. Network analysis shows the benefits of developing sub-
centers around stations at the intersection of inner subway networks and suburban
rail stations, because they concentrate passenger flows and have high growth
potential. Such approach also supports the polycentric development of cities.
    In the cities profiled in this book, two-thirds of jobs are typically located outside
the core area, providing opportunities for creating mixed-use development around

Core-and-Branch Systems
Many subway systems in global cities are characterized by a core-and-branches
structure (Roth and others 2012). The core is densely connected with stations at
constant densities, interconnected by crisscrossing lines. It provides high levels of
accessibility for people and companies. The density of stations decreases sharply
moving away from the city core on branches.3
   The core-and-branches layout has a strong impact on local development po-
tential. It determines the long-term trajectory of densities and accessibilities, as
highlighted in box 1.6.
   The London, Paris, and Tokyo subways started their development around the
same time. All three cities created a circle line (in 1884 in London, 1900–1910 in
Paris, and 1885 in Tokyo) surrounding the core city (about 30 square kilometers
in London, 45 square kilometers in Paris, and 60 square kilometers in Tokyo).

24 O                                                           Transforming the Urban Space



       From this circle line, branches of suburban rail radiate into the suburbs. The den-
       sity and interconnectedness of stations is high in the network core and low in the
       branches, creating job and economic hyperdensities in the core. Network layouts
       shape densities—or put another way, cities are networks from which locations
       emerge.
           The core-and-branches structure of most subway networks leads to concentra-
       tion of jobs within the core. In London, for example, one-third of all jobs (1.5 mil-
       lion) are concentrated in the 15-square kilometer hypercore, the most accessible
       and central part of the subway network.


       Polycentric Systems
       Most subway systems are polycentric, with a ring of strong economic subcenters
       along the loop line (the Yamanote line in Tokyo is one example). Seoul’s subway
       network, inaugurated in 1974, 90 years after London Circle line, is less concen-
       trated and more grid-like, encouraging the emergence of subcenters such as
       Gangnam-gu.
          TOD planning encourages the intensification of human density (people and
       jobs) with a good job/housing mix around the most connected transit stations
       outside the core while preventing development in the less accessible areas be-
       tween the branches. As a complement to the core, polycentric centers linked via
       transit avoid creating one-way flows at peak work hours. China Development Bank
       Capital, Energy Innovation, and Energy Foundation (2015) recommends that the
       job-resident ratio (the number of people employed divided by the number of resi-
       dents) should be 0.5–0.7 in every commuting district and the area should not ex-
       ceed 15 square kilometers.


       Multimodality
       When choosing new line layouts, planners need to pay attention to enhancing the
       connective strength of the entire network, the hierarchy of its centralities, and its
       alignment with economic concentrations. Effective transit systems are hierarchi-
       cally integrated in terms of service, fares, and information; they combine mass
       transit options for the densest corridors, regular bus services for lower-density
       corridors, and last-mile connectivity solutions at the neighborhood level. In large
       emerging cities spilling across multiple local governments (such as the Lima metro
       area or mega-urban regions such as the Yangtze Delta River), doing so requires the
       creation of regional agencies to ensure coordination of infrastructure investment
       across multiple jurisdictions.
           Multimodality across scales—that is the seamless combination of different
       transport modes for a given trip—creates strong hubs that connect urban, re-
       gional, national, and even continental scales. London’s Crossrail provide new
       transport links with the Tube, Thameslink, the National Rail, the Docklands Light
       Railway (DLR), and the London Overground. More than 200 million passengers are
       projected to use Crossrail in its first year of operation in 2019. Crossrail station in-
       terchanges with Tube stations and high-speed rail lines (the existing HS1 and the
       planned HS2) will create very high node values, spurring urban development to
Transit-Oriented Development Strategies at the Metropolitan, Network, and Local Levels   O 25



align place value with the very high node values of the most central stations. Main
hubs where jobs are already concentrated will have more connections and more
lines after Crossrail becomes operational. These hubs, which sit atop the London
transit system hierarchy, are clustered. Crossrail will provide a direct connection
between all of London’s main business centers, linking Heathrow with Paddington,
the West End, the City, and Canary Wharf. Reductions in travel times, improve-
ments in passenger experience, and increases in the frequency of rail service will
have significant impacts on London’s economic performance. New residential and
commercial investment is expected to have a transformational effect on key loca-
tions along the route.


Zoning Around Stations
To reap the benefits of investment in transit networks, cities encourage develop-
ment at major interchanges, at the most accessible stations in the network, and at
stations that are major articulations in the network; moderate development in ar-
eas that are less accessible; and discourage development in areas that are more
than 1 kilometer from a subway station. This approach is central to the achieve-
ment of city-level accessibility targets.
   Zoning policies can be fine-tuned to coordinate the provision of transit infra-
structure and the development of land. An effective planning instrument for
achieving optimal land use intensity at city level and around transit stations is the
floor area ratio (FAR), also known as the floor space index (FSI), the site ratio, and
the plot ratio.
   Good practice includes setting FARs at different levels depending on uses and
accessibility. In Manhattan, for example, the FAR is 24.0 for highly accessible areas
around Grand Central Terminal, 21.6 along Park Avenue, and 14.4–18.0 in other
areas to the east and west (New York City 2013). Singapore (box 1.7) and Seoul
(box 1.8) also use FARs finely tailored based on proximity to stations.
   Good practice also includes a margin of flexibility for both transferring develop-
ment rights between different uses as the market changes and allowing private
developers to adjust the intensity of development based on market needs. In
London’s Kings Cross, margins of flexibility were provided to the main developer
between uses (residential, office, retail) of up to 20 percent. Such an approach in-
creases the marketability of real estate operations in developments that take years
to complete. This flexibility can also be used to capture part of the value created
by real estate development to finance transit infrastructure provision, public space,
and affordable housing.
   Zoning in the Hudson Yards project in Manhattan sets FARs at 10–33 for pre-
dominantly commercial use, 6.5–12 for mixed use, and 6–15 for predominantly
residential use. The range between base and maximum FARs is intended to pro-
vide flexibility and capture value. Developers who want to exceed the base FAR
can do so by making bonus payments to the District Improvement Fund (DIF). The
DIF can be used to finance subway lines extensions, public space, and inclusionary
housing, creating a positive feedback loop of development (see chapter 3) from
the initial rezoning at higher density and a social mix within a high-end mixed-use
business district.

                                     Local communities are the building blocks of TOD. In a TOD community, the inter-
                                     face between a station and the community it serves is critical. Both TOD and
                                     transport-adjacent development (TAD) focus on an 800-meter or 10-minute walk

ments. Like TOD, TAD is near transit. Unlike TOD, however, it fails to capitalize on
this proximity. It lacks functional connectivity to transit in terms of land-use com-
position, station access, and site design.
    Once a development is built, transitioning from TAD to TOD typically takes a
major push from local government in partnership with private sector partners—and
retrofitting is almost always more expensive and complex than starting with a

proper TOD plan. Thus, it is important to focus at the early planning stage on the
transformational effect of transit lines for delivering more vibrant, inclusive, and
sustainable communities.
   Part of the infrastructure investment can be financed through value capture (see
chapter 3). New rail access in an area justifies higher-density planning policies,
because increased accessibility will lead to higher potential market value. Many
local authorities encourage more intense and diversified development near transit
stations, increasing the potential for developer-funded community amenities (see
chapters 5 and 6 for the description of financing instruments to capture value from
developers for funding local amenities in Hudson Yards and King’s Cross).
   Principles for local community development include the following:

• Embrace and maximize the quality of station design and enhance station acces-
  sibility, in order to improve the public realm for increasing place value.
• Prioritize public investment on key interventions.
• Facilitate the availability of health, education, shopping, and recreation
  facilities.
• Guide and leverage private sector activity.

    Station-based urban regeneration or development offers great opportunities—as
long as local authorities and developers adopt a proactive approach. Successful
strategies that work for one station area can be replicated across the network for the
same type of stations.


Types of Stations
Location within the network involves a complex interplay of place, network, and
market potential (these concepts are defined in the introduction and developed in
chapter 2). This complex interplay implies that different types of TOD should be
selected depending on the location of the station within the network.
    The benefits of increased transit accessibility are seldom shared uniformly
across a network. Location within the network leads to a variety of local factors and
planning contexts. The market potential impact of London’s Crossrail (profiled in
chapter 7) varies significantly across stations, and is used for illustration below.
    Every community around a station has a different market profile, a distinct set
of opportunities and challenges, and a unique set of resources at its disposal. The
right policy levers and delivery mechanisms for realizing regeneration and devel-
opment around each station therefore vary widely.
    The 3V Framework is a policy tool for clustering stations based on their different
values. It allows planners to identify key experiences for station types and to use
them to help determine how infrastructure projects can deliver more. TOD com-
mon principles should be adapted to different contexts with planning strategies
(infill, intensification, and transformation) described in chapter 2.

Major hubs
The most promising type of stations are major hubs in central locations. They have
a high node value because they connect several lines and urban scales. They often
30 O                                                         Transforming the Urban Space



       have a diversified urban fabric, sometimes with unique architecture and cultural
       heritage that create high place value.
           London’s Tottenham Court Road Station is a hub that connects the Central and
       Northern lines and many bus routes. Its status as a transit hub is set to grow with
       proposals for the Crossrail 2 route, which would see two Crossrails interchange
       between Tottenham Court Road and Dean Street.
           Despite its high connectivity, the Tottenham Court Road locality has underper-
       formed for decades. Crossrail unlocks the latent growth potential in the area (mar-
       ket potential value) by alleviating transport capacity constraints. The opportunity
       in this type of station is to use the new line as a catalyst for urban transformation.
       Doing so involves designing a more supportive street network and a better envi-
       ronment for pedestrians. The investments of Crossrail in the public realm also have
       a catalytic effect on improving low-quality building facades, which depressed the
       retail sector in the area and limited development values. Improvements to the built
       area will help create a place where a much broader range of uses can be
       accommodated.

       Stations at urban fringe locations
       Urban stations at fringe locations are close to the urban core but not at the most
       central locations. Increased connectivity acts as a catalyst to intensify activity at
       these stations. An example is the approach to regeneration in the area around
       Whitechapel station, in London (see chapter 7). Efforts in this project seek to en-
       courage investment by restoring historic buildings and spaces to highlight cultural
       richness, improve ease of movement both along and across the route, and provide
       better walking and cycling opportunities to stimulate a healthier urban environ-
       ment. The Whitechapel Vision: Regeneration Prospectus (Tower Hamlets), re-
       leased in May 2015, envisions urban intensification supporting the development
       of 3,500 new homes and 5,000 new jobs in the community; transforming Whi-
       techapel Road into a destination shopping area; creating seven new public squares
       and open spaces; and creating a world-class life science campus.

       Suburban stations
       An often-neglected type of stations are suburban stations at the end of lines. They
       have a low node value and in the case of Crossrail are often located within post
       1950s urban infrastructures that dominate and fragment the area (which therefore
       has a low place value). Communities are mostly residential.
           Developers and investors looking at these communities face two challenges.
       The first is the lack of developable sites. In the absence of a masterplan, opportuni-
       ties are not obvious; they are there, they are just fragmented.
           The second challenge comes from their lower market value, which that reduces
       the appeal for developers. Lack of developer confidence in the market means that
       early schemes might have to be developed in partnership with the public sector
       or a housing association.
           An example of such a station is Abbey Road, which sits at the terminus of the
       southeast surface section of the Crossrail route. An infill regeneration strategy is
       envisioned based on diversifying uses in the community. A partnership was formed
       to implement a comprehensive redevelopment on a largely derelict 4-hectare
Transit-Oriented Development Strategies at the Metropolitan, Network, and Local Levels        O 31



brownfield site to the north of the station. The development, known as Cross
Quarter, will “develop a heart” for the area, which will include a new Sainsbury’s
supermarket, addressing the lack of major convenience retail in Abbey Wood.
Cross Quarter will also include 220 new homes, community facilities (including a

Creating vibrant, inclusive, and sustainable communities involves much more than
increasing density or designing a project. It also requires social and economic ac-
tions. The Complete Communities program launched by the Urban Land Institute
defines the following goals:

• Living: To create and preserve communities that provide affordable housing,
  integrated transportation systems, and quality education.
• Working: To enhance regional economic prosperity through jobs, training, and
  access to education in a way that is designed to retain and attract new
  businesses.
• Moving: To promote increasing and improving movement around the region
  using public transit, electric cars, and walking and bicycling to achieve better
  physical well-being.
• Thriving: To support communities that provide access to healthy foods, arts,
  recreation, and entertainment that make people happy and feel meaningful
  through active civic engagement.

   Tying urban rail projects into broader policies for community development can
be mutually beneficial, significantly increasing the quality, effectiveness, and effi-
ciency of other important areas of economic and social policy, including employ-
ment, health, education, and economic development (Jones and Lucas 2012).
   All strategies for station areas redevelopment include a strong component of
urban quality improvement. Good urban design adds place value, supports in-
creased density, and helps ensure that it does not feel oppressive. It requires signifi-
cant streetscape improvement, so that streets are places for people. Urban design
that creates a spirit of place creates a feeling of enclosure, human scale, coherence,
and linkage. (Chapter 4 discusses the core qualities of good urban design.)

Drivers, Policies, and Strategies to
Increase Values Using the 3V
Framework



The 3V Framework is based on three values that characterize transit stations: node
value, place value, and market potential value. This chapter presents key drivers of
node, place, and market potential value; describes how planners can cluster sta-
tion areas based on their values; and defines strategies of urban transformation to
increase value. Increasing a value (node, place, or market potential) in a station
area has an impact on other values. The main goal of the 3V Framework is to reveal
imbalances in the structure of values across the urban space and around stations.
These imbalances offer opportunities to improve the alignment of values, drive
urban growth, and initiate positive feedback loops of value capture.
    The 3V Framework introduces two main changes to the node/place model
proposed by Bertolini in 1999. First, it bases node value on recent research about
the structure of networks and the roles played by three kinds of centralities: de-
gree, closeness, and betweenness. Network science has progressed considerably
since 2000, with important discoveries about structural similarities shared by the
Internet, social networks, DNA, and neural networks. This body of knowledge has
been applied to subways to explain why station areas such as Shinjuku in Tokyo are
booming. This work has important implications for public policies, as it reveals that
network layouts matter for creating value.                                              Opposite page:

       place at different stages of development—which can lead to positive feedback
       loops between the two—making the split particularly meaningful. The case studies
       on Hudson Yards (chapter 5) and Kings Cross (chapter 6) illustrate this well. In
       China, for example, it is essential to separate these dimensions so that decision
       makers realize that without addressing the use of superblocks in urban planning
       much value will be lost.
          The 3V Framework explores different aspects of planned stations, including
       their role in the transit network (node value); the scale of change expected (com-
       paring existing uses to future uses and assessing place value); and how market
       timing, development opportunity, and the scale of investment can come together
       to identify opportunity sites and key activities to support or strengthen market
       activity.



       What Drives Node, Place, and Market Potential Values?

       For residents, value is driven by the characteristics of a place (the fit with personal
       preferences in terms of urban form, schools, access to daily amenities such as
       parks, heath facilities, and recreation centers, walkability and bikeability) and the
       connections between the place and job opportunities or other amenities used less
       than daily in the rest of the city. For companies, value is derived from maximizing
       profitability, which in the service industries will typically lead to converging to
       space with a high agglomeration of jobs. The application of transit-oriented devel-
       opment (TOD) principles can support such value creation, by strengthening the
       quality of life at the local level while providing for enhanced job opportunities
       through good connections to jobs at the network and city levels using mass
       transit.


       Drivers of Node Value: The Impact of Centralities in the
       Network
       Node value is driven by the importance of a node in a transportation network. All
       nodes in a network are not equal. Differences in the number of lines and modes of
       transport a node offers, as well as differences in centrality within the network, cre-
       ate a hierarchy of nodes. Nodes that are strong and complex hubs, more central,
       more accessible, or combine all these qualities have a higher value, because they
       tend to serve more passengers. Shinjuku, in Tokyo—the world’s busiest station,
       with 3.5 million passengers a day—ranks high in terms of centrality.

       From intermodal hubs to simple nodes
       Hubs are among the most important nodes. A transport hub (also known as a
       transport interchange) is a place where passengers can switch between lines or
       between transport modes. Public transit hubs include large subway stations with
       multiple lines, train stations, rapid transit stations, bus stations, tram stations, and
       airports.
          Some complex hubs combine several modes in a single integrated multimodal
       station, or complex of stations. Examples include Hongqiao Airport in Shanghai;
Drivers, Policies, and Strategies to Increase Values Using the 3V Framework                            O 37



Tokyo Station, which link the high-speed rail station to six subway stations; and
Union Station in Washington, which combines long-distance trains, commuter
trains and buses, with metro and city buses. The number of lines and modes con-
necting at a hub defines its importance.
    The hierarchy of nodes is as follows:

• Highly connective hubs offer transfers between many lines and transport
  modes. They are clustered at the core of the network.
• Core transfer stations connect two or three lines. Most are located in city
  centers.
• Single line stations radiate from the core of the network.

The core-and-branches structure
Some nodes in a network are more accessible than others (accessibility refers to
the distance of a station to all other stations). In a well-organized city, jobs tend to
cluster around the more accessible nodes within networks. These highly accessible
nodes are usually clustered in the dense and interconnected core of the transit
network.
   Efficient subway layouts in global cities (including the systems in, Shanghai,
Tokyo, Seoul, London, Paris, and New York) converge toward a similar layout,
characterized by a core-and-branches structure (figure 2.1), despite their geo-
graphical and economic differences (Roth and others 2012). Densely intercon-
nected by crisscrossing lines, the core provides maximum accessibility to jobs and
people. It usually extends only about 5 kilometers, because it would be costly to
maintain a high density of stations beyond this radius. Outside this area stations
tend to be located on branches, and the density of stations decreases sharply
when moving away from the city core (see appendix A).1

                                            The core-and-branches layout and the differences in centralities in subway net-
                                         works have a strong impact on local development potential. Major subway exten-
                                         sions with radiating branches, such as the one built in Seoul in the 1990s, made
                                         the central stations within the core more accessible from all other stations, creating
                                         strong market potential at the center. As a result, land prices rose, and develop-
                                         ment opportunities increased. Major subcenters may develop when subway ex-
                                         tensions lead to large increases in accessibility, as they did in Gangnam-ku in
                                         Seoul, where, over a period of 20 years, a booming real estate market raised the
                                         property value in an area of 40 square kilometers above that of Busan, the second-
                                         largest Korean city and one of the first global container ports.2

                                         Centrality in transit networks
                                         Centrality is a structural characteristic of stations (nodes) in the network that quanti-
                                         fies how a station fits within the transit network overall. Stations with high centrality
                                         scores are more likely to be key conduits of people and to help concentrate jobs
                                         and economic activities. Low-centrality stations can be termed peripheral. Lower
                                         centrality is associated with lower growth potential and fewer job opportunities.
                                         Three of the most commonly used measures are degree, closeness, and between-
                                         ness centrality.3

                                         Degree centrality
                                         Degree centrality is the number of links per node. It is an important property of
                                         many networks, in particular the Internet (figure 2.2).

the highest growth potentials—are located around the Circle Line and along the
Central Line, defining Central London. There is a higher density of high-degree
stations in the western part of Central London, where one third of London’s jobs
are concentrated.

Closeness centrality
Closeness centrality expresses the average distance, measured in number of links,
from a station to every other station in the network. Stations who connect to most
others through many intermediaries get closeness scores that are increasingly
nearer to zero. One property of closeness centrality is that it tends to assign high
scores to stations that are near the center of local clusters.
    Closeness centrality is an important property of many networks, including social
networks (figure 2.3) and the London subway (map 2.2). Closeness centrality in
London’s subway network confirms that Central London is the most accessible part
of the network.

Betweenness centrality
The betweenness centrality of a station is equal to the number of shortest paths
from all stations to all others that pass through this station. A station with high
betweenness centrality has a large influence on the transfer of passengers through
the network, under the assumption that passenger transfer follows the shortest
paths. This calculation identifies the stations that are necessary conduits for pas-
sengers that must traverse disparate parts of the network, such as suburban trains

and subway lines or core-and-branches in a subway network. An example is the
interchange stations along the Yamanote Line in Tokyo, which have high levels of
betweenness centrality. Stations with high levels of betweenness centrality often
do not have the shortest average path to every other station, but they have the
largest number of shortest paths that have to go through them.
   Betweenness centrality is an important property of many networks. The con-
cept finds wide application, including in computer and social networks, biology,
transport, and scientific cooperation. In the Facebook network (figure 2.4), indi-
viduals who act as bridges between clusters in the network have high betweenness
centrality.
   Map 2.3 highlights the betweenness centrality of the Circle Line, built in 1884.
Most of London’s original train stations are located on the Circle Line, which con-
nects the radiating branches of suburban trains with the Central London transit
network.
   Like the Circle Line, the Yamanote Line in Tokyo (built in 1885) is shaping
growth, through a high level of centrality for its stations (box 2.1).

• Intermodal diversity refers to the number and variety of transportation modes
  a station connects. The more options and variety of choices a station offers,
  including connection to subways, buses, and high-speed rail, the higher its
  connectivity. Providing a variety of modes and integrating bicycles and bus fa-
  cilities, as in Malmö, Sweden, is key for increasing transit connectivity and en-
  hancing accessibility to jobs, as shown in the Zhengzhou case study (chapter 8).


Drivers of Place Value: Local Connectivity, Fine-Grain
Urban Fabric, and Mixed Use
Because place value varies widely, the types of planning, urban design, public
policies, and investment strategies will be different based on local station area
context. Place value for residents is derived from vibrant, sustainable communities
that provide easy access to jobs, shopping, and services on foot or bicycle. Such
communities provide a range of benefits, including reduced transportation costs,
improved access to various amenities (including high-quality education), and im-
proved public health.
    A key driver of place value is the quality of the urban fabric, which is based on
human scale, permeability, diversity, and the capacity to evolve. High quality is
achieved by small blocks, subdivided into land lots of various sizes, and a high
density of street intersections.
    The block is a central element of urban planning and urban design. It is the
smallest area that is surrounded by streets. City blocks are the space for buildings
within the street pattern of a city; they form the basic unit of a city’s urban fabric.
City blocks can be subdivided into smaller land lots, usually privately owned. City
blocks are usually built up to varying degrees and thus form the physical containers
of public space. The Portland Transit-Oriented Strategic Plan demonstrates a cor-
relation between block size and land value, with smaller blocks having higher land
values (CTOD 2011).
    Place value is unevenly distributed across an urban area. Places across cities
have a wide range of intensities and a mix of land uses. In a typical city, many sta-
tions areas are mainly residential, with low intensity, while a few are more job ori-
ented and mixed use, with high intensity.
    Walkability also varies. It depends on the street patterns and the design of
streets as places for people. Street patterns determine not only whether residents
and workers can access rail and bus transit but also whether they can access the
shopping, jobs, and services located in their immediate neighborhood. Street pat-
terns with blocks about 100 meters per side and high connectivity enhance local
accessibility (see box 2.2). In contrast, superblocks and gating decrease
accessibility.
    An index of place value can be built using a weighted sum of the following
metrics (see appendix B):

• Density of street intersections measures the density of street intersections
  within an 800-meter radius of each station. Connected street patterns with a

                                      high density of intersections promote accessibility and walkability. International
                                      best practice shows that an intersection density of about 100 intersections per
                                      square kilometer enhances accessibility.
                                    • Pedestrian accessibility measures the proportion of the area within 800 meters
                                      of a station that is within a 10-minute walk. Block sizes of about 100 meters per
                                      side with vibrant edges (facades with businesses on the perimeter) promote
                                      more compact development and walkability.
                                    • Diversity of land uses measures the different types of land use with an 800-me-
                                      ter radius of a station. Areas with commercial urban amenities such as restau-

  rants, grocery stores, and specialty retail shops allow residents to perform daily
  activities.
• Density of social infrastructure (amenities) measures the number of cultural,
  educational, and health services as well as the social infrastructure, within 800
  meters of a station. When concentrated in a compact area or easily accessible,
  such amenities increase place value.
• Pedestrian/bicycle connectivity measures access to sidewalks and bikeways,
  which encourage people to walk or cycle to transit stations and neighborhood
  destinations. It can be added to the other measures where appropriate.


Drivers of Market Potential Value: The Interaction of
Supply and Demand
The market potential value of a station area is assessed by understanding the un-
realized market value around it. Market demand at the city level also needs to be
understood, to put such analysis in context. The availability of relevant data varies
widely from city to city; the approach needs to be tailored accordingly, focusing
on local drivers of demand and supply.

Drivers of demand
Market potential depends on overall demand for real estate development at the
city level and on the economic activity and attractiveness of the specific place for
developers and businesses. For businesses and commercial activities, local job
densities and high accessibility to other job concentrations across the urban area
and expected growth are crucial, because they determine the agglomeration
economies of locating around a specific station. For residential development, mar-
ket potential depends greatly on the number of jobs accessible in 30–45 minutes
from a location.

Drivers of supply
Market potential depends on available land opportunities, the ease with which
land can be redeveloped, and the volume of construction permitted. When a loca-
tion is highly attractive, the market develops high-density programs with mixed-
use programs, as long as FARs are adjusted upward, as is in King’s Cross in London
(26 hectares) and Hudson Yards in Manhattan (22 hectares).
   Emerging areas that have some market potential but few mixed-use buildings
may be good candidates for TOD investment. TOD policy can help push a ripen-
ing market and escalate development intensity and quality. In areas with less mar-
ket potential, strong incentives are needed to encourage market development
and the desired mix of land uses and building types.

Market activity
Market activity is an important component of market potential value. It derives
from the intensity of market transactions during a sufficiently long period for resi-
dential and mixed-use (residential/commercial) land uses. Box 2.3 illustrates the
role of an increase in connectivity and high-quality public space in building strong
market demand in Canary Wharf, in London.

Calculating market potential value
Market potential value metrics provide a rough measure of the feasibility of TOD
development based on local conditions (see appendix B). It depends on overall
demand for additional real estate at the city level. Market potential can be mea-
sured with a weighted combination of demand-side and supply-side measures.
   Demand-side measures include the following:

• Human density measures the number of people and jobs per square kilometer
  within a catchment area of 800 meters around a transit station. The number of
  residents and workers in an area and the balance between jobs and working-
  age population is correlated with the attractiveness of an area for residents and
  businesses and with the development of a strong real estate market.
• Activity mix measures the mix of residents and jobs in an area. It can be mea-
  sured through the job to resident ratio.
• Forecasted rate of growth in human density indicates the expected evolution
  around a station. It is typically forecast as part of urban mobility plans or mass
  transit development plans.
• Number of accessible jobs measures the number of jobs accessible through
  transit and walking within a given time (usually 30–45 minutes). It measures an
  area’s attractiveness for residents and companies, which want strong linkages
  with other dense nodes of jobs within the urban region.

   Supply-side measures include the following:

• Real estate opportunities measures the potential for developable floor space lo-
  cated within 400 meters of a station for the highest premium and 400–800 meters
  for a lower premium. Real estate opportunities are based on additional square
  meters of floor space that can be built on land adjacent to the station—the differ-
  ence between the maximum floor space that can be built within the regulatory
  FAR and the existing built floor space. High FARs support a high density of people
  and jobs and a high volume of construction.
• Volume of transactions provides useful indications of the state of the market. A
  decades’ worth of data should be examined (where available), to provide a
  longer-range look at performance. Overall demand for additional real estate at
  the city level should be considered.


Impact of Station Locations on Values
International experience suggests that node value (high connectivity and accessi-
bility within the network) plays a major role in dense core areas, where it fosters
economic and jobs concentration and commercial real estate development. Ca-
nary Wharf and King’s Cross in London are examples of projects where increased
connectivity caused spikes in market value.
    Connectivity plays a less important role than place value in low- to medium-
density areas. One of the key features of residential property value is the residential
self-selection process (a process in which individuals select places that fit their pref-
erences, in particular for amenities and schools). Self-selection explains large varia-
50 O                                                          Transforming the Urban Space



       tions between value changes (and direction) at different stations on a given line
       (Higgins 2015), even though all benefit from increased accessibility. Stations where
       place value is more important than node value are typically in the long tail of single-
       line stations, for which node value is generally weak (the strongest node values are
       major hubs, which are usually within the core part of subway systems).1



       Types of Station Areas

       The three values are unevenly distributed across station areas.2 Some stations are
       important interchanges between different subway lines and different transport
       modes. These stations offer high potential for new developments. Other stations
       offer less potential, because they are in suburban areas, with less vibrant real estate
       markets and fewer connections to the rest of the network. These stations offer differ-
       ent opportunities, such as cheap available land to redevelop, as the analysis of risks
       and opportunities in fringe and central locations along the Crossrail route in London
       demonstrates (chapter 7). Different types of stations require different types of devel-
       opment strategies, investments, and policy instruments. A methodology is needed
       to cluster stations based on their node, place, and market potential values.


       Clustering Station Areas Based on Node Value
       Node value is higher at subway network cores than at the periphery. At network
       cores, stations are interconnected in dense clusters around major hubs. At the
       periphery of the network, stations are spaced much farther apart.
          The mathematical regularities in the core-and-branches layout of many subway
       networks, the distribution of transit centralities, and the intensity of flows across
       many subway systems allows a clustering of node value into single-line stations,
       core transfer stations, and highly connective hubs

       1. Single-line stations belong mostly to the branches of the urban rail system ex-
          tending outward into the suburbs.
       2. Core transfer stations are transfer stations with two or more lines concentrated
          at the city core.
       3. Highly connective hubs rank high in intermodality, centrality, and intensity of
          passengers flows. They have the highest node values.


       Clustering Station Areas Based on Place Value
       Station areas can be grouped into three types based on their place value: subur-
       ban, urban, and intense urban.

       1. Suburban areas are generally nontransit areas or areas close to transit that do
          not possess the urban character that would best support TOD. This category
          generally describes low to moderately populated areas that lack a combination
          of street connectivity, pedestrian and bicycle facilities, and urban amenities to
          more fully support the level of transit service. Suburban areas are generally
Drivers, Policies, and Strategies to Increase Values Using the 3V Framework            O 51



   mono-functional (either residential or industrial or business parks, with no
   mixed use) on large areas of land.
2. Urban areas are moderately or substantially populated areas with a good or
   improving pedestrian/bicycle network and some mix of neighborhood retail
   and service amenities as well as a moderate mix of supporting jobs.
3. Intense urban areas combine a high diversity and intensity of uses with high
   economic concentrations, making these areas the most likely to support a tran-
   sit lifestyle.


Clustering Station Areas Based on Market Potential Value
Station areas can be clustered into three types based on their market potential
value: limited, emerging, and strong.

1. Limited areas have weaker market conditions and lack the demand necessary
   to support new compact and/or mixed-use development. TOD investments in
   these areas are less likely to catalyze additional private development and
   should be used only on a limited basis. An emphasis on visioning and planning,
   to begin to develop interest, is more appropriate.
2. Emerging areas have limited to moderate real estate market conditions; inten-
   sive building types are generally not supported in the near term. Although they
   may lack immediate market support for TOD, emerging areas may be ideally
   suited for catalytic TOD investments to enhance local market strength, because
   land and development costs are not high and small investments may catalyze
   further market investment.
3. Strong areas have market conditions that are already ripe or ripening, TOD in-
   vestments should focus on improving urban living amenities and developing
   prototype developments.

   This approach is not predictive of the financial feasibility of a new development
in a category. Rather, it provides a sense of how a station area is likely to
perform.



Policies for Different Types of Stations: Infill,
Intensification, and Transformation

The 3V Framework is a virtuous circle. Higher place, node, and market potential
values induce higher economic value, which in return raises place and node value,
as more and more opportunities emerge and investments become more profit-
able. The 3V Framework integrates the different aspects and scales of urban
development.
    TOD investments are intended to stimulate a market response, but many other
critical investments and incentives are needed. TOD investments should take a
comprehensive view of programs and policies that can help realize the full range
of TOD benefits. These comprehensive strategies include investments in human
capital, neighborhood services, and business development, which may improve

                                                                  • Infill is mainly for nodes in suburban neighborhoods with single transit lines and

  ity levels and transit service through increased densities; plan and fund multi-
  modal transportation system; and plan for maintaining equity in vulnerable or
  challenged communities. Such locations can provide good opportunities for
  affordable housing.
• Intensification is for emerging station areas in urban neighborhoods with inter-
  changes and emerging markets. Intensification areas are typically built-up areas
  with good existing or potential public transit links that can support redevelop-
  ment at higher than existing densities. The strategy is to invest in catalytic TOD
  projects to prime and push the market, promote development-oriented plan-
  ning, and evaluate and address missing multimodal connections and accessibil-
  ity.3 Such locations can be prime opportunities to provide affordable housing.
• Transformation is the strategy to apply in major hubs. Creating a high level of
  place value—through job concentration and good urban design, including ma-
  jor investments in public spaces—can create high peaks of land and real estate
  value. The strategy is to invest in aggressive TOD projects to push the market,
  through significantly higher densities and lower parking ratios; innovative build-
  ing types and advancements in urban design; employment opportunities;
  some affordable or workforce housing; and increased transit service, capacity,
  and amenities to support intensity of uses.

    The nine types of development in each matrix are grouped into three clusters.
The types on the diagonal are balanced types, needing infill, intensification, or
transformation depending on their value. The most promising types are the ones
outside the diagonal, which can be considered as unbalanced. They offer great
potential for transformation, such as the massive redevelopments at King’s Cross
and Hudson Yards. These matrices are not to be considered as static descriptions
but as dynamic tools for identifying the levels of possible transformations of differ-
ent TOD areas.
    The actionable strategies depend on the relative strengths of values at each loca-
tion. A location with a high node value (a highly connective major hub) such as King’s
Cross, for example, can acquire a high market potential value through massive in-
vestments in high-quality public space when the market timing is right. Such a strat-
egy is transformative. At the other end of the range, in suburban stations on a single
line with a limited market potential value, infill development would be favored.



Key Strategies for Increasing Values

Planners can adopt the following approaches for increasing values.


Increasing Node Value
Network structures vary. Some have more hubs than others and interconnect more
neighboring stations with criss-crossing lines. These network organizations shape
land uses and land values differently. Networks that present strong concentrations of
lines in focal points, which interconnect many lines and transportation modes, shape
economic concentrations in spikes, with high peaks of value concentration. In con-
54 O                                                            Transforming the Urban Space



       trast, networks that are flat, with no major hubs and no dense concentration of lines
       in a core, do not offer strong opportunities for capturing high land values around
       stations. As efficient urban spatial organizations require concentrating production
       factors to create agglomeration economies, the more hierarchy a network presents,
       the better it is for shaping land uses in a productive way for economic growth.
           In London, Tokyo, and Seoul, transit network structures determine how concen-
       trated population, jobs, and economic densities will be. The spatial development
       strategy of cities like these is to first create a hierarchy of hubs in the transit network
       and then to encourage public and private investment to create high place value
       around these nodes. Subway systems in China, developed much more recently,
       are less hierarchical so far than subways that evolved under market forces and over
       long periods of time, like the London or Tokyo subways.
           Key strategies for increasing node value include interlinking neighboring sta-
       tions into clusters and increasing accessibility of core stations within the network.
       Interlinking—that is, increasing the density of links between neighboring sta-
       tions—creates many triangles between neighboring stations and tightly connects
       the network, offering passengers varied possibilities for interchange. Increased
       accessibility of stations within the network makes a given station more valuable.
       Successful subway extensions, such as the addition of four lines in Seoul, cluster a
       large number of highly accessible stations in the network core, concentrating den-
       sity and economic activity. Such a network level approach needs to be supported
       by increased service levels and service integration.


       Increasing Place Value
       TOD creates place value through greater compactness, mixed-use development,
       and an urban environment that supports vibrant and active communities.4 The
       optimal mix of economic, educational, transport, and recreational opportunities
       ultimately gives rise to a people-centered city, where the needs of all people are
       placed at the core of all planning processes. TOD creates new street-life patterns
       where people can move about easily and confidently, linger, and get together with
       other people.
           The City Prosperity Initiative (UN-Habitat and International City Leaders 2015)
       provides a comprehensive assessment of cities’ prosperity based on indicators along
       six dimensions: productivity, infrastructure, quality of life, equity and social inclusion,
       environmental sustainability, governance, and legislation. According to this index, 85
       percent of cities with a very solid prosperity index are in Europe, led by Oslo, Copen-
       hagen, Stockholm, Helsinki, Paris, and Vienna (Amsterdam, Tokyo, London, and Zu-
       rich are also in the top 20). These cities offer high-quality public spaces and dense
       street patterns. Box 2.4 summarizes key benchmarks for enhancing place value de-
       rived from international best practice and UN-Habitat recommendations.
           Key strategies for raising place value are increasing compactness and increas-
       ing the diversity of land uses. As identified early by Jane Jacobs (1961), the com-
       pact city (or city of short distances) is an urban planning and urban design concept
       that promotes relatively high residential density with mixed land uses.
           At the scale of the city, being compact means being integrated spatially by
       public transit systems. Compactness can be applied to a neighborhood scale, re-

sulting in spatial integration by good walking and cycling connectivity and orienta-
tion toward transit stations. A large resident population provides opportunities for
social interaction as well as a feeling of safety. A compact city is also a more sus-
tainable urban settlement type than urban sprawl, because it is less dependent on
cars and requires less infrastructure provision per capita. The two performance
objectives for compactness focus on the proximity of a development to existing
urban activity and short travel time to major trip generators in the central and re-
gional destinations (ITDP 2014).
   Providing diverse and complementary uses within the same or adjacent blocks
reduces trip lengths and support the clustering of economic activity (photo 2.1).
Mixed-use development helps create high-quality neighborhoods with vibrant
and sustainable communities amenable to a concentration of commercial, cultural,
and educational amenities.

           In high-value places, personal motor vehicles become largely unnecessary in
       day-to-day life, making it possible to reduce the roadway area. Scarce and valuable
       urban space resources can be reclaimed from unnecessary roads and parking space
       and reallocated to more socially and economically productive uses (ITDP 2014).
       Despite wealthy populations, Paris intra-muros and Manhattan have extremely low
       rates of car ownership, because people find cars unnecessary, expensive, and in-
       convenient. Half of Paris intra-muros households and less than half of households
       in New York own a car. Within the five boroughs, ownership is lowest in Manhattan
       (23 percent of households), followed by Brooklyn (44 percent) and the Bronx (46
       percent). In contrast, a large majority of households in Queens (64 percent) and
       Staten Island (84 percent) own at least one car. These overall ownership rates are
       far lower than in the rest of the United States, where 92 percent of all households
       own at least one car and 20 percent own three or more vehicles.
           To support compactness and mixed use, neighborhoods need to be designed in
       a way that promotes walking and cycling, reclaiming the streetscape from cars. Walk-
       ing and cycling are the most natural, affordable, healthy, and clean modes of travel
       for short distances—and a necessary component of the vast majority of transit trips.
           The size of urban blocks and the street network influence walkability and bikeability.
       Small block sizes reduce vehicle miles traveled and raise property values (CTOD 2011).
       Dense networks of streets and paths and small blocks enhance walkability. Certain
       thresholds differentiate pedestrian cities, TOD cities, and car-dependent cities. Japa-
       nese cities with an average distance between intersections of 50 meters (even in mod-
       ern Tokyo) are highly pedestrian friendly (Salat 2011). European cities built in the 19th
       century as well as the historical core of U.S. and some Asian cities have average dis-
       tances between intersections of 100–150 meters, the TOD planning sizing.

       meters. Taking into account that each street on the perimeter of the diagram is
       counted as half (because it belongs to two squares of 1 square kilometer each), the
       total street length is 18 kilometers and the number of intersections per square kilo-
       meters is 81. In this street network model, recommended by UN-Habitat, both
       street hierarchy and block size are considered. This simple model illustrates a good
       balance between street and other land uses. Other patterns, like the rectangular
       pattern in New York, are also effective. Cities have much to gain in terms of quality
       of the urban space in developing a street density level similar to the one recom-
       mended in the model.
           The creation of a vibrant and active pedestrian public realm plays a major role
       in stimulating walking. Walking can be highly attractive when sidewalks are ani-
       mated and lined with useful ground-floor activities and services, such as store-
       fronts and restaurants. Pedestrians and cyclists increase the exposure and vitality
       of local retail shops.
           Cities are rediscovering the value of developing cycling networks; early adopters
       have realized that cycle-friendliness enhances place value. It is strongly promoted in
       Amsterdam, Paris, and Malmö (photo 2.3). Key factors encouraging cycling are safe
       street conditions, in particular at intersections, and secure cycle parking and stor-
       age. A safe cycling network connecting all buildings and destinations through the
       shortest routes available is a basic TOD requirement (ITDP 2014). Cycling can be an
       attractive travel option only to the extent that bicycles can be securely locked.

Increasing Market Potential Value
Increasing residential density
Market potential is increased on the demand side by encouraging higher residen-
tial and employment densities and higher employment rates. It is increased on the
supply side by greater diversity of land parcel sizes, which create a vibrant land
market, and higher FARs near transit stations.
    Residential densities are not uniformly distributed (figure 2.7). High residential
density around stations results in well-populated streets, ensuring that urban
places are lively, active, vibrant, and (often) safe places where people want to live.
Density delivers the customer base that supports a wide range of services and
amenities and makes local commerce thrive. As many of the most famous and
desirable neighborhoods in the world attest, high-density living can be highly at-
tractive if supported by the right level of infrastructure (photo 2.4). Cities can stim-
ulate increased density around stations by adjusting their land-use plans.
    High residential density does not imply vertical urban forms. With 21,000 in-
habitants per square kilometer (25,000 excluding the Bois de Boulogne and Bois
de Vincennes), seven-story-high intra-muros Paris, where strict regulations ban
high-rises, achieves the same average residential density as Manhattan. Indeed,
several districts have densities of 40,000 inhabitants per square kilometer—much
higher than in vertical urban forms. Vertical growth is most often low density, be-
cause of inefficient land use (much urban land is left empty or occupied by over-
sized road infrastructures). Cities benefit from growing in a more compact form,
with traditional low- and medium-rise buildings in small-perimeter blocks.

Increasing job density
Job density feeds economic productivity as a result of economies of agglomera-
tion.5 A doubling of employment density in U.S. cities corresponds to a 6 percent
increase in hourly labor productivity (Haughwout 2009). A study of 261 Chinese

       cities shows that economic productivity in China increases by 8.8 percent with a
       doubling of employment density (Fan 2007). Economies of agglomeration are the
       benefits firms obtain by locating near one another. This concept relates to the idea
       of economies of scale and network effects. As more firms in related fields of busi-
       ness cluster, their costs of production may decline significantly. Even when com-
       peting firms in the same sector cluster, there may be advantages, because the
       cluster attracts more suppliers and customers than a single firm could achieve.
       Cities form and grow to exploit economies of agglomeration.
           Job density increases market potential values as economic density determines
       firms’ locational choices. Across the United States, job density explains half of the
       variation in economic productivity per capita. Job and business densities are key
       to reaping the benefits of agglomeration economies, increasing economic pro-
       ductivity, and fostering innovation. Concentrating economic activity in particular
       locations enables firms to reap economies of scale and scope and bring talented
       people together to share ideas and innovate. Job densities reflect such phenom-
       ena by exhibiting high peaks of concentration (figure 2.8).

       Increasing human density
       Human density is the total number of residents and jobs in a district. It gives an indica-
       tion of the intensity of development. The number of residents and workers in an area
       and the balance between jobs and the working-age population has a direct correla-
       tion with the attractiveness of an area for residents and businesses and thus the de-
       velopment of a strong real estate market. Cities can create the conditions to allow
       such increases in human density to take place by setting a vision, building consensus,
       planning actions, and investing in infrastructure that supports such increases.

Increasing the diversity of land parcel sizes to create a vibrant land market
Diversifying the size of land parcels can help create an adaptive city that can meet
future demand. Manhattan provides a good example of such an approach. Origi-
nally, its land parcels were sold in units of 200 square meters (about 300,000 units
of land for sale on an area the size of Manhattan [about 60 square kilometers]).
Such small parcels fostered an active land market with great potential of future
mixed use. Over time plots of land in Manhattan have been consolidated, but
40 percent of all land still remains the initial size set two centuries ago. Very few
parcels occupy whole urban blocks (figure 2.9).

   Plots in urban China are much larger: current urban development is based on
400 meter x 400 meter superblocks. On an area the size of Manhattan, there would
be only 250 units of land for sale in a Chinese new town. Cities can increase the
vibrancy of their land market by creating a wider range of block sizes and encour-
aging diversity of development.

       Increasing floor area ratios near transit stations
       In TOD projects, local authorities often reset FARs at higher values, to allow for den-
       sification and to generate revenue streams that can be captured to finance infrastruc-
       tures (transit and public spaces). Commercial FARs can be raised near stations; resi-
       dential FARs can also be reset, albeit at lower values than commercial FARs.
           Such approach has an impact on both land value and compactness. A 2015
       analysis of the options for Shanghai found that existing areas around metro sta-
       tions would be sufficient to accommodate the required built area for the estimated
       growth in population by 2050 if FARs are raised to levels in Hong Kong SAR, China;
       New York; Seoul, Singapore; and Tokyo; (World Bank and Chreod Ltd. 2015).



       Notes

       1 In statistics a long tail in a distribution is the portion of the distribution having a large
         number of occurrences far from the “head” or central part of the distribution. In inverse
         power laws, the long tail is the high frequency of occurrences of small values (in metro
         systems the large number of stations with only one line passing through them). The term
         long tail has gained popularity in recent times for describing the retailing strategy of
         selling small numbers of a large number of unique items, usually in addition to selling a
         small number of popular items in large quantities.

       3 Urban catalysts (used, for example, in New York) are new redevelopment strategies
         comprising a series of projects that drive and guide urban development. In the past,
         redevelopment efforts such as urban renewal and large-scale redevelopment projects
         often jeopardized the vitality of downtowns. The difference between an urban catalyst
         and these redevelopment strategies is that catalytic redevelopment is a holistic, not a
         clean-slate, approach to revitalizing the urban fabric.

       5 New economic geography provides an integrated and micro-founded approach to spa-
         tial economics. It emphasizes the role of clustering forces in generating an uneven dis-
         tribution of economic activity and income across space. The approach has been applied
         to the economics of cities, the emergence of regional disparities, and the origins of in-
         ternational inequalities (Bogart 1998; Brueckner 2005; Coe, Kelly, and Yeung 2007;
         Strange 2008; Venables 2008; Moretti 2013).

The Dynamic Interplay of Values and
Its Contribution to Value Capture


Urban transit systems and urban regeneration are essential for promoting urban
economic growth and improving the quality of life by providing access to places
and activities for work, education, services, and leisure. To establish affordable,
high-quality transport systems, cities must ensure that their transport systems are
financially sustainable. Revenue from users, indirect beneficiaries, and public
sources must be sufficient to pay for new investments in infrastructure and fund
maintenance and operation of existing facilities and services.
    Many cities in developing countries face underfunding for urban transport. In
these cities, the upfront investments needed for new transport infrastructure are
large compared with their fiscal capacity, and revenue from their still small-scale
and often poor-quality systems and other sources is insufficient to cover mainte-
nance and operation expenses, let alone new investments.
    By choosing the most appropriate sets of financing instruments and focusing
on wise investments, cities can design comprehensive financing for all types of
urban transport projects, using innovative, multilevel revenue sources that
promote efficient pricing schemes; increase overall revenue; strengthen
sustainable transport; and cover capital investments, operation, and maintenance
for all parts of a public transit system. (For a framework for achieving comprehensive
and sustainable urban transport financing, see Ardila-Gomez and Ortegon-
Sanchez 2016.)

       provide affordable housing and daycare centers in their new facilities (chapters 5–7
       describe how New York and London have used these mechanisms.)
          This chapter introduces value capture in the context of the 3V Framework by
       describing how the dynamic interplay of values (particularly node and place value)
       creates economic value and facilitates value capture that can be used to finance
       investments in urban growth and transit. Transit-oriented development (TOD) is
       the key to turning node-place dynamics into market success stories such as King’s
       Cross in London and Hudson Yards in New York, described in chapters 5 and 6.
       Addressing imbalances between values can unleash development potential.



       The Dynamic Power of Imbalances between Values

       The 3V Framework allows policy makers to assess development potential in a
       proactive and dynamic way. Not only are the values of stations unevenly distrib-
       uted; the different types of values for each station may differ greatly. The most
       promising areas of development are the ones where increased connectivity
       through public investment comes in places where there is room for further
       development.
           Bertolini’s (1999) node-place model considers place and node values.1 It in-
       cludes an analysis of the dynamic interplay of place and node values to create
       market potential and economic value. According to Bertolini, by increasing acces-
       sibility, improving the transport provision (node value) of a location will create
       conditions favorable to the further development of the location. In turn, the devel-
       opment of a location (an increase in its place value) will create conditions favorable
       to the further development of the transport system, initiating a positive feedback
       loop of development. This model highlights the dynamic potential of imbalances
       of values within the same station area (box 3.1).
           Unbalanced nodes and unbalanced places create strong development oppor-
       tunities, because they are underutilized assets. When leveraging these develop-
       ment opportunities, specific policies should be put in place to ensure equity, such
       as professional training for local populations or inclusionary housing.
           King’s Cross was an unbalanced node, with one of Europe’s highest levels of
       accessibility, connectivity, and centrality for high-speed rail, national and regional
       rail, urban rail, and subway networks (photo 3.1). The area had a strong imbal-
       ance, with underutilization of its 27 hectares of land. Creating place value with a
       high-quality public realm (40 percent of the land); 20 new connective streets; 10
       plazas and gardens; and a mixed-use program that includes Google’s second
       global headquarters, digital start-ups, inclusionary housing, a school for the arts,
       cafes, and retail stores increased place value, which in turn increased market
       potential.
           Hudson Yards (image 3.1) is a major high-density, mixed-use land redevelop-
       ment planned and designed to capture job growth in the knowledge and creative
       economy. It was an underutilized land asset close to the highest concentration of
       creative and financial industries in Midtown Manhattan. Massive investment in
       transit infrastructure (the Line 7 extension) and high-quality public space increased
       place and node value, fostering high market potential.

   The choice of case studies in this book underscores the potential of run-down,
underutilized areas as drivers for creating market potential value when increasing
connectivity (increasing node value) and putting in place sufficient investment in
urban fabric regeneration through a high-quality public realm. King’s Cross is a
former rail industrial site that was regenerated. Hudson Yards is being built above
a rail yards. Malmö and Hammarby (in Sweden) regenerated suburban docklands.
They demonstrate that high market potential can also be created in suburban ar-
eas if good linkage is established with the core city and the area is well planned
and designed. Malmö and Hammarby underline the importance of the quality of
urban design in creating value (chapter 4). Examples of urban redevelopment
along Crossrail also demonstrate the potential of fringe locations (chapter 7).

enhancing the public realm, and supporting inclusionary housing.2 The unlocking
of an increase in the potential value of underused assets (land and/or structures)
as a result of a public sector intervention (rezoning or provision of transit infrastruc-
ture) stimulates demand from the private sector. Subsequent investment and de-
velopment from the private sector ensure that potential asset value increase is real-
ized (Huxley 2009). Figure 3.1 illustrates this feedback loop.
   Value capture finance can be defined as “the appropriation of value generated
by public sector intervention and private sector investment in relation to an unde-
rused asset (land and/or structure) for local reinvestment to produce public good
and potential private benefit” (Huxley 2009). It can take the form of monetary or
in-kind contributions from the private to public actors. Local value recycling is the
reinvestment of monetary or in-kind contributions from the private sector within
the same development site or scheme. This reinvestment can pay for the initial
public intervention but tends to fund further interventions.
   Value capture finance increases the incentive for both public intervention and
private investment by creating a win-win situation. It divides the cost of urban
development between the public and private sectors, without the public sector
necessarily undertaking a large share of the initial investment. Figure 3.1 captures
the positive feedback loop of value capture.

           The 3V Framework identifies imbalances in local development and thus unde-
       rutilized assets (either because an increase in connectivity linked to public invest-
       ment in infrastructure calls for a redevelopment or because high place value calls
       for investment in connectivity to create a positive feedback loop for market
       growth). It allows public investment be fine-tuned to market response potential in
       order to initiate these positive value capture feedback loops.
           The case studies presented in later chapters illustrate the positive feedback loops
       created in New York and London by the coordinated actions of public and private
       sector. The different strategies initiating these positive feedback loops are discussed
       below, following both the 3V Framework and the framework proposed by Huxley.


       Value Creation
       Value creation strategies involve increasing node, place, and market potential
       value, with each one supporting the others. They are illustrated with a short sum-
       mary of the strategies used in King’s Cross and Hudson Yards, where potential
       asset values were created by public sector intervention that increased node and
       place value. Public investment in parks, mass transit, and infrastructure will help
       make these places the most livable areas of their cities.
          In both projects, transport infrastructure supports higher node value. Major in-
       vestments in local transport infrastructure (of £2.5 billion to date) turned King’s
       Cross/St Pancras into the most significant interchange for local, national, and inter-
       national travel in London. At Hudson Yards, investment in infrastructure includes
       extension of the No. 7 subway west and south from its old terminus at Times Square.
       A new station is being built at W. 34th Street and 11th Avenue. The $2.4 billion Line
       7 extension was funded with New York City funds from municipal tax increment fi-
       nancing (TIF) bond sales, which are expected to be repaid with property tax reve-
       nues from future developments in areas served by the extension (Fitzsimmons 2015).
          Higher place value was supported through environmental and social improve-
       ments and investments to enhance the urban quality and image of both sites. De-
       velopment of King’s Cross combined physical regeneration (developing sites, refur-
       bishing buildings) with community regeneration (providing skills, training, community
       facilities). At Hudson Yards, the public sector renovated the Javits Center ($465
       million). At both sites, much attention was given to high-quality public space and
       iconic architecture. Three major New York parks (the third section of the High Line,
       Hudson River Park, and Hudson Park & Boulevard) converge at Hudson Yards. They
       are supported by $630 million of public investment in public space and parks.
          Higher market potential value was supported by allowing population increases
       and land use changes, using planning and regulatory tools. Both King’s Cross and
       Hudson Yards are creating very dense mixed-use communities, with human densi-
       ties (or projected densities) of about 1,750 per hectare. Such transformation is
       fostered by rezoning at a higher FAR, with transparent mechanisms to purchase
       rights for additional FAR above the base FAR, and with margins of flexibility for
       adapting to market changes. This allows the public sector to capture part of this
       increase in value to finance needed investments (box 3.2).
          Enhanced destination branding and marketing enable new areas to emerge.

      BOX 3.2      Capturing Value in Midtown Manhattan through Flexible
                   Floor Area Ratios

                                       Value Realization
                                       Private sector investment, comprehensive master planning, and area promotion
                                       increase potential asset values. For example, growth on New York’s New West Side
                                       can be attributed to the success of the High Line, which spurred $2 billion of pri-
                                       vate investment, 12,000 new jobs, and 29 development projects since opening in
                                       June 2009. At both Hudson Yards and King’s Cross, developers came up with in-
                                       novative master plans that included high-quality public space and local connectiv-
                                       ity. Both projects involved dialogue between the public and private actors. Public
                                       participation was extensive in the King’s Cross development.


                                       Value Capture
                                       Higher asset values are captured for private profit and the public good. Private
                                       value capture is primarily via the rent or sale of new or enhanced housing, retail,
                                       or office units. The public sector uses a range of mechanisms to capture enhanced
                                       asset values realized by private actors. They include tax increment financing (TIF)
                                       and payment in lieu of taxes (PILOT) financing, both of which allow a municipality
                                       to sell bonds that are repaid with future tax revenues. Table 3.1 summarizes the
                                       main mechanisms of value capture.



TABLE 3.1 Key Features of Selected Land Value Capture Instruments
 Instrument                   Description

 Tax or fee based
 Property and land tax        Tax levied on estimated value of land or land and buildings combined. Revenues usually go
                              into budgets for general purposes.
 Betterment levies and        Surtaxes imposed by governments on estimated beneﬁts created by public investments, so as
 special assessments          to require property owners who beneﬁt directly from public investments to pay for their costs.
 Tax increment                Surtax on properties within an area that will be redeveloped by public investment to be
 ﬁnancing (TIF)               ﬁnanced by municipal bonds, against the expected increase in property tax, which is pledged.
                              Instrument mainly used in US.
 Exactions/impact fees        Fees (or in-kind contribution) collected from private developers to pay for the cost of
                              providing additional public infrastructure and services, and to accommodate additional
                              population generated by their new development projects.
 Development based
 Land sale or land lease      Mechanism in which governments sell developers land for payment or land use right, in return for
                              either an upfront leasehold charge or payments of annual land rent through the term of the lease.
 Air right sale               Mechanism in which governments sell development rights extended beyond the limits
                              speciﬁed in land use regulations (e.g., FAR) or created by regulatory changes to raise funds to
                              ﬁnance public infrastructure and services.
 Land readjustment            Mechanism in which landowners pool their land and contribute a portion of it sale to raise
                              funds to partially defray public infrastructure development costs.
 Urban redevelopment          Mechanism in which landowners, together with a developer, establish one cooperative entity
 ﬁnancing                     to consolidate piecemeal land parcels into a single site that they then develop (e.g., high-rise
                              building and/or mixed-use building) with new access roads and public open spaces. Local
                              government modiﬁes zoning codes and increases maximum ﬂoor area ratios in the targeted
                              redevelopment district (typically around rail transit stations). Used mainly in Japan.

Local Value Recycling
The captured value can be recycled, or reinvested, in the same development
through public or private sector–led reinvestment. In the case of public sector–led
reinvestment, increased public revenues captured from the private sector through
higher local taxation, fees, and levies pay for additional government interventions
within the same development area, reinforcing asset values and having positive
social-economic impacts. The public sector offers private actors an opportunity to
deliver community-oriented infrastructure directly, further increasing asset values
and positive social-economic impacts.
    As a result of these positive feedback loops, the area surrounding Hudson Yards
is growing at a rate five times that of Manhattan as a whole. A report released in
May 2016 (Related Companies and Oxford Property Group 2016) outlined the
economic impact of the Hudson Yards development on New York City’s economy.
It claims that once fully operational, the project will contribute nearly $19 billion a
year to New York City’s GDP (accounting for 2.5 percent of the city’s output), gen-
erating nearly $500 million in annual tax revenues.



The Real Estate Benefits of Transit-Oriented Development
TOD enhances place value and in turn increases market potential value and real
estate benefits. Cross-country evidence suggests that property prices are much
higher when densities and walkability scores around station areas are high. Renne
(2014) studied prices around 4,000 train stations in the United States. He finds that
the average home in a TOD area (with high densities and high walkability) was
worth about 3.5 times more than the average home in the United States and that
home prices in these areas rose by twice as much as national home prices between
1996 and 2013 (box 3.3). Characteristics of the urban fabric such as density, use,
and walkability thus determine the livability of a place, define its place value, and
have a strong impact on real estate prices.

Using Good Urban Design of the
Public Realm to Create High Place
Value



Good urban design creates place value that fosters urban economic growth. It
supports increased density and ensures that people do not find congestion and
density oppressive. It complements the planning approach presented in chapter
2. It includes significant streetscape improvements that make streets places for
people; creates a spirit of place; makes the city more legible; and provokes a feel-
ing of enclosure, human scale, coherence, image (see photo 4.1), and linkage.
    This chapter focuses on urban qualities that create place value. The first two
sections describe these qualities. The third section illustrates them with three case
studies of good urban design that contributed to significant increases in market
value.



Positive and Negative Space

Numerous perceptual qualities affect reactions to a place. They include the walk-
ing experience, the sense of safety, the sense of comfort, and the level of interest.
To achieve walkability, urban designers should achieve “spirit of place,” enclosure,    Opposite page:

       shape and direction. “An outdoor space is positive when it has a distinct and defi-
       nite shape, as definite as the shape of a room, and when its shape is as important
       as the shapes of the buildings that surround it” (Alexander, Ishikawa, and Silver-
       stein 1997). Positive space traditionally comprised not only streets, squares, and
       gardens but also the interiors of large buildings, such as courtyards of palaces and
       interiors of churches. There was no separation between street and buildings but
       rather a continuum of public space, the stage of urban life.

    Map 4.1 contrasts the positive public space in 18th century Rome with the
disconnected public space of Brasilia. The map of Rome, drawn by Giambattista
Nolli in 1748 (panel a), shows how the continuity and positivity of public space
creates the high place value of traditional European cities. It reveals no division
between interior and exterior spaces or between solid masses and empty spaces.
The black areas show the continuous public space of streets, squares, large
churches, and palace courtyards; the white areas show the compact mass of pri-
vate buildings. In the map of Brasilia (panel b), the continuous public space is re-
placed by formless empty space between buildings—a space divested of its posi-
tivity that becomes pure negativity, creating no place value.
    Streets and squares are the basic elements around which cities should be orga-
nized; for most people, they constitute the very essence of the phenomenon
“city.” In recent years, planners have made good use of streets (based on the linear
pattern of human movement) and squares (based on the eye’s ability to survey an
area) to improve urban design. In contemporary developments such as Canary
Wharf, King’s Cross, and the Beddington Zero Energy Development (in London);
Hudson Yards (in New York); and Hammarby Sjöstad and Malmö (in Sweden), the
positive qualities of the public space have contributed to place value.



Eight Urban Qualities that Create High Place Value

Cross-country evidence and the analysis of numerous positive public spaces, his-
torical and contemporary, suggest that positive space can be achieved when ur-
ban designers endow space with eight key urban design qualities.1

       Genius Loci (Spirit of Place)
       Genius loci (spirit of place) is the quality of a place that makes it distinct and rec-
       ognizable, a place one remembers. Image plays to the innate human ability to see
       and remember patterns. A memorable place is created when distinct elements are
       easily identifiable and grouped into an overall pattern (Lynch 1960).
           Landmarks are a component of spirit of place. What is essential is their singular-
       ity and location in relationship to the context and the city. Landmarks act as visual
       termination points, orientation points, and points of contrast in the urban setting
       (photo 4.2). They give identity and structure to the urban space around them.

   Spirit of place is related to sense of place. A visual theme contributes to a co-
hesive sense of place and inspires people to enter and rest there (Cullen 1961).
Iconic architecture and human-scale passages characterize the Beddington Zero
Energy Development, in London (photo 4.3) and the Queen Elizabeth II Great
Court, the largest covered square in Europe, at the center of the British Museum
(photo 4.4).


Enclosure
Enclosure refers to the degree to which buildings, walls, trees, and other vertical
elements define streets and other public spaces. These vertical elements interrupt
viewers’ lines of sight. A sense of enclosure results when lines of sight are so deci-
sively blocked as to make outdoor space seem room-like. Spaces where the height
of vertical elements is proportionately related to the width of the space between
them have a room-like quality.
    “Enclosure, or the outdoor room, is, perhaps, the most powerful, the most
obvious, of all the devices to instill a sense of position, of identity with the sur-
roundings.… It embodies the idea of here-ness” (Cullen 1961). In an urban setting,
enclosure is formed by lining the street or plaza with unbroken building fronts of
roughly equal height. The buildings become the “walls” of the outdoor room; the
street becomes the “floor”; and, if the buildings are roughly of equal height, the
sky becomes an invisible ceiling. The total width of the street (from building to
building) should not exceed the building heights, to maintain a feeling of enclo-
sure. Box 4.1 illustrates the impact of such enclosure on the quality of public space.
    Enclosure is eroded by breaks in the continuity of the street wall. Breaks filled
by nonactive uses (vacant lots, parking lots, driveways) and large building setbacks
create dead space. “Building setbacks from the street have actually helped greatly
to destroy the street as social space” (Alexander, Ishikawa, and Silverstein 1977).


Human Scale
Human scale refers to the size, texture, and articulation of physical elements that
match the size and proportions of people and correspond to the speed at which
people walk. For pedestrians the information field offered by public space should
be scaled to offer rich and coherent information at a pace of five kilometers per hour.
    Building details, the pavement texture, street trees, and street furniture all con-
tribute to human scale. Moderate-size buildings, narrow streets, and small spaces
create an intimate environment; large buildings, wide streets, and large open
spaces create the opposite effect.
    Distance plays an important role in personal interaction. At 300–500 meters,
people can identify other people as humans instead of objects. At 25–100 meters,
they can identify individual characteristics and body language. At less than 25
meters, richness of detail and communication intensify dramatically meter by me-
ter (Alexander, Ishikawa, and Silverstein 1977). These distances set the limits of
human scale and the perceived quality of the human space. Decisions at the large
scale (city and regional planning); the medium scale (site planning); and the small
scale (the immediate environment) are inseparably linked. This interrelationship is

                                         important because the small scale is where people meet and evaluate decisions
                                         made at all planning levels. Almost all of the most highly regarded public squares
                                         in Europe are less than 10,000 square meters; most are less than 8,000 square
                                         meters (box 4.1). The battle for quality in cities and building projects must be won
                                         at the very small scale.

Layering of Space
Layering of space refers to the degree to which people can see or perceive what
lies beyond the edge of a street or other public space. Physical elements that
influence layering of space include walls, windows, doors, fences, landscaping,
and openings into midblock spaces. The Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art
(photo 4.5), designed by Richard Meier, illustrates the concept of transparency
and layering by articulating two public squares and a complex composition of
historic and modern architecture, materials, and volumes, with a great sense of
space layering.
    Whether the public environment invites or repels people depends on its de-
gree of enclosure and transparency and the way in which the border zone is de-
signed. Flexible boundaries in the form of transitional zones function as connect-
ing links, making it easier physically and psychologically for people to move
between in and out. Contact through experience between what is taking place in
the public environment and what is taking place in the adjacent residences, shops,
offices and communal buildings provides an extension and enrichment of
possibilities.


Complexity
Complexity refers to the visual richness of a place. It depends on the variety of the
physical environment—the number and kinds of buildings, the landscape ele-
ments, the street furniture, and human activity.

                                         is exposed per unit of time. Narrow buildings in varying arrangements add to
                                         complexity; wide buildings subtract from it. People need many different surfaces
                                         over which light is constantly moving in order to keep their eyes engaged. Changes
                                         in the textures, widths, and heights of buildings, as well as building shape, articula-
                                         tion, and ornamentation, add to complexity.
                                             Complexity supports walking (photo 4.6). Pedestrians require a high level of
                                         complexity to hold their interest. An interesting walking network makes the walk-
                                         ing distance seem shorter by dividing the walk into manageable stages. Crucial to
                                         determining the acceptable distance in a given situation is not only the physical
                                         distance but also the experienced distance. People find a 500-meter along an
                                         uninteresting broad arterial very long and tiring; the same walk can be experi-
                                         enced as a very short distance if the route is perceived in stages (Ewing and Bar-
                                         tolomew 2013).
                                             Complexity is not only a physical attribute of the urban fabric.1 It is also a social
                                         process of human interactions that is self-reinforcing (Gehl 2008). When one per-
                                         son does something, others often participate or observe. Individuals and events
                                         thus influence and stimulate one another. Once this process begins, the total activ-
                                         ity is nearly always greater and more complex than the sum of the component
                                         activities.
                                             People and events are assembled in time and space so that individual activities
                                         get a chance to grow together to become larger, more meaningful, and inspiring
                                         sequences of events. Something happens because something happens. Larger,
                                         more complex community activities develop naturally from many small daily activi-
                                         ties (box 4.2).


                                         Coherence
                                         Coherence refers to a sense of visual order. The degree of coherence is influ-
                                         enced by consistency in the scale, character, and arrangement of buildings, land-
                                         scaping, street furniture, paving materials, and other physical elements (photo
                                         4.7). “Geometrical coherence is an identifiable quality that ties the city together
                                         through form and is an essential prerequisite for the vitality of the urban fabric”

       Legibility
       When faced with a new place, people automatically create a mental map that di-
       vides it into paths, edges, districts, nodes, and landmarks (Lynch 1960). Legibility
       refers to the ease with which people can create such a mental map so that the
       spatial structure of a place can be understood and navigated as a whole. Street or
       pedestrian networks that provide a sense of orientation and relative location and
       physical elements that serve as reference points improve legibility (photo 4.8).

Linkage
Linkage can be defined as features that promote the interconnectedness of
places and provide convenient access between them. It refers to physical and
visual connections—between buildings and the street, between buildings, be-
tween spaces, between one side of the street and the other—that unify disparate
elements. Linkage can occur longitudinally along a street or laterally across a
street. The fact that the possibilities for seeing other people and events is limited
to a distance of 25–100 meters places great demands on the degree of linkage
(Ewing and Bartolomew 2013). The High Line in New York, Marina Bay East Gar-
dens in Singapore, and the bridge to St Paul in London (photo 4.9) are example
of such linkages.


Example of Application of All Eight Design Elements
The proposed Green Triangle in Tianjin, a major port city in northeastern China,
illustrates how all eight design elements could be applied. The conceptual design
for the project was developed as part of a World Bank workshop in June 2014 to
illustrate the concepts presented in this chapter in a real case. At this stage, it is
not expected to be built.
    The Golden Triangle area is located in the center of Tianjin, where green space
is surrounded by a residential neighborhood to the north, mixed use to the east,
and a commercial center to the south. The area has planned stations for two metro
lines and a bus rapid transit line. It covers 1.6 hectares and allows for a maximum
FAR of 4.1 and a maximum plot ratio of 60 percent.
    The vision for the Golden Triangle it to combine new building space with green
space, to turn it into a “Green Triangle” (image 4.1). The area would be highly

permeable, with six openings in a medium-size block leading to an inner public
space where passengers can meet. A garden roof would link the different levels.
The garden roof and the inner green triangular square recreate the same amount
of green space as in the original site.
    The Tianjin Green Triangle’s unique combination of an elevated garden prome-
nade, a green amphitheater, and a green triangular plaza would offer the opportu-
nity to create a reference point at the entire city scale: an urban experience associat-
ing the space of movement (transit stations) and places for people (streets, green
roofs, the green amphitheater and enclosed plaza, the sharp triangular tower) as an
icon of green 21st century Tianjin. The project would avoid isolated buildings, arteri-
als, and other disconnected and inanimate objects, instead connecting people
through place-making and multiple experiences in a complex sequence of move-
ment within a structured place where people pursue a wide variety of activities.
    The project’s physical structure would support the social structure by linking
indoors and outdoors at various levels. It would offer flowing, gentle transitions
between various categories of public spaces. Its physical structure would reflect
and support the desired social structure, encouraging innovation and creativity
and contributing to creating high place value.
    The conceptual design of the Tianjin Green Triangle embodies the eight urban
design qualities for creating high place values:

1. Spirit of place: The triangular patterns of the project capture attention and cre-
   ate a lasting impression. The triangular landmark tower creates a strong image
   by its singularity and location in relationship to its context and to the city at
   large. It is a visual termination point, an orientation point, and a point of con-
   trast in the urban setting.
2. Enclosure: Buildings, walls, and streets define the “Green Agora.” The height
   of the vertical elements, which is proportionally related to the width of the
   space between them gives, the agora a room-like quality. The buildings be-
   come the “walls” of the outdoor triangular room, the plaza the “floor,” and the
   sky an invisible “ceiling.”
3. Human scale: The size, texture, and articulation of the Green Triangle’s physical
   elements match the size and proportion of people and correspond to the
   speed at which people walk. Moderate-size buildings and sequences of small
   spaces create an intimate environment. The Green Agora is within the 100-me-
   ter limit that allows people to see everything that happens.
4. Layering of space: Many entryways in the Green Agora contribute to the percep-
   tion of human activity beyond the street and foster interactions between indoors
   and outdoors. The Tianjin Green Triangle assembles people and functions in time
   and space. It integrates, invites, and opens up rather than close in activities.
5. Complexity: The project provides complex walks, split into sequences, at various
   levels along the edges of the Green Agora. Movement at the edge of a space
   makes it possible to simultaneously experience both the large space and the small
   details of the building facades or the spatial boundary along which one walks.
6. Coherence: The project displays a high level of formal and geometrical coher-
   ence, as the urban block is carved into smaller components following a set of
   consistent principles.

       7. Legibility: The project’s spatial structure provides a sense of orientation and
          relative location by physical elements that serve as reference points. The Green
          Triangle increases the clarity of the cityscape, the ease with which its parts can
          be recognized and organized into a coherent pattern.
       8. Linkage: Tianjin Green Triangle is intensely linked by roof bridges and a con-
          tinuous architectural promenade unfolding on several levels (see image 4.1,
          panel c). The block is divided into buildings separated by openings and united
          by the continuous elevated gardens and their bridges. These green connec-
          tions link people and events.



       Case Studies of Urban Design that Creates High Place
       Value

       This section examines three cases studies (two from Sweden and one from Singa-
       pore). All three cases used increases in connectivity and high-quality urban design
       to spur green development.


       High-Quality, Eco-Friendly Urban Design and Transit
       Connectivity in Hammarby Sjöstad, Sweden
       Hammarby Sjöstad, in Stockholm, implemented an integrated approach to district
       planning that incorporates sustainable resource use, ecological design, and low-
       carbon transport (photo 4.10). Its success can be attributed to strong environmen-
       tal goals that shaped the development plan, which covers land use, transportation,
       building materials, energy, water, and sewage.
           The 160-hectare district was built on a former industrial and harbor brownfield
       area located on the south side of Hammarby Lake, three kilometers south of the
       Stockholm city center. Its flexible grid of small blocks incorporates public green
       space and streets designed as places for people.
           Hammarby Sjöstad is an example of the conversion of a run-down industrial
       area into a modern, environmentally sustainable, mixed-use district with good
       public transit connections and high-quality urban design that embodies the eight
       urban qualities described in the previous section. Redevelopment of this industrial
       waterfront used the dynamics of place and node value increase to raise market
       potential value.
           Planning for the redevelopment of the site began in 1996. The goal was to
       build a sustainable community that is twice as energy and resource efficient as a
       typical one. The Hammarby model (figure 4.1) is a unique eco-cycle system that
       systematically seeks out opportunities to reuse energy, solid waste, water, and
       wastewater from homes, offices, and other structures in the area in an integrated
       manner. It is the district’s attempt at a balanced “closed-loop urban metabo-
       lism.” Urban metabolism is a model to facilitate the description and analysis of
       the flows of materials and energy within cities. It provides researchers with a
       framework to study the interactions of natural and human systems in specific
       regions. In a circular metabolism, there is nearly no waste and almost everything
       is reused. (Wachsmuth 2012).

          Urban-scale density, access to multiple modes of transit, an emphasis on re-
       duced car commuting; preservation and restoration of existing natural systems,
       and progressive construction and housing policies make Hammarby Sjöstad an
       effective demonstration of integrated planning. Through the city’s forethought in
       land acquisition, the planning department was able to efficiently coordinate trans-
       portation, land use, and development.

       Integrated transportation and land use
       Hammarby Sjöstad had three transportation goals:

       • Eighty percent of residents’ and workers’ journeys would be made by public
         transit, bike, or foot.
       • At least 15 percent of households would have car-sharing memberships, and at
         least 5 percent of workplaces would have car-sharing memberships.
       • One hundred percent of heavy transportation by vehicles would meet environ-
         mental zone requirements (Fränne 2007).

           The district’s planner recognized the importance of integrating transportation
       and land use planning. Expansion of the district was therefore complemented by
       transport investments, including increased bus service, cycle paths, pedestrian
       bridges, ferry service, and extension of the tram line.
           Hammarby Sjöstad was designed to integrate transportation, amenities, and
       public spaces. The spine of the district is a 37.5-meter wide boulevard and transit
       corridor that connects key transport nodes and public focal points and creates a
       natural focus for activity and commerce (Foletta 2011). Hammarby Sjöstad’s tram-
       line was built as the main commuting traffic mode to the southern part of Stock-
       holm. Underground parking and low parking ratios mean that cars do not domi-
       nate the urban landscape.

       The planning process
       The first step in planning was the development of the strategic master plan, led by
       architect Jan Inghe-Hagström, at the Stockholm City Planning Bureau. The plan is
       divided into 12 sub-neighborhoods, which are being developed in phases. A pro-
       cess called “parallel sketches” is used in which the city selects three to four private
       sector architects/planners to draw up detailed proposals for a sub-neighborhood.
       The city evaluates each of the sketches and combines the best features to create
       a master plan. The city planning and design team then prepares a design code for
       each sub-neighborhood in partnership with the developers and architects. This
       design code is included in the development agreement between the developer
       and the city. The design code is taken through the local authority political process
       in order to grant planning permission; the code provides an overview of the layout,
       form, and structure of each block, including key landmark buildings, public spaces,
       and pedestrian routes.
           To provide architectural diversity, and inspire higher standards of design
       through competition, a consortium of developers and architects is then invited
       to develop each plot or individual building within the sub-neighborhood, ac-
       cording to the design code. More than 60 developers and 30 architects were

involved in the planning process (Foletta 2011). This participatory process helped
the project achieve a high level of diversity and complexity within a coherent
master plan.

Application of the eight design principles
Spirit of place has been created in Hammarby Sjöstad by the subtle use of Stock-
holm urban morphology, sizing, and scaling. The variety of urban tissues in Stock-
holm helped guide the urban design. Although Hammarby Sjöstad is located out-
side Stockholm’s center, the design is intentionally urban rather than suburban and
follows the urban fabric typology of Stockholm’s center city (image 4.2), with 4
types of landscape and 5 types of public waterfront, 12 different types of urban
tissue and as many street profiles (Assche and Meeus 2000). The traditional city
structure of Stockholm has been combined with a new architectural style that re-
sponds to Hammarby Sjöstad’s waterside context, promotes the best of contem-
porary sustainability technology, and follows modern principles of maximizing light
and views of the water and green spaces.
    Enclosure of a variety of inner spaces is subtly combined with openness and
linkage by multiple water and pedestrian connections. The facades form a con-
cave, complex, and irregular enclosure of pedestrian areas, giving a sense of
rhythm, diversity, and variety to the pedestrian experience. Bridge curves give
rhythm to the pedestrian journey.

           Human scale is created by an urban morphology (form and structure) using
       urban block patterns and sizing of the center city. The district was planned with a
       dense settlement structure, with four- to five-story buildings in a compact neigh-
       borhood complemented by spacious green courtyards. The design follows stan-
       dards for Stockholm’s center city in terms of street width (18 meters), block size (70
       x 100 meters), density, and land use. City street dimensions, block sizes, building
       heights, and density mix are integrated with openness, waterfront views, parks,
       and sunlight. This design allows for both wind-shielded and sunny inner court-
       yards, with ample possibilities and incentives to develop inviting entrance and
       common courtyard greens and facilitate small-scale cultivation in micro-garden
       plots and small greenhouses.
           Layering of space is ensured by limited building depths, recessed penthouse
       flats, large balconies and terraces, and large windows on water-facing facades.
       Most balconies overlook streets, waterfront walkways, and open spaces. Many
       apartments also have a semi-open block form, providing open access to the court-
       yards of the residential blocks.
           Complexity, coherence, and legibility are created by the planning process. A
       master plan resulted from the combination of multiple sub-neighborhood plans;
       implementation fostered diverse designs respecting the design code.
           Among the key organizing principles is the variety in the scales of development.
       The scale of development varies from four- to five-story buildings along the Sickla
       Canal and six- to eight-story buildings along the main corridors. Taller buildings
       facing the water are built in a classic urban style that complements the large-scale
       facilities and large open water areas. Large-scale, multifunctional buildings have
       been built along the avenue, with small-scale backstreet and courtyard houses
       built between the dock and the park walkway. The environment along the canals
       is more intimate and small-scale, with development gradually downscaled toward
       the shorelines (photo 4.10).
           Linkage is ensured in multiple ways. The water environment adds significant
       links in the neighborhood. Major non-road-based links create huge areas of open-
       ness linked to building spacing and height. A network of connected parks, green
       spaces, and walkways runs through the district to provide a counterbalance to the
       dense urban landscape. Two wide bridges over a busy road have been covered
       with vegetation. The bridges provide both a link and a shortcut to the nature re-
       serve just outside the city.

       Enhancement of the social life of the community
       Mixed-use development creates a complete and balanced community. The
       200-hectare district is home to about 20,000 people (9,000 housing units) and
       10,000 jobs (200,000 square meters of commercial space). It offers a wide range
       of educational, cultural, and recreational programs. It balances both private and
       public space and ensures that priority is placed on what benefits the community.
       High-density living promotes a greater sense of community by facilitating the de-
       velopment of programs and processes that promote social interaction and cultural
       enrichment. Family living is key to Hammarby’s success, with good-quality housing
       and community facilities for families, including schools, community center, and
       churches.

The development process and market potential value
The city of Stockholm joined forces with 25 construction companies to build the
district, with the district contributing 80 percent of local cost. Other funding came
from two government agencies, the Swedish Rail Administration (rail transport)
and the Swedish Road Administration (routing of the Southern Link ring road).
    Several key features ensured an efficient development process, with a good
balance between planning and market forces (Lee n.d.). The entire site is owned
by a single owner. As a result, the plan could be implemented in an orderly fashion.
It was based on a master plan reflecting a long-term vision. Major public funding
of infrastructure was key, with power, water, and recycling facilities all put in place
early. Each development zone was put out to developers and architects, who came
up with solutions. Within the confines of the master plan, different developers
delivered each zone, creating diversity. Requiring developers to pay for each site
on a per-square-meter-of-development basis sharpened the focus on design and
quality. The master plan envisaged a mix of nonresidential uses but did not impose
constraints. Ground floor areas in certain key frontage zones had to be active (in-
cluding shops, for example), but were flexible for the end-user. The market eventu-
ally determined what worked.
    Hammarby Sjöstad is now a middle-class suburb with strong housing values
(which increased by four to five times since the first parts were built). It also in-
cludes affordable housing, public rental, private rental, and privately owned
properties.

Lessons learned
A holistic approach to planning, grounded in increased connectivity, high-quality
design, and strong environmental goals can help shape new developments and
create market potential in run-down industrial areas. These principles should be
adopted as early as possible, so that they can be integrated into every part of the
infrastructure early in the planning process. Achieving both coherence and a high
level of complexity and diversity in the neighborhood requires a participatory pro-
cess that includes all stakeholders and a discussion of possible options and their
potential results within the planned district.


Transit-Oriented Development and Green Growth in
Malmö, Sweden
Like Hammarby, the Bo01 district of Malmö was built on a former industrial estate
and port, where the ground was polluted (map 4.2). This 18-hectare development
represents the first step in the process of transforming the 160 hectares of indus-
trial estate and port of Västra Hamnen, one of Malmö growth areas. Density is 122
people per hectare, but more than half of the development area is dedicated to
open space, making Bo01 an example of an urban settlement that does not dimin-
ish quality of life for the sake of density.
    Bo01, the first area of the Western Harbor being constructed (inaugurated in
2001 for the housing exhibition Bo01), combines transit-oriented development
(TOD) features with green growth. Comprehensive planning for energy, water,
and waste systems resulted in significant improvements, especially in energy

                                          management.
                                             Bo01 inhabitants are encouraged to use environmentally friendly modes of
                                          transport. The area is car free. It is well served by paths dedicated to pedestrian
                                          and bicycle use. A little more than eight kilometers of bicycle paths extend from
                                          Bo01 through the Western Harbor. All residents of Bo01 are within 450 meters of
                                          a bus stop, and buses operate every seven minutes (City of Malmö 2006).
                                             Malmö has more than 460 kilometers of bicycle paths. Forty percent of trips to
                                          school or work are made by bicycle, and 30 percent of all trips are by bicycle
                                          (Reepalu 2013).

                                          Application of the eight design principles
                                          Outstanding urban design qualities have been achieved through an innovative
                                          participatory planning process in which the city exerted control through owner-
                                          ship, goal formulation, and planning while involving stakeholders. The city hired
                                          Klas Tham, a well-known architect and planner, to craft the design and planning
                                          basis for Bo01 and serve as its main designer and director. Tham balanced the
                                          technological goals of the project with an overarching concern for the social envi-
                                          ronment and for elevating the aesthetic quality of the development (Austin 2013).
                                          According to Tham:
                                             The plan has also been shaped by our ambitions: to offer an urban structure
                                          that is sufficiently robust, to meet the demands of an uncertain future (the network
Using Good Urban Design of the Public Realm to Create High Place Value                   O 99



structure of block city and clear borders between the public and private spaces),
to provide the conditions for the essence of the city, the meeting between differ-
ent people and cultures, to come about gradually (the small-scale property divi-
sion of the plan, its range of different residential environments), to let cars get
through, but on the terms of the pedestrians, to provide the conditions of a city
environment which, over and above empathy and comprehensibility, also offer a
wealth of information, mystery, surprises, and many unique and promising urban
spaces; a dramatic tension between the grand and the intimate, to offer a wealth
of all forms of vegetation, from the individual garden, to the sheltered, thickly
wooded public canal park through the interior of the area. That is how the plan
took shape. The grid has been distorted by the wind, among other things, like a
fishnet hung out to dry. And, as a result, it has actually become more rational, more
valuable to build, live and stroll around in. (McCollum n.d.)
     Innovative planning methods that emphasized the collaboration of govern-
ment, designers, and developers were created through “creative dialogues” to
produce consensus on what could be accomplished under a time constraint. The
result was the Quality Program (1999), a simple document outlining the minimum
standards for architecture, landscaping, energy, water, waste management, and
biodiversity. It included an emphasis on green space, which reinforces the master
plan and resulted in diverse and effective landscapes (City of Malmö 2002). Dia-
logue fostered an atmosphere of collaboration and innovation. The 20 developers
selected for the project committed to material, technological, environmental, and
architectural quality measures before any parcel was sold. Although time-consum-
ing, the process resulted in rapid approval of the plans developers submitted to
the city (Austin 2013).
     Spirit of place is created in Bo01 by the “sensory, emotional and mental nonquan-
tifiable human aspects of design” and by “highlighting the genius loci—the unique
identity and quality of the place—the sky, the sea, the wind, the ground—and its
imageability,” according to the Quality Program (1999). According to Klas Tham:
     The plan has been sculpted by the grandeur of the site (the ocean, the expanse
of sky, the horizon, the sunset), by very strong exposure to the wind from the west,
and by the broad-meshed grid of boulevards in the district. This ensures orderli-
ness and empathy on a grand scale and at the same time, gives space to discover
a teeming, less tangible world on the inside of the large squares. (McCollum n.d.)
     Water is included in park axes and as stylized streams of storm water in squares,
piazzas, streets, and lanes. It creates natural limits and structures people’s move-
ment. Bridges, canals, and courtyards organize journeys with views of water. The
Turning Torso Tower (see photo 4.1) acts as a landmark, creating place identity.
     Enclosure of a variety of semipublic courtyards and small squares—linked by
green spaces, including parks and streets—provides vitality, light, room to travel,
and room to rest.
     Human scale and the interaction of man with the environment are fundamental
factors in the Quality Program (1999):
     It is human beings and their needs that provide the starting point for all design
and all planning and never, for example, the needs of motor traffic or technol-
ogy.… A district needs values which cannot be measured in the traditional manner:
visual and acoustic impressions, the experience of greenery and water, street
100 O                                                                  Transforming the Urban Space



        spaces with “human” proportions, and the subconscious understanding, interpre-
        tation and experience of one’s surroundings in a way which interacts positively with
        our biological origins, even in the distinctively manmade environment of the city.
            Slightly more than half of the area is open space; many social spaces were de-
        signed within a diverse landscape to create a broad range of experiences for
        people. Access to green areas and water, the use of daylight, and various visual
        impressions create a sense of well-being (photo 4.11).
            Layering of space is ensured by intermediary transparent components that are open
        to the outside, such as porches and balconies, to ensure transitions between public and
        private areas. Public space is not designed as a homogenous entity in opposition to
        private space but as a series of intermediary semiprivate and semipublic levels.
            Complexity is defined in the Quality Program (1999) as the “wealth of informa-
        tion, mystery, surprise, possibilities of getting lost and making accidental discover-
        ies.” It is created by irregular streets and their rich set of interconnections, visual
        variety, diversity in patterns, open spaces, and buildings.
            The Bo01 plan develops a rhythm of moving and stopping. It is made for the
        slower pace of pedestrians and cyclists. Variations in the grid shield inner areas
        from the weather that buffets the district. Unpredictable building orientation and
        placement create a dynamic character, full of surprising spaces and views within a
        pedestrian environment.
            Diversity characterizes the area. Twenty-six architectural firms designed the
        houses, each firm given wide freedom of expression. Twenty developers built

houses and apartments of different sizes and types of ownership. Bo01 created a
community with the variety, detail, and diversity that elude master-planned com-
munities with fewer participating architects, landscape architects, and developers.
    The project also reveals diversity and variety in the design of its parks. The
Scania Portal (Scaniatorget) includes etched pathways that allow storm water to
reach the sea with an austerity and restraint reminiscent of Zen gardens. In contrast
to typical seaside parks, with their hardened, protective edges, Anchor Park offers
more detail and an introverted character than the dramatic views and scale of the
western landscapes (Dania Park, Scania Portal, the Promenade, and Scania Park).
    Coherence within this high level of diversity is ensured by a strong overarching
order in the detailed development plan with “distinct territories, clear boundaries
between what is to be perceived as, respectively, public and private, between
semiprivate and private, between private and private” (Bo01, the City of Malmö,
and Developers’ Representatives 1999). The architectural design is integrated with
and supportive of the structure of public spaces. The design of the facades over-
looking quays, parks, and main streets proclaims the buildings as the walls of very
important urban spaces. The tall houses on the block perimeter form a wind shel-
ter around a small-scale and green interior.
    Legibility in Bo01 is defined as “strong, intrinsic identity of the part and the
whole—the home, the block, the street, the square, the park, the neighborhood;
intelligibility of structure, form and function, facilitating participation by the local
residents” (Bo01, the City of Malmö, and Developers’ Representatives 1999). Ur-
ban edges ensure this intelligibility (photo 4.12). The neighborhood has a clearly
defined limit, with the sea forming a natural border.
    Linkage was developed at many scales. It is both formal and informal and
includes a mix of streets, pedestrian walks, alleyways, squares, and water banks.
As stated in the Quality Program (1999), the plan “provides many different
opportunities for approaching and exploring the district. A network of axes
moving through different, carefully balanced public spaces will provide oppor-

        tunities for many different choices of direction and experiences.” A central axis
        extends from the city castle toward the sea. This tree-lined avenue is the sym-
        bolic main entrance to the Western Docks; it creates visual contact between the
        castle and the sea. At right angles to this axis, a canal and street access link the
        docks in the Wihlborg area with new housing on the Bo01 site. The cross
        formed links and articulates four city quadrants with different characteristics
        and content.
            Another layer of linkage is the variety of informal pathways where people can
        stroll and bicycle. They complement the neighborhood street pattern with a rich
        network of pedestrian connections. The use of these varying interior open spaces
        facilitates many social interactions and is of great importance in creating a charac-
        ter for the area as a whole.

        Lessons learned
        The holistic definition of sustainability by the visionary planner resulted in aesthet-
        ics and social opportunities that match the high levels of technical performance.
        The project supports physical and psychological health by providing immediate
        access to open space, walkable neighborhoods, and opportunities for social inter-
        action. The urban environment offers natural meeting points and a well-balanced
        mix of housing activities, schools, and green areas, creating a vibrant community
        fulfilling the needs for beauty, proportion, nature, water, and safety.


        The Positive Feedback Loop of High Node, Place, and
        Market Values in Marina Bay, Singapore
        Singapore’s desire to become a financial hub economy meant that it needed to
        build new, high-quality commercial space.2 Urban regeneration and “breathing
        space” was needed in the central business district (CBRE 2012).

    Marina Bay became the new growth area (photo 4.13). The 360-hectare area
was reclaimed during the 1970s and 1980s, in anticipation of the growth of the city
center. Full development of this area is expected to more than double Singapore’s
office size, to 4.8 million square meters.

High node value
Marina Bay is planned as a vibrant, mixed-use district with round-the-clock activi-
ties based on sustainable development strategies. By 2018 the area will be served
by four mass transit lines and nine metro stations; all locations in Marina Bay will
eventually be within a five-minute walk of a public transit node. Singapore’s Urban
Redevelopment Agency projects that the intricate network of mass transit lines,
cycling paths, and pedestrian walkways serving the district will make the need for
car redundant in this part of the city. It is the first district in Singapore to be
planned upfront with a network of dedicated cycling lanes. A comprehensive
pedestrian network, including shady sidewalks, covered walkways, and under-
ground and second-story links, will ensure all-weather protection and seamless
connectivity between developments and transit stations. Water taxis will also
operate.

High place value
To provide good connectivity and seamless extension, the development parcels
were planned based on an urban grid pattern with floor area ratios of 8–25 that
extends from the existing street network within the central business district. This
grid creates a flexible framework with a series of land parcels that can be combined
or subdivided to meet new requirements or changing demands and allow the
phasing in of development.
    The vision for Marina Bay is “a garden city by the bay.” It is Singapore’s first
location to host water activities and serve as a focal point for major events. To-
gether with the waterfront promenade and its loop of attractions and vibrant pub-
lic spaces, Gardens by the Bay is playing a key role in defining the character of
Marina Bay, with its leafy streetscape, lush park, and sky-rise gardens.
    Gardens by the Bay is a nature park spanning 101 hectares of reclaimed land
adjacent to the marina reservoir. The park consists of three waterfront gardens, the
largest of which is 54 hectares. It is part of a strategy to transform Singapore from
a “garden city” to a “city in a garden.” The aim is to raise the quality of life by
enhancing greenery and flora in the city. Gardens by the Bay includes “super-
trees”—tree-like structures 25–50 meters high. These vertical gardens perform
various functions, providing shade, venting hot air, and circulating cool water
(photo 4.14)

High market potential value
Public sector investment has been key to the development of Marina Bay. This
investment has been recouped by returns from the private sector. The Urban
Redevelopment Agency has received more than $4.5 billion from the sale of
land parcels (excluding proceeds from One Marina Boulevard and the M+S
Marina One development site), according to estimates by CBRE (2012). Public
sector investments in infrastructure have attracted local developers as well as
104 O                                                                    Transforming the Urban Space

        developers from Australia; Hong Kong SAR, China; Malaysia; and the United
        States. U.K. firms reportedly occupy 29 percent of the development’s space,
        with 19 percent occupied by U.S. firms and 18 percent by Singaporean firms.
        Most occupants are from multinational companies headquartered in Europe (51
        percent), Asia (22 percent), and North America (20 percent). Occupants include
        law, information technology, commodities, energy, and insurance firms as well
        as financial service firms.
            Flexibility is an advantage for developers and corporate occupants. Develop-
        ment sites that are zoned white are granted high development flexibility. Develop-
        ers in these zones have the autonomy to develop property for a variety of uses and
        to respond to changing market needs.
            With a prime waterfront location, high-end specifications, and larger floor
        plates (the amount of rentable floor space on one floor), buildings in Marina Bay
        have contributed to an increase in the average market rent. Of the six office towers
        totaling 510,000 square meters completed between 2006 and 2012, the average
        pre-let commitment level upon completion was 82 percent; four of the six towers
        were essentially 100 percent pre-let upon completion (CBRE 2012). In 2012 more
        than $18 billion was invested in the development. Marina Bay looks to be one of
        the most lucrative investments ever in Singapore, according to CBRE.

        Lessons learned
        The success of the new development is based on a positive feedback loop of high
        node value, high place value (created by the futuristic landscaping of Gardens by
Using Good Urban Design of the Public Realm to Create High Place Value                        O 105



the Bay), and high market potential value. The project is a public-private partner-
ship in which the state makes infrastructure investments and releases development
sites to the private sector. Urban designs and planning objectives are articulated
and achieved through conditions imposed on these sites. The fact that the Urban
Redevelopment Authority is both the master planner and the place manager en-
sures that a central governing body is able to coordinate the infrastructural devel-
opments from concept to operation (CBRE 2012).

Realizing Market Potential Values
through High Place Value and
Improved Accessibility: Hudson
Yards in New York City


This case study describes the redevelopment of Hudson Yards, part of a compre-
hensive strategy to develop Manhattan’s West Side (image 5.1) and to maintain a
high level of agglomeration economy in Midtown Manhattan.1 It analyzes the proj-
ect using the 3V Framework, examining its node, place, and market potential
values and describing the approach taken to capture some of the resulting in-
creases in value.
   A report released by Related Companies and the Oxford Properties Group (the
project’s developers) outlines the substantial economic impacts of the 11.3-hect-
are Hudson Yards development on New York City’s economy (Appleseed 2016).2
The development will help modernize New York’s commercial office space, im-
prove its global competitiveness, create jobs, and make major contributions to
New York’s GDP and city taxes (box 5.1).



The Need for More Office Space in New York City

During the 1990s, New York City’s economy soared. Projections made in 2001 in-
dicated that the city could add nearly 600,000 jobs by 2020—but that it would
need more office space to do so. The projections indicated that these jobs would
increasingly come from companies in the “ideas economy,” where value is created
by “thinking things rather than moving things” (Group of 35 2001).
   To accommodate the growth in the office sector, the city estimated that it would
need about 6 million square meters of new office space by 2020. Without this new

        space, New York stood to lose thousands of jobs and the economic activity they
        would generate. The shift of such jobs to New Jersey and Long Island would have
        implications for New York and the region, with a reduction in agglomeration econ-
        omies that could be generated in highly concentrated jobs areas in Manhattan.

        The effects—including the loss of jobs and competitiveness; a reduction in tax
        revenues generated by Manhattan office space, a major contributor to New York’s
        operating budget; and the environmental costs associated with changes in the
        patterns of commuting, with an increase in the car share—were highly
        undesirable.
            Office floor area ratios (FARs) in New York are highly variable, with values rang-
        ing from less than 0.25 to more than 30 (map 5.1). About 60 percent of New York’s
        office space is concentrated on 1 percent of the city’s land area (9 square kilome-
        ters, out of a total of 780). The concentration of residents is lower than the concen-
        tration of jobs (map 5.2). Mathematically, the distribution of office FAR values
        across the urban space follows an inverse power law, with a very steep gradient of
        –1.7 (see appendix A).
            Midtown and Downtown are New York’s economic engines. The Midtown office
        market comprises 27.4 million square meters (44 percent of all office space in New
        York City). Combined with Downtown, this market totals 36 million square meters
        (59 percent of the total of New York City’s office inventory).
            The central business district (CBD) in Manhattan offered opportunities for new
        office space through rezoning, but there was not enough space to meet projected
        demand. Potential development sites are insufficient to meet future demand of 4.2
        million square meters in Midtown by 2025.
            To meet those needs, the Group of 35 (a group organized by a U.S. Senator and
        including major developers, landowners, and business officials) called for the cre-

ation of three new and expanded CBDs: the Far West Side of Manhattan, Down-
town Brooklyn, and Long Island City. An extended IRT Flushing Line would serve
the new CBD on Manhattan’s Far West Side, connecting the area to the Port Au-
thority Bus Terminal, Times Square, and Grand Central Terminal. Development in
the area was planned to provide at least 2 million square meters of office space.
    For each location, the core strategy was to create an “urban business campus”
as a catalyst for development. As private sector efforts alone were considered in-
sufficient to produce the urban space needed for new economic growth, the strat-
egy for each new CBD included the initiation of an urban business campus by the
public sector. This strategy aimed at avoiding the initial reluctance of the private
sector to consider locating in a new CBD because of the dearth of ready-to-go
development sites, amenities, and business support services.
    To jump-start the development process, the public sector (the City of New York
and the State of New York) planned three urban business campuses, one for each
new CBD. They included the following elements: 300,000–500,000 square meters
of state-of-the-art office facilities; a park-like setting, with open spaces and pedes-
trian-friendly streetscapes; and amenities such as retail and dining establishments,
business services, hotels, and entertainment venues and access to local cultural
and academic resources.
    The City and the State partnered to accomplish a number of tasks. They identi-
fied several blocks in the new CBD where the campuses should be located. They
then assembled development sites by condemnation (appropriating property for
public use), making financial contributions when necessary. They designated loca-
tions with the appropriate high-density commercial use zoning. They then solicited
developers to build 300,000–500,000 square meters of new office space. Finally,
they aggressively marketed projects and offered financial incentives to attract
businesses to new developments.

                                     Urban business campuses such as the one planned for Hudson Yards are expected
                                 to create a sense of place in the CBD and serve as a catalyst for ongoing private sec-
                                 tor development efforts that will follow in adjacent areas. Some of the public sector
                                 investments will be recouped when sites are sold to private developers.



                                 The Selection of Highly Accessible Sites for New
                                 Development

                                 Over the centuries, New York has been able to make major public investments that
                                 trigger private market response. The grid plan of 1811 laid out the future of develop-
                                 ment for island of Manhattan at a time when few people thought development would
                                 expand north of Houston Street. Part of the success of New York is based on its ability
                                 to make strategic public investments that yield high returns long into the future.
                                     The three areas identified by the Group of 35 Report as the future new CBDs of
                                 New York—the Far West Side, Downtown Brooklyn, and Long Island City—illustrate
                                 the strong connection between how accessible places are and how densely popu-
                                 lated, used, and built up they are (box 5.1).3 They benefit or will benefit from high
                                 accessibility in 30 minutes by transit by New York City residents. Some 2.8 million
                                 jobs are accessible in less than a 30-minute public transit ride from Brooklyn Heights.
                                 The Far West Side will be better connected to Midtown Manhattan by extending the
                                 No. 7 Subway to reach the same levels of accessibility as the other locations.




    BOX 5.2    Concentration of Transit Accessibility in New York City

    Transit accessibility in New York City is highly con-   commute (excluding walking time), and more than
    centrated in speciﬁc areas, creating a highly efﬁ-      75 percent of commuters use transit; more than 1
    cient urban form for agglomeration economies. In        million workers are accessible within a 30-minute
    a 780-square-kilometer city with 8.5 million people,    transit commute to an employer. The highest con-
    4 million jobs are located less than half a mile from   centration of accessibility is in Midtown, which is
    a mass transit station. The high concentration of       undergoing rezoning at higher density: 3.3 million
    jobs in Manhattan and the dense provision of sub-       jobs are accessible in less than a 30-minute tran-
    way infrastructure in New York City have created        sit commute, and 1.6 million workers are accessible
    a highly efficient urban form with an integrated        within a 30-minute transit commute on average. In
    labor market: 1.35 million jobs are accessible within   comparison, in Chicago (a city of 2.7 million peo-

       In Manhattan an average 2.6 million jobs are         and less than 12 percent of commuters use transit
    accessible in less than a 30-minute public transit      (Center for Transit Oriented Development n.d.).

ideal location for creating a new CBD. As the Hudson Yards Master Plan Preferred
Direction notes:
   The planning for Hudson Yards anticipates a multi-decade-long time horizon for
the redevelopment of the Hudson Yards (photos 5.2 and 5.3). This area is one of
the great opportunities to secure the City’s economic future in the global market
place. It is anticipated that through decisive public sector actions, such as the ex-
pansion of mass transit, creation of character-defining open space, and reinvention
of the area’s zoning, these actions would spur the private investment that will
sustain the livelihood of future generations of New Yorkers.
   The Hudson Yards Redevelopment Project is a joint venture by New York City and
New York State run by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to encourage
development on Manhattan’s Far West Side along the Hudson River. The project in-

        cludes rezoning of the Far West Side into a new high-density mixed-use neighbor-
        hood; extension of the No. 7 Subway; creation of new open space; and renovation
        of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. The centerpiece of the project is the de-
        velopment of a 11.3-hectare mixed-use real estate development by Related Compa-
        nies and Oxford Properties over the John D. Cammermayer railyards (where the
        commuter trains that serve Long Island stay when they are not in service), split into
        Eastern and Western Yards. The original design of the yards foresaw the construction
        of a deck on top of them when market demand warrants it.
            To complete the 28-acre Hudson Yards development, two platforms must be
        constructed to bridge 30 active Long Island Rail Road train tracks. Two subsurface
        rail tunnels will be used by Amtrak and New Jersey Transit. A tunnel box was con-
        structed on the Manhattan side of the river to preserve the possibility of constructing
        a future trans-Hudson under river crossing. The foundations of the finished buildings
        extend through and rise above the platform. The platforms will cover approximately
        three-quarters of Eastern and Western Yards. Throughout construction, the Long
        Island Rail Road, Amtrak, and New Jersey Transit trains will remain operational.
            The Eastern and Western Railyards will be a neighborhood with 1.6 million
        square meters of floor space. Half of the developed area will be open space. It is
        the largest private real estate development in the history of the United States and
        the largest development in New York City since Rockefeller Center was built, in
        1939. It is expected that additional public investment in parks, mass transit, and
        infrastructure will turn it into one of the most livable areas of the city.
            There is a precedent to the Hudson Yards project: Park Avenue. Responding to
        public outrage at the pollution and filth of the New York Central Railroad railyards
        in mid-Manhattan, in 1903 the state legislature passed a law requiring the railroad
        to “cover its tracks.” In response, the railroad built a deck over the newly electrified
        tracks from Madison Avenue to Lexington Avenue, between E. 42nd and E. 56th
        streets. Down the middle of the deck a grand boulevard was built. It was crowned
        with a magnificent new train station, Grand Central Terminal. Over the next three
        decades, new hotels, office buildings, and apartments sprang up along Park Av-
        enue, forming the core of what would become the world’s greatest central busi-
        ness district. One hundred years later, the trains still run under Park Avenue, and
        160,000 people earn their living in the blocks over the tracks (NYC Planning n.d).


        Increasing Node Value
        Public transit networks—their structure and how they connect people to people—
        completely change how people perceive distance and how businesses and jobs are
        located. Strategically located between 10th and 12th Avenues between W. 30th
        and W. 34th Streets, Hudson Yards is near the center of the metropolitan region.
            The center of the metropolitan region offers connections to commuter rail ser-
        vice, the subway system, the West Side Highway, the Lincoln Tunnel, and ferries
        along the Hudson River. Penn Station, located nearby, is the busiest transportation
        facility in the United States, handling more than 600,000 New Jersey Transit, Long
        Island Railroad, and Amtrak passengers daily in 2015. The Port Authority Bus Ter-
        minal is the busiest such terminal in the United States, serving 200,000 passengers
        a day with 7,200 buses in 2015. Buses link the area to the region’s three major

airports. Commuters from parts of New York and New Jersey can reach the Far
West Side via ferry, with expansion plans allowing for trans-Hudson service for up
to 60,000 passenger trips a day. Vehicular travelers can reach the Far West side via
the Lincoln Tunnel (map 5.4).
   Despite its location, Hudson Yards lacked direct mass transit connectivity west
of Eighth Avenue. The development strategy entails critical infrastructure improve-

        ments to address this issue. These improvements include extending the No. 7
        Subway to connect to the Port Authority Bus Terminal, and Grand Central Station;
        bringing Metro-North to Penn Station; mitigating traffic around the Lincoln Tunnel;
        and building a platform above the railyards for real estate development and pe-
        destrian flows. The No. 7 Subway Extension west and south of its current terminus
        at Times Square, a $2.4 billion investment, added a new station at W. 34th Street
        and 11th Avenue (image 5.2).


        Increasing Place Value
        Numerous amenities near Hudson Yards—including Madison Square Garden, the
        Javits Center, and the Broadway theater district—already attract millions of visi-
        tors. The strategy for the development builds on these amenities, as well as the
        proximity of three parks.

        Three dynamic parks and the High Line effect
        Creating place value in Hudson Yards is based primarily on the design of public
        space. Half of the site is set aside for public open space (image 5.3).
            The site connects directly with the High Line, an elevated park that quickly be-
        came the second most visited tourist attraction in New York, a dynamo for high-end
        real estate development, and an iconic architectural project (photo 5.4 and images
        5.4–5.6). A revolutionary public space and urban revitalization project, the High
        Line is a plant-lined elevated parkway converted from a long-abandoned freight
        line snaking above the West Side of Manhattan. Designed by Diller Scofidio +
        Renfro, the 2.4-kilometer parkway, which sits 9 meters above street level, wraps

around Hudson Yards as it curves toward the Hudson River, revealing sweeping
waterfront views at its northern end. The High Line combines elements of the origi-
nal railway with native flora and fauna. The characteristics of former tracks—flat,
long, frequently running through historical areas—are appealing for various devel-
opments. New growth on the West Side can be attributed to the success of the
High Line, which has spurred $2 billion of private investment, 12,000 new jobs, and
29 development projects since opening in June 2009.
   The site will become one of the greenest neighborhood in the city (images 5.7

        organized around the new Hudson Park and Boulevard Public Park (built at a cost
        of $30 million), creating a network of open space. The development also has easy
        access to a six-story building to host cultural activities (the Culture Shed) and a
        large public square (map 5.5).

Mixed-use development
By 2024, when the project is completed, 125,000 people a day will work in, visit,
or live in Hudson Yards. The neighborhood will include more than 1.6 million
square meters of commercial and residential space, 5 state-of-the-art office tow-
ers, about 5,000 residences, a 750-seat public school, a unique cultural space, 5.6
hectares of public open space, a 175-room luxury hotel, restaurants, and more
than 100 stores (image 5.9).

Smart city systems that make development connected, reliable, efficient,

Related Companies designed the area to be ready for the future: Communications
will be supported by a fiber loop, designed to optimize data speed and service
continuity for rooftop communications, as well as mobile, cellular, and two-way
radio communications. This will allow continuous access via wired and wireless

        Social diversity
        Local affordability was a major concern with earlier transferrable development
        right schemes in New York, since commercial densification had historically paid
        little attention to ensuring the interest of local communities, which would suffer
        from rising costs and increasingly unaffordable living options. In the context of
        Hudson Yards, social diversity has been emphasized as a principle, even if market-
        rate residential units at Hudson Yards are expected to sell for $20,000–$35,000 per
        square meter and the retail and commercial space will be expensive.
             Flexibility and development bonuses are offered to developers for providing af-
        fordable housing. Some affordable rental apartments were allocated by lottery in
        2016. More affordable units might be delivered later, but Related Companies focused
        first on commercial development. It leased all of its properties with high-end tenants.


        Increasing Market Potential Value
        Responding to market demand through a well-located underutilized area
        The market potential value of a station area is assessed by identifying the unreal-
        ized market value around it and estimating market demand at the city level (see
        chapter 2). New York City, particularly Manhattan, has strong needs for new office
        space in well-connected areas. Manhattan is also one of the United States’ tightest
        housing markets, with an estimated vacancy rate of 2.87 percent in November
        2015 (Carmiel 2015). People in New York City are clustered at high densities in the
        areas with the highest accessibility to jobs and to Manhattan in 30 minutes. Ac-
        cording to census data, Manhattan gained about 100,000 residents between 2000
        and 2014 (increasing its population from 1.54 million to 1.64 million). Demand for
        new housing is great and expected to grow.
            The enhancements of node value and place value on the Far West Side will
        unleash the high market potential of the area. Increasing the connectivity of and
        creating jobs in Hudson Yards will be a catalyst for development of the entire Far
        West Side. The number of accessible jobs will increase significantly beyond the
        boundaries of the project itself, fostering increases in human densities (people +
        job densities) and land and real estate development.
            The proximity to Midtown Manhattan is the most compelling market potential
        value asset of the Far West Side, since the area can be seen as a natural extension
        of this existing market, providing convenient access to clients and other business
        services in Midtown, and a tremendous advantage in terms of bridging the psy-
        chological barriers that affect firms’ locational choices. This untapped market po-
        tential value has been unleashed through rezoning of the area. Previous zoning
        was for low-density industrial uses. The maximum floor area ratio of 5 was not
        enough to encourage private investment in commercial development.
            The Far West Side has adequate space to accommodate a large-scale office
        district. It is a remarkably underdeveloped area of Manhattan, with 128 unbuilt lots
        and 27 hectares of vacant development space. After rezoning, the area can easily
        accommodate at least 2 million square meters of new office development, as well
        as other commercial, residential, and retail uses.
            When preparing the Master Plan for Hudson Yards, New York City identified the
        vision and driving direction for the development of the overall area (the Preferred
Case Study: Hudson Yards in New York City                                                           O 125



Direction 2003), including zoning for appropriate densities and uses. This Pre-
ferred Direction directs the highest density to the areas that will most benefit from
subway access—namely, the regional 42nd and 34th streets and across from the
Javits Convention Center. The rezoning strategy seeks to preserve the Ninth Av-
enue scale by keeping the density near existing levels. The Ninth Avenue is sepa-
rated from the higher density areas by a band of moderate density areas (maps 5.6
and 5.7). In 2009 the West Side Yard was rezoned.

        Flexible zoning and tax abatement
        Adapted zoning in Hudson Yards sets varied FARs for predominantly commercial,
        mixed-use, and predominantly residential in order to introduce flexibility and cap-
        ture value. Developers of commercial or residential projects in the Hudson Yards
        area have an opportunity to receive a zoning bonus that would allow their project
        to exceed the base maximum FAR (or “as-of-right”) established in the zoning reso-
        lution by making a District Improvement Bonus (DIB) payment to the Hudson Yards
        District Improvement Fund (about $1,350 per square meter), through transfer of
        development rights, or through provision of inclusionary housing (image 5.10).
        The inclusionary housing bonus for specific parts of the development allows 10–15
        percent of the development to be affordable to low-, moderate-, or middle-in-
        come families (maps 5.8 and 5.9 and image 5.11). The New York City Industrial
        Development Agency’s (NYCIDA) Uniform Tax Exemption Policy (UTEP) also in-
        cludes financial incentives, including real estate tax discounts, for commercial de-
        velopment projects in the Hudson Yards area (map 5.10).4

        Financing structure for public spaces and connecting infrastructures
        The cost of phase 1 infrastructure was initially estimated at $1.763 billion for the
        No. 7 Subway Extension, $351 million for Eastern Railyard platform, and $361 mil-
        lion for open space and streets (HYIC 2004). Cost estimates for phase 2 were $250
        million for the No. 7 Subway 41st Street Station and $271 million for the midblock
        boulevard and parks. The total cost of public spaces for the 2 phases was esti-
        mated at $632 million. Total infrastructure costs for the 2 phases with the subway

        extension was estimated at about $3 billion. The new 34 St-Hudson Yards No 7 line
        Station opened September 13, 2015. Although a new station at 10th Avenue and
        41st Street was part of the original plan, the intermediate station was eliminated
        in October 2007 due to cost overruns, leaving the terminal station at Eleventh
        Avenue and 34th Street as the only new station on the extension.
            The Hudson Yards Investment Corporation (HYIC), a local development corpo-
        ration, was created in 2005 under the Not-for-Profit Corporation Law of the State
        of New York to finance certain property acquisition and infrastructure develop-
        ment, including the No. 7 Subway Extension. The Hudson Yards Development
        Corporation (HYDC) is a local development corporation created by the city to
        manage and implement the project. The two corporations have separate financial
        statements.
            HYIC collects revenues, including payments in lieu of taxes (PILOT) and district
        improvement bonuses from private developers and appropriation from the city;
        pays principal and interest on its bonds; and disburses bond proceeds to pay
        project costs. Its revenue streams include interest support payments by the city;
        PILOT; tax equivalent payments for property taxes on new residential develop-
        ment in the project area; district improvement bonuses against additional density;
        and payments in lieu of mortgage recording (PILOMRT). Under the support and
        development agreement between HYIC, HYDC, and the City, the City agreed to
        make payments, subject to annual appropriation, in an amount sufficient, together
        with HYIC other revenues, to pay interest on outstanding bonds (HYIC 2015).
            HYIC acquired a 50 percent interest in the Eastern Railyards Transferable Devel-
        opment Rights (TDR), allowing developers to build larger buildings than otherwise
        permissible under zoning law. The proceeds received by HYIC for the sale of the

TDRs up to the amount of HYIC’s investment (including total purchase price and
interest costs) will be used to support its operations and service its debt.
   By the end of 2006, $3 billion of Hudson Yards bonds had been sold, making
the project fully financed. Of this amount, $1 billion were sold in October 2011.
They were rated A by S&P and Fitch, and A2 by Moody’s. Another $2 billion of
bonds were sold in December 2006, with similar ratings.
   In 2008 the commercial real estate market crashed. The MTA started negotia-
tions with selected developers before the crash (Related was not the first team
selected; originally Tishman was selected). The real estate crash delayed the proj-
ect, because developers were unable to secure financing. Eventually the City
Council had to vote to pay for a few more years of debt service payments.
   New development will generate various streams of revenue that are expected to
cover these costs over time. It is expected that these streams of revenue will largely
cover the debt service and that the project will generate cumulated incremental
revenues to City and State of $67 billion between 2005 and 2035 (figure 5.1).

project (map 6.1) in Central London and a major transport hub. The site is an inter-
change station with six London metro lines, two national train stations (King’s Cross
and St Pancras [photo 6.1]), and an international high-speed rail line (HS1) con-
necting to Paris, making it the most connective hub in Central London. Investment
in high-quality public space and local pedestrian connectivity and mixed-use de-
velopment triggered a strong market response, raising market potential.
    In 1996 strategic planning guidance for London identified King’s Cross as one
of five “central area margin key opportunities.” It called for mixed-use develop-
ment, with an intensification of densities and commercial uses close to the station,
as well as urban regeneration and support to local communities, including a hous-
ing program (some of it affordable housing) and community facilities. Planners also
called for maintaining and enhancing features of historic and conservation impor-
tance to create a neighborhood with a distinct character, identity, and image.
    The area of opportunity for urban regeneration spanned over 27 hectares of
fragmented land and old industrial buildings located on the site of former rail and
industrial facilities to the north of the transport hub and in front of the two rail sta-
tions (photo 6.2). Redevelopment has involved restoration of historic buildings and
new construction. The site has been regenerated and made attractive by provision
of ample public spaces. The plan increases local connectivity, accessibility, and
permeability, with a dense pattern of internal streets. It creates high place value,

                                          Increasing Node Value

                                          King’s Cross Station, in the core of London, is a major interchange station at the
                                          scale of the city, the United Kingdom, and Europe (map 6.2). It has one of the high-
                                          est node values in Europe, with very high levels of connectivity and accessibility.
                                          Five international airports are within an hour, including three with direct connec-
                                          tions to King’s Cross. King’s Cross is also the biggest inner-city transit interchange
                                          in London, linking 6 metro lines and 17 bus routes.
                                              King’s Cross—together with the St Pancras and Euston stations—is expected to
                                          function as the principal transit center for London. The 2004 London Plan ex-
                                          pected that with the completion of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link-High-Speed 1
                                          (HS1), the Thameslink 2000, and the Cross River Tram, King’s Cross will become
                                          the most accessible station in Greater London. The decision in 1996 to move Brit-
                                          ain’s first high-speed railway, the Channel Tunnel Rail Link, from London Waterloo
                                          Rail Station to St Pancras provided the catalyst for landowners LCR and Exel (now
                                          DHL) to develop the King’s Cross site.
                                              The Western Concourse between King’s Cross and St Pancras stations is de-
                                          signed as a public plaza with legibility, linkage, and transparency (photo 6.3). Like
                                          the British Museum’s Great Court (photo 4.4), the space acts as an internalized
                                          exterior, where the sky is materialized by an impressive architectural structure and
                                          the façade acts as a wall.



                                          Increasing Place Value

                                          After the King’s Cross site became an integral part of HS1 development in the late
                                          1990s, plans to redevelop the site became a real possibility. Lack of market appetite

had postponed such plans multiple times in earlier decades. To the north of the two
train stations lay 27 hectares of former rail and industrial facilities. There was thus a
strong imbalance between very high connectivity about to emerge and low intensity
of land use. This imbalance opened an opportunity to increase place value by rede-
fining, reshaping, and creating value on former rail land to the north of the two
stations and transforming King’s Cross Square in front of the stations (photo 6.4).
    King’s Cross is a unique development from a planning perspective. It took al-
most six years to design, negotiate, and receive planning consent. Four rounds of
public consultations were held, involving some 30,000 people. The developer and
government listened and adapted the scheme based on feedback.

        Keeping the Master Plan Flexible
        Two master planning teams and four independent design review panels led to a
        highly tailored scheme that responded to the needs of multiple stakeholders. Plan-
        ning balanced the developer’s long-term aspirations to create and manage a long-
        term asset and the local authority’s desire to integrate it into the deprived com-
        munities that surrounded the area through urban regeneration. The developer
        started from a blank piece of paper, built the scheme based on principles and
        precedents, and realized its vision in the master plan (see map 6.1).
            The master plan unifies the site with a comprehensive vision, but it is flexible
        enough to accommodate change. This flexibility will enable King’s Cross to adapt
        to changes in social and technological trends. Development is not functionally
        locked into the needs and technologies of today but has been left enough margin
        to evolve with needs and market shifts. Changes in the proportions of uses and
        transformation of buildings to respond to changes in market conditions have been
        integrated in a planning conceived more as a continuing process than as a once
        and for all exercise.
            To balance this adaptability and maintain continuity, order in space, and iden-
        tity, key physical aspects of the site were fixed. Streets and public spaces, the most
        resilient features of neighborhoods, were defined. To create visual order in space
        and avoid out-of-proportion construction that would obstruct views and the flow
        of well-defined public space, maximum and minimum building heights were fixed
        in various zones. These standards ensure consistency in density and scale through-
        out the site. To provide a sense of unity, uniqueness, and harmony while allowing
        for diversity and variety, design guidelines describing building techniques, materi-
        als, and how materials can be used were also established.
            Planners have been careful not to be too prescriptive about the tone, character,
        and feel of the area. Instead, specific details of the new district have been allowed
        to emerge over time, aided by a master plan that allows room for flexibility, nego-
        tiation, change, and experimentation with occupiers and activities (ULI 2014).


        Attracting High-Tech Companies
        The high-quality development attracted Google, which spent about £650 million
        to buy and develop a 1-hectare site on a 999-year lease from King’s Cross Central
        Limited Partnership, the partnership developing the site. The finished develop-
        ment (93,000 square meters) will be worth up to £1 billion. Several thousand staff
        will occupy the low-rise structure. Google’s U.K. headquarters will be its largest
        office outside its corporate headquarters in California. The building includes 4,650
        square meters of ground-floor retail. Google’s presence is expected to draw other
        technology companies, especially small start-ups, and help bump up rents.


        Combining High Density with Medium-Size Buildings
        High density at Kings Cross is achieved not through high-rises but through 50
        medium-size buildings designed at human scale. The high density, mixed-use, infill
        redevelopment with an average floor area ratio (FAR) of 4.6 at block scale com-

bines heritage and new buildings (map 6.3). Twenty heritage buildings are being
retained and refurbished as shops and restaurants. Their color and character re-
flect the unique nature of the development, which blends historic and contempo-
rary architecture (photo 6.5).


Reshaping the Image of King’s Cross
Image exerts a powerful influence over site development. The density of accessi-
ble local amenities, cultural and leisure assets, and green spaces increases place
value. Developing a mix of land uses contributes to a location’s success and re-
duces the developer’s risks. Mixed-use schemes are more adaptive to market
changes if enough flexibility is allowed to shift uses. Such schemes allow develop-
ments to quickly establish themselves within an emerging urban neighborhood
with an appealing sense of place.
   According to the King’s Cross Public Realm Strategy: The area in and around
King’s Cross has been in constant evolution and is marked by its history as one of
the first “intermodal” hubs in the United Kingdom, with connected water, rail and
road modes of transport. Its character reflects directly its history, forming one of
the most significant groupings of early Victorian buildings in London. These exist-
ing buildings and structures have been very influential in the layout of uses across
the site.
   One-quarter of King’s Cross is dedicated to cultural and leisure uses. The his-
toric fabric was embedded in the plan in a sophisticated manner, rather than
merely preserved. Every building has a new use and a relationship to its neighbors
and the spaces in between (photos 6.6 and 6.7).

            The tranquility of the canal and the views to the Camley Street Natural Park
        offer a contrast with the new shops and cafes in the Coal Drops (a former coal
        transfer point between rail and wagons and road carts) and Granary Square. A new
        pedestrian bridge across Regent’s Canal and other links have been created to
        “capitalize upon the canal’s positive contribution to King’s Cross and to bring life
        to the canal, enhance its character, wildlife value and recreational use and improve
        access and safety” (Argent 2002).


        Creating High-Quality Public Space
        The public realm is a physical and social entity that comprises the spaces between
        buildings and the activities happening in them. It is at the heart of the King’s Cross
        concept:

               [Public realm] means an arrangement of routes and public spaces—be it
            traditional streets and squares or other links and connections—to and
            through the surrounding city. Establishing the right framework is very im-

            portant. It will provide the template, over time for buildings, new land uses
            and activities. (EDAW and others 2004)

            The design aims at achieving an attractive and legible public realm—“a busy,
        thriving and exciting destination; a confluence of people and activity; an outstand-
        ing place to live, work, or just be” (EDAW and others 2004).
            King’s Cross Central is built around the social, functional, and symbolic impor-
        tance of the public realm in providing spaces for people to meet and spend active
        and leisure time. The public realm is high grade, but it is not just corporate design
        to create high-priced rentals. It is also meant to be a part of London—open, demo-
        cratic, and accessible.
            In total, some £2 billion will be invested in local transport infrastructure and the
        public realm, including £250 million for 20 new streets, 10 new public spaces, and
        5 major squares totaling 3.2 hectares. The planning team “spent a lot of time think-
        ing about the spaces in between buildings, about how people would use those
        spaces” (ULI 2014). Some 40 percent of the development will be devoted to open
        space (figure 6.1). Some of the built space will also include public spaces, such as
        courtyards and gardens.
            The design of King’s Cross connects people to people with a continuum of
        outdoor areas and in some cases large indoor areas, such as the west concourse
        at the King’s Cross Station. It encompasses streets, parks, squares, pedestrian ar-
        eas, canal promenades, cycle paths, and trails as a continuum of interconnected
        spaces that can support a wide variety of activities. A goal is to generate pedes-
        trian movement and activity.
            King’s Cross illustrates how both high-quality design and long-term manage-
        ment strategies help create a good public realm. The continuous flow of spaces,

routes, and views and the vibrancy of interactions within the public realm is sup-
ported by high-quality detailing that creates a rich and constantly changing infor-
mation and activity field for pedestrians. Special attention to paving, planting,
orientation, light and shadow, shelter, signage, and street furniture makes spaces
accessible, safe, and legible (photo 6.8).
142 O                                                          Transforming the Urban Space




        Ensuring Unrestricted Use of the Public Realm
        According to the King’s Cross Central Public Realm Strategy (EDAW and others
        2004):


              The traditional heart of civic life is centered on the town-square, the
           high-street and town-park, elements of the public realm, around which
           community life revolves and civic pride is focused. Civic space traditionally
           suggested a mode of behavior reflecting either the importance or use of
           the space, or the civic function of the day. Hence a town-square may be a
           market place one day and a place of remembrance on the next.


            Argent, the developer, sought to achieve this civic meaning of the public realm
        by following other London examples of unrestricted use of the public realm that is
        owned and managed privately balancing access and quality, and managing the
        space with the public in focus.
            Clear definition between the public realm and the private domain is provided
        at King’s Cross with built form rather than walls, fences, or planting. Where it was
        desirable to limit access or use to residents or employees, features such as rumble
        strips, different road surface (by color or texture), pillars, and narrower carriageway
        were used to delimit the private space and give the impression that the area be-
        yond is less public and more private.


        Creating Active Streets
        The King’s Cross design creates active streets with retail stores, bars, cafes, and
        restaurants to keep the neighborhood lively throughout the day. All ground-floor
        units are, or will be, leased to these types of occupants. But the approach goes
        beyond individual streets within King’s Cross Central. It creates a network of safe
        pedestrian routes that connect key sites in the development and closely connect
        the development with the surrounding communities in Camden and Islington
        (map 6.4).
            The site design includes a variety of promenades for various time of day and
        types of people, each with a different emphasis or theme (as represented by the
        colors on the site map [map 6.5]). These trails integrate places for people to walk
        or linger. Tiered stone seating and steps cascade from Granary Square to Regent’s
        Canal, enhancing the south-facing aspect and reinforcing the historic relationship
        between the canal and the Granary, the geographic heart and heritage soul of
        King’s Cross (photo 6.9).
            To the west of the site is Camley Street Natural Park (photo 6.10). Created
        within a relatively small space, it expresses a unique fusion between Central Lon-
        don’s density, rich industrial archaeology, green space, and nature conservation.
        The focal point is a floating platform that brings architecture and nature closer
        together, allowing people to take in unrivalled views of both Regent’s Canal and
        the Camley Street Natural Park. Inspired by the rocky islands off the Nordic coast-
        line, the platform is an important new learning facility for the park.

ture as shown in this section drawing on Suzuki and others (2015).


Ensuring Flexible Uses to Adapt to Market Conditions
The agreement for the redevelopment of King’s Cross set floor space maximums
stimulating diverse site use (table 6.1). The agreement allows for flexibility in land

uses to enable the developer to adapt to market conditions, as redevelopment is
likely to take 10–15 years to complete. Use within the total floor space is allowed
to vary by 20 percent; floor space allocated to one use can be traded against an-
other, to a limited extent.


Financing and Fostering Market Potential Value
King’s Cross is funded through a combination of equity, debt, and recycled reve-
nues. Cash flow management has enabled the partnership’s equity to be used
across a variety of projects to create demand and interest from potential buyers.
The total estimated value of the entire King’s Cross project, including construction,
professional fees, and interest, is expected to reach £3 billion (ULI 2014).
    The partnership has made £250 million of investments in public realm infra-
structure since 2009, unlocking 557,000 square meters of development. Equity
funding went toward creation of the public realm, including new roads (including
King’s Boulevard), new public spaces (including Granary Square), a new bridge
across Regent’s Canal, canal side improvements, and the Energy Centre and its
district heating and distribution networks. The King’s Cross Central Limited Part-
nership also signed a £100 million construction contract with the University of the
Arts, which will build a campus at King’s Cross (ULI 2014).
    About £300 million of debt secured since 2009 has been used to finance some
of the direct construction costs of residential and office buildings. This debt pack-
age, from four leading banks, provided loans for three commercial buildings, the
final phases of infrastructure, and 272 apartments. The U.K. Homes and Communi-
ties Agency provided £42 million in public funds to support affordable housing
(ULI 2014).
    After development, the new balance between high node value and high place
value is expected to foster high market potential value, with rental and real estate
performance exceeding that of London as a whole.


Capturing Value
One key land value capture technique adopted by local governments in England
and Wales is of Section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act of 1990. It

                                            Section 106 agreements have been crucial in incorporating desirable planning
                                        principles into public-private funding and property development at King’s Cross.
                                        They underscore the importance of balancing interregional business marketability
                                        and local community livability with public-private partnership–based infrastructure
                                        funding and property development (Suzuki and others 2015).
                                            Section 106 agreements include cash and in-kind contributions by the devel-

                                        and community services (figure 6.2). The package includes £2.1 million to create
                                        24,000–27,000 local jobs through a construction training center and skills and re-

                                            Under the supervision the Department for Transport, London & Continental
                                        Railways (LCR) has been mandated to maximize its long-term asset value. Its de-
                                        velopment strategy has been to use its major sites as equity to participate in joint-
                                        venture development companies that can make long-term profits through urban

                                        areas were identified and regeneration proceeded after the local authority ap-
                                        proved the plans in 2006, with an initial target completion date of 2016.

    As part of the construction of the HS1 project by LCR, the Department for
Transport provided financial assistance to the then private LCR to cover part of
the construction costs, the project’s debts, and the operations of LCR and its
subsidiaries. LCR was also granted property development rights around the
King’s Cross and Stratford Stations. This arrangement was to continue until the
concession contract expires in 2086, at which point the assets would return to the
government. Based on the 1996 arrangement between the government and
LCR, the Department for Transport expected to receive half of LCR’s net profit
after deducting the costs for the King’s Cross development scheme (Suzuki and
others 2015).
    The developer (Argent) was selected as a private partner in 2001. It entered
into a joint collective ownership acquisition and development agreement with the
landowners, in a deal that included an agreement that the land be valued follow-
ing the approval of planning permission and completion of HS1. Upon valuation,
Argent would have the option to acquire the land from the landowner or enter into
a 50/50 partnership with it. The price paid by Argent was to be discounted based
on the land open market value, with the discount increasing as the value of the
land rose.
    The deal incentivized Argent to optimize the value of the scheme. Under the
agreement, land value would be established once the landowners (LCR and DHL)
provided vacant property (which they were to do after HS1 was completed and
open) and the developer completed its planning, submitted a viable business
plan, and secured funding. The agreement was designed to be concluded when
certainty had been delivered by all parties. The London Borough of Camden
granted planning permission for regeneration in 2006, and LCR, Argent, and DHL
jointly formed the King’s Cross Central Limited Partnership in 2008 (Suzuki and
others 2015).
    A long-term development partnership was created in which Argent owns a 50
percent interest, the government-owned LCR holds a 36.5 percent interest, and
DHL Supply Chain (formerly Exel) holds a 13.5 percent stake. Argent brought the
backing from a large pension fund (BTPS, managed by Hermes Investment Man-
agement), essential for the private development of the site.
    In 2009 the Department for Transport took over LCR, which had accumulated
too much public debt in the construction of HS1. Following the concessioning of
HS1, LCR was restructured into a property development and management com-
pany in 2011. A central feature of LCR’s current business profile is that returns from
its property interests are expected to be mainly in the form of capital appreciation
over the next 5–10 years.
    By March 31, 2014, six years after the actual development had started, more
than 57 percent of the redevelopment project by floor area had been either com-
pleted or committed. Redevelopment continued to proceed apace, and financial
contributions to LCR began. In January 2015, LCR sold its stake in the project to
an Australian pension fund for £371 million, according to the company’s audited
statements. DHL did the same. Increases in the profit contributions and investment
carrying value arose predominantly from disposal and reevaluation of investment
properties. LCR also lent funds to the King’s Cross Central Limited Partnership for
regeneration.

Increasing Connectivity and
Economic Value along a Transit Line:
Crossrail in London



In 2009, the United Kingdom and London initiated construction of Crossrail, one
of the largest rail infrastructure projects in Europe. The first part of the network (the
Elizabeth Line) is scheduled to open in December 2018 (map 7.1).
    The new train line will deliver a much-needed increase in rail capacity—but it is
much more than a new rail link. It is an infrastructure scheme that fully integrates
regeneration and wider economic benefits into its business case and activities. By
bringing an additional 1.5 million more people within a 45-minute transit ride from
job clusters, Crossrail will increase inclusiveness and integrate more people into
London job market. The project is expected to become a catalyst for urban regen-
eration in key locations and a driver of London’s economic growth. Crossrail has
spurred urban regeneration across its network of 40 stations.
    This case study shows how node and place values vary along the new line, trig-
gering different market potential and responses. The most central station areas,
where job concentration and connectivity is already extremely high, are the main
beneficiaries of high market potential increases. Market opportunities are also pos-
sible in fringe areas, provided the right development strategies are put in place.



London’s Booming Population and Economy

London is the world’s leading center for international business and commerce and
one of the “command centers” of the global economy. It has the fifth-largest city
economy in the world (after Tokyo, New York, Los Angeles, and Seoul) (Parilla and

                                                                                    149

        The city’s economy is roughly the size of Sweden. London is projected to be the
        world’s second most competitive city (after New York) in 2025 (Economist Intelli-
        gence Unit 2013).1

   London’s booming population is set to break the 9 million mark within the
next decade. The London Plan 2016 projects that the city will add nearly 1.1
million people in working age and 900,000 new jobs by 2036. By 2050 the
population could reach 13.2 million people, nearly twice its 1991 level, with
240,000 more daily travels into Central London by 2025. The projected 35 per-
cent growth in public transit trips will put additional pressures on the transit
network.



The Importance of Crossrail to London’s
Competitiveness and Growth

Transit acts as an enabler of economic growth for London, shaping employment
concentration and agglomeration economies. The quality of the city’s international
connections and intracity network is a crucial component of its competitive advan-
tage. London dominates rail travel in the United Kingdom: 62 percent of all rail
journeys in the country started or ended in London in 2012/13 (GLA Economics
2016). Concentrating economic density has created agglomeration economies
and increased productivity.
    To remain at the top of global competitiveness, London continues investing in
transit connectivity. Crossrail, scheduled to open in full in December 2019, is a new
railway line running east to west through London and into the surrounding coun-
tryside. It will run over 100 kilometers of track, with a branch to Heathrow Airport.
The main features of the project are the construction of 42 kilometers of new tun-
nels connecting stations in Central London, including a branch to Canary Wharf in
east London, and the construction of 10 new stations.
    Crossrail is Europe’s largest infrastructure project, with a projected cost of £14.8
billion. The project is being jointly sponsored by the Department for Transport and
152 O                                                         Transforming the Urban Space



        Transport for London (TfL). Project delivery is being managed by Crossrail Ltd., a
        special-purpose subsidiary of TfL. The capital cost will be recovered from riders
        through farebox revenues; from businesses and developers, including BAA, the
        Canary Wharf Group, and the City of London through direct contributions to capi-
        tal costs, developer contributions, and a business rate supplement (an extra pay-
        ment on some business property); and from national taxpayers through a grant
        from the Department for Transport.
            Crossrail will deliver significant travel time reduction (up to 40 percent on
        some routes), a 10 percent increase in London’s rail-based public transit ca-
        pacity, and a 50 percent increase in capacity to the Isle of Dogs (an area in
        the East End of London), where the business district of Canary Wharf has the
        highest job density in London and in Europe, rivaled only by Wall Street and
        (eventually) the new Hudson Yards development in New York (see chapter 5).
        It will provide new transport links with the London Underground, Thameslink,
        the National Rail, the Docklands Light Railway, and the London
        Overground.
            More than 200 million passengers are projected to use Crossrail annually. It will
        offer a direct connection between all of London’s main business centers, linking
        Heathrow with Paddington, the West End, the City, and Canary Wharf. According
        to GVA (the largest independent property agency in the United Kingdom), the
        improvements in travel times, the quality of passenger experience, and the fre-
        quency of rail service will have significant impacts on London’s economic perfor-
        mance and new residential and commercial investment, through a transforma-
        tional effect on key locations along the route.


        Increasing Node Value by Reinforcing Highly
        Connective Hubs in Central London
        London’s public transit system has been central in shaping a radial monocentric
        city with a high concentration of hubs in the core.2 Its network has guided and
        constrained the city, with public transit networks central to growth during the 19th
        and first half of the 20th century.3
            Map 7.2 shows the percentage of commuting trips made by public transit, ac-
        cording to place of residence (panel a) and destination (panel b). High transit ac-
        cessibility to the city center has fostered a highly concentrated distribution of jobs
        in the city hypercenter, with a more dispersed pattern of residential density. The
        result is that two-thirds of commuting flows originate or terminate in Outer
        London.
            Two main mechanisms drive node value in London: the concentration of transit
        hubs in the core of the city where most employment and GDP creation takes place,
        and accessibility patterns that are highly concentrated in the core of London. Map
        7.3 shows how the three network centralities used in the 3V Framework are con-
        centrated in Central London (chapter 2). The highest levels of centrality—and thus
        accessibility—within the network and the greatest growth potential are around the
        Circle Line and along the Central Line, defining Central London. The density of
        stations is higher in the western part of Central London, where one third of Lon-
        don’s jobs are located.

           Crossrail stations within the area defined by the Circle Line will increase the im-
        portance, centrality, and accessibility of Central London’s major hubs. Crossrail sta-
        tion interchanges with existing tube stations and High-Speed 1 (HS1) stations will
        create very high node values, calling for further urban development to align place
        value with the very high node values of the most central stations. Main hubs, where
        jobs are already concentrated, will have more connections and will concentrate
        more lines after Crossrail. These major hubs at the top of London’s transit system
        hierarchy are in close proximity. Crossrail will also create a new direct connection
        between the National Rail networks running into Paddington and Liverpool Streets;
        passengers will no longer have to change at the termini of the National Rail routes.
           Crossrail is expected to have three main benefits:

        • It will relieve overcrowding on existing Tube and train services by adding 10
          percent extra rail capacity for London, the largest single increase in London’s
          transport capacity since World War II.
        • It will strengthen links to key financial centers (Heathrow, the West End, the City,
          and Canary Wharf) to support London as a world city and bring an additional
          1.5 million people within 45 minutes commuting distance of London’s key busi-
          ness districts.
        • It will reduce travel times into and across London, with reliable and efficient
          service and 24 trains per hour at peak times through Central London.


        Increasing Place Value through Place-Making,
        Redevelopment, and the Public Realm
        Crossrail delivers integrated designs for stations, above-station developments,
        and public spaces.4 Each element complements the others to create places and
        transform spaces.
            Crossrail Limited, which is tasked with delivering the new railway, coordinates mas-
        ter planning of public realm improvements around stations. The aim is to ensure that
        these improvements are integrated with existing and planned improvements in the
        wider area and reflect other planned uses. Master plans are developed with key stake-
        holders, including local authorities and private developers. The approach recognizes
        that passengers will judge the success of the railway not only by the service and the
        stations but also by their overall experience arriving at and departing from stations.
            Crossrail’s approach to public spaces aims at making the areas outside stations
        work effectively as transport interchanges, getting people to the next stage of their
        journey by bicycle, foot, bus, or taxi and being an attractive and pleasant public
        space to spend time in. The designs aim to be adaptable and sustainable, so that
        their use can change over time. All Crossrail stations will be accessible from street
        to platform, safe, and secure.
            The station area designs also aim to retain the identity, diversity, and character-
        istics of local areas, giving confidence to local communities and potential investors
        (photo 7.2). Toward that end, boroughs (local administrative units) play a vital part
        in raising funds for the designs, to ensure that such design will spread improve-
        ments and regeneration impacts. The designs were produced in collaboration with
        Crossrail, local authorities, TfL, and (on Crossrail’s surface section) Network Rail.

   By March 2014 urban realm designs had been completed for 31 stations, in-
cluding 27 in the London area and 4 outside London. They covered more than
100,000 square meters of improved public space at 40 sites—the equivalent of 19
Leicester Squares. The “Crossrail effect” is already happening in the center of
London, at locations such as the east end of Oxford Street, while developers are
also showing interest in outer London locations such as Abbey Wood and
Southall.
156 O                                                                       Transforming the Urban Space



           The funding required to implement the designs will be obtained from a variety
        of sources, a principle agreed to by all the partners at an early stage. Crossrail
        estimates the total cost of the urban realm improvements outside every station on
        the route at £129 million. The target is to raise and implement £90 million of im-
        provements by Crossrail’s opening. The funding will be split between Crossrail,
        TfL, and third parties (principally local authorities through developer
        contributions).
           London property value analysts widely recognize that a driving force behind
        Crossrail’s ability to support development activity and property market values is
        investment in the extent, configuration, and quality of public space immediately
        around each station. According to GVA, the new stations, developments above
        the stations, and planned urban realm improvements have the potential to rede-
        fine Crossrail’s stations as the centers of the communities they serve, as attractive
        places with entertainment, public art, restaurants, and public spaces—places to
        spend time in, not just to pass through.
           Examples of urban realm improvements along Crossrail line moving west to
        east are outlined below. They show how place value can be enhanced areas
        contexts.

        Maidenhead
        Maidenhead Station, on the west end of the line, is a gateway to a town through
        which about 3.5 million people pass each year. The main proposal includes cre-
        ation of a new landscaped station plaza with a water pool acting as a focal point

that will animate the space and encourage people to linger (image 7.1). Tree plant-
ing, high-quality paving materials, sensitive lighting, and seating will help provide
a positive experience for passengers arriving by rail.

Paddington
Paddington is a historical Central London railway terminus and Underground sta-
tion. It is a busy complex served by four underground lines: Bakerloo, Hammer-
smith & City, District, and Circle. Crossrail will increase the ranking of Paddington
as a major London hub.
   An interim improvement scheme has been completed on the canal side outside
the new Hammersmith and City Line entrance on Departures Road, opposite the
Crossrail entrance. A permanent urban realm design scheme aims to complete the
waterside public space within the Paddington Basin (image 7.2). Crossrail antici-

pates that “it will establish a clear, safe and accessible towpath alongside the
canal, station entrance and office development, which will be built over the en-
trance. This will aid pedestrian movements and wayfinding from station exits and
surrounding developments while maintaining the character and quality of the
area by respecting the historical industrial character of the Basin” (Crossrail
2015b).
   Crossrail has also obtained planning consent from the Westminster City
Council to build a 32,000-square meter development at Paddington Triangle
(image 7.3).

Bond Street
Bond Street is a major historic retail street in London. The new urban realm design
for Bond Street West takes into account an increase in pedestrian use. It sensitively
integrates the new Crossrail station entrance with the surrounding environment.
Proposals for Bond Street East will provide ample area for pedestrians, creating a
prominent and generous forecourt to the station entrance. High-quality granite
paving will extend into the station concourse. Four diagonal crossing points will be
introduced on Hanover Square with adjacent footways in matching materials. Cy-
cle parking will be provided at several locations in the square (image 7.4).

Tottenham Court Road
Tottenham Court Road Station will link the West End to Canary Wharf in 12 min-
utes, Stratford in 13 minutes, and Heathrow in less than 30 minutes. It will cut travel
times in half in some cases.
   Crossrail is investing £1 billion to transform the station, making it the biggest
transport investment in the West End in decades. Built more than 100 years ago
as two separate Tube stations, Tottenham Court Road was not designed to cope
with the almost 150,000 passengers a day who now travel through the station.
Alongside the upgrade of the existing Tube station, Crossrail is building a new
station the length of three football fields, four floors underground.

Liverpool Street East
Liverpool Street Station is a key gateway to the City of London (also known as the
Square Mile), Europe’s leading financial center. It is a destination for 73 million
people a year who use the Underground and 63 million who use the national rail
on their way to work, as visitors to the City, or en route to the nearby areas of
Spitalfields and Shoreditch. The compactness and density of the Square Mile
means that walking is the best way to move around the City. The arrival of Crossrail
will see significant increases in pedestrian movements and other transport modes
to get to and from the station (image 7.7).

                                           station will act as an “urban bridge” by providing a direct and accessible link be-
                                           tween the areas to the north and south of the station. As part of the wider urban

                                           motorway to a more traditional road with pavements and dedicated cycle lanes. It
                                           will link southbound bus stops to the station via a new pedestrian crossing
                                           (image 7.9).

Canary Wharf
Canary Wharf (photo 7.3) has the highest density of jobs and office space in Lon-
don, with about 105,000 jobs on 28.8 hectares (an average gross built density of
office space of 7.4). Its history over the past 20 years provides an example of the
role of investment in public transit and in place-making supporting and sustaining
economic growth. The three-value interplay is prevalent at Canary Wharf: Place-
making and a 50 percent increase in transit capacity are expected to allow a dou-
bling of office space in London’s fastest-growing business center.
    The Docklands, once part of the Port of London in east and southeast London,
experienced rapid expansion with the extension of the Jubilee Line, in 1999, en-
abling current employment levels to be reached; the previous transport systems
would not have been able to cope with the number of passengers who now com-
mute to Canary Wharf on the Jubilee Line. The combination of connectivity with
high quality public realm allowed a former industrial site to be transformed into a
booming business district.
    In 1985, SOM, an architecture, engineering, and urban planning firm, began
work on a master plan for Canary Wharf, which called for transforming a derelict
industrial area into a thriving financial district. The master plan established a clear
urban framework of streets, public squares, and green space. SOM worked with
local artists and landscape architects to create memorable and functional gardens,
plazas, fountains, shopping arcades, and waterfront promenades. It also enhanced

peak time in each direction. It will trigger high agglomeration economies between
the two densest and fastest-growing economic cores of London. Travel time to
Paddington will be cut by from 33 to 17 minutes; travel time to Heathrow will fall
from 55–90 to 39 minutes.
    The 250-meter-long station being built for £500 million is surrounded by the
water of the West India Quay dock. Designing a station to be built 18 meters be-
low water level presented significant design challenges but resulted in optimum
access to and through the Canary Wharf Estate while retaining a navigable channel
for boats within the dock. The station and proposed retail and park areas will be
seven floors high. Retail areas are planned for three of the seven floors, along with
a landscaped garden, restaurant, and community facility on the top floor.
    The development includes a timber lattice roof and rooftop garden level that
sit above the three-story retail development (photo 7.7). It lets in light and rain for
natural irrigation. Sustainably sourced beams provide a warm, natural counter-
point to the glass and steel towers of Canary Wharf.
    The decision to expand Canary Wharf eastward allowed the developer to build up
to 3,610 new homes, 1.9 million square meters of office space, 35,000 square meters
of retail floor space, a community center, and a network of public squares, with a public
space of 3.6 hectares in the first stage. The new office space will be designed to ac-
commodate the technology media and telecommunications sector, as well as financial
and professional services firms. The new station acts as a bridge between two com-
munities, Canary Wharf Estate and Poplar, to the north. The extension will offer high
street retail units to complement Canary Wharf’s existing retail offer. It will also include
affordable housing, substantial new green parks and dockside walks, a library, a large
surgery, a school for 420 children, a community sports hall and community spaces.

                                         Locations
                                         London generates approximately 22 percent of Britain’s GDP (City of London Cor-
                                         poration 2011). It shifted to a mostly service-based economy earlier than other
                                         European cities. Currently, more than 85 percent of the employed population (3.2
                                         million) of Greater London works in service industries.
                                             London’s economic advantage lies in its extremely dense employment clusters.
                                         Its highest-value economic activity occurs in agglomerations of banking, insur-
                                         ance, financial, professional and business services, and creative industries. For
                                         businesses in these sectors, proximity to each other creates more opportunities for
                                         specialization in client and labor markets as well as increased potential for knowl-
                                         edge-sharing. Such agglomeration makes London significantly more productive
                                         than the United Kingdom as a whole.
                                             In an advanced service economy, such as London, local job densities and acces-
                                         sibility to jobs are key components of market potential value. The more accessible

a place is, the more it concentrates jobs. Employment has been declining signifi-
cantly in Outer London, while increasing in Inner London and its densest areas. In
contrast, in the City of London, density increased 30 percent in 10 years. Extremely
high job density can be achieved only with an extensive network of transport con-
nections and a high density of transport hubs in the center (photo 7.8).
    Two-thirds of Greater London’s GDP is produced on 20 percent of its land area
(Inner London). Fifty-six percent of all private sector jobs in Greater London are
located in Inner London.5 Most of Inner London’s economic activity is concen-
trated in 10 percent of its area, in Central London. Central London concentrates
1.5 million jobs, 30 percent of Greater London’s employment, in about 30 square
kilometers, or 2 percent of London land space (map 7.5 and Figure 7.1).6
    A report by Colin Buchanan and Partners analyzes the impact of the number of
people accessible within 45 minutes on employment densities in specific London
locations (GLA 2004). It concludes that as accessibility increases, employment den-
sity can increase. Employment density by borough in London is correlated with the
number of people that can access the borough in 45 minutes by transit. Firms lo-
cate where they can access a large number of people and other firms; people lo-
cate where they can access a large number of jobs opportunities.
    Within the spike of wealth and economic might of Central London—the highest
in Europe—the City of London stands out. In a 3 square kilometer area that repre-
sents just 0.2 percent of Greater London, the City generated £45 billion in

Office density and rent in London
London office market is complex and made of highly specialized established and
emerging subcenters. Five major business districts (the City, Westminster, Canary

                                              London office prices are strongly correlated with transit access to jobs, transit
                                           access to people, and the historical quality of the urban fabric (measured by the
                                           proportion of buildings placed on the Statutory List of Buildings of Special Archi-
                                           tectural or Historic Interest) (Smith 2012). Accessibility variables are the most influ-
                                           ential. Prices are higher in West London than elsewhere because of it connectivity
                                           (particularly to Heathrow Airport) and prestige, which stem from its impressive ur-
                                           ban realm and high-quality historic architecture.

   High prices in the West End are also linked to urban development dynamics.
Urban development in London between 2000–10 experienced massive intensifica-
tion, with the construction of 8 million square meters of new office space, leading
to a total of 26.4 million square meters of office space in 2010. Development was
restricted in the West End for policy and heritage reasons. Rapid expansion in the
City of London and Canary Wharf initially led to a softening of prices (Smith 2012).

                                             The different office markets follow different patterns of firms clustering and
                                         specialization. Higher rents in the West End than in the City and Canary Wharf have
                                         not led to businesses migration. Firms in the City are highly specialized in finance,
                                         with linkages between banks, insurance, management consultancy, accounting,
                                         legal services, and fund asset management. Firms in the West End are more diver-
                                         sified, with creative industry clusters. The London office market is thus made of
                                         submarkets with very high local specialization (Smith 2012). Development trends
                                         reinforce patterns of firm clustering. The division between east and west is grow-
                                         ing, with development having different effects on prices (map 7.9).

                                         Differential effects of Crossrail on market potential
                                         Real estate prices around station areas will not benefit equally from the increase in
                                         connectivity.7 The complex spatial structure of London real estate markets explains
                                         the different market potential values along the Crossrail line. In addition to the
                                         dynamic interplay of node and place value enhancements, markets have their own
                                         logic (demand and supply, market vibrancy) that must be taken into account in
                                         devising transit-oriented development (TOD) spatial strategies. This section ana-
                                         lyzes both the overall effect of Crossrail and the differentiated effects on market
                                         potential along the line.
                                             Crossrail will bring an additional 1.5 million people within a 45-minute commut-
                                         ing distance of London’s key business districts (the West End, the City, and Canary
                                         Wharf) (map 7.10). It will create direct connections to Heathrow Airport for Central
                                         and East London and increase the interchange roles of Farringdon and Stratford.
                                         It will decrease travel times between Canary Wharf and the City, strengthening the
                                         role of Liverpool Station as a major interchange connecting seven railway lines with
                                         trains to Southend and Standsted. Crossrail will also link new emerging centers in
                                         Inner London to the major established centers. It will enable the regeneration of
                                         areas around stations along its route by increasing accessibility with shorter travel

times and giving employers located along the route better access to a larger, more
highly skilled labor market. It will likely attract new private sector development and
increase employment densities near Crossrail stations. More than 100,000 addi-
tional jobs could be created across the Thames Gateway, with Crossrail directly
serving Custom House, Woolwich, and Abbey Wood and improving connections
to other networks in the area (Crossrail 2011).
   A property impact study covering the period 2012–21 reached the following
conclusions (Crossrail and GVA 2012):

• Crossrail is already having an impact on investment decisions. At many loca-
  tions it will be influential in supporting and accelerating new development.
• Crossrail could help create additional residential and commercial value of as
  much as £5.5 billion along the route between 2012 and 2021.
• Crossrail will support the delivery of more than 57,000 new homes and 3.2 mil-
  lion square meters of commercial office space that have been identified for
  development within 1 kilometer of stations along the route.
• Commercial office values around Crossrail stations in Central London will in-
  crease as a result of Crossrail over the next decade, with an increase of 10
  percent above a rising baseline projection. Residential capital values immedi-
  ately around stations in Central London will rise by about 25 percent, and val-
  ues in the suburbs will rise 20 percent above the rising baseline projection in
  the period.
• Urban realm improvements and the development of new schemes above
  Crossrail stations will act as a highly visible and beneficial driver for further de-
  velopment activity; the intensification of use; and in several areas, such as Far-
  ringdon, significant change.

                                              Crossrail will have a transformative effect on the property market and develop-
                                          ment activity over time. This overall increase will not be evenly distributed.
                                              Along the length of the entire line, from Maidenhead to Shenfield, prices within
                                          a short walk of stations rose only 5 percent more than the local market between
                                          2008 and 2014, gaining 43 percent on average. Some areas saw prices soar, how-
                                          ever. In Central London, Farringdon and Paddington outperformed the local mar-
                                          ket by about 24 percent. Average prices within a 10-minute walk of stations in
                                          Central London rose 57 percent, according to analysis by the London estate firm
                                          Knight Frank, while prices close to the Bond Street Station rose 82 percent, the
                                          largest increase along the route (Knight Frank 2015).
                                              The most significant improvements can be expected to occur where large
                                          changes in connectivity coincide with major development opportunities.
                                          Within Central London, heritage constraints will limit the development re-
                                          sponse to increased transport capacity in the West End. In the City a more
                                          liberal planning regime should allow densification where connectivity is
                                          improved.
                                              Crossrail and Thameslink will create a new and highly significant transport inter-
                                          change at Farringdon, where increased connectivity will vastly enhance develop-
                                          ment and job potential (CB Richard Ellis 2009). The impact of transport change will
                                          be most dramatic in fringe locations, where opportunities for development are
                                          plentiful. In markets such as the Isle of Dogs, Stratford, and Paddington, transport
                                          will play a leading role in the transformation of property markets. The stations along
                                          the Crossrail route where property prices have outperformed the market are the
                                          ones located in Central London where both jobs and connectivity are highly con-
                                          centrated (map 7.11).
                                              The greatest changes to the property market are expected to be in East

                                          with Crossrail as key driver. It will provide direct access to Heathrow and West
                                          London for the first time, as well as improved access to Central London. The

increasing importance of London City Airport will also be a stimulus. Crossrail
will also play a key role at Stratford, where it will create a direct link to the City
and the West End (HS 1 has already put Stratford on the international rail
network).
   The Paddington office market could also double in size by 2020. Skylines could
be reshaped at King’s Cross, Euston, Victoria, and Southbank, as developers seek
to capitalize on the existing quality of transport connections and improvement to
existing networks.

Building a typology of nodes along Crossrail
According to GVA, Crossrail will reinforce the central spikes of high node and
market potential values, a phenomenon that occurred in Seoul in 1998 after com-
pletion of the second phase of its subway. Given the strength of existing Central
London office groupings, Crossrail is unlikely to create new markets or major loca-
tions of new demand in its own right, but it will be instrumental in reinforcing and
strengthening office clusters and supporting demand in established locations.
Maintaining values in high value areas can be as important as increasing them in
more modestly priced locations.
    According to CB Richard/Ellis 2009, Crossrail will create new opportunities and
risks for both core and fringe markets (table 7.1). The current transport system fa-
vors core markets within London, because these markets evolved where transport
links were good and transport improvements were made to improve access to
them. Given that these areas are already well endowed with transport links, the
effects of improved transport will be incremental.
    By comparison, fringe locations (where provision of new transport infrastructure
will create an imbalance between a higher node value and a comparatively low
place value) benefit from the transformational effects of new links and increased
capacity. The risk to fringe markets is that increased transport capacity at the core
reinforces agglomeration effects that further strengthens its position relative to the
periphery. These risks are counterbalanced by the possibility of benefiting from the
boost to the profitability of potential developments.

                                                              CB Richard Ellis proposes a typology based on connectivity (node value in-
                                                          crease) and development potential (place and market potential value increase)
                                                          (figure 7.2). The greatest growth potential is where high levels of office develop-
                                                          ment match high increases in connectivity.
                                                              Halfway through the construction process, some neighborhoods are already
                                                          seeing benefits from incoming stations, while others have yet to do so. Although
                                                          Crossrail will spur economic growth mainly by reinforcing the core advanced ser-
                                                          vice economy nodes, such as Canary Wharf, there are development opportunities
                                                          for a variety of communities along the route, provided they adopt the right devel-
                                                          opment strategies.
                                                              Development of less central stations requires careful planning. In particular,
                                                          surface-level transport interchanges must fully integrate different transport modes
                                                          in a seamless way. Cycling and pedestrian access and the approach to the station
                                                          have major impacts on station use and perception, for example. High-quality sta-

                                                          perception and community amenities, and gaining or retaining retailers. In particu-

lar, new streets connecting to stations should be phased in with other developer
initiatives, so that works can be combined. Financing alternatives should be ex-
plored if developer contributions are not phased in in tandem with station works.
    Plans need to allow for flexibility and adaptation to changes in demand. Some
areas will take longer to benefit. The character of some places will change—from
town center to residential, industrial to commercial, quiet to busy, or any number
of shifts. Such transformation calls for a long-term view from all parties involved,
built on a partnership with transit agencies and local authorities to develop high-
quality plans that can deliver social as well as financial returns.
    Crossrail’s experience in fringe stations shows that TOD can achieve even more
in terms of station-area regeneration and its effect on local economies and social
inclusiveness if consideration is given to the nonrail aspects of infrastructure pro-
grams from the outset. A recommendation is to build or increase skills and em-
ployment services, especially in areas where connectivity is opening new opportu-
nities for job creation.
    Crossrail has prepared integrated designs for 12 major property developments
over and around its key Central London stations (Crossrail 2015a). Development
plans cover more than 280,000 square meters of high-quality office, retail and resi-
dential space. The receipts from property developments are targeted to generate
income of approximately £500 million as part of the core Crossrail funding strat-
egy. Crossrail and its partners have gained planning consent for the majority of the
schemes; the last few planning applications have been submitted.



Benefit to Cost Ratio and Economic Benefits of Crossrail

Beneﬁt to Cost Ratio
The conventional economic appraisal of a transport project focuses on factors such
as travel time savings and travel quality benefits, assessing them against the total
cost of the project. Such appraisals have long been used to assess the relative at-
tractiveness of different transport projects by assigning monetary values to bene-
fits and costs for Crossrail. This analysis yields a benefit to cost ratio of 2.59 based
on a U.K. value of time and ratio of 3.64 using a London specific value of time
(table 7.2). The project thus generates substantial net transport economic benefits.
More than 40 percent of these benefits are associated with the increase in the
capacity of London’s congested transport network to meet the existing and future
transport needs of London (Crossrail 2011).


Wider Economic Beneﬁts
The conventional appraisal methodology considers only the direct transport ben-
efits and costs. But a major project such as Crossrail will generate economic ben-
efits that are not included in a standard benefit-cost calculation. The Department
for Transport identifies four components of these wider economic benefits: move
to more productive jobs, pure agglomeration, increase in labor force participation,
and impacts on imperfect competition.

                                               Crossrail will have a substantial effect on the U.K. economy. According to Ian
                                           Lindsay, Land and Property Director, at the peak of construction, Crossrail will di-
                                           rectly employ about 10,000 people. Supply chain benefits in the United Kingdom
                                           are projected to be three times higher than actual investments. More than 1,000
                                           contracts have already been put out to bid, and 90 percent of the budget is being
                                           spent in the United Kingdom. Crossrail is aiming to leave a skills legacy by rein-
                                           vigorating tunneling and underground construction skills in the United Kingdom
                                           (Lindsay 2012).
                                               Crossrail supports a transport system that is an engine for economic growth.
                                           Improved public transit is one of the major prerequisites for attracting more jobs
                                           and residents, delivering and facilitating the growth forecast in The London Plan
                                           2016 (City of London 2016). More than 35 percent of future employment growth
                                           in London is expected to be located in areas well served by Crossrail services (the
                                           West End, the City, and Canary Wharf). Like Hudson Yards in New York (see chapter
                                           5), Crossrail is a central component of a strategic planning policy aiming at rein-
                                           forcing the existing high concentration of jobs in the core city to reap the highest
                                           possible agglomeration economies.

                                             advanced services in London.
                                           2 Public transit include bus, coach, metro, tram, train, and river bus trips.
                                           3 Railways first arrived in London in 1836. Most initial developments were intercity. The

    London, resulting in a ring of disconnected stations; the ban stimulated a market for
    interconnections and development of the underground (Levinson, Giacomin, and Bad-
    sey-Ellis 2016). Both surface rail and underground networks expanded together, produc-
    ing both competition and synergy between the two modes. Transportation develop-
    ment played a significant role in suburban expansion, with railway companies forming
    business relationships with property developers, in some cases acting as property devel-
    opers themselves.

5   Although it is the richest area in Europe, Inner London is not uniformly rich: There is a
    strong divide between West and East. Inner London West produces twice the gross
    value added of Inner London East on less than one-third its area. Inner London West has
    GDP per capita 3.6 times higher than Inner London East. This division between East and
    West is growing, as reflected in the price of office space.
6   Greater London covers 1,572 square kilometers and has a population of 8.2 million
    people; Inner London covers 319 square kilometers and has a population of 3.2 million
    people; Central London (based on London Plan) covers 30 square kilometers; the City
    of London covers 2.9 square kilometers and has a population of 8,000, reflecting its role
    primarily as an economic center. Population data are based on the 2011 census.

Integrating the Space Economy with
Transit-Oriented Development:
Increasing Economic Efficiency and
Social Inclusiveness in Zhengzhou


This case study widens the geographical scope of the 3V Framework to the scale
of a large city (Zhengzhou).1 It analyses the impact of the first six planned subway
lines (map 8.1), examining development potential of 21 stations along the city’s
Line 3 in detail. It shows how the 3V Framework can help develop a long-term vi-
sion for the most efficient shape of densities (people, job, and economic) to in-
crease economic growth and productivity while decoupling economic growth from
infrastructure costs and energy use. It highlights how to devise local strategies for
urban development around specific transit nodes, taking into account their node,
place, and market potential values. It also shows how the approach to transit-ori-
ented development (TOD) used in highly efficient cities can be applied in rapidly
growing cities, particularly in China.
    This chapter makes recommendations at three levels:

• At the metropolitan level, it recommends integrating Zhengzhou’s space econ-
  omy and labor market with transit, in order to foster economic growth through
  agglomeration and increase productivity, competitiveness, and inclusiveness.
• At the network level, it recommends increasing accessibility by matching eco-
  nomic and people densities with the most accessible and central parts of the
  subway network.
• At the local level, it recommends increasing place and market potential values
  in order to reap the benefits of land value capture finance.

        Importance of Zhengzhou

        Zhengzhou is the provincial capital of Henan Province in central China. The city—one
        of the eight great ancient capitals of China—lies on the southern bank of the Yellow
        River. As a prefecture-level city, it serves as the political, economic, technological, and
        educational center of this large province (home to more than 94 million people).
            Zhengzhou is a major transportation hub, located at the intersection of the Longhai
        Railway and the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway. The high-speed railway network provides
        service from the city to Beijing, Nanjing, Xi’an, Wuhan, and Shanghai. The new high-
        speed railway station (the Zhengzhou Dong Station) is one of the largest in Asia. Be-
        cause of its strategic location, Zhengzhou is increasingly attracting domestic and inter-
        national investment as well as migrants, transforming the city into one of China’s large
        economic centers (EIU 2012). GDP per capita of Zhengzhou was Y77,217 in 2015.
            Zhengzhou has a population of 9.6 million inhabitants and an area of 7,446
        square kilometers. Its urban population of 6.4 million live on 1,010 square kilome-
        ters, including a built-up area of 438 square kilometers, according to the municipal
        government. It is the second-largest city in central China, after Wuhan.



        Metropolitan-Level Transit-Oriented Development in
        Zhengzhou

        The National Development and Reform Commission approved the plans for
        Zhengzhou Metro Lines 1 and 2 in February 2009. This rapid transit rail network
        will serve both the urban and suburban districts of Zhengzhou. The subway

extension will increase the productivity, livability, and attractiveness of the city for
businesses and investors.
    To transform connectivity and accessibility enhancements into increases in
GDP, it is essential to coordinate the intensity of land use around transit stations
and economic plans (UN-Habitat 2015). Cross-country experience suggests that
the intensity of land use should not be evenly distributed across the city but should
peak where transit accessibility to jobs is greatest. Firms locate where they can
increase their productivity through agglomeration and localization effects. Zoning
policies should allow for and promote densification of the most accessible areas.
    Shaping densities (people and jobs) based on transit accessibility and connecting
people to jobs in a seamless, integrated way though many modes (planes, high-speed
rail, regional trains, subways, buses) and across many geographical scales is essential
to boost economic development, make most efficient use of resources, and minimize
infrastructure cost. Seamless integration of scales and modes should be ensured at
efficient and compact interchange hubs, which provide good opportunities for urban
development if neighborhoods are permeable, pedestrian oriented, and vibrant.

                                          considered a valuable asset in global cities, because concentrated areas with high

The projected scattering of people and jobs across a vast territory may reduce the
city’s strong agglomeration effects.
    Current planning does not foster a concentration of economic and residential
densities around the most central parts of the subway network (map 8.4). Indeed,
the city’s decentralization policies are projected to reduce densities in the most
central and accessible places within the city core while relocating people and ac-
tivities to peripheral zones that are less accessible—the opposite approach from
that of New York and London. Such transformation would lead to a less efficient
form of land use and transit integration.
    This evolution would be accompanied by increasing imbalances in the jobs to
residents ratio, with an increase in large mono-functional industrial zones in periph-
eral locations with weak connections to subway lines. As a result, Zhengzhou’s
competitiveness and attractiveness for businesses would decline and travel times
increase. Labor markets may become fragmented, reducing agglomeration econ-
omies and global welfare.
    Instead, learning from the previous case studies, planning could match intensity
of development across Zhengzhou with accessibility to people, jobs, and com-
mercial space within 30 minutes by public transit, reinforcing already dense and
accessible areas (which have higher potential for growth) rather than dispersing
development with decentralization policies and new towns. It would require ad-
justing plans to allow better matching of increases in human densities with the
increase in the number of accessible jobs delivered by the investment in new
subway lines. Increases in connectivity and accessibility would lead to real estate
growth and land values increases that could be partly captured by the public sec-
tor to pay for public investment and foster further local development. A new zon-
ing system that differentiates floor area ratios (FARs) and land uses based on transit
accessibility would allow Zhengzhou to develop a strategic TOD plan integrating

                                               economic, transportation, and land use planning.2 A match between jobs and
                                               transit would allow for a stronger integrated approach to spatial planning.
                                                   Residential and job densities in Zhengzhou are currently similar to those in
                                               competitive global cities such as Paris, London, and New York. Population density
                                               is high in central areas and low at the periphery (figure 8.2 and map 8.5), following
                                               an inverse power law of exponent –0.945 (see appendix A).

    The projected distribution of residential densities reveals a progressive in-
crease, but large dense areas remain with little access to the subway network (map
8.5). Residential density is highly concentrated in 2009 (inverse power law expo-
nent of –0.92). It is projected to become more smoothly distributed beginning in
2020 (inverse power law exponent of –0.66)—a development that reduced urban
efficiency (figure 8.3).
    Residential density within a 500-meter radius of subway stations reveals a
strong imbalance between the western and eastern parts of the city (map 8.6). This
imbalance will structure value, with a cluster of high residential density stations
within the western part of the loop line.

                                                         GDP per capita and the employment rate are highest in four peripheral districts
                                                      (map 8.7). This pattern reflects zoning that concentrates employees and industrial
                                                      zones in districts with few residents.

                                                      strates strong agglomeration economy effects (figure 8.4). They may be
                                                      jeopardized by the spreading out of jobs across a vast territory (map 8.8). The
                                                      analysis reveals a drop in the concentration of jobs under the impact of de-
                                                      centralization policies (figure 8.5), with the exponent of the power law falling

Densities increase over time, but the imbalance remains. Jobs are decentralized,
not clustered around subway stations. The projected decrease in density in the
most connected part of the city will reduce market potential value in the urban

Impact of Transit-Oriented Development on Improved
Job Accessibility in Zhengzhou
Li and others (2016) examined the average percentage of jobs accessible from
each location within 45 minutes’ travel time by public transit, walking, and biking
weighted by the population for different land use and transport investments.3
They showed that a significant increase in average job accessibility can be
achieved when two complementary policies are combined: (a) a multimodal tran-
sit system that includes a well-developed subway network, supplemented by

                                       percent (panel c). Also ensuring good bike access to the stations (through im-
                                       proved bike lanes and secured parking facilities, for example) increases the share
                                       to 46 percent (panel d).



                                       Node Value along Line 3

                                       Node value is the value a station acquires through its location in the network. Dif-
                                       ferent network organizations create different distributions of node values. The
                                       shape of transit and infrastructure networks strongly affects agglomeration and the
                                       potential for land value capture. Increases in connectivity and accessibility increase
                                       the growth potential and the market potential value of urban places.

    Line 3 has 21 stations, crossing some of the densest parts of Zhengzhou in the central
northwest quadrant of the city and linking them to the east of Zhengzhou (map 8.14).
    Centralities in subway networks play an important role in structuring node values.
The northern part of the loop line, Line 5 (in red in map 8.15), and the major inter-
changes between lines stand out in terms of betweenness centrality (many different
routes pass through the station). As in global cities (Tokyo, London) or large Chinese
cities (Shanghai), the loop line in Zhengzhou has high betweenness centrality, linking
the core and the spokes. Stations with high betweenness centrality capture large
flows of passengers and thus have high market development potential. Centrality

        analysis is based on the network including six lines by 2020. The central part of Line
        3 (in pink in map 8.15) has good closeness centrality (stations are close to other sta-
        tions in the network) but weak betweenness centrality, except when it crosses Line 5.
            Closeness centrality does not display a steep gradient (figure 8.6). Its values do
        not decrease according to an inverse power law but linearly. In contrast, the distri-
        bution of betweenness centrality follows an inverse power law (with an exponent
        of –0.72 in Zhengzhou), both for the entire system and for Line 3 (figure 8.7).

The Node Value Index
The node value index is created from three subindexes based on daily ridership,
centrality, and intermodal diversity.

• Daily ridership (in 2021 and 2028) is the current and projected traffic of each
  station.
• Centrality describes the accessibility of each station within the network and the
  number of routes passing through it. It is measured as a composite index of
  three types of centralities explained in Chapter 2, calculated at the scale of the
  entire network.
• Intermodal diversity describes the number of other transit modes at walking
  distance from the station.

  Each metric was normalized in a subindex (with 1 as the highest value). The
composite index is the mean of the three subindexes.

Subindex 1: Daily ridership
Data on ridership were extracted from a study of projected inbound traffic at sta-
tions in 2021 and 2028 for Line 3. Ridership is highest at strong, central attractive
destinations, such as Er Qi Guang Chang and Dong Da Jie, and at interchange
stations, notably stations that connect to loop Line 5, which have high between-
ness centrality (figure 8.8).4

Subindex 3: Intermodal diversity
Intermodal diversity captures the number of complementary modes (bus and bus
rapid transit routes) that are within walking distance from a station. Figure 8.15
shows higher intermodality at the city center than at the periphery.

  tion. In contrast, a “flat” network—one that has no major hubs and no dense
  concentration of lines in a core—does not offer strong opportunities for captur-
  ing high land values around stations.
• Interlinking neighboring stations into clusters. An important property that en-
  hances the connectivity of networks and the value of their nodes is clustering
  (establishing dense links between neighboring stations). This density of links
  creates many triangles between neighboring stations and tightly connects the
  network, offering passengers varied possibilities of interchange.
• Increasing accessibility within the network. Highly successful subway extensions
  (such as the addition of four lines in Seoul) cluster a large number of highly ac-
  cessible stations in the network core, which concentrates density and economic
  activity.


Coordinating Node Values with the Intensity of Land Use
The projected decentralization of people and jobs is likely to reduce the match
between the centrality of subway stations and residential and job densities in station
catchment areas. To reap the opportunities created by the network extension, plan-
ners could coordinate the intensity of land use and economic policies in three ways:

• Encourage development at major interchanges (highest degree centralities), at the
  most accessible stations of the network (highest closeness centrality), and at sta-
  tions that are major articulations of the network (highest betweenness centrality).
• Moderate development in areas that are less accessible within the network.
• Discourage development in areas that are more than 1 kilometer from a subway
  station.

   Zoning policies can be fine-tuned to coordinate transit infrastructure provision
and land use development. FARs are an effective way to achieve optimal land
use intensity. They should be set at different levels depending on uses and ac-
cessibility. Seoul set FARs as high as 10 for commercial uses around the most
connected and central transit stations, at 2–4 for mixed residential and business
areas, and at 1–2 for residential uses. Uses are defined with fine granularity, de-
pending on proximity to and importance of transit stations (see box 1.8). FARs
should include flexibility for transferring them between uses based on market
changes, allowing the private sector to adjust the intensity of development to
market needs.



Place and Market Potential Value along Line 3

Zhengzhou’s planning is based on superblocks. Arterials over many subway routes
are 60 meters wide; some are as wide as 100 meters (with additional setbacks).
Street intersection densities (the number of intersections per square kilometer)
around subway stations are low in new areas, as in most Chinese cities. Most su-
perblock areas have fewer than 10 intersections per square kilometers—a fraction
of the 80–100 recommended by UN-Habitat (2013). Street intersection density
202 O                                                          Transforming the Urban Space



        reflects important properties of local accessibility to stations, the permeability and
        openness of the neighborhood, and the quality of the urban and social fabric. It is
        highly correlated with block size. Street lengths in Line 3 station areas are also well
        below the 18 kilometers of streets per square kilometer UN-Habitat
        recommends.
            Place value for residents derives from vibrant, sustainable communities where
        they can access jobs, shopping, and services on foot or bicycle and enjoy a range
        of benefits, such as reduced transportation costs; easier access to amenities, in-
        cluding high-quality education; and improved public health. Like node value, it is
        unevenly distributed. In a typical city, many station areas are mainly residential, and
        a few are more job-oriented and mixed-use.
            Walkability also differs across areas. It depends on street patterns and the
        design of streets as places for people. Street patterns determine not only
        whether residents and workers can access rail and bus transit but also whether
        they can access shopping, jobs, and services in their neighborhood. Street pat-
        terns with small blocks (about 100 meters per side) and high connectivity (no
        cul-de-sacs) enhance local accessibility. Superblocks and gating decrease
        accessibility.


        Place Value along Line 3
        The place value index is built from two subindexes: street intersection density and
        the diversity of land use. Diversity of land use is a measure of mixed use in the area
        surrounding the station. Each subindex was normalized (with 1 as the highest
        value). The composite index is the mean of the two subindexes.
            The subindex of intersection density reveals low intersection densities almost
        everywhere along the line except in the city center, with a peak in the historical part
        of Shun Cheng Jie. Intersection densities are below 10 almost everywhere and as
        low as 6 in Dong Feng Lu and Hang Hai Dong Lu. The peak is 50, at Chung Cheng
        Jie, followed by 40 at Er Qi Guan Chang, but even these densities are low com-
        pared with the 80–100 recommended by UN-Habitat (2013)
            Diversity was estimated within a 1-kilometer area of each station (map 8.16)
        using a color analysis method applied to the regulatory plan color codes (see
        Shannon entropy in appendix B). Weak values capture large-scale mono-functional
        residential developments or warehouses in the eastern part of Zhengzhou; they
        have low street intersection densities. High values characterize more vibrant neigh-
        borhoods in the central part of the city. The western part of the city is more diversi-
        fied than the newly developed eastern part, which is strictly zoned. As the diversity
        calculation is based on the regulatory plan, it tends to reflect expected future di-
        versity rather than current use.
            The interplay of land use and intersection densities and their discrepancies
        could guide public policies. Increasing land use diversity in the east should be ac-
        companied by increasing street density and local connectivity.
            The aggregated place value index maintains the pattern of higher place value
        in the historic central parts of the city, although the effect is dampened by planned
        land use (figure 8.19).

        Recommendations for Increasing Place Value
        Mixed-use development promotes a variety of compatible land uses and functions
        and provides a mix of residential, commercial, and community infrastructure in neigh-
        borhoods while reducing the demand for commuter travel. Transforming superblocks
        into communities with a better mix of uses, ensuring a wider ranging of building types
        and sizes, creating a finer mesh of streets with better connectivity, and building a
        better-defined and more vibrant public realm would increase place value in
        Zhengzhou.


        Market Potential Value along Line 3
        The market potential value index in this study is built from three subindexes that reflect
        the demand side of market potential value: human density, the job to resident ratio,
        and growth potential:

        • Human density (the number of residents and jobs per square kilometer) is an indica-
          tion of how economic potential and concentration of interaction and activity vary
          along the line.
        • The jobs to residents ratio provides an indication of the level of economic mono-
          functionality of the station environment.6
        • Growth potential is the rate of growth of human density between 2009 and 2030.
          It is a proxy for market growth and market opportunities.7

           Each metric was normalized in a subindex (with 1 as the highest value). The com-
        posite index is the mean of the subindexes.
           Human density around transit nodes in 2009 reveals a pattern of concentration
        within the centerwest quadrant (map 8.17). The subindex peaks at Shun Cheng Jie and
        Dong Da Jie (figure 8.20).

           around stations should be raised. Residential FARs could be raised, albeit at
           lower than commercial FARs.
        3. Increase the diversity of land parcel sizes to create a vibrant land market. Diver-
           sity of land parcel sizes can meet future demand and create an adaptive city.
           Urban development in China is based on 400 square meter superblocks, the
           current unit of land sales to developers. This contrasts sharply with the smaller
           unit of land sales found in other large cities outside China (see chapter 4).
           Smaller block size fosters an active land market with potential for mixed use.



        Interplay of Node, Place, and Market Potential Values

        By improving accessibility, improving the node value of a location creates condi-
        tions favorable to the further development of the location. Because of growing
        demand for transport, an increase in place value creates conditions favorable to
        the further development of the transport system.

of the station surroundings are based on superblocks with low intersection density,
leading to reduced accessibility to stations.) Er Qi Guang Chang stands out as a
place of high value and high potential in terms of node value, connectivity, and
diversity. Zhong Zhou Da Dao, Huang He Lu, and Dong Da Jie Da Jie stand out in
terms of node value; their medium place value should be enhanced.
    Figure 8.26 reveals strong imbalances between market potential and node val-
ues. Er Qi Guang Chang stands out in terms of both values. Most market potential
value is moderate, with little alignment with node value. Stations with higher node
values have lower market potential values than stations with lower node value on
the periphery of the network. This pattern is the likely result of decentralization
policies that do not align land use intensity and transport and may not let the
market shape the distribution of densities based on accessibility. Growth should
occur as a priority in more connected stations (below the 45-degree line) rather
than in less connected stations (above the 45-degree line) requiring planners to
think about alternative spatial scenarios of growth.
    The relationship between market potential and place value shows the same type
of imbalance (figure 8.27). Er Qi Guang Chang and Shun Cheng Jie stand out in

        terms of place value but remain below their potential in terms of market potential
        value, because planning does not incentivize development around these stations.



        Recommendations

        A functional and cost-effective transit infrastructure—one that gets commuters to and
        from work efficiently—is a fundamental prerequisite of a thriving business environment
        in a large city. Another is a set of economic and housing policies that match transit
        accessibility, jobs, and housing and clusters companies in places accessible by large
        numbers of people, in order to broaden the choice of affordable housing locations.
            The 3V Framework helps planners meet these two prerequisites by allowing
        them to prioritize investments and adjust policies and regulatory planning in order
        to intensify development around the highest potential stations and to define strat-
        egies in diverse economic and urban contexts. TOD can unlock a new wave of
        urban productivity in Zhengzhou if land use policies that encourage higher densi-
        ties of jobs and people in areas with good transit accessibility are put in place. This
Case Study: Zhengzhou                                                                   O 213



integrated planning approach would involve a shift to more compact, connected,
and coordinated urban growth, with land development intensities aligned with
transit networks accessibility.


Creating Transit-Oriented Districts Near the Center
The urban core is the most efficient place for concentrating jobs; doing so fosters
agglomeration and localization economies. Dispersing economic growth to the
periphery creates inefficiencies, because networks cost more per capita at the
periphery and economic output per capita and per serviced land decreases when
development occurs far away from the urban core (Salat 2016).
   Fostering growth at the center requires appropriate regulations for block size,
FARs, and coverage ratios. TOD zoning at the Zhengzhou master plan level could
establish a minimum density for jobs and housing for the station catchment area.
The regulatory plan could support the redesign of TOD communities by:

• creating a more walkable street network, with denser and more connected
  street patterns (80–100 intersections per square kilometer), narrower streets,
  reduced or eliminated setbacks, and streetscapes designed for people
• establishing urban design standards at the small block rather than the super-
  block level
• fostering mixed-use districts that are walkable and bikable, with transit-oriented
  street and circulation systems and high densities of population and jobs. Within
  these districts, areas close to major transit stations would have higher densities
  and land-use standards, allowing the municipality to capture some of the value
  of the investment in transit infrastructure.


Adopting Different Strategies for Different Types of
Stations
The 3V Framework allows policy makers to assess the development potential of
station areas in a proactive and dynamic way. All nodes in a network are not equal.
Node and place values are unevenly distributed across Zhengzhou and along Line
3. Some stations, such as Er Qi Guang Chang, score high in node and place value.
International experience suggests that such stations could play a major role in
fostering economic and job concentration and commercial real estate
development.
    The imbalances between values create development opportunities. At many
stations, the supply of new infrastructure is stronger than the activity of land use;
there is potential to enhance place value to derive market value from the current
oversupply of connecting infrastructure. At other stations, greater connectivity will
encourage economic activity and increase market potential value.
    The 3V analysis identifies which type of development is more appropriate in a
station area and which stations have the highest development and value capture
potential. It helps define station types based on node, place, and market potential
values. Zhengzhou’s policy makers can use the framework to (a) build a typology
of stations that classifies them into subgroups for applying different development
214 O                                                                   Transforming the Urban Space



        strategies and (b) identify the imbalances between connectivity, accessibility, place
        quality, and market potential values at stations. Identification of such imbalances
        enables the relevant land, economic development, and transport agencies to de-
        velop multiagency solutions.


        Capturing Value
        Increases in connectivity and accessibility will increase land value in subway catch-
        ment areas. This value can be captured to create a positive feedback loop for fi-
        nancing infrastructure, enhancing the public realm, and building inclusionary hous-
        ing (see chapter 3).



        Notes

        1 This chapter is based on projections made as part of the traffic modeling for Line 3 of
          the Zhengzhou subway (for which the World Bank provides part of the financing); the
          Zhengzhou master plan; detailed control plans with land use, floor area, coverage ratios,
          3D renderings of the urban fabric, technical specifications of station designs; population
          and jobs data by census tracts and within the polygons of the traffic study and forecasts
          for 2020 and 2030; and GDP data by subdistrict. It benefitted from discussions with
          Zhengzhou planning bureau and transportation bureau and from field visits to each of
          the 21 sites of the planned stations.
        2 The FAR (also known as floor space ratio [FSR], floor space index [FSI]) is the ratio of a
          building’s total floor area (gross floor area) to the size of the piece of land upon which it
          is built.
        3 Calculated as:

                     number of jobs accessible from each location
        - location                                                   population in each location
                                 total jobs in the city
                                                                                                    x 100%
                                              Total Population

        4 Ridership is aligned but not directly correlated with structural properties of the network
          (correlation was tested). It is thus valid to keep the traffic and centralities as separate
          subindexes for buildin he centrality index.
        5 In more complex networks with high-ranking hubs, such as London and Tokyo’s, weight-
          ing could give higher weight to degree centrality.
        6 The maximum value of the subindex is 1. As some places (industrial zones) have more
          than 1 job per resident and others (residential neighborhoods) have far less than 1 job
          per resident, the subindex was normalized between 0 and 1 with a lognormal function
          in order to give values below 1 to mono-functional neighborhoods (either excessively
          job or resident oriented).
        7 This value was normalized between 0 and 1 with a log function calibrated to have 0.5 for
          zero growth, values below 0.5 for decreases in density, and 1 for a 200 percent increase,
          with a cut-off beyond 200 percent.

Conclusions


Cities that effectively integrate transportation and land use reduce traffic conges-
tion, promote business, improve public services, and boost revenues. Such cities
are more livable, economically competitive, and environmentally and socially sus-
tainable than other cities.
    Transit-oriented development (TOD) contributes to shaping urban forms in or-
der to increase access to transit and access to jobs by transit. Managed well, it can
unlock land for affordable housing and more inclusive urban growth by reducing
the burden of transportation costs on poor, low and middle income households.
    Cities that grow efficiently around transit lines—such as Tokyo, Singapore,
Hong Kong SAR, China, London, and New York—are strategically planned with a
long-term vision of the evolution of their spatial structure. This vision factors in
long-term population and economic growth. It is turned into master plans with
15- to 20-year horizons that are reviewed every 5 years. These master plans detail
land use with a high level of granularity, setting variable intensities of development
and allocation of uses at the scale of small urban blocks of about one hectare. They
have built-in flexibility in zoning codes and incentives that allow some variation to
planning and design parameters. Land supply is planned in tandem with market
demand and cycles.
    The 3V Framework helps policy makers integrate transport planning and land
use across different geographical scales, from metropolitan to local. It helps iden-
tify areas of opportunity where the combination of high connectivity and the po-
tential for redevelopment and regeneration of the urban (and in some cases social)
fabric will generate market response from the private sector, initiating a positive
feedback loop of local urban growth and value capture finance. It is applicable not
only to areas with the highest growth potential but also to areas with less potential
but more land opportunities. As the case studies demonstrate, by creating and
capturing higher land values around urban transit stations and corridors, cities can
recoup some of the costs of building, operating, and maintaining mass transit
systems, as well as support TOD in ways that make them more appealing places
to live, work, and do business.                                                          Opposite page:

            The 3V Framework is an instrument for tailoring, with a high granularity, intensi-
        ties of development to different levels of transit accessibility and to different local
        contexts. It acknowledges the wide variations in densities of jobs and residents
        and in accessibility across the urban space. It comprises both a vision of the met-
        ropolitan urban shape that is most efficient for inclusive economic growth and
        actionable differentiated local strategies for specific development around transit
        stations. As such, it is particularly well adapted to contribute to integrated plan-
        ning that articulates a long-term vision and local plans and integrating transporta-
        tion infrastructure investment and land use planning.
            Above all, the 3V Framework is a tool for developing options for rapidly grow-
        ing cities. The World Bank plans to apply it in various contexts, including India and
        Latin America. The Framework is not limited to investments in subway networks; it
        can be applied to other kinds of mass transit networks, such as bus rapid transit.
            Implementing the framework involves a long-term strategic vision and a pro-
        cess of actions and investments. The process should be able to adapt to the dy-
        namic, evolving, and complex nature of cities and be able to continuously update
        the vision, as required by changing conditions and market response.
            This shared vision—and the engagement of multiple stakeholders in its imple-
        mentation—drive spatial, social, and economic transformation. Key to success is
        coordinating across scales and sectors, integrating a multiplicity of actions and
        initiatives that will reinforce one another, implementing the vision with milestones
        and indicators, and being highly granular and contextual.
Appendix A Power Laws in the
Distribution of Urban Values,
Network Centralities, and
Commuting Flows


Network science has discovered that networks (neural networks, natural networks,
transit networks, the Internet) have a strict architecture that is captured by a few
simple mathematical regularities (inverse power laws). These formulas represent a
novel perspective from which to understand the interconnected urban world and
the relationship between transit network layouts and people, jobs, and economic
concentrations.
    Urban values such as the ones used in the 3V Framework are not distributed
evenly or randomly through urban space but according to identifiable mathemati-
cal patterns. The 3V Framework is not just an empirical method; it derives policy
making from the underlying order of urban space and urban connectivity, as de-
scribed below.



Power Laws in the Distribution of Values across Urban
Space

Inverse power laws govern demographic densities in cities.1 Research by the Ur-
ban Morphology and Complex Systems Institute (Salat 2016, 2017) documents the
presence of power laws at the intra-urban scale, where they order the patterns of
most urban values and their distribution across urban space. An inverse power law
distribution does not have a central peak, like the familiar bell curves found in
statistics. It is a continuously decreasing curve, indicating that many small observa-
tions coexist with a few large ones in a highly structured mathematical way that
relates the large, the intermediate, and the small (figure A.1). This relationship
characterizes variables such as density, centrality, connectivity, and accessibility.
   In a city, for example, the density of jobs is high in a few locations, medium in
a moderate number of locations, and low in a large number of locations. The fre-
quency of a component of size x is proportional to the inverse of its size at an ex-
ponent m characteristic of the system. The relative frequency of each type is de-
termined by the mathematics of the rank size distribution: the size of any urban

220 O                                                          Transforming the Urban Space

        component (density, accessibility, connectivity) is related to its rank within the dis-
        tribution. The higher m, the steeper the gradient between the few high values and
        the many low values.
            Inverse power laws are a measure of inequality or hierarchy in systems (Pumain
        2005). They were first introduced in economics by Vilfredo Pareto (1906). The Pa-
        reto distribution is a power law probability distribution that is used to describe
        social, scientific, geophysical, actuarial, and many other types of phenomena. Pa-
        reto originally used it to describe the allocation of wealth in society, where a small
        proportion of the population owns a large portion of wealth. He also used it to
        describe the distribution of income.
            The Pareto distribution can be observed in GDP density across urban space:
        The same spatial distribution of GDP characterizes both London and Zhengzhou,
        despite huge differences in their socioeconomic structures. An inverse power law
        of exponent –0.90 characterizes both, indicating a high level of concentration of
        GDP in a few areas. The distributions of jobs is similar in Paris, London, and New
        York (with exponents of –1.0). In contrast, the exponent is –0.89 in Zhengzhou and
        –0.94 in Shanghai, reflecting decentralizing policies.
            This idea is sometimes expressed more simply as the Pareto principle or the
        80–20 rule, which says that 20 percent of the population controls 80 percent of the
        wealth.2 In terms of urban space, it means that 20 percent of urban land produces
        80 percent of urban GDP. This pattern explains the economic break-up point of
        sprawling: When a city expands at low density, infrastructure costs for servicing the
        land remain high per capita while the contribution to urban GDP becomes negli-
        gible (Salat 2016; Salat, Bourdic, and Kamiya 2017).
            Recent research shows that inverse power laws govern the distribution of de-
        gree and closeness centralities in transit networks; GDP; densities of jobs, people,
        and amenities; energy intensity (energy used per unit of urban land) and productiv-
        ity (gross value added created per unit of energy used); as well as many other ur-

ban characteristics (Salat 2017). The ubiquity of power laws in urban space derives
from power laws in networks. Cities can be described as networks from which loca-
tions emerge.



Power Laws in Network Centralities and Commuting
Flows

This section looks at properties of subway networks and commuting flows that
underlie the clustering of stations based on their node values from a graphs theory
perspective (see Barabasi and Albert 1999 and Barabasi 2005).


Power Laws in the Core-and-Branches Structure of
Subway Networks
Efficient subway layouts in global cities appear to converge toward a similar layout
(Roth and others 2012). The structure of the world’s largest subway networks—in-
cluding Beijing, Shanghai, Tokyo, Seoul, London, Paris, and New York—share simi-
lar generic features despite these cities’ geographical and economic differences.
This shape is made of a core with branches radiating from it. Densely intercon-
nected by crisscrossing lines, the core has a spatial extension of about five kilome-
ters, because it would be too costly to maintain a high density of stations beyond
this radius. Beyond this radius are (lower-density) branches. The density of stations
with distance to the city center sharply decreases and follows an inverse power law
of the form R–1.6, where R stands for radius. For most networks, the average num-
ber of links per station within the core is about 2.5, and at least 60 percent of sta-
tions at the core serve at least two lines. In all the studied subways, the number of
stations grows by a factor of R2 at the core. Beyond the core the density of stations
decreases very quickly with distance from the core, with the number of stations
growing at only R0.5.


Power Laws in the Distribution of Centrality Values
In graph theory and network analysis, indicators of centrality identify the most
important vertices within a system. Applications include identifying the most influ-
ential people in a social network, key infrastructure nodes in the Internet or urban
networks, and superspreaders of disease.3
   Centrality indices are answers to the question “What characterizes an important
vertex?” For mass transit networks, degree centrality, closeness centrality, and
betweenness centrality best capture the centrality of stations.

Degree centrality
Historically first and conceptually simplest is degree centrality, defined as the num-
ber of links at a node. Hubs dominate the structure of all networks in which they
are present. They create short paths between any two nodes in the system.
   In most networks, most nodes have only a few links, and a few big hubs have a
very large number of links. The links connecting the smaller nodes are not sufficient

                                        to ensure that the network is fully connected. It is the large hubs that make net-
                                        works work.
                                            Once the Grand Paris Express is built, the Paris metro will have a few hubs in
                                        the hypercore of the network with many connections, including four stations with
                                        six or more connections (figure A.2). These stations will be located in parts of the
                                        city where one third of jobs are agglomerated. The system will also have a long tail
                                        of single-line stations (degree centrality of 2).

                                        Closeness centrality
                                        The farness of a node x is defined as the sum of its distances from all other nodes;
                                        its closeness is defined as the reciprocal of its farness. The more central a node is,
                                        the shorter its total distance from all other nodes.
                                            Stations in the network core in Paris are closer to other stations than are stations
                                        outside the core (figure A.3). Closeness centrality decreases linearly, not according
                                        to an inverse power law.

                                        Betweenness centrality
                                        Betweenness centrality quantifies the number of times a node acts as a bridge
                                        along the shortest path between two other nodes. It was introduced as a measure
                                        for quantifying the control of one person over communication between other
                                        people in a social network. Vertices that have a high probability of occurring on a
                                        randomly chosen shortest path between two randomly chosen vertices have a
                                        high level of betweenness.

   A subway station with high betweenness centrality has significant influence on
the transfer of passengers through the network (assuming that passengers follow
the shortest paths). These stations areas have high development potential, as
demonstrated by stations along Tokyo’s Yamanote Line.

                                       As in London, New York, and Tokyo, the distribution of betweenness centralities
                                   in Paris follows an inverse power law of exponent –1 (figure A.4), suggesting a
                                   universality class (a collection of mathematical models that share a single scale
                                   invariant limit). Although cities may differ dramatically at small scales, their behav-
                                   ior becomes increasingly similar as the limit scale is approached. In particular, as-
                                   ymptotic phenomena such as critical exponents will be the same for all cities in the
                                   class (notably for the density distribution of jobs and the betweenness centralities
                                   of their subway networks).

                                                       Research by the Urban Morphology and Complex Systems Institute (Salat and
                                                       Bourdic 2015) shows that ridership per station in Paris and London and the structure
                                                       of commuting flows follow the same mathematical distribution. Power laws also
                                                       describe passenger flows and the intensity of commuting routes. Traffic in London’s
                                                       tube stations in 2010 follows an inverse power law of exponent –1, with a concen-

                                                       considered) between home and work in Paris (map A.1) reveals an inverse power
                                                       law of exponent –0.65 (figure A.6).

        Notes

        1 For a discussion of inverse power laws, see Cheshire (1999), Rose and Resnick (1980),
          Xavier (1999), Blank and Solomon (2000), Eeckhout (2005), Soo (2005), Rose (2006), and
          Salat and Bourdic (2011).
        2 Empirical data show that 67 percent of London’s GDP is produced in 20 percent of Lon-
          don’s area. In contrast, 80 percent of Zhengzhou’s GDP is produced in 20 percent of
          Zhengzhou’s area. The difference comes not from the distribution, which is identical, but
          from the size of the cities. The long tail of low values of GDP per square kilometer at the
          urban periphery makes a weak contribution to the GDP. Thus, if the city expands, the
          proportion of its urban land that does not contribute significantly to its GDP will expand
          accordingly and GDP will appear more concentrated in the simplified version of the
          Pareto principle. Only the complete Pareto description, with the exponent of the power
          law, captures the distribution. It reveals striking structural similarities different cities.
        3 Centrality concepts were first developed in social network analysis; many of the terms
          used to measure centrality reflect their sociological origin.

Estimating Node, Place, and Market
Potential Value of Stations


Table B.1 summarizes the key subindexes that can be used to estimate the node,
place, and market potential values of stations. Selection of subindexes, particularly
for market potential value, depends in part on the availability of data. All subin-
dexes are normalized to a 0–1 scale, as shown in the example of Zhengzhou (see
chapter 8).

                                          Example 1 Density of Street Intersections

                                          Connected street patterns with a high density of street intersections promote ac-
                                          cessibility and walkability. UN-Habitat recommends a density of at least 80–100
                                          intersections per square kilometer. A high density of intersections is also a good
                                          proxy for block size. Small block sizes (about 100-meter sides) with vibrant edges
                                          (facades on the perimeter with businesses) promote more compact development
                                          and walkability. The higher the density of intersections, the smaller the blocks are.
                                          This indicator captures block size, the “granularity” of the urban fabric, the diver-
                                          sity of paths around the transit station, and local accessibility. Map B.1 shows ex-

Example 2 Local Pedestrian Accessibility

An isochrone is a curve that shows equal travel times. Isochrones are critical be-
cause how long it takes to get somewhere is more relevant than how far away it is.
Isochrones have been used for more than 130 years in science and transport plan-
ning to understand the relationship between movement and time. Isochrone maps
can include a combination of transport modes or focus on just one mode.
    Walking isochrones map walkable catchments or “pedsheds.” They provide
insight into the permeability of a neighborhood, as well as an understanding of
accessibility to public transport, jobs, and services.
    Map B.2 illustrates how superblocks reduce accessibility around subway sta-
tions in Tianjin, a major port city in northeastern China. The green circle displays
the theoretical maximum accessibility within an 800-meter radius. Because of su-
perblocks, only 50–65 percent of the 800-meter radius area is accessible by foot.
The Liu Yuan Station area has 4.4 kilometers of streets per square kilometer, far
below the minimum length of 18 recommended by UN-Habitat; within an 800-me-
ter radius circle, the average block surface is 103,300 square meters, and the
density of intersections is 7. This density is just 1/11th–1/15th the density recom-
mended by UN-Habitat and international best practice. The Golden Triangle Sta-
tion area, the most accessible and permeable station in Tianjin, has a street density
of 11.2 per square kilometer; within an 800-meter radius circle, the average block
surface is 22,400 square meters and the density of intersections is 48. The Tu
Cheng Station area has a linear density of 5.8 per square kilometers; within an
800-meter radius, the average block surface is 74,250 square meters, and the
density of intersections is 9.
    The subindex measures the percentage of the 800-meter radius area that can
be reached within a 10-minute walk (area in green).

Example 6 Floor Area Ratios

Table B.2 presents the ranges of FARs applied in various cities. Based on those
ratios, the potential for development can be estimated.
    Map B.6 presents FARs along Singapore’s Orchard Road. FARs in Singapore along
Orchard Road, one of Singapore main commercial roads, are set higher (4.2–5.6) close
to subway stations and are zoned for commercial uses (in dark blue) and offices (in vio-
let) on small blocks; 100 meters away from the transit line, FARs are lower (1.4–2.8).
Some blocks in light blue are residential and commercial with FARs of 4.2–5.6.
