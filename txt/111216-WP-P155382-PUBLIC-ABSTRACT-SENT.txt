Retail payment systems play an important role in the smooth functioning of an economy, and inefficiencies
in the retail payments market can have cascading effects that provoke sub-optimal performance throughout
the economy. Such inefficiencies persist, especially in many middle-income and low-income countries, with
cash still being the most widely used payment instrument.

A number of issues are responsible for this situation, and the lack of a coherent, comprehensive strategy for
the development of retail payment systems is among the most significant factors. However, in order to
develop such a strategy, it is important to have a good understanding of the costs associated with different
retail payment instruments. The definition of objectives for the national payments system in general and for
the retail payment system in particular, in terms of the optimal mix of payment instruments and overall retail
payment system efficiency, relies on the availability of high-quality payment-related data. Data on the costs
of payment instruments can prove valuable in developing an implementation plan to achieve the desired
outcomes. Such cost data, however, is rarely available, and the data that is available typically fails to capture
the full costs of payment instruments. As a step toward addressing this gap in information, this document
provides a comprehensive methodology to measure the costs of retail payments for users and suppliers of
payment instruments, as well as the economy as a whole.

The novelty of this retail payments cost methodology is that it provides an overall perspective, laid out in this
practical guide. In the future, this guide may serve as a reference point for interested stakeholders and
countries who aim to perform a retail payment cost analysis. It also ensures a high level of standardization
and comparability of results across countries when using the same methodology to estimate retail payment
costs.

Objective

Retail payment systems play an important role in the smooth functioning of an economy and inefficiencies
in the retail payments market can have cascading effects throughout the economy. While there are a number
of issues that are responsible for the persistence of inefficiencies in retail payment markets, the lack of a
coherent, holistic strategy for the development of retail payment systems is among the most common1. In
order to develop such a strategy, it is important to economically substantiate the migration from less cost-
efficient retail payment instruments (typically cash and paper-based instruments) to more cost-efficient ones
(typically electronic payments). A good understanding of the costs associated with different retail payment
instruments is therefore needed.

Overall, establishing a sound economic baseline for national retail payment systems in terms of costs of
different payment instruments can better guide system development and enable high-impact changes.
Efficiency gains due to the migration to lower-cost retail payment instruments, and more efficient use of
those instruments, could have significant benefits for economic development and growth as the transaction
costs of exchanging goods and services are reduced. Lower costs of retail payments can also fundamentally
boost the reach of electronic payment services to lower income households and further improve the
efficiency of the national payment system as access to modern payment instruments is broadened.

This document is designed to serve as a practical guide for central banks and other public or private-sector
stakeholders interested in conducting a study on the costs of day-to-day retail payments in their economies.
In order to achieve this objective, this guide provides a comprehensive methodology that can be used in its
entirety or adopted in module form. The framework also offers the flexibility to adapt certain elements to
the specific conditions of a national retail payments market.

The results of a cost study based on this methodology can help decision makers to agree on the targeted
gains in efficiency in their retail payments system, define an implementation plan for achieving a desired
future mix of payment instruments, and provide information for all stakeholders involved in the retail
payments market.

By applying the methodology for measuring the costs of retail payments provided in this document, cross-
country comparability and benchmarking is possible and the experience of other countries can be taken into
consideration when developing or adjusting the national retail payments strategy based on the results of the
cost study.

Methodological assumptions

The methodology presented in this guide is premised on a set of “stylized facts” resulting from the
experiences of the Payment Systems Development Group (PSDG), and others, in developing practical
guidance of applicability to diverse circumstances that yields useful and comparable results. These “stylized
facts” include:

 Public or private parties engaging in a study on the cost of different retail payment instruments are likely
  to have a sound understanding of the current state of their national retail payments market (e.g. as

services, factors influencing their adoption, their clearing and settlement process and the different roles within retail payment systems refer to
chapter 2 of “Developing a comprehensive national retail payments strategy” (Oct. 2012). Retail Package: http://go.worldbank.org/JFEVAXK3I0
                                                                                                                                                     7
    regards the payment instruments used for specific use cases or the volume and value of payments made
    with non-cash payment instruments)2.

 The application of a common international framework ensures a systematic approach when surveying and
  calculating the costs of retail payments within a national payments market and allows for cross country
  comparability and benchmarking of the results.

 The use of common and internationally recognized definitions of the retail payment instruments analyzed
  for a cost study limits the misperceptions and facilitates international comparability.

 The methodological framework needs to identify the levers that drive the outcome and achieve a balance
  between the detail of the theoretical formulation and the feasibility of the framework’s practical
  implementation. In this framework the payment characteristics of both the payment instrument and the
  context are the “levers” that drive the costs of a specific retail payment, and the outcome is the costs of
  retail payments.

 The methodology focuses on domestic “day-to-day” retail payments. Extraordinary payments of high
  value, for example, the purchase of a car by a consumer or cross-border payments3 are not considered.
  The combination of different stakeholders (users and service providers) who incur different costs, their
  role (payer or payee) in different use cases, the service channel, and the payment instruments used, are
  all relevant characteristics which were analyzed.

 The design of the methodology allows for flexibility without losing its comparative basis. If applied fully,
  the methodology comprises of surveys of payment service users (consumers, businesses, and government
  agencies), payment service providers and payment infrastructure providers, while at the same time
  capturing any regional differences. Moreover, the surveys ensure validity (capturing all relevant
  information and being able to generalize to the entire target population) and reliability (consistency of
  cost element measurement). In order to provide implementation flexibility, the survey execution and data
  analysis can be conducted by in-house experts or with the help of professional market research firms.

 While this methodology tries to identify the costs of retail payments it does not aim to explain the
  preference of payment service users for choosing certain payment instruments and/or the service offering
  on the supply side, nor does the methodology aim to quantify factors.

Scope of the methodology

This methodology addresses the following dimensions: (i) the demand side: costs borne by payment service
users (PSU), i.e. consumers, businesses and government agencies, in their roles as payers and payees; (ii) the
supply side: payment service providers (PSP) and payment infrastructure providers (PIP); and (iii) the overall
economy. It builds on and forms an integral part of the World Bank Group’s Retail Payments Package. The
methodology aims to meet the following criteria: (i) applicability, (ii) comparability; (iii) efficiency, and (iv)
standardization.

The methodology hopes to capture the retail payment costs by identifying ten payment instruments: cash,
cheque, voucher, debit card, credit card, prepaid card, direct debit transfer, direct credit transfer, mobile
money, and online money. Countries implementing the methodology will choose from the payment
instruments relevant in their retail payment system. These ten payment instruments are the complete set of
potential payment instruments available for day-to-day transactions. Any payment mechanism within a
country, based on its main characteristics, is assigned to one of these payment instruments in order to ensure
comparability and common terminology.

The methodology examines the payment instruments in the overall context of their use by including
important factors that are likely to affect retail payment costs. Specifically, the following parameters are
taken into account when deriving and measuring retail payment costs per payment instrument borne by the
different stakeholders on the demand and supply side:

       Payment type: indicates the direction in the flow of funds among the three PSUs categories (e.g.
        government-to-person) and their role as payer and/or payee.

       Payment purpose (use case): brings to surface the reason that triggers the transaction (e.g. salary
        payments).

       Payment transmission method: describes how a payment is initiated and/or received (in-person or
        remotely) and via which service channel (e.g. branch, ATM, agent).

Structure of the Practical Guide

This document is organized in five parts, which are further divided into sections and sub-sections. Part I
introduces the methodology by putting the cost analysis in context and analyzing the different building blocks
such as, key definitions of relevance for retail payments, classification of stakeholders by type, description of
payment transmission method and payment purposes (use cases), and classification of costs. Part II analyzes
the costs incurred by the demand side. More specifically, each payment service user category (i.e. consumers,
businesses, and government agencies) is analyzed in a separate section, including process steps for
identifying the specific cost elements, while also providing guidance on the content to be covered in the
surveys and the calculation of costs. Part III examines the costs incurred by the supply side, namely the
payment service and payment infrastructure providers, following a similar structure to the demand side. Part
IV brings the demand and supply side costs together by calculating the overall costs to the economy, after
adjusting for transfer costs4. Moreover, it further examines the savings that can be achieved under
substitution scenarios from paper-based to electronic payments. Finally, Part V challenges the
implementation of the framework by suggesting a step-by-step approach that can be used to execute the

4   Transfer costs are fees paid to other stakeholders in the retail payment process for services rendered.
                                                                                                               9
framework. Depending on a country’s needs, the demand and supply side of the framework can be
implemented independently. However, regardless if only the demand or only the supply side is implemented,
Part I and Part V of the document are relevant for the understanding of the overall methodology. Finally, if
the demand and supply side costs have both been identified, it becomes possible to implement Part III on
the costs for the overall economy.

Key outcomes

The implementation of this framework will produce important findings on the costs for the demand side, the
supply side, and the entire economy.

For the demand side:
 Ratio of paper-based to electronic payments (based on volume) during a calendar/fiscal year for each
    payment purpose (use case).
 Total costs of using each of the retail payment instruments covered in the retail payment cost study.
 Total costs for each payment purpose (use case).
 Total costs borne by each payment service user category: the sum of the resource costs and transfer
    costs.
 Average costs per payment, use case and payment instrument combination, given a specific service
    channel (e.g. the cost of receiving public sector salary in cash from the premises of a government office).

For the supply side:
 Total annual costs associated with each type of payment instrument.
 Average costs per payment processed, per type of payment instrument.
 Average costs per combination of payment processed and service channel used.
 Total annual costs for payment service providers.
 Total annual costs for payment infrastructure providers.

For the entire economy:
 Total resource costs
 Total transfer costs
 Total annual costs to the economy associated with each payment instrument, in absolute terms and
    expressed as percentage of the country’s GDP.
 Savings that could occur from different substitution hypotheses (e.g. hypothesis under which all public
    sector salaries distributed in cash at the premise of a government office are substituted by direct credit
    transfers).

                                          I.         OVERVIEW OF FRAMEWORK

1.     Recent interest in retail payment instruments and retail payment systems has now shifted the
decades-long focus of central banks and other authorities from large-value payment systems5. In the
meantime, it has been widely acknowledged that retail payments are essential for economic activities.
Improving retail payments’ efficiency is beneficial to the day-to-day transactions between consumers and
businesses and the payments made by and to government agencies, alike.

2.       A retail payment instrument is a means of exchange that facilitates the transfer of funds between
non-financial institutions (i.e. “payment service users”, such as consumers, businesses, or government
agencies). While almost every method of retail payment6 involves payment service providers (often
financial institutions) at some point in the transaction processing and fund settlement process, a key
characteristic of a retail payment is that one or both of the parties to the transaction, i.e. the payer and/or
the payee, is not a financial institution. Further characteristics of retail payments are that the transferred
funds are of relatively low value and their settlement is typically not time-critical. Retail payments can be
completed entirely with physical instruments (typically cash), initiated on paper then converted into
electronic format during processing (e.g. paper cheques, which are truncated), or initiated, authorized,
authenticated, cleared and settled electronically (e.g. card payments). Based on their main characteristics
retail payment instruments can be classified into the following categories:

3.       Physical instruments: These include cash (banknotes and coins), paper cheques, money orders,
paper vouchers, and traveler’s cheques. Cash is typically used for in-person transactions of low value
directly between payer and payee. Other paper-based instruments normally require the involvement of
one or more intermediaries (banks or non-bank payment service providers) to affect the transfer of value
from the payer to the payee. Non-cash paper-based instruments are used during face-to-face and remote
payments and their transaction value is, on average, higher than those of cash payments. Non-cash paper-
based instruments are often converted into electronic format during the processing, clearing and
settlement process.

4.       Electronic funds transfer (EFT)-based instruments: These are direct credit transfers and direct
debit transfers, and they are typically used for remote payments. If the payer and the payee have accounts
with different institutions, the transaction processing and funds settlement of EFT payment instruments
is generally conducted in between payment service providers (PSP)7 under well-codified rules and
procedures (“payment schemes”). These schemes are usually domestic, although there are also schemes
that have an international coverage (e.g. the jurisdictional scope of the SEPA credit transfer and the SEPA
direct debit schemes, currently being used in 34 European countries8). The scheme management is often
centralized in a company that is not operationally active (also referred to as “governance authority” or
“scheme owner”). Typically, this governance authority is also responsible for adapting the scheme to new

  Large-value payment systems typically process a relatively small number of high-value and time-critical payments, typically between financial
institutions. These systems are essential to the proper functioning of the financial system; a failure could trigger disruptions or transmit shocks,
both at local and international levels. Large-value payments are often also referred to as systemically important payments and include:
interbank money market operations, the cash leg of securities trades, and the cash leg of foreign exchange trades. While for a lot of large value
payments only financial institutions are the ultimate payer/payee, some customer transactions may also be processed in large-value payment
systems.
6 Cash payments and innovative peer-to-peer transactions (e.g. virtual currency transactions) are the two exceptions.
7
  Payment service providers (PSP) offer payment services to payment service users (PSU), while payment infrastructure providers (PIP) offer
payment-related services to PSP. PSP include deposit-taking institutions, credit institutions and other authorized service providers like postal
offices, money transfer organizations or e-money institutions. PIPs include providers of Automated Clearing Houses, Automated Cheque
Processing, Payment Switches, and Settlement Systems, and cash-in-transit companies. For a detailed description, see sub-section I.1.1.

legal, technological, or user requirements. From an end-to-end perspective between payer and payee,
EFT instruments are often not fully electronic: direct credit transfers are often initiated in paper-form and
direct debit transfer mandates are also often issued and signed on paper. However, typically the first PSP
within the payments process converts paper forms into electronic format and increasingly PSPs aim to
migrate to end-to-end electronic processing (e.g. by leveraging internet banking applications).

5.       Payment card-based instruments: These include credit card payments, charge card payments and
debit card payments, and typically involve usage of a physical plastic card by a payer to discharge the
payment obligation to the payee. The physical card has the associated account information encoded in a
magnetic stripe and/or in an embedded integrated circuit (IC) chip, and in addition the relevant
information is usually printed or embossed on the plastic card. The information on the magnetic stripe or
IC chip, when read by an appropriate device of the payee or by an ATM, can be used to trigger a funds
transfer from the payer’s account in favor of the payee. Payment cards can be used for in-person
purchases, as well as for remote payments. Increasingly, card-based payments are accepted in all standard
service channels like ATMs, internet, telephone/mobile phone, and at payment centers. In addition card
payments are very popular for payments in e-commerce, either by simply providing the e-commerce
retailer or the PSP with the card details shown on the payment card (card number, expiry date, and card
security code) or via more sophisticated solutions, which include a proper authorization by the card issuing
PSP.

6.      Prepaid instruments: This category includes payment products that are emerging in both
developed and developing countries and can take the form of prepaid cards, vouchers, mobile money or
online money. These products usually require the payer maintaining a prepaid payment account with a
(often specialized) PSP, not necessarily a financial institution. Often these instruments are proprietary
solutions, which are not interoperable with deposit transaction accounts or e-money transaction accounts
from other issuers for individual transactions, but the funding can typically be effected via cash, EFT, or
payment cards. Payment instructions can be initiated through agents of the PSP, the internet, mobile
phones, or typically as in the case of prepaid cards, at the POS-terminal or ATM. In a lot of jurisdictions
these prepaid instruments are qualified as “e-money products”. By definition, e-money is a record of funds
or value available to a consumer and stored on a payment device such as chip, prepaid cards, mobile
phones or on computer systems as a non-traditional account with a banking or non-banking entity. E-
Money products are further differentiated into mobile money, prepaid cards and online money (electronic
wallets).

I.1.    RETAIL PAYMENTS: CONTEXT AND DEFINITIONS

7.       A retail payment is defined as a transaction that meets the following criteria: (i) the payment is
not directly related to a financial market transaction; (ii) the settlement of funds is not time-critical; (iii)
the payer, the payee, or both are consumers, businesses and/or government agencies, but not financial
institutions; (iv) the payer, the payee, or both are not direct participants in the payments system that is
processing the payment; and (v) it is effected in the course of regular conduct of life/business (e.g. not
associated to a life event or extraordinary procurement). In addition, it is recommended to include a
maximum threshold in terms of value. High value payments, even if they meet all the criteria for retail
payments, are likely to be processed differently than the bulk of low value retail payments and therefore
cannot be considered to be representative in terms of costs. A maximum threshold in absolute terms is
not recommended though, but rather to define the threshold as a multiple of the gross domestic product
per capita (e.g. twice the GDP per capita).


                                                                                                             12
I.1.1.    Stakeholders in retail payments

8.       The objective of this methodological framework is to help public and private parties to identify
the representative costs borne by the demand and supply side for retail payments for a certain period of
time. Furthermore, the methodology should help in extrapolating the identified costs for an entire year
based on the annual volume of retail payment transactions within an economy. The application of a
consistent terminology and methodology as proposed in this report is the common denominator to
facilitate a cross-country comparison of results, notwithstanding the acknowledgement that during
implementation country specific and language specific adaptations in the terminology might be required.

9.       Payment service users (PSU) constitute the demand side of retail payment actors. PSU can be
broadly categorized into consumers (the term “households”, “individuals”, or “persons” could also be
used), businesses (registered enterprises, including retailers, sole proprietorships and self-employed
providers of goods and services), and government agencies (federal, regional and local ones). All of them
typically have a dual role, being the payer for certain retail payment transactions and the payee for others.
The following table presents the possible combinations of payer and payee, also referred to as payment
types, taking into account the involvement of the three categories of PSU, and their role as a payer and
payee. These payment types are further explained in the respective sections for consumers, businesses,
and government agencies, in Part II.

                                                       Consumer                  Business             Government Agency
               Payer
                       Consumer                   P2P                               P2B                        P2G
                        Business                  B2P                               B2B                        B2G
                  Government Agency               G2P                               G2B                        G2G9
               P=Person, B=Business, G=Government


10.      Payment service providers (PSP) and payment infrastructure providers (PIP) are the actors which
constitute the supply side of the retail payments chain. The PSP which offer their services directly to PSU
include banks and non-bank payment service providers, like money transfer operators or e-money
institutions. The PIP which enables the PSP’s service provision to the PSU without typically directly
servicing the PSU, include (for cash payments) cash-in-transit (CIT) companies and central banks, and (for
non-cash payments) operators of retail payment systems (e.g. clearing-houses), large value payment
systems (e.g. real-time gross settlement systems) and payment switches. While it is obvious that retail
payment systems and payment switches need to be considered for the cost of retail payment systems,
large-value payment systems are taken into consideration to the extent that they are processing retail
payments (be it on a per-transaction basis or for their net settlement).

I.1.2.    Retail payment instruments

11.     The choice of retail payment instruments included in the cost study is decisive for the
explanatory power of the results. While from a theoretical point of view the consideration of all retail
payments used in a country would be preferable, the exclusion of niche retail payment instruments makes
sense from a practical point of view, since the level of effort to achieve representative results for niche
products might not be meaningful and/or not justify the effort. The decision of which instruments to

9 G2G payments will be considered only in the context of secondary activities such as cash receipts and cheques, supply of change, and transfer
of funds between own accounts.

                                                                                                                                           13
include in a specific country study should be based on statistical data for the use of retail payments. Those
retail payment instruments which have a reasonable share of the overall retail payments volume should
be included into the cost study. Typically payment instruments which constitute five percent or more of
the total volume should be included into the study. In addition emerging payment instruments which,
based on their trajectory, are likely to play an important role in medium term, might be considered, even
if their existing share of the total volume is below the threshold10. A description of the most common
retail payment instruments is provided in the following:11

12.     Cash: Banknotes and coins issued by a central bank or government, which are recognized as legal
tender in the respective country, or accepted next to local currency for retail payments. The definition is
not confined to the national currency of that country. While the methodology does not include cross-
border payments in countries where foreign currencies are used for domestic retail payments alongside
the local currency, the former also needs to be considered.

13.      Cheque12: Written order from one party (the drawer) to another (the drawee, normally a bank)
requiring the drawee to pay a specified sum on demand to the drawer or to a third party specified by the
drawer. Cheques may be used for settling debts and withdrawing cash from banks. While cheques are
typically categorized as a paper-based retail payment instrument, they are increasingly becoming a
“hybrid payment instrument” due to cheque truncation. Cheque truncation is the process of replacing the
exchange of paper cheques as part of the clearing process with exchange of their images or digital
substitutes.

14.     Voucher: Certificate or document that can be exchanged for cash or can be used for the
conditional purchase of goods and services. Vouchers can be issued by government agencies for the
payment of salaries, pensions, subsidies and social transfer and by businesses (as part of their salary
payments or for customer refunds). While vouchers have traditionally been issued in paper form,
electronic vouchers are becoming more and more important. The main differentiating criteria between
electronic vouchers and e-money payment instruments is that the latter are general purpose payment
instruments while vouchers can typically be used for dedicated purposes only (e.g. the purchase of
agricultural inputs, groceries, or school supplies).

15.      Debit card: Payment card where the funds are debited in full for every transaction from the
underlying transaction account. It enables the holder to make purchases and/or withdraw cash. Some
issuers of debit cards provide an overdraft feature allowing the payer to use the card even without
sufficient balance in the underlying account.

16.     Credit card: A type of payment card, indicating that the bearer has been granted a line of credit.
It enables the bearer to make purchases and/or withdraw cash up to a prearranged ceiling. The credit
granted can be settled in full by the end of a specified period or can be settled in part, with the balance
taken as extended credit. Interest is charged on the amount of any extended credit and the holder can be
charged an annual fee. A special type of credit card is a charge card. It enables the bearer to make
purchases but does not offer extended credit. Moreover, the full amount of the debt incurred must be
settled at the end of a specified period. The bearer is usually charged an annual fee.


10 Depending on the relevance of this emerging payment instrument, this might be done as part of the overall cost study, or if no representative
data can be obtained, in form of a case study.
11 This description is based on the glossary of terms (Annex 8) of the World Bank publication “Developing a comprehensive national retail

payments strategy”. The terms used there have been largely taken from CPSS Glossary (CPSS, 2003). In some cases, the definiti on provided in
“Developing a comprehensive national retail payments strategy” was adapted.
12 Also referred to as “check”.



                                                                                                                                             14
17.     Prepaid card: E-money product for general purpose use where the record of funds is stored on
the payment card (on magnetic stripe or the embedded integrated circuit chip) or a central computer
system, and which can be drawn down through specific payment instructions to be issued from the
bearer’s payment card.

18.      Direct debit transfer: A payment order or a sequence of payment orders made for the purpose
of collecting funds from the payer and placing at the disposal of the payee. The payment instructions
typically move from the PSP of the payee to the PSP of the payer, possibly via several other PSP as
intermediaries and/or more than one direct debit transfer system. If both, the payer and the payee are
customers of the same PSP, the direct debit transfer can be processed without the involvement of other
PSP and/or direct debit transfer systems. Direct debit transfers are typically categorized as electronic-fund
transfer payment instruments, the authorization (or mandate) forming the contractual basis for the
(series of) direct debit transfer(s) is however often still paper-based.

19.      Direct credit transfer: A payment order or possibly a sequence of payment orders (“standing
order”) made for the purpose of placing funds at the disposal of the payee. Both the payment instructions
and the funds described therein typically move from the PSP of the payer/originator to the PSP of the
payee, possibly via several other PSP as intermediaries and/or more than one direct credit transfer
system. If both the payer and the payee are customers of the same PSP, the direct credit transfer can be
processed without the involvement of other PSP and/or PIPs. While direct credit transfers are typically
categorized as electronic-fund transfer payment instruments, they can be a “hybrid payment instrument”,
if they are initiated on paper forms. As part of the clearing process, these paper forms are replaced with
copies of their images, or more commonly digital substitutes.

20.     Mobile money: E-money product where the record of funds is stored on the mobile phone or a
central computer system, and can be drawn down through specific payment instructions issued from a
mobile phone, typically the one of the payer. However, the payer can also make use of the mobile phone
of an agent. It is also known as m-money.

21.     Online money: E-money product where the record of funds, stored on a central computer system,
can be drawn down through accessing this central computer system via an internet connection on a
variety of devices (e.g. desktop PC, laptop, tablet, smart-phone).

I.1.3.   Payment transmission methods and service channels

22.     Retail payments can be initiated and received in different contexts and through different
methods. One main category of payment transmission methods is that of in-person payments which
require the physical presence of the payer and the payee (or a representative, including machines). In-
person payments can be initiated in the course of the underlying (economic) interaction (e.g. matching
payment with delivery) or there might be a time-gap in-between (i.e. a certain period is allowed for the
payment and payer and payee to meet again to discharge the payment obligation). The other main
transmission method is remote payments, i.e. the payer and the payee (or a representative, including
machines) do not meet at the same location. Remote payments are initiated from a distance (e.g. via mail,
phone or internet). Similar to in-person payments they can be initiated in the course of the underlying
(economic) interaction (e.g. MOTO or online shopping) or with a time-lag. It is worth noting that both
transmission methods, in-person and remote payments, do not necessarily require an economic
interaction as a basis, but can also be effected based on a courtesy or personal obligation.

  P=Person, B=Business, G=Government


23.     It is important to emphasize that the payment transmission method and service channel for the
same payment instrument can differ: cheques and payment cards can, for example, be used for in-person
payments (e.g. a payment the grocery store) or remotely (e.g. mailing a cheque or using the payment card
over the internet).

24.     In-person payments involve the physical presence of the payer at the point of economic
interaction and/or a service channel provided by the payee (payee’s payment center) or a PSP (branches
of the PSP, ATMs, PSP payment centers or agents). If the payer travels to a certain location to initiate the
payment this will result in payment specific time and travel costs.

   a. Point of (economic) interaction: Constitutes the main service channel of in-person payments and
      can be described as the convergence of the locations of the payer and the payee. Examples include
      the location of the payer (e.g. home-delivery), the location of the payee (e.g. at a grocery store or a
      restaurant) or any other place where the payer and the payee meet (e.g. in a taxi). This is the only
      sub-category of in-person payments in which neither the payer nor the payee incurs any payment
      specific travel costs.

   b. Payment center: Physical outlets allowing one or more payees (e.g. in case of utility companies) to
      collect or payers to disburse (e.g. in case of government agencies disbursing via their own counters)
      funds. These activities might be conducted at the teller or in the self-service area of the payment
      center. The main identifying criteria of payment centers and what differentiates them from
      branches or agents is that payment centers are set up by (or for) a PSU for the main purpose of
      initiating and/or receiving funds.

                                                                                                                   16
       c. Branch: Physical outlet of a PSP that permits a PSU, to withdraw cash from their accounts and/or
          access other services such as balance inquiries, transfer of funds, or acceptance of deposits. These
          activities might be conducted via the teller or in the self-service area of a branch.

       d. Automated teller machine (ATM): An electromechanical device that permits authorized PSUs,
          typically using machine-readable payment cards, to withdraw cash from their accounts and/or
          access other services such as balance inquiries, transfer of funds, or acceptance of deposits. ATMs
          may be operated either online with real-time access to an authorization database, or offline. ATMs
          might be located at branches or at other locations.

       e. Agent: An agent provides payment services on behalf of a PSP. The type of service provided by the
          agent could vary from direct processing of transactions like disbursing cash or accepting deposits,
          to ancillary non-transaction-related services like collection of documents, opening of transaction
          accounts, or addressing customer service queries, among others. An agent can provide these
          services in a physical outlet (e.g. own shop or stand) or can be a mobile agent.

25.     Remote payments imply that the physical locations of the payer, the payee, and/or the PSP do
not coincide. Remote payments can be initiated via mail, the internet, or the (mobile) phone.

       a. Mail: The use of regular mail for sending cheques, vouchers, initiating credit or debit card
          transactions13, or even cash.

       b. Internet: Data communication network that allows a PSU to access services such as balance
          inquiries or transfer of funds, via a variety of internet-enabled devices (e.g. desktop PC, laptop,
          tablet, smart phone). Instead of the internet, designated lines can also be established for data
          communication.

       c. Telephone/mobile phone network: Voice or text communication network that allows a PSU to
          access services such as balance inquiries or transfer of funds, via landline or mobile phones.

I.1.4.        Purpose of retail payments and use cases

26.      The purpose of a retail payment can be: i) the compensation for an economic transaction (e.g.
purchase/sale of goods and services), ii) a transfer due to an entitlement or obligation (e.g. salaries, social
transfers, tax payments), iii) a personal transfer (e.g. courtesy transfer to support relatives or donation)14,
or iv) the reorganization of the payer’s own funds (e.g. cash withdrawals or deposits).

27.     Table 3 lists the most common PSU use cases for each of these payment purposes and some of
the main payment services and infrastructures provided by the PSP and PIP. Table 4 accommodates these
various use cases to the types of retail payments identified in Table 1.

28.      The use cases are examples of retail payments that have a regular character either for the payer
or the payee, i.e. these payments should be effected at least once a year on a regular basis (e.g. annual
payment of taxes). While for a consumer life time events or bigger investments (e.g. the purchase of a
house or a car) would not be considered as retail payment, the monthly leasing would be. On the other
hand, a car dealer would consider the payment from the buyer and the payment to the wholesaler as
retail payments.


13   The payer can provide their card information to pay a bill or order a good via regular mail.
14   See: “Payments and Social Ties,” by Viviana Zelizer (1996).

                                                                                                            17
I.1.5    Value and Volumes of Retail Payments

29.    Special emphasis should be placed on the collection of data for both values and volumes of retail
payments. Even if there is statistical data available in a country on value and volume for certain retail
payment instruments, the retail payment cost study can provide additional insights as regards value and
volume of transactions by stakeholder group, payment transmission method/service channel, and
purpose of retail payments.

30.     Volume figures in terms of the number of transactions allow for computing for example unit costs,
while data on the values of retail payment transactions may give indications of the thresholds/break-even
points when a particular payment instrument is used or preferred compared to others.

31.   Finally, if a maximum value threshold has been defined, the value figures will identify those retail
payments within the scope of the cost survey.

I.2.         COSTS OF RETAIL PAYMENTS

32.     This section discusses the costs of retail payments from the demand and supply side perspective,
by defining and classifying costs into different types. Moreover, it briefly introduces the Activity-Based
Costing methodology which is particularly relevant for capturing the cost data on the supply side.

I.2.1.       Type of costs

33.     Using and providing payment services generates costs for the actors involved, i.e. for PSUs,
PSPs, and PIPs. In the last two decades a number of studies have tried to quantify those costs, the majority
of which have focused mainly on the supply side and – if the demand side was captured – typically on
businesses only (see Table 5). The cost terminology used in the studies varies. However, an increasing
number of studies have chosen concepts such as “social costs” and “private costs” . Since this document
is supposed to serve as a guide for policy makers, the emphasis has been put on the practical application

15 For those payments where government agencies “act like a business”, they are considered under the B2B type of payments. In fact all use
cases listed there, with the exception of “Payments for procurement of supply chain products and services”, also apply to government agencies.
16 The suggested framework does not consider other G2G payments such as intra-governmental (across agencies within the same country) and

inter-governmental (across government entities of different countries) since they typically include large-value payments.

                                                                                                                                           19
of the terms used. As a result, the following differentiation has been made: i) resource costs vs. transfer
costs and ii) total costs per stakeholder group vs. costs for the entire economy17. The distinction between
resource costs and transfer costs is necessary for a correct calculation of the total costs per stakeholder
group and the costs for the entire economy. In order to allow policymakers to make the right decisions,
the types of costs also should be distinguished along two additional dimensions: i) direct vs. indirect costs
and ii) variable vs. fixed costs. The distinction between direct costs and indirect costs mainly facilitates
the accurate collection of comprehensive data, and is essential for estimating the potential savings when
substituting one payment instrument with another (overall, for a particular payment transmission
method/service channel, or in a particular use case). It is worth stressing that the following three
categories i) type (resource vs. transfer), ii) attribution (direct vs. indirect), and iii) variability (fixed vs.
variable), are distinct within the category, but not mutually exclusive between categories, and that there
is no dedicated relationship between them. That is, a cost element that is classified as resource (or
transfer) can be either direct or indirect, as well as fixed or variable.

34.      Resource costs: The sum of all internal costs incurred by a stakeholder in order to initiate and/or
receive payments (in the case of PSU), or in order to make payment instruments and/or services available
(in the case of PSP and PIP). Typically, resource costs for the PSU include time-based costs (e.g. time to
get to an ATM to withdraw cash or initiate a payment), labor-based costs (e.g. end-of day cash processing
at a store or reconciliation), travel costs (e.g. mileage to get to the branch) and capital/technology-based
costs (e.g. hardware and software costs or terminal maintenance for merchants). If payment-related
internal processes are outsourced to a PSP/PIP (e.g. a cash logistic company) they should be treated as
transfer costs in order to allow for a correct calculation of the total costs for the economy.18 If payment-
related internal processes are outsourced to a provider not captured as PSP/PIP in this methodology,
conceptually they still have to be considered as resource costs in all calculations. Holding costs (i.e. the
private cost in terms of foregone interest of holding cash) should also be treated as resource costs. The
resource costs of PSP/PIP, include the production, issuing, reissuing, destruction, and logistics costs of
payment instruments that have physical representation, costs for initiating and processing payments,
payments-related infrastructure and its maintenance costs, security costs, as well as costs for supporting
activities associated with payments (e.g. customer service, creating and maintaining transaction accounts,
marketing and advertising, etc.). If internal processes are outsourced by PSP/PIP to another entity that is
not a PSP or PIP or not captured by the cost study, conceptually they still have to be considered as resource
costs (e.g. since agents are not considered to be PSP for the purposes of this study, agent commission fees
are considered to be resource costs).

35.    Transfer costs: Are the fees paid to other stakeholders of the same or a different stakeholder
category in the retail payment process for services rendered (e.g. transaction fees, outsourcing fees for
payment-related services), including fees paid by the payer for using a specific payment instrument (e.g.
surcharges) or discounts granted by the payee to incentivize the use of specific payment instruments.




17 The total costs for the economy consist of resource costs, transfer costs, and economic externalities. In the context of costs, negative
externalities are of main importance, although positive externalities also exist. One of the most important negative economic externalities results
from the use of cash to facilitate the underground (“black” or “gray”) economy, among others. The calculation of externalities is beyond the scope
of this methodology, but it is acknowledged that the total costs for the economy are likely to be underestimated as a result of this omission.
18 When calculating the costs of the demand side only, outsourcing fees should always be treated as resource costs. Otherwise the true payment-

related production costs of those stakeholders who outsource some of their internal processes will be underestimated, since outsourcing fees
will be omitted. On the other hand, when calculating the total costs for the economy, outsourcing fees of the PSU paid to the PSP/PIP should be
treated as transfer costs, since the true production costs will be accounted for by the resource costs reported by the outsourcees.

36.     Revenues: Transfer costs for one stakeholder covered by the methodology can be considered as
revenue for another stakeholder: e.g. the payer (in case of discounts), the payee (in case of surcharges),
the PSP (for fees paid by the PSU), and the PIP (for fees paid by the PSP). The main source of information
for transfer costs will be the stakeholder who is paying the fee and revenue information can be indirectly
obtained that way. However, it is recommended to include questions on surcharges and discounts into
the business survey and on revenues from payment related services into the supply side surveys. This
information will not only allow for quality checks of the transfer cost information received, but also


                                                                                                                           21
interpret individual stakeholders’ behavior and choices, which are likely to be affected by the total net
costs they are facing (i.e. the total costs minus their revenues), and needs to be taken into consideration
when discussing substitution scenarios. Payment instruments that are relatively inefficient from the
overall economy’s point of view, might be an important source of income for certain stakeholders. In
which case stakeholders are unlikely to embrace the substitution of those payment instruments. In this
context seigniorage income could be considered as a source of revenue for the central bank and/or the
mint acting as issuer of currency, and – if it can be obtained – reported alongside other supply side
revenues.

37.     Total costs for a type of stakeholder versus costs for the economy: By adding up all resource and
transfer costs for a single type of stakeholder, the total costs for that specific stakeholder group can be
derived. In contrast, in order to avoid double-counting when calculating the total costs for the economy,
only the resource costs of the stakeholders involved and economic externalities should be included.

38.     The following table provides an overview of the relationship between resource costs, transfer
costs and total costs for each stakeholder, but also the economy as a whole:

          stakeholders in the retail payment chain. In that case their transfer cost would be 0. If they incur transfer costs to
          other PIP, this should be taken into consideration in this regard.

39.     Direct versus indirect costs: A relevant distinction between direct and indirect costs can also be
made if the costs are explicitly linked to a specific retail payment instrument and/or transaction.

40.      Direct costs are those that arise from a direct and exclusive use of resources to issue a retail
payment instrument or make a retail payment. In other words, direct costs are the costs “directly
related” to the activities carried out for producing, issuing and destroying each retail payment instrument
and/or conducting each retail payment transaction, and which can be imputed in a straightforward way
(e.g. production costs and/or costs associated with fees and commissions and with staff directly involved
in each activity and with each payment instrument)19. If a specific payment instrument can be used for
more than one payment transaction (e.g. cash or payment cards as opposed to cheques), its production
and destruction costs should be depreciated over its average lifetime (e.g. time a banknote is on average
in circulation or a payment card is valid) and the annual depreciation costs be allocated to the number of

                                                                                                                                               22
transactions conducted with this payment instrument. By doing so, direct costs of production, issuing, and
destruction become indirect costs of usage.

41.    Indirect costs are those that arise from a non-exclusive use of resources to make a retail
payment. Indirect costs are the costs associated with local overhead20 and support functions21 that are
necessary to carry out the activities associated with retail payments. These costs should be imputed to
each transaction using specific allocation keys (e.g. costs relating to rentals, maintenance and
depreciation, and other corporate support services).22

42.      Bundled products/services: It is often the case that PSUs are recipients of bundled financial
services (i.e. pay only one single fee but receive services that are associated with multiple payment
instruments and/or additional services not directly linked to payments like free insurance or reward
points). Indeed, for the purpose of real cost findings, it is important to rigorously allocate the single
(indirect) fee to the different products and services offered in the case of bundles on the demand side of
the payment chain. This methodology suggests that in the case of bundled services provided to a PSU, the
price of a comparable basic payment service is used as a proxy and costs not related to payment
transactions (e.g. free insurance) are considered out of the scope of the methodology. For the PSP,
however, this represents a resource cost associated with the provision of payment services, which needs
to be captured.

43.      Fixed versus variable costs: Depending on the variability of the costs, they can be qualified as
variable or fixed costs. Fixed costs remain unchanged for a specific payment instrument, irrespective of
the amount or purpose of the retail payment it is used for. Variable cost can vary per payment instrument
dependent on the amount and/or the service channel used for the retail payment. This goes beyond the
definition of variable cost typically used in cost accounting, which focuses mainly on variability due to
volume. However, within payment instruments the variability dependent on the amount requires
consideration too, since certain pricing practices (e.g. ad valorem fees) result in different (transfer) costs
to be borne by PSU. Variable costs do not necessarily change linearly: they might be stepwise variable.23
Especially for the calculation of potential cost savings, it is necessary to get a sound understanding of what
share of the costs is fixed and what share is variable with the number and value of transactions made in
the economy. The identification of the variability of the costs should ideally be done by the respondents
themselves, by asking for each cost item, whether they are fixed, variable with the number of transactions
or variable with the value of transactions.

44.     Resource and transfer costs comprise of different cost categories and consist of a variety of
individual cost elements (see Table 7 and definitions). This methodology tries to find an appropriate
balance between the necessary level of detail and a realistic and practical level of effort when surveying
and/or analyzing this data.

27
   Operations time costs are fixed when they refer to time spent to install and keep physical acceptance devices for electronic payments (e.g.
POS terminals) operational.
28 Operations time costs are variable when they refer to preparing the cash register before opening hours and closing the cash register at the

end of the business day.
29 Travel costs are indirect only when they are incurred to get to the branch, ATM, agent outlet or payment center for depositing the day's sales

if more than one payment instrument is involved.
30 Depending on the telecommunication contract of the PSU, telecommunication costs incur directly in connection with a payment (for example

in case of a flat fee telecommunication contracts) or have to be assigned proportionally to a specific payment. They can be fixed (for example if
a flat fee telecommunications/internet service is paid) or variable with the volume of payments (for example, if payment is made by mail, the
cost of stamps will be considered a telecommunication cost and it will vary with the number of payments made).
31 Depending on the type of loss, costs can be either attributed directly to a specific payment (e.g. errors in filling a cheque or direct credit

transfer form and associated reconciliation errors) or indirectly (e.g. loss of cash and payment card fraud in case of loss or theft of the entire
wallet).

45.      Time costs are associated with time spent by a PSU to access and/or obtain a payment instrument,
initiate a payment transaction, receive a payment transaction and/or reconcile that payment. Time costs
are typically variable in nature. While a PSU should be asked about the perceived time spent, it is
recommended to complement this information by conducting field studies and measuring the time spent
on those cost elements which are observable (e.g. waiting time or – for in-person payments – transaction
time). Previous cost studies have observed considerable differences between the perceived time spent
and the effective time measured.

46.     While one cannot assume that any stakeholders would incur earnings spontaneously at any time,
this methodology suggests quantifying the costs of time-based opportunity costs, since disregarding this
component would adversely affect the real costs of retail payments. The national minimum wage36 could
be used as a proxy to quantify the opportunity cost of the time spent by consumers. For transparency
reasons it is recommended to report the opportunity costs for consumers explicitly in time units per use
case/payment instrument/service channel combination and to calculate the costs of retail payments with
and without time-based opportunity costs for consumers. For PSUs which are businesses or government
agencies, time costs can be measured in labor costs. In that case the real or average wages of the persons
involved in the payment transaction could form the basis of the calculation. However, for practical reasons
and in order to avoid inflating the time costs, it is recommended that the minimum wage approach is also
applied to businesses and government agencies. Time costs can be further broken down in the following
cost elements:

      a. Travel time refers to the time required for the PSU to get from the place of residence or office to
         a designated physical point in order to effect (i.e. initiate or receive) a payment transaction.37 By
         definition travel time does not incur if the payment is conducted as part of the underlying
         economic or personal transaction and/or payments are initiated remotely via the internet or
         phone. However, travel time is incurred if a remote payment initiated by mail requires travelling
         to the post office or a mailbox to post the payment.

      b. Waiting time refers to the time interval from the moment the PSU arrives at the designated
         physical point of payment (e.g. at payment center, branches, agents) until the interaction with
         the teller (or a device like the ATM) begins. The time a consumer waits at the checkout of a

32 In case of cash and cheque depositing.
33 In case of fixed transaction fees.
34 In case of ad valorem fees.
35 Fees for services outsourced are treated as resource costs when functions or activities are outsourced to third parties that are not PSP/PIP.
36 The suggestion for using this conservative proxy avoids inflating the cost, which could potentially occur if other proxies are used, such as the

average wage. While countries might not have a national minimum wage defined by law, statistical data about income distribution is usually
available. In that case, the lower level of income distribution should be used. If no reliable data on the minimum wage is available, alternatively,
per capita gross domestic product figures could be considered.
37 In theory, when the trip to a designated service point for payment purposes is combined with other activities, only the equivalent fraction of

the time-based opportunity cost should be allocated to the payment activity. For practical purposes, though, this framework assumes that the
trip is entirely attributed to the payment activity, and as such, the entire travel time from the PSU’s home or work place is allocated to the
payment activity and the payment instrument used in the process.

                                                                                                                                                25
           physical store to pay for purchases made is not considered part of the waiting time for retail
           payments, rather it is considered as part of the underlying economic transaction.

     c. Transaction time refers to the time of effective direct interaction between the payer and the
        payee (from each side, respectively) or the payer and a device made available by the payee for
        the purpose of effecting a payment (e.g. POS-terminal). While the lengths of the transaction time
        for the payer and the payee are coinciding as in the case of in-person payments (unless a self-
        service checkout is used), the cost of that time to the payer and payee is likely to differ unless the
        national minimum wage is applied as a proxy in both cases. For payments without direct
        interaction between payer and payee, transaction time encompasses the time spent by the PSU
        with a representative of the PSP (e.g. the teller) or a device (ATM, computer, phone, etc.). For
        remote payments conducted via internet or phone, the transaction time is defined as the period
        from the moment the payer accesses the relevant application (e.g. enters the online banking
        website to arrange the transaction) until the transaction has been successfully initiated.

     d. Reconciliation time refers to the time spent by consumers in checking their personal transaction
        account/card statements and for business and government agencies, as both payers and payees,
        in reconciling payments received/sent with the amounts due based on the accounting
        information.

     e. Operations time is mainly relevant to businesses and government agencies when handling
        physical payment instruments like cash, cheques, or vouchers as well as the time spent installing
        and keeping physical acceptance devices for electronic payments (e.g. POS terminals) operational.
        In the case of businesses and government agencies, it includes aspects such as preparing cash
        registers before the opening hours, closing cash registers, and preparing cash and cheques at the
        end of the business day for bank deposit. Operations time also includes exceptions’ handling (e.g.
        the handling of counterfeited banknotes or chargebacks).

47.    Logistic costs comprise monetary costs spent by the PSU that occur in the process of accessing
and/or obtaining a payment instrument and initiating or receiving a payment transaction. Specific cost
elements under this category are:

     a. Travel costs refer to the distance travelled by the payer/payee to get from the place of residence
        or office to a designated physical point in order to effect (i.e. initiate or receive) an in-person
        payment transaction.38 By definition travel costs are not incurred by the payer if the in-person
        payment transaction is conducted as part of an underlying economic transaction and/or payments
        are initiated remotely via mail, internet or phone. On the other hand PSUs are likely to incur travel
        costs for a transaction that involves physical payment instruments (i.e. cash deposits or cash-outs,
        cheques, and vouchers), assuming this activity has not been outsourced. While the PSU might
        choose different means of transportation (e.g. walking, cycling, public transportation, personal
        motor vehicles or other paid forms of transportation such as taxis), irrespective of the explicit
        monetary travel costs (e.g. fuel costs, the bus ticket and/or the taxi/minivan for the trip), it is
        recommended that for comparability reasons the distance is chosen as the relevant cost




38 In theory, when the trip to a service point for payment purposes is combined with other activities/chores, only the equivalent fraction of the
travel costs should be allocated to the payment activity. For practical purposes, though, this framework assumes that the trip is entirely
attributed to the payment activity, and as such, the entire travel time is allocated to the payment activity and the payment instrument used in
the process.

                                                                                                                                              26
       parameter. Official mileage allowances or equivalent data could be used for the calculation of the
       travel costs.

   b. Communication costs are associated with the supporting activities that affect a payment
      transaction. The most typical communication costs include data transmission costs (e.g. for
      internet connectivity or the use of fixed lines) on the payer and the payee side, phone
      communication costs (voice communication, messaging) and postal charges for regular mail. It is
      recommended to use country averages for the internet, voice, messaging, and postal fees.

48.     Infrastructure costs are mainly relevant for businesses and government agencies and cover costs
borne in the process of maintaining the existing infrastructure for effecting payments. They include the
following specific cost elements:

   a. Maintenance costs typically include the infrastructural costs for keeping payment terminals,
      physical outlets, vaults, and other relevant payment infrastructure (e.g. IT-infrastructure)
      functioning during the day-to-day operations.

   b. Depreciation costs refer to the assets’ value that has been reduced. More specifically, they refer
      to the used value of payment terminals, physical outlets, vaults, and other relevant payment
      infrastructure (e.g. IT-infrastructure).

49.     Damage costs are associated with the use of a range of payment instruments and appear in
various forms, resulting in losses for the different PSU actors. They are synonymous to risk costs and
consist of:

   a. Error costs refer to losses typically incurred by businesses and government agencies due to
      imbalances between cash registers and actual receipts and/or costs associated with losing
      cheques or vouchers.

   b. Theft costs refer to any losses due to extraction of funds from a PSU without consent, and apply
      to multiple payment instruments.

   c. Fraud costs constitute losses of various forms (e.g. counterfeiting, identify theft) and could be
      associated with banknotes, coins and non-cash payment instruments, to the extent that they are
      not covered by insurance.

   d. Insurance costs include insurance premiums paid against losses associated with different
      payment instruments.

50.      Production costs are associated with the primary material used and the procedure followed to
produce payment instruments. Production costs refer to the costs associated with printing physical paper
forms (e.g. for direct debit transfer mandates, direct credit transfer forms, cheques, and vouchers) and
can be incurred by the payee and/or the PSP. The billing process itself is not considered as part of the
costs of retail payments, therefore costs for printing invoices are excluded from the production costs.

   a. Production costs of cash refers to the costs of obtaining banknotes and coins.

   b. Production costs of cheques refer to the costs of obtaining cheques or cheque books.

   c. Production costs of cards refer to the costs of obtaining a new payment card or a payment card
      replacement (in case of loss, theft, or fraud).

                                                                                                      27
51.     Service costs are fees and charges paid by a PSU to another stakeholder in the retail payment
process, in most of the cases to a PSP. They include the following cost elements:

    a. Periodic fees refer to fees typically paid by the PSU to the PSP for services and infrastructure
       components (e.g. POS terminals) provided. They could be variable or fixed, depending on the
       service, and are paid periodically.

    b. Per transaction fees occur when a payment is performed. They can either be fixed fees per
       transaction, ad valorem fees or a combination of both. Unlike periodic fees, per transaction fees
       could also be paid from one PSU to another (e.g. surcharges paid by a payer to a payee or
       discounts for the use of certain payment instruments given by a payee to a payer).

    c. Fees for services outsourced refer to fees paid to external actors for services that are not
       generated in-house (e.g. to cash logistic companies).

52.    Cost of funds are the losses associated with not holding funds in an interest-bearing account.
More specifically, they include:

    a. Holding costs refer to losses of interest foregone by not holding funds in an interest-bearing
       account.

    b. Float costs refer to funds that are often not at the disposal of the PSUs (neither the payee nor the
       payer) for a certain period of time between initiation and receipt of the payment transaction. As
       such, in this case there is still interest foregone from the payee’s perspective, since he does not
       have immediate access to the funds and as such cannot deposit them in an interest-bearing
       account.

II.1.   RETAIL PAYMENT COSTS BORNE BY CONSUMERS

53.    This section applies the cost methodology to consumers in their role as PSUs (acting as payers for
some transactions and payees for others).

II.1.1. Classification of consumer retail payments by type

54.      Payment types (see Table 8) highlight the interaction between consumers and other PSUs while
identifying the role of consumers as payer and/or payee. While the use cases per payment type might
differ from country to country, the payment types as such should be universally applicable and it can be
assumed that at least one use case per payment type exists in every country. Payment types can be
grouped according to the role of consumers in the retail payment process, i.e. whether they are acting as
payers, payees or both. In the following paragraph, the types of retail payments involving consumers are
listed and some typical use cases are mentioned. For a detailed list of use cases the reader is referred to
sub-section I.1.4.




                                                                                                        28
                            Table 8: Types of retail payments for the demand side
                                  (those relevant for consumers highlighted)

                               Payee                                                Government
                                           Consumer             Business
            Payer                                                                     Agency
                    Consumer                   P2P                P2B                  P2G
                     Business                  B2P                B2B                  B2G
               Government Agency               G2P                G2B                  G2G
            P=Person, B=Business, G=Government


55.    If both, the payer and the payee are consumers, the payments are referred to as person-to-
person payments.

    a. Person-to-person (P2P) payments include transfers of money, without an underlying economic
       transaction, to support or to make a present to family members/friends (e.g. domestic or
       international remittances). Payments to other individuals in the social context (e.g., to repay for
       a shared restaurant bill) also fall into this category. Moreover, P2P payments include the
       disposition of a persons’ own funds (e.g. deposits, withdrawals, and transfers between accounts
       of one and the same account holder), given that these transactions can be viewed as transactions
       with oneself. P2P costs should be captured separately for the payer and the payee side of P2P
       payments.

56.      If only the payer is a consumer, the relevant use cases can be grouped into P2B and P2G type of
retail payments.

    a. Person-to-business (P2B) payments include retail payments associated with the purchase of retail
       goods and services from businesses irrespective of the size of the business and whether the
       business is formally registered or not. P2B payments include payments for financial services other
       than payment services (for example insurance), regular transport expenses, utilities and other
       periodic bills, and consumer durables and consumables. It is important to emphasize that this
       category also covers individual service providers (e.g. one-person companies and individuals
       receiving compensation for services rendered) and/or purchases from suppliers not necessarily
       falling into the category of retailers (e.g. fresh farm product sales). Within an economy a large
       share of the total volume of retail payments falls into the category of P2B payments. The value
       per transaction however can vary widely depending on the type of good/service the payment is
       made for.

    b. Person-to-government (P2G) payments include obligations that citizens pay to central, regional
       and/or local government authorities. Typical use cases include income tax payments and the
       employee's share of social security contributions (if they are not paid by the employer on behalf
       of the employee, in which case it would be qualified as a B2G payment) as well as other taxes (e.g.
       property tax). Fines (e.g. traffic fines), duties, and other types of government collections (e.g. fees
       for government issued documents like passports or driving licenses) vary significantly across
       countries and thus should be identified on a country-by-country basis.

57.      If only the payee is a consumer, the relevant use cases can be grouped into B2P and G2P type of
retail payments.

    a. Business-to-person (B2P) payments are typically payroll payments to individuals that are
       employed by the payer, provided the payer is not considered to be a government agency.

                                                                                                           29
             Government agency employees are considered part of G2P payments. When it comes to entirely
             state-owned companies, it will depend on how the payment is made. If the state-owned company
             pays its employees directly, this would be considered as a B2P payment. If the payroll payments
             are effected via a ministry or other government agency, they should be treated like payroll
             payments for government employees (i.e. as G2P payment).

        b. Government-to-person (G2P) payments are associated with four main use cases. The two most
           prominent cases (in terms of volume) are pensions paid to retirees and payroll payments to
           individuals employed by government agencies (or state-owned enterprises for which the payment
           is effected via the government agency). Other relevant use cases are the payment of social
           benefits (often also referred to as cash transfers, even if the underlying payment instrument is
           electronic) and tax refunds to individuals (applicable in particular for income taxes).

II.1.2. Identification of the relevant payment instruments and service channels per use case

58.     The use cases identified herein represent the typical range of payments initiated and received by
consumers, irrespective of the state of economic development of a country and/or its national payment
system. However, when conducting the cost study, the use cases should be critically assessed and adapted
to country-specific circumstances, as appropriate.

39   For every use case the choice of all payment instruments should be given. The same applies for businesses and government agencies.
40   For every use case the choice of all service channels should be given. The same applies for businesses and government agencies.

                                                                                                                                             30
59.     Once the relevant use cases are identified, the payment instruments that can be used by
consumers for the specific use cases should be identified. It is assumed that the entity conducting the cost
study knows which payment instruments can, in principal, be used for the identified use cases. If this is
not the case, this information should be obtained via desk research, focus group interviews, and/or
surveys on the payments behavior of consumers prior to conducting surveys in the context of the cost
study.

II.1.3. Identification of cost elements per payment instrument-service channel combination

60.      For every payment instrument identified as relevant for at least one use case, the service
channel(s) for the use of that payment instrument and the cost elements associated with the payment
instrument-service channel combinations need to be identified. These cost elements can be assigned to
each specific payment instrument-service channel combination (see Table 10). Given that in the case of
consumers the different cost elements for these combinations are typically the same41, irrespective of
whether or not the consumer is in the role of the payer or payee, cost elements will not be separately
listed in the following.

II.1.4. Sample selection and survey design for consumers

61.      Once the relevant cost elements per payment instrument have been identified, primary data on
the overall frequency of the different use cases, the relevance of the different payment instruments per
use case (in terms of volume and value) and the value of cost elements associated with a payment
instrument needs to be identified via a consumer survey. Consumers are asked to report their payments
for a “typical month”. This implies that the consumer disregards seasonality effects which could influence
payment behavior during certain times, e.g. holiday season spending or even unusual spending within a
week.

62.     The involvement of a professional market research firm or institute at this stage is recommended
in order to ensure accurate results and reliable and representative data to the largest possible extent.

63.    Mode: Personal interviews49 at the residence of the respondent, are ideal, as they increase the
accuracy of information collected, reduce non-response rates, and make it easier for interviewers to
probe, whenever necessary. The duration of the interview can range between 30 and 75 minutes,
depending on the respondent and the number of payment instruments covered. Alternatively, in the case
of budget limitations and difficulties to reach certain areas physically, telephone interviews should be
considered. Incentive schemes (e.g. cash, gift cards, mobile phone credits, vouchers) can increase



47 These include point of interaction, payment center, agent outlet, and telephone/mobile phone network.
48 These include Internet/designated lines and telephone/mobile phone network.
49 Also referred to as “in-person interviews” in the literature.



                                                                                                                       33
response rates among consumers, regardless of the mode used, but at the same time add to the cost of
the survey and might therefore not always be feasible.

64.      Structure: The survey collects individual payment information and as such, the respondent
provides information for payments he/she initiates or receives, rather than payment information for the
entire household. The questions in the consumer survey should be designed to best capture cost elements
per single transaction depending on the payment instrument used. By doing so the other important
parameters that affect costs such as payment type, payment purpose, and payment transmission
method/service channel, are taken into consideration. In order to capture all the relevant cost data
identified in the framework, the consumer questionnaire can be structured into three main sections. The
first section covers questions on the volume and value of retail payments (received and initiated), based
on use cases, payment instruments and transmission methods/service channels. The breakdown of
payments by use case should make it easier for consumers to recall the number of payments they receive
and initiate. The second section focuses exclusively on the cost elements. Specifically, once the volume of
payments (as well as the breakdown by use case, instrument and transmission method) has been
captured, the next step is to capture the individual cost elements associated with using specific payment
instruments and transmission methods. For this section, respondents are requested to provide their
perception, since it is impossible for them to have an accurate estimate, especially for time-based costs.
The third section covers socio-demographic data (e.g. age, gender, education, employment status, card
ownership, access to transaction accounts, etc.). The intent is to use the socio-demographics for
regression analysis, tabulations, as well as for extrapolation purposes to the entire population of the
implementing country. See a list of sample questions in Box 2 (please note that the terminology has been
slightly adapted in order to simplify the questionnaire compared to the methodology, depending on the
country specifics further adaptations in terminology are likely to be needed).

65.    Apart from the generally accepted factors in social science determining the survey design, there
are some factors that are specific to the cost study. Selecting the sampling technique is one of the most
important steps in designing the survey. The sampling technique will play a significant role in determining
the appropriate size of the sample necessary to obtain accurate results.

66.      Sampling: Stratification is the recommended technique and the most cost efficient way of
choosing the sample, conducting the survey, and achieving national representativeness. Regardless of the
country implementing the survey, certain factors (e.g. margin of errors) can be determined in advance,
while other factors, such as expected non-response rate, will vary by country. These are all factors that
affect the derivation of a precise sample size, and as such, a sample size for the survey cannot be pre-
determined but rather has to be specified on a country by country basis. However, the sampling technique
plays a major role in determining the quality of the survey, rather than the sample size itself. Thus, if
countries use the same sampling technique, results can still be compared regardless of the exact sample
size used. For reference, global surveys such as the Findex normally use sample sizes that range between
500 and 1,000 respondents, for most countries, while for large countries such as China and India, the
sample reaches 2,000 respondents.50

67.      Sampling Frame: The target population, the population from which the actual sample is selected,
is usually the entire civilian, non-institutionalized population, aged 15 years and older. If a country desires
to exclude certain regions from the sampling frame because they are difficult to access in terms of security

representativeness.

68.    Stratification: It is recommended that the initial phase of stratification results in the creation of
two main strata: urban and rural. As a second step, the urban and rural strata can be further stratified
separately by district/region, and finally, the districts can be sub-divided into census enumeration areas.

69.     Selection of Units: There are two different ways a researcher could draw enumeration areas (and
thus households) from the different districts. The first one is the so-called probability proportional to
sample size whereby the number of households to be surveyed from each district is derived as follows:
the percentage of the population represented in each district will also be used as the percentage of
sampled households (from entire sample) for the respective district. The second way uses a
disproportionate sample in terms of probability. Specifically, the population distribution does not matter,
but rather, enumeration areas are chosen in a random order (e.g. every fifth enumeration area). Then,
households are chosen from the selected enumeration areas (typically an equal number of households
for each enumeration area), and eventually, individual respondents from the households. In order to
maximize the quality of information obtained, the person with the highest frequency of payments could
be selected for the interview, or to further enhance statistical accuracy, the respondent can be chosen
randomly.

II.1.5. Calculation and reporting of retail payment costs for consumers

70.      Before the data analysis, it is important to examine the data for missing and ineligible entries. For
the latter part, having a designated program for data entry can help to filter out any ineligible entries or
data beyond the specified range. It is often the case that the top and bottom one percent of data are
removed from the final data set in order to capture outliers. In terms of missing data, that can either be
treated as such during the analysis phase (since most data analysis software recognize missing data) or be
imputed using data imputation techniques (e.g., substituting the missing values with the average of the
existing values).

71.     Most of the data pertaining to costs borne by consumers are direct and variable costs and can be
allocated upfront to single transactions (e.g. travel time, waiting time, and transaction time) for

                                                                                                                           36
consumers in their role as payer and/or payee. However, data for some cost elements will be obtained
per period (e.g. on a weekly, monthly, or annual basis) rather than on a per transaction basis. These are
mainly indirect and fixed costs such as fees associated with the underlying transaction account and/or
payment instruments (e.g. annual fees for opening and maintaining a transaction account, reconciliation
time per month). Upon data analysis, though, these cost elements will be allocated to single payment
transactions using transaction volume as the main allocation key, in order to create a common basis. Since
transaction volume data will be available from the consumer survey, indirect and fixed costs can then be
divided by the volume of payment transactions (per period) across payment instruments, use cases, and
service channels.51

72.     The average monetary value per cost element will be calculated from the data obtained via the
consumer survey. If these cost elements are direct costs per transaction, they should be added up for
every use case and multiplied by the number of payments initiated/received by the average consumer
per annum per use case. For indirect costs, appropriate multipliers need to be identified and used, rather
than simply applying the number of transactions (e.g. a time factor). The relevant cost data obtained via
the consumer survey should be complemented and/or quality checked against supply side data available
via secondary sources (e.g. price databases, price sheets from the PSP, etc.).

73.      Once all cost elements are expressed per payment, they can all be summed up, as a first step, in
order to report the cost associated with a single use case payment, the instrument and the service channel
through which it has been received or initiated (e.g. a single payment in cash performed at the point of
interaction for the purchase of goods). As a second step, the per payment cost figures can be multiplied
by the annual volume figures in order to generate estimated annual cost figures associated with the
different payment instruments and payment purposes, for the payer and the payee, separately. If a cost
is a resource or a transfer cost does not matter as such to the consumer, since it is still borne by them.
The differentiation is important for calculating the total costs to the economy.

74.     As such, this approach allows the understanding and reporting of cost results on two bases: firstly,
on a structural per payment basis, for a single payment purpose, the instrument and the service channel
associated with it; and secondly, on an annual basis, for all annual transactions for a specific payment
purpose, using a specific payment instrument and transmission method.

75.     Particular emphasis should be placed on quality control procedures. Internal control procedures
should occur in order to detect potential mismatches and inconsistencies in the data captured in the
surveys. Moreover, given the unique nature of cost data and potential measurement errors, external
sources should also be used in order to compare and validate the survey data. For instance, annual
financial reports, central bank data, prior cost surveys (if any), private sector reports, to mention a few,
are examples of external sources that could be used for quality control. In addition, sensitivity analysis is
of equal importance in order to see how sensitive the results are to certain assumptions. Quality control
procedures and sensitivity analysis should be performed for the data gathered for each stakeholder, on
the demand and supply side.




51For this methodology, it is assumed that the cost function associated with the different payment instruments is linear (on volume), and
therefore, dividing by the volume will lead to equal cost allocation across payments.

II.2.    RETAIL PAYMENT COSTS BORNE BY BUSINESSES

76.     This section applies the cost methodology to businesses as one category of the PSU, in their role
as payers and/or payees. Specifically, it does so by guiding the reader through the steps of identifying the
relevant payment types and use cases for businesses and linking them to the respective service channels
and payment instruments.

II.2.1. Classification of business retail payments by type

77.      Payment types highlight the interaction between businesses and other PSUs, while identifying the
role of businesses as payer and/or payee. While the use cases per payment type might differ from country
to country, the payment types as such should be universally applicable and it can be assumed that at least
one use case per payment type exists in every country. Payment types can be grouped according to the
role of businesses in the retail payment process, i.e. whether they are acting as payers, payees or both. In
the following paragraph, the different types of retail payments involving businesses are listed and some
typical use cases are mentioned. For a detailed list of use cases the reader is referred to sub-section II.2.2.

            P=Person, B=Business, G=Government



78.   If one business is in the role of the payee and another one in the role of the payer, these
payments are referred to as Business-to-Business (B2B) payments.

     a. Business-to-business (B2B) payments are generally characterized by a large number of
        transactions on a daily-basis, ranging from large-value payments associated with large inter-
        industry transactions (which are not in focus of this methodology), to low-value payments
        between small, medium and large-sized enterprises. Typically, payments for procurement of
        consumable goods, supply chain products and professional services are included under retail
        payments as defined by this methodology. In addition, the B2B category includes payments for
        regular transport expenses, payments for utilities and other periodic bills, and payments for
        financial services (including insurance). The reorganization of a business’ own funds, e.g. deposits
        of cash and cheques, the supply of change, and transfers of funds between businesses’ own
        accounts, can be considered as B2B payments too.

79.      If only the payer is a business, the relevant use cases can be grouped into B2P and B2G type of
retail payments:

     a. Business-to-person (B2P) payments are normally characterized by a large number of transactions
        of relatively small value. They typically involve periodic transactions in compensation for the work
        rendered by employees, i.e. payrolls (wages, salaries, and incentives).52

     b. Business-to-government (B2G) payments are typically periodic payments, usually characterized
        by a large number of transactions of varying value. B2G payments typically include corporate tax
        payments (e.g. income taxes, sales taxes and value-added taxes), fees for government services
        (e.g. company registration; permits, etc.), penalties paid by businesses (e.g. fines, etc.) and
        employer’s share of social security contributions. In a lot of countries it is also the responsibility
        of the employer to pay the employee’s income tax and social security contribution directly to the
        government agency. These transactions would be considered as B2G payments too.

80.      If only the payee is a business, the relevant use cases can be grouped into P2B and G2B type of
retail payments:

     a. Person-to-business (P2B) payments are characterized by large volumes and varying values
        (depending on the type of good/service the payment is made for). They typically involve payments
        for retail goods and services, payments for regular transport expenses, payments for utilities and
        other periodic bills (e.g. utility bills, rent, etc.), financial services (including insurance) and
        payments for consumer durables (e.g. electronics, furniture, etc.). It is important to emphasize
        that this category also covers payments to individuals acting as entrepreneurs (e.g. one-person

52
 Large, state-owned enterprises (e.g. electricity or water distribution companies), unless they are now separate entity but rather part of a
Ministry, are also treated as businesses for the purpose of this framework.

                                                                                                                                               39
             companies and individuals receiving compensation for services rendered) and/or purchases from
             suppliers not necessarily falling into the category of retailers (e.g. fresh farm product sales) and
             to public sector enterprises which are not considered as government agencies.

        b. Government-to-business (G2B) payments are characterized by a large number of transactions
           with average value varying widely, ranging from large-value procurement contracts (which are
           not considered within this methodology) to low-value payments falling into the retail payments
           category. Specifically, they include payments made by the government (procurement) to the
           private sector for consumable goods (e.g. stationery) and capital goods (e.g. equipment,
           computers, etc.), services (e.g. cleaning, maintenance, professional services, etc.), transport
           expenses (e.g. travel expenses, gasoline, etc.), and periodic bills (e.g. utility bills, rent, etc.). G2B
           payments can also be the result of corporate tax refunds and – although not in scope of this
           analysis – the disbursement of loans, subsidies or business assistance provided to the private
           sector. For cases in which government agencies, or quasi-government organizations, are “acting
           like a business” (including all procurement related payments of government agencies), they
           should be included into the “business” category. This is especially true when the government
           agency’s accounts and payment mechanisms are entirely separate from those of the government
           accounting.

II.2.2. Identification of the relevant payment instruments and service channels per use case

81.     The use cases identified aim to represent typical payments initiated and received by businesses,
irrespective of the state of economic development of a country and/or its national payment system.
However, when conducting an actual cost study, the use cases should be critically assessed and adapted,
as appropriate, to the country-specific situation.

82.     Once the relevant use cases have been identified, those payment instruments which can be used
by businesses for the specific use cases should be identified. It is assumed that the entities implementing
the methodology know which payment instruments can be used for the identified use cases. If this is not
the case, this information should be obtained via information gathering efforts prior (e.g. focus group
discussions or consultation of business associations) to the launch of the cost of retail payments business
survey.

II.2.3. Identification of cost elements per payment instrument- service channel combination

83.     For every payment instrument identified as relevant for at least one use case, the service
channel(s) available for the use of that payment instrument, and the cost elements associated with those
payment instrument-service channel combinations need to be identified. Depending on the service
channel, the payer and the payee may face different cost elements. These cost elements can be assigned
to each specific payment instrument-service channel combination (see Table 15). For businesses, the cost
elements typically are different depending on whether or not the business is in the role of the payer or
payee. Therefore, unlike for consumers, separate analysis of the two roles is provided.

II.2.4. Sample selection and survey design for businesses

84.     Once the cost elements per payment instrument have been identified, primary data on the
relevance of the different use case/payment instrument combinations (in terms of volume) and the
monetary value of those cost elements can be obtained via a business survey. Depending on the country
context, business data may be sensitive and businesses may be reluctant to provide the necessary level
of detail to government authorities or certain external parties, in which case a neutral third party (e.g. a
market research firm or institute) might be perceived as ensuring a higher degree of confidentiality. In
countries with a high degree of formality and/or in the case of large enterprises/headquarters, it might
on the contrary be helpful if an authority (e.g. the central bank) is directly involved in approaching the
business and/or even conducting the interview.

85.      Mode: Business surveys on the cost of payment instruments are ideally conducted through
personal interviews with business representatives responsible for finance and payments of the specific
business. In addition to personal interviews, additional options and/or a combination thereof should be
offered to business (telephone, paper-based, and online interviews). Depending on the business size,
information might not be readily available for which reason follow ups contacts are likely to be needed.
Upon data analysis, branches that are part of an establishment or chain should be treated as individual
stores for sampling purposes, and the data for those stores are extrapolated in the same way as for single
store businesses. However, in addition to the branches, head-offices should be interviewed too, in order
to complement information which is not known to branch level staff (e.g. functions that are handled
centrally). Headquarter level information will also be an important quality control, when extrapolating the
individual branch level results. The length of the interview should not exceed one hour. In order to reduce
the response burden for businesses, they can be invited to share relevant raw data (e.g. cash register
data), based on which the researchers are helping them to complete the survey. Incentives for businesses
to participate could be personalized letters, e.g. signed by a high-ranking central bank representative, the
possibility to attend webinars or dissemination events for the presentation of the results, (in case of
independent business owners) the possibility to win a price, and/or the possibility have their business
listed in the acknowledgement of the report.

86.     Structure: The questionnaire for businesses can be structured in three sections. The first section
asks for aggregate data on the distribution of payment transactions initiated and received (based on
volume and value) by instrument, use case, and service channel. The second section focuses on cost
elements associated with the different payment instruments, separated based on the flow of payments
(cost elements that are unique to payment transactions initiated, cost elements that are unique to
payment transactions received, and cost elements that are common to both). The third section captures
other business-specific information (not related to payments) such as turnover, number of branches, etc.,
which are useful for extrapolation and analytical purposes. See a list of sample questions in Box 2.

87.      Sampling: It is recommended that countries use the stratification technique in the process of
drawing the sample of businesses to be surveyed. Stratification ensures proper representation of
important sub-groups, which if left to randomness, might be left out of the sample. Moreover,
stratification results in a cost efficient way of drawing the sample, as compared to using a randomly drawn
sample. The most important rule in the process of stratification is that strata should be divided in a way
that heterogeneity is observed among them while there is homogeneity within them. The main
stratification criteria for businesses include: industry, size (number of employees or annual turnover), and
geographic location. In the following paragraphs, the three main steps in this process are described.



                                                                                                         45
88.      Sampling Frame: Authorities typically have access to a database or an official business register,
which contains data for all registered businesses, based on industry, location, number of employees, and
other information. Most business surveys use the business register as the main sampling frame to draw
the sample from, and it is recommended that implementers do the same for the purpose of this survey.
In the absence of a business register or access to it, the implementing entity will need to obtain the
relevant data from alternative sources, e.g. from business associations. The main drawbacks of business
registers are that they might not be up to date and that the register would not capture the self-employed
and sole proprietors that are not registered. The former drawback is offset by the fact that they constitute
the most inclusive readily available sampling frame. The latter, the potential absence of the self-
employed, merits special attention, particularly in cases where the self-employed play a significant role in
the economy. It should therefore be thoroughly considered how to capture data for the sampling of self-
employed appropriately, e.g., via their special interest groups. Moreover, to further validate the register,
random checks could be made by calling businesses in order to verify in advance if they are still active. It
is hard to specify in advance the sample size, given that it will depend on country specific factors. However,
for reference, the Enterprise Surveys conducted by the World Bank around the world in order to capture
private business data uses a sample size which starts from a minimum of 120 businesses and reaches
almost 2,000 businesses.56

89.      Stratification: For business surveys, it is recommended that stratification is performed at three
levels, starting at the industry level. Once the relevant industries assigned to capture and collect data
from57 have been identified, the sampling frame can be divided into the applicable industry strata.
Secondly, each industry stratum can be further divided into businesses based on size, using the number
of employees as the basis for grouping them into single-member, small size, medium size, and large size
enterprises. The thresholds for the classification into small, medium, and large size will depend on country
specific circumstances. Another alternative could be to use the level of annual turnover to classify
businesses. Thirdly, each industry stratum could also be stratified based on geographic location within the
country. This last stratification criterion is particularly useful for capturing a geographically diverse set of
SMEs, given that large industries are typically concentrated in certain areas of a country.

90.      Selection of units: The units of interest in this case are the businesses that will be surveyed. An
important step in the process, in addition to the stratification, is the allocation of units among the different
strata. In general, it is recommended that the probability proportional to sample size for the allocation of
units among the strata is used. That is, the percentage of the businesses represented in each stratum will
reflect the percentage that businesses with those specific characteristics correspond to in the “true
population” of businesses. Other alternatives could be used for countries with unique business
ecosystems.

  To facilitate the pre-identification of key businesses/ industries and characterize the inter-industry trade at the country level, the National
Income and Products Accounts (NIPAs) may be considered. NIPAs broadly involve: i) input-output accounts, which capture the intermediate inputs
(energy; raw materials; semi-finished goods and services) consumed by industries in producing its gross output; ii) the GDP by industry accounts,
which provide an industry-by-industry breakout of GDP and therefore its contribution to the economy. Thus, these widely used accounts provide
statistics on industries, their interaction with each other and the roles they play in the economy.

II.2.5. Calculation and reporting of retail payment costs for businesses

91.     While most of the cost elements in the consumer sample questions are captured per single
payment transaction, the nature of costs for businesses is such that the majority of cost elements will be
reported per period. Indeed, service costs, reconciliation time, and fraud, only to mention some,
constitute major costs borne by businesses which are typically recorded on a daily, weekly, monthly or
annual basis.

92.     Similarly as in the case of consumers, a two-step analysis process needs to be followed here. Upon
data analysis, the cost elements reported per period will still need to be disaggregated to the per
transaction level. By doing so, cost elements will be allocated to single payment transactions using
transaction volume as the main allocation key, in order to create a common basis. Since transaction
volume data will be available from the business survey, indirect and fixed costs can then be divided by the




                                                                                                                            48
volume of payment transactions (per period) across payment instruments, use cases, and service
channels.58

93.      The average monetary value per cost element will be calculated from the data obtained via the
business survey. If these cost elements are direct costs per transaction, they should be totaled for every
use case and multiplied by the number of payments initiated/received by a business per annum per use
case. For indirect costs, appropriate multipliers need to be identified and used, rather than simply applying
the number of transactions (e.g. a time factor). The relevant cost data obtained via the business survey
should be complemented and/or quality checked against supply side data available via secondary sources
(e.g. price databases, price sheets from the PSP, etc.).

94.     Once all cost elements are expressed per payment, they can all be summed up, as a first step, in
order to report the cost associated with a single use case payment, the instrument and the service channel
through which it has been received or initiated (e.g. a single payment in cash received at the point of
interaction for the sale of goods).

95.      Eventually, though, once the per-transaction allocation has been achieved for each cost element,
the volume of payments will be used for the reverse process, that of the aggregation of costs to annual59
levels, by multiplying cost per transaction with the annual volumes60. Whether a cost is a resource or a
transfer cost, that does not matter as such to the business as it is still a cost borne by them. The
differentiation is important for calculating the total costs to the economy and to policymaking, business
decisions (in terms of fees paid to outsource services), and efforts to enhance the efficiency of payment
services.

96.      As such, this approach allows the understanding and reporting of cost results on two bases: firstly,
on a structural per payment basis, for a single use case, the payment instrument and the service channel
associated with it; and secondly, on an annual basis, for all annual transactions for a specific use case,
using a specific payment instrument and transmission method.

97.     The total costs for all the businesses of an economy can be calculated by multiplying the average
costs per business of a certain category of businesses (small, medium, large-sized) and industry by the
total number of businesses within this category of businesses in that economy. Calculations and separate
analyses can also be performed for a sub-set of businesses surveyed, in order to explore more in-depth
the patterns of certain industries or business sizes that might be of particular interest.

98.     Particular emphasis should be placed on quality control procedures. Internal control procedures
should occur in order to detect potential mismatches and inconsistencies of the data captured in the
surveys. Moreover, given the unique nature of cost data and potential measurement errors, external
sources should also be used in order to compare and validate the survey data. For instance, annual
financial reports, central bank data, prior cost surveys (if any), private sector reports, to mention a few,
are examples of external sources that could be used for quality control. In addition, sensitivity analysis is
of equal importance in order to see how sensitive the results are to certain assumptions. Quality control



58 For this methodology, it is assumed that the cost function associated with the different payment instruments is linear (on volume), and
therefore, dividing by the volume will lead to equal cost allocation across payments.
59
   Businesses usually keep records based on fiscal rather than calendar year. It could also be the case that the dates for the fiscal year for different
businesses vary. Even though such deviations are not expected to affect the results in a drastic way, the specification of the calendar and fiscal
year dates should accompany the analysis.
60 It should be noted that the sample questions do not capture volumes on annual basis, since it is hard for the respondent to recall annual

volumes. Volume questions are typically asked on a weekly and monthly basis, and then extrapolated to an annual basis.

                                                                                                                                                    49
procedures and sensitivity analysis should be performed for the data gathered for each stakeholder on
the demand and supply side.

II.3.     RETAIL PAYMENT COSTS BORNE BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES

99.     This section applies the cost methodology to government agencies as the PSU in their role as
payers and payees.

II.3.1. Classification of government agency retail payments by type

100. Government payment types highlight the interaction of government agencies with other PSUs
while identifying the role of government agencies as payer and/or payee. While the use cases per payment
type might differ from country to country, the payment types as such should be universally applicable and
it can be assumed that at least one use case per payment type exists in every country. Payment types can
be grouped according to the role of government agencies in the retail payment process, i.e. whether they
are acting as payers, payees or both. In the following the different types of retail payments involving
government agencies are listed and some typical use cases are mentioned. For a detailed list of use cases
the reader is referred to sub-section II.3.2.

                               Table 19: Data to types of retail payments for the demand side

                         Business                B2P                              B2B                        B2G
                   Government Agency             G2P                              G2B                        G2G61

101. Government related retail payments represent typically a significant proportion of a nation’s
overall retail payment volume and value, in both developed as well as in developing economies. The scale
of governments’ use of the retail payment services is an important consideration for policy makers.
Improvements in the way government payments are disbursed, collected and processed can have a
significant positive impact on the economy and catalytic effects on the payment system as a whole. The
government’s share of the volume and value of retail payments can be measured directly in countries
where overall retail payment volumes and values are tracked and the government maintains accurate
records on their payment activity. If this information is not available, an approximation can be determined
from the size and influence of the government in domestic economic activity. Specifically, the share of
government expenditures plus government revenue in GDP62 will provide a rough proxy measure of the
activity of the government in retail payments relative to overall retail payment activity.

102. If one government agency is in the role of the payee and another one in the role of the payer ,
these payments are referred to as government-to-government (G2G) payments.

     a. Government-to-government (G2G) payments are typically intra-governmental transfers from
        one government agency to another for budget allocation or extra-budgetary purposes, or
        transfers from one level of government to another. Compared to other types of government
        payments, an average G2G payment is typically large in terms of value, while the number of

61 G2G payments will be considered only in the context of secondary activities such as cash receipts and cheques, supply of change, and
transfer of funds between own accounts.
62 The relative importance of government payments is naturally correlated to the size and influence of the government in the overall economy,

which is usually measured in terms of government expenditures as a share of the GDP, and/or tax collections as a share of the GDP. In the

                                                                                                                                           51
       transactions made is relatively small. Government agencies, just like consumers and businesses,
       also conduct payments across their own accounts. These transactions include, for example,
       deposits of daily cash receipts and cheques and transfers of funds between accounts. Given the
       important role these transactions play in government payments, they are included in the G2G
       payments under consideration here. In that regard, it is worth underscoring that one category of
       G2G payments, i.e., intra-governmental transfers, are not included in this cost methodology given
       the fact that such transfers are typically of large value that do not qualify as day-to-day retail
       payments. However, G2G transactions on government agencies’ own accounts are included here.

103. If only the payer is a government agency, the relevant use cases can be grouped into G2P and
G2B type of retail payments.

   a. Government-to-person (G2P) payments are typically associated with social benefit transfers (e.g.
      conditional cash transfers, child support payments, or student allowances), government
      employee salaries, pension payments, and tax refunds, among others. G2P payments are normally
      characterized by a very large number of transactions of relatively small value per transaction.

   b. Government-to-business (G2B) payments are characterized by a large number of transactions
      with values varying widely, ranging from large-value procurement contracts (which are not
      considered in this framework) to retail payments. While in section I.5 G2B payments have been
      discussed from the perspective of the business as the payee, the focus here is on the government
      agencies in their role as payer. One major category of G2B payments, includes those made by the
      government for the procurement of consumable goods (e.g. stationery) and capital goods (e.g.
      equipment, computers), services (e.g. cleaning, maintenance, professional services), transport
      expenses (e.g. travel expenses, gasoline), periodic bills (e.g. utility bills, rent). For these payments
      government agencies might “act like a business”. On the other hand, given the government’s
      significant presence in the payment industry, the government may face different payment costs
      than businesses. Thus, it is recommended to address such G2B payments separately from similar
      B2B payments. A second major category of G2B payments include corporate tax refunds, and a
      third, although not in scope of this analysis, the disbursement of loans, subsidies or business
      assistance provided by the public sector.

104. If only the payee is a government agency, the relevant use cases can be grouped into P2G and
B2G type of retail payments.

   a. Person-to-government (P2G) payments include payments made by citizens to the central and
      regional government agencies in the form of tax payments (e.g. personal income taxes if paid
      directly by employees/persons and not by their employer), the employee's share of social security
      contributions, payments for obtaining services from government agencies (e.g. licenses, permits),
      penalties (e.g. fines), and other obligations to regional and central government authorities. P2G
      payments tend to be of small-value and large volume, given the typical scope of applicability
      across the population.

   b. Business-to-government (B2G) payments include payments made by businesses to government
      agencies in the form of tax payments (e.g. corporate income taxes, corporate sales taxes, value-
      added taxes, and personal income taxes paid on behalf of employees where applicable), the
      employer’s share of social security contributions, payments for obtaining services (e.g. permits)
      and penalties (e.g. fines). The discussion of B2G payments in section I.5 focused on the
      perspective of the business as the payer, the focus here is on the government agencies in their


                                                                                                           52
           role as payee. B2G are a mirror of G2B payments with regard to average size and transactional
           volumes (i.e. varying size and large number of payments).

II.3.2. Identification of the relevant payment instruments and service channels per use case

105. The use cases identified aim to represent typical payments initiated and received by government
agencies, irrespective of the state of economic development of a country and/or its national payment
system. However, when conducting an actual cost study, the use cases should be assessed and adapted,
as appropriate, to accurately reflect the range of transactions conducted by the government.

106. Once the relevant use cases have been determined, those payment instruments, which can be
used by government agencies for the specific use cases, should be identified. It is assumed that the entities
implementing this methodology know which payment instruments can be used for the identified use
cases. If this is not the case, this information should be obtained from the relevant government agencies,
prior to the launch of the government survey.

II.3.3. Identification of cost elements per payment instrument - service channel combination

107. For every payment instrument identified as relevant for at least one use case, the service channels
available for the use of that payment instrument, and the cost elements associated with those payment
instrument-service channel combinations, need to be identified. Depending on the service channel, the

63 For every use case the choice of all payment instruments should be provided. The same applies for businesses and government agencies.
64 For every use case the choice of all payment transmission methods should be provided. The same applies for businesses and government
agencies.
65 The suggested framework does not consider other G2G payments such as intra-governmental (across agencies within the same country) and

inter-governmental (across government entities of different countries) since they typically include large-value payments.
66 For those payments where government agencies “act like a business”, they are considered under the B2B type of payments. In fa ct all use

cases listed there, with the exception of “Payments for procurement of supply chain products and services” also apply to government agencies.

                                                                                                                                          53
payer and the payee may face different cost elements. These cost elements can be assigned to each
specific payment instrument-service channel combination (see Table 21). Given that in the case of
government agencies the cost elements may differ depending whether or not the government agency is
in the role of the payer or payee, like for businesses, a separate analysis of the two roles is provided.

II.3.4. Sample selection and survey design for government agencies

108. Once the cost elements per payment instrument have been identified, quantitative information
on the monetary value of those costs can be obtained via a survey of the financial management units of
the relevant government agencies, including the Ministry of Finance. If central banks or other authorities
are the entities implementing this methodology, they might consider conducting the government



                                                                                                                        57
agencies’ surveys on their own, bearing in mind that they are relatively small in number and the
information obtained may be sensitive.

109. Mode: Personal interviews with the financial management units of government agencies are
recommended. Multiple visits might be required, no longer than one hour each. In certain cases, the
questionnaires can be sent electronically to agencies to fill out, along with detailed instructions, for a more
cost efficient procedure.

110. Structure: The structure of the government agency questionnaire is similar to the equivalent for
businesses. The difference being that some customization might be needed for the different government
agencies that will participate in the survey, depending on their function. Despite any potential
customization, the questionnaire can be structured in three standardized sections. The first section asks
for aggregate data on the distribution of payments initiated and received (based on volume and value) by
instrument, use case, and service channel, relevant to the agency. Payments that do not meet the
definition or retail payments (even if not large in terms of value) as defined in this methodology, should
not be captured. The second section focuses on individual cost elements associated with the different
payment instruments. The third section captures other agency-unique information (not related to
payments) such as, number of offices, number of employees, etc., which are useful for extrapolation and
analytical purposes. See Box 3 for sample questions.

111. Sampling: Unlike the consumer and business surveys where representative surveys are
suggested, if possible, all central government agencies and units with authority to directly initiate or
collect payments to/from consumers and businesses and/or directly manage their own accounts should
be surveyed. Depending on the country, for regional and municipal government agencies, a representative
sample might be surveyed (based on stratification criteria such as region and size of community they
represent). Government payments are quite unique in that the processes followed and the instruments
used are specific to country circumstances. Moreover, given that government agencies differ in their role
and their daily operations, it is challenging to specify upfront a designated way to collect data on the costs
associated with the payment instruments used by the government, and to propose a specific sampling
technique. The level of centralization of government payments is a key determinant of the scope of the
survey, in terms of number of participants to be surveyed. If a centralized treasury single account model
prevails, the Treasury initiates most government payments on behalf of government agencies, and
collects most payments for the government. In such circumstances, it is the financial management unit in
the Treasury that determines which payment instruments are used and responsible for the adoption of
new payment technologies. In contrast, if the government’s payment system is decentralized, each
government agency initiates payments via their own accounts (either at the central bank or at PSP) and
collects fees directly from the public. In between, there are multiple variations.

II.3.5. Calculation and reporting of retail payment costs for government agencies

112. In order to draw conclusions on the cost of different payment instruments for government
agencies, the direct costs for these payment instruments have to be totaled and an appropriate
distribution of indirect costs determined. Similarly to the consumer and business analyses, a two-step
analysis process needs to be followed. Upon data analysis, the cost elements reported per period will still
need to be disaggregated to the per transaction level for every payment instrument, using the volume of
payments per payment instrument as the main allocation criterion.

113. For government agencies and businesses, many of the cost elements associated with particular
payment use cases are captured and reported periodically. Indeed, service costs, infrastructure costs,
damage costs and reconciliation time, to name a few, constitute major costs borne by government
agencies, and are usually recorded daily, weekly, monthly, or annually.

114. If indirect costs apply to several payment instruments, the value of the indirect costs per annum
should be assigned to the different payment instruments according to their share of transaction volume72.

115. The average monetary value per cost element will be calculated from the data obtained via the
government survey. If these cost elements are direct costs per transaction, they should be totaled for
every use case and multiplied by the number of payments initiated/received by a government agency per
annum per use case. For indirect costs, appropriate multipliers need to be identified and used, rather than
simply applying the number of transactions (e.g. a time factor).

116. Once all cost elements are expressed per payment, they can all be summed up, as a first step, in
order to report the cost associated with a single use case payment, the instrument and the service channel
through which it has been received or initiated (e.g. a single payment in cash made via a payment center
to the beneficiary of a social transfer).

117. Eventually, though, once the per-transaction allocation has been achieved for each cost element,
the volume of payments will be used for the reverse process, that of the aggregation of costs to annual73
levels, by multiplying cost per transaction with the annual volumes.

118. As such, this approach allows the understanding and reporting of cost results on two bases: firstly,
on a structural per payment basis, for a single use case, the payment instrument and the service channel
associated with it; and secondly, on an annual basis, for all annual transactions for a specific use case,
using a specific payment instrument and transmission method.

119. The total costs for all government agencies can be calculated by adding the costs of all individual
surveyed government agencies and extrapolating the results for any that were not surveyed. A more in-
depth analysis can be performed for certain regional or local government units, if the payment costs for
those government units incur is of particular interest.




72
   For this methodology, it is assumed that the cost function associated with the different payment instruments is linear (on volume), and
therefore, dividing by the volume will lead to equal cost allocation across payments.
73 Government agencies usually keep records based on fiscal rather than calendar year. It could also be the case that the dates for the fiscal year

for different businesses vary. Even though such deviations are not expected to affect the results in a drastic way, the specification of the calendar
and fiscal year dates should accompany the analysis.

            III. OVERVIEW OF COST ELEMENTS FOR THE SUPPLY SIDE
         (PAYMENT SERVICE AND PAYMENT INFRASTRUCTURE PROVIDERS)

120. The methodology for assessing the costs of retail payments addresses the demand side and the
supply side separately, by identifying and measuring the costs borne by all actors in the payments process
chain. This part of the framework focuses on the supply side, which comprises actors providing services
and infrastructure to demand side actors (i.e. payment service users: consumers, businesses, and
government agencies) and/or other supply-side actors.

121. Both, the supply side as well as the demand side of the methodology can be implemented
independently if a country is interested in examining only the costs borne by suppliers or those borne by
users. However, only if both – the retail payments’ costs for the supply and the demand side - have been
assessed, the overall costs of retail payments for a country’s economy can be calculated (after adjusting
for transfer costs).

122. For identifying the costs borne by the supply side, two categories of supply side actors have been
identified in this guide, and detailed in the following section: payment service providers (PSP) and
payment infrastructure providers (PIP). The supply side methodology, where necessary, deviates from the
demand side methodology, given that supply and demand side costs are different in nature. However, the
core components of the methodology are the same.

123. Payment service providers (PSP) issue payment instruments (e.g. cash, payment cards, e-money)
to PSU and/or offer services, which allow PSU to initiate retail payments with a given payment instrument,
including supporting services (e.g. opening and maintaining transaction accounts). A central bank is
typically the issuer of banknotes and coins, while commercial banks, micro-finance institutions, e-money
institutions, and other non-bank PSP (e.g. payment institutions) are issuers of non-cash (including
electronic) payment instruments. In addition to PSPs that issue payment instruments and (in the case of
non-cash payments) typically maintain transaction accounts, there are institutions which offer over-the-
counter cash-in/cash-out transaction services (e.g. money transfer operators) or additional functions (e.g.
currency exchange bureaus if foreign currency plays a considerable role in a country’s retail payment
system).

124. Payment infrastructure providers (PIP) provide payment infrastructure services typically to the
PSP and not directly to the PSU. Typical services provided by the PIP include cash logistic services or (for
non-cash payments) authorization, switching, clearing, and netting and/or settlement services.

125. It is important to emphasize that the present methodology follows a functional approach rather
than an institutional approach when identifying and measuring the costs associated with the PSP/PIP.
Depending on the market conditions, one institution can fall into the PSP as well as the PIP category. A
typical example of this would be central banks, which in many countries do not only issue currency (a PSP
function), but also offer payment settlement and sometimes even payment switching, clearing and netting
services (PIP functions).

126. Payment related supply side costs associated with supporting activities outside the PSP/PIP
sphere (e.g. card manufacturing, banknote printing, coin minting, provision of telecommunication
services, and production of POS-terminals) are considered as transfer costs of the PSP/PIP when
outsourced to other PSP/PIP and as resource costs when outsourced to non-PIP/non-PSP. This distinction
is important for accurately calculating the total costs for the economy as described in part IV.


                                                                                                         63
127. Whenever relevant, the measurement of the supply side costs should also takes into
consideration the service channels, via which payment services are offered. This will mainly be relevant
for PSP and their service offering to PSU.

128. All payment instruments taken into consideration on the demand side also have to be analyzed
from the supply side perspective. Table 25 below summarizes and classifies cost elements borne by PSP
and PIP based on their type (resource vs. transfer) and functional cost category, followed by the definitions
of each cost element. Most cost elements are classified as resource costs. However, it is important to
distinguish the instances where the activities associated with particular cost elements are outsourced to
other surveyed PSP/PIP. In order to avoid double-counting costs in these cases, it is important to make a
distinction between the cases where an activity is outsourced to (i) another surveyed PSP/PIP and where
an activity is outsourced to (ii) a third party (which is neither a PSP nor PIP) or to a type of PSP/PIP not
surveyed for the study. In the first case, the outsourcing fee paid is considered a transfer cost, while in
the second, it is considered a resource cost since the cost of performing the outsourced activity is not
accounted for elsewhere.

129. Production/procurement costs are associated with the production of payment instruments (both
paper-based and electronic), which have some type of physical representation.74 They are fees and
charges paid to stakeholders in the retail payment process not necessarily covered by this methodology
(e.g. specialized banknote printing companies, mints, card manufacturers, cheque printing companies).
This cost include the following cost elements:

        a. Production/procurement costs of banknotes are paid (in case of sourcing from an external
           banknote printing company) or calculated (banknote printing is done in-house by the currency
           issuer) cost per unit (banknote, bundle or brick) and denomination of banknote. This includes all
           costs associated with the production of banknotes (e.g. raw materials, staff costs, facilities
           maintenance, etc.).

        b. Production/procurement costs of coins are paid (in case of sourcing from an external minting
           company) or calculated (minting is done in-house currency issuer) cost per unit and denomination
           of coins. This includes all costs associated with the production of coins (e.g. raw materials, staff
           costs, facilities maintenance, etc.).

        c. Production/procurement costs of cheques/direct credit transfer paper forms/direct debit
           transfer mandate paper forms are paid (in case of sourcing from an external printing company)
           or calculated (printing is done in-house) cost per unit. This includes all costs associated with the
           production (e.g. raw materials, staff costs, facilities maintenance, etc.).

        d. Production/procurement costs of payment cards are paid (in case of sourcing from an external
           card manufacturing company) or calculated (certain activities) cost per unit. This includes all costs
           associated with the production (e.g. raw materials, staff costs, facilities maintenance, etc.) of the
           payment card.




74   These costs do not include handling, quality control and personalization costs.

130. Issuing, reissuing and destruction costs are associated with payment instruments which have
physical representation. These are costs incurred for processes related to the proper handling, quality
control, and personalization (where relevant) of payment instruments after they are produced, but before
they are distributed or redistributed to PSU. They include the following cost elements:

        a. Banknote (re-)issuing costs refer to costs of checking, sorting, counting, and packaging of
           banknotes, but without the effective transport of banknotes.

        b. Coin (re-)issuing costs refer to costs of checking, sorting, counting, and packaging of coins, but
           without the effective transport of coins.

        c. Banknote destruction costs refer to cost of destroying unfit banknotes, whereas any revenues
           from selling destroyed banknote materials are to be deducted.

        d. Coin destruction costs refer to cost of destroying unfit coins, whereas any revenues from selling
           destroyed coin materials are to be deducted.

        e. Cheque/payment card issuing costs refer to costs of personalizing cheques/payment cards, but
           without the effective transport of cheques and cards.

131. Logistic costs are the costs of transporting payment instruments with physical representation to
their designated PSU or between different PSP or PIP locations (typically in the case of cash)81. They
include the following cost elements:

        a. Cash logistic costs are associated with the movement of banknotes and coins between the central
           bank’s main vault, cash centers and/or other PSP in the process of issuing and/or collecting
           banknotes and coins (including staff costs, transport costs, and depreciation costs).

        b. Cheque/payment card logistic costs are the costs of providing new or existing customers with
           cheques/payment cards.

132. Time costs are associated with time spent by PSP assisting customers in effecting deposits,
withdrawals, or payment transactions over the counter or remotely:

        a. Transaction time includes time spent by employees in accepting customer cash deposits and
           withdrawals, cheque deposits or cash-outs, initiating direct credit transfers, establishment of
           standing orders and direct debit transfers, etc. Includes payments initiated over the counter or
           remotely with the PSP. As mentioned for the time cost elements of the PSU, it is recommended
           to complement the information received via the survey by measuring the effective time in the
           field (e.g. within bank branches).

133. Payment handling costs are costs accrued when a PSU initiates a payment to until that payment
is settled, including costs associated with returned and disputed payments. They include the following
cost elements:




81   Security costs and any possible losses that may be incurred during transportation are not included here.

                                                                                                                66
   a. Truncation costs include costs of scanning, archiving and managing paper cheques and/or card
      payments/direct credit transfers initiated on paper forms, direct debit transfer paper mandates,
      etc.

   b. Authorization costs include costs of processing the payment authorization request for certain
      payment instruments (e.g. payment cards, direct debit transfers, online money or mobile money)
      by verifying whether a specific transaction can be executed (e.g. right credentials, sufficient
      account balance), including costs related to maintaining databases with authorization-related
      data.

   c. Payment processing costs includes the costs of processing a cheque, payment card, direct debit
      transfer, or direct credit transfer transaction, from the point when the transaction is authorized
      to until the customer’s account is debited and the retailer’s account is credited. This includes
      clearing, netting, and settlement of the payment.

   d. Return costs due to insufficient balance are the costs of returning a payment after authorization
      that could not be settled due to insufficient funds (e.g. if the authorization process does not
      involve blocking of the respective amount).

   e. Cancelation costs includes the costs involved in canceling a cheque, payment card, direct debit
      transfer or direct credit transfer order before a transaction is settled, as well as chargeback
      processing costs associated with disputed transactions that have been settled.

134. Payments-specific infrastructure and maintenance costs are costs for the depreciation and
maintenance of equipment and for performing of processes, whose sole purpose is to make payment
instruments or payment-related services available. They include the following cost elements:

   a. Vault maintenance costs are the costs associated with the maintenance of currency vaults,
      including facility costs (rent, depreciation, utilities, surveillance, facility insurance, etc.), if not
      already covered under one or the other operative cost elements.

      costs, costs associated with night safe deposits, etc., not covered under ‘vault maintenance costs’
      or other cost elements.

   c. Payments-specific IT costs include costs for payments-related software developments, interfaces
      for internet banking, interfaces with ATM/POS networks and other centralized infrastructures,
      etc. This cost element excludes ATM maintenance costs and POS terminal management costs.

   d. ATM maintenance costs include the costs associated with machine maintenance and
      depreciation of ATMs.

   e. POS management costs include costs of managing and maintaining POS terminals (e.g. costs
      associated with machine maintenance and depreciation, staff, IT and communications, rent, etc.).

   f.   Loyalty program costs refer to costs related to loyalty programs, like bonus miles, insurance, cash
        back transactions and other benefits, to the extent not covered by other cost elements.

   g. Switching costs are associated with routing authorization and authentication-related messages
      and the payment transactions as such between participating PSPs in a payment scheme.


                                                                                                           67
   h. Clearing costs are associated with the process of transmitting, reconciling, confirming payment
      orders prior to settlement, including the netting of instructions and the establishment of final
      positions for settlement.

   i.   Settlement costs are associated with the process of discharging obligations in respect of funds
        transfers between two or more parties.

135. Security costs include losses and the costs of preventing potential losses of value from holding
payment instruments or providing services related to payment instruments due to unforeseen
circumstances or illegal activity. They include the following cost elements:

   a. Insurance costs with respect to cash, include insurance premiums paid against losses induced by
      activities related to the production, issuing, collecting, storing and destroying of banknotes and
      coins. With respect to non-cash payment instruments, insurance premiums paid against losses
      induced by activities related to the production of payment instruments (where relevant) and
      processing of payment transactions.

   b. Costs of loss, robbery, fraud and theft are costs induced by the occurrence of loss, fraud and/or
      theft of banknotes and coins and non-cash payment instruments, to the extent that they are not
      covered by insurance.

   c. Fraud prevention costs are the costs of managing the risk of fraud, excluding the costs for
      insurance against fraud. These include costs associated with procedures in the event of
      cheque/card loss or theft (including customer service, reissuing and delivering of cheques/cards,
      etc.) to the extent that they are not covered under any other cost element and/or are not paid by
      the PSU; maintaining and monitoring “black lists” and other attempts for fraudulent card use;
      investigating fraud attempts; etc.

136. Costs for supporting activities include all costs for activities that are related to payment
instruments and payment-related services and are of foundational and/or supporting nature. They include
the following cost elements:

   a. Transaction account costs are associated with opening, maintaining and closing transaction
      accounts, as well as costs for producing and delivering periodic account statements to customers,
      to the extent not covered by other cost elements. These costs can be one-off and/or ongoing,
      suggesting that some of them will recur and some will vary from period to period.

   b. Marketing and advertising costs refer to costs for marketing and information dissemination
      aimed at acquiring new customers and/or campaigns targeting existing customers. It is important
      to note that this cost element contains two types of costs: i) the costs associated with new
      customer campaigns are one-off costs that may not recur periodically, and ii) the costs associated
      with educating and offering new services to existing customers are mainly ongoing, that is, they
      are recurring costs. Campaigns specifically aiming to educate existing and/or potential customers
      should also be included under this cost element.

   c. Acquiring and training costs include the costs associated with acquiring and training employees,
      agents and/or merchants accepting certain payment instruments (e.g. costs associated with staff,
      marketing and advertising, etc.).




                                                                                                     68
     d. Customer support costs refer to costs for responding to customer complaints or providing further
        clarifications related to a particular payment instrument/transaction account activity/loyalty
        programs (including staff costs, consumables, etc.), to the extent not included in other cost
        elements.

     e. Archiving costs are associated with moving paper or electronic data that is no longer actively used
        to a separated database for retention and costs associated with maintaining existing archives as
        required by law or by the needs of the PSP/PIP.

     f.   Overhead costs are associated with staff, rent for branch office buildings, utilities, depreciation
          of resources, general IT and communications, back office processing, archiving, as well as any
          other costs for supporting activities related to payment instruments/services, to the extent not
          included in other cost elements.

137. Service fees are fees and charges paid to another stakeholder in the retail payment process, in
most cases to the PSP or PIP. They include the following cost elements:

     a. License fees refer to costs paid by the PSP to governance authorities of payment schemes, under
        the agreement established with these companies for the issuing and/or acquiring of payment
        instruments.

     b. Interchange fees are transaction fees payable in the context of a payment scheme by one
        participating PSP to another, for example by an acquirer to a card issuer.

     c. Agent commission fees include fees paid to agents for registering new customers and/or carrying
        out transactions.

III.1     ACTIVITY-BASED COSTING APPROACH

138. Activity-Based Costing82 (ABC) has been the approach for disaggregating the costs borne by
suppliers of retail payment services in previous cost studies. However, it seems that the ABC-approach is
often considered too complex and time-consuming for supply side respondents, which might, in the worst
cases, adversely affect the willingness to respond. Therefore, this document suggests a simplified version
of ABC to identify the costs for the supply side, by still following the cause and effect approach, which
suggests that there is an immediate relationship between the costs incurred for performing a particular
organizational activity and the retail payment instruments/services offered as a result of performing this
activity. As such, this methodology allows for accurately allocating costs to a particular retail payment
instrument.

139. Each cost element identified in Table 25 corresponds to an organizational activity performed in
order to make a particular retail payment service and related infrastructure (e.g. issuing payment
instruments, providing transaction accounts, and facilitating retail payment transactions) available. Each
activity is a cluster of related tasks and procedures comprising a specific stage in the process of making a
retail payment service available. All the work done in an organization can be classified as being part of a



82 The conceptual basis for the design and use of activity-based systems were put forward by Cooper and Kaplan in 1992. They observed that
traditional cost systems used volume-driven allocation bases to assign organizational expenses to individual products. However, many of the
resource demands are not proportional to the volume of units produced or sold. Thus, they put forward a method that links activities and used
resources to costs. See: “Activity-Based Systems: Measuring the Costs of Resource Usage”, by Robin Cooper and Robert S. Kaplan (1992).

                                                                                                                                           69
specific activity, which can take place in one or more functional areas. Also, an activity must have a
measureable effect, regardless of whether or not it is performed by humans.

140. The methodology requires that costs are classified as direct and indirect. Direct costs are those
that arise from a direct and exclusive use of resources to provide retail payment services. That is, direct
costs are the costs “directly related” to the activities carried out for the provision of certain retail payment
instruments/executing transactions, and which can be imputed in a straightforward way (e.g. costs
associated with fees and commissions and with staff directly involved in each activity and with each
payment instrument)83. Indirect costs are those that arise from a non-exclusive use of resources to provide
retail payment services. Indirect costs are the costs associated with the local overhead84 and support
functions85 that are necessary to carry out the activities involved with the provision of services for
different retail payment instruments and cannot be directly assigned to a certain payment instrument
and/or payment transaction (e.g. POS-terminals that can be used for debit, credit and prepaid card
payments). These costs should be imputed to the provision of each retail payment instrument/the
execution of each retail payment transaction using specific allocation keys (e.g. costs associated with
rentals, maintenance and depreciation, and other corporate support services)86.

141.       Three steps are performed in order to create the list of the payment related cost elements.

142. First step: The activities performed by the PSP and PIP are identified to ensure that all relevant
resources are considered in the analysis. This is necessary to accurately identify all activities for which
indirect costs are incurred87. Then, the identified activities are classified as:

     a. Activities related to retail payment services88;

     b. Supporting activities89;

     c. Activities not related to retail payment services90.

The shaded areas in Figure 2 show the relevant groups of activities translating into payment related costs.
The costs incurred by an organization for performing “activities related to retail payment services” are
direct costs, which need to be considered in calculating the total costs incurred for making payment
instruments and services available. The costs for “supporting activities” are incurred for activities that are
related and activities that are not related to payments. The first sub-category is indirect costs, which
together with the direct costs form the total payment related costs. The second sub-category is other
costs unrelated to payment systems, which are irrelevant for this study and not examined further. Finally,



83  See: Schmiedel et al. (2012)
84 Costs that are direct at the level of the organizational entity that is responsible for executing the concerned activities/delivering the
concerned service/product, but which cannot directly be allocated to them in an economically feasible way (e.g. division head and the
secretariat function or other support functions within the respective organizational entity). Source: Schmiedel et al. (2012).
85 Support functions are all functions that refer to financial accounting and reporting, information and communication technology (ICT) which

cannot be directly assigned to payment services, secretariat services to decision-making bodies, communication, event and meeting services,
language services and lawyer-linguist services, planning and controlling, and organization, internal auditing, internal institutional, legal, tax and
administrative issues, human resources management and social affairs, and internal services. Source: Schmiedel et al. (2012).
86 See: Schmiedel et al. (2012)
87 The cost study conducted by the European Central Bank (Schmiedel et al., 2012) shows that indirect costs are a substantial proportion of the

total costs of making payment instruments available.
88 The costs in this category are direct costs if they arise from a direct and exclusive use of resources to make a particular retail payment/service

available through a particular payment channel, or indirect costs otherwise.
89 The proportion of payments-related costs in this category is classified as indirect costs, and the non-payments-related proportion is irrelevant.
90 The costs incurred for performing the activities in this category are irrelevant to payments, therefore, they are ignored further.



                                                                                                                                                 70
the costs incurred for performing “activities not related to retail payment services” are also irrelevant for
the purpose of this study.

143. Second step: The costs for each cost activity are imputed. Costs for activities directly related to
payment instruments/services can be easily assigned. In order to allocate the accurate proportion of costs
related to payment instruments/services for supporting activities between payment-related and non-
payment-related services, the relative size of these services needs to be assessed. A quick measure of size
can be the number of employees working directly to provide each type of service (payment vs. non-
payment related), the number of machine hours, or the revenues earned by providing each type of
service.

144. Third step: The costs for each activity are allocated across payment services or payment
instrument/service channel combinations (where applicable) on the basis of their use during the
production process. Among the multiple sophisticated allocation methods that exist91, the transaction
cost driver is preferred due to its simplicity and data availability. That is, payments volume is used for cost
allocation.

                                         Figure 2: Relationship between activities and costs




145. It is worth stressing that this approach needs to be used even if a PSP or PIP provides services
related to a single payment instrument-service channel combination (where applicable) only. By doing so
cost elements can be classified based on traceability (direct vs. indirect), variability (fixed vs. variable) and
nature (resources vs. transfer), which is important from a data analytics point of view.




91 The ABC methodology suggests three types of allocation keys: 1) Transaction cost driver: Corresponds to the number of times an activity is
carried out and assumes that the same amount of resources is needed each time the activity is performed; 2) Duration cost driver: Reflects the
time needed to carry out an activity. It is used when there is a significant variation in the way the activity contributes to making a product or
service available; and 3) Intensity cost driver: Involves accounting for the resources actually used for each operation. In practice, this allocation
mechanism is applied if the resources are expensive and have significant variations. Those three types of allocation keys allow for more
accurate allocation of costs; however, more general allocation keys can be used for simplicity.

                                                                                                                                                   71
III.2.     COSTS BORNE BY PAYMENT SERVICE AND PAYMENT INFRASTRUCTURE PROVIDERS
146. The cost differentiation among the various actors on the supply side is based on the payment
services and payments infrastructure they provide. As such, it would not matter for the purpose of cost
identification and measurement what type of institution an actor on the supply side represents, but
rather, what function it serves. This is the reason why no specific institutional actors are examined on the
supply side, but rather two major groups are distinguished: Payment Service Providers (PSP) and Payment
Infrastructure Providers (PIP).

147. Depending on country circumstances and payments market structure, there might be actors who
offer a wide range of activities, some of which belong to the PSP group, and others to the PIP group.
Hence, the selection of the specific actors from which cost data will be gathered on the supply side is to
be determined on a country-by-country basis.

148. Typically, though, PSPs are: the central bank, commercial banks, e-money institutions (online
money providers, mobile money providers), microfinance institutions, currency exchange centers (if
foreign currencies are of relevance for a national payment system), and money transfer operators other
than mobile money providers (if domestic money orders are of relevance for a national payment system).

149. PIPs typically are: the central bank, cash-in-transit companies, payment switches, automated
clearing houses, cheque clearing houses, and other providers of switching, clearing, and/or settlement
services. One and the same entity can combine different PIP-services: for example automated clearing
houses for electronic fund transfers can also clear cheques.

III.2.1. Identification of cost elements per payment instrument-service channel combination

150. The remainder of this section provides a step-by-step guide for identifying and measuring the
costs associated with the above-mentioned set of actors. The table below summarizes all payment
instrument and service channel combinations (only relevant for PSP). While mobile money and/or online
money transaction can only be initiated via one service channel, all other payment instruments can be
initiated over multiple service channels, including point of interaction, payment center, branch, ATM,
agent, internet/designated lines, and/or telephone/mobile phone network.

   A direct debit transfer typically includes a mandate, by which the debtor (payer) confirms that his/her account is debited. The mandate itself
is not considered a payment instrument on its own, but an agreement between payer and payee and/or payer and PSP, authorizing one or a
series of direct debit transfers. The transmission methods indicated for direct debit transfers are only relevant if both, authorization of mandate
and initiation of direct debit transfer are coinciding. For direct credit transfers the transmission methods indicated are only relevant for one-off
transactions rather than standing orders.

151. Table 27 summarizes the cost elements of the PSP per payment instrument and service channel,
and Table 28 summarizes the cost elements of the PIP for each payment instrument. While PIP’s costs
vary based on the payment instrument, payment service channels are mostly irrelevant, since PIP do
typically not directly interact with PSU. For example, PIP’s costs are the same, regardless if a PSU initiates
a card payment at the point of interaction, payment center, agent, or over internet/designated lines.
However, the costs of the PSP can vary substantially based on the payment instrument, but also based on
the PSU’s choice of service channel. For example, PSPs incur additional acquiring and training costs for
providing payment services at agents. They also pay an agent fee for payments initiated at an agent.

III.2.2. Sample selection and survey design for payment service and payment infrastructure providers

152. Once the cost elements per payment instrument have been identified, primary data on the
relevance of the different retail payment instruments, transmission methods, and the monetary value of
those cost elements can be estimated via a corresponding PSP/PIP survey. The PSP/PIP data may be highly
sensitive and the PSP/PIP may be reluctant to provide the necessary level of detail to a professional
research firm or to any other external party. Therefore, where necessary, relevant authorities are
encouraged to conduct the surveys on their own in order to ensure reliable information and accurate
results. Survey participants may even request a non-disclosure agreement to be signed or for the data to
be stored on encrypted devices. To ensure the involvement of the relevant PSP/PIP, implementing entities
should closely involve them and/or their association throughout the process (from the design of the
questionnaire, to the data collection and validation phase). This could be done through a working group
and/or task force involving the relevant supply side actors.

153. Mode: PSP/PIP surveys on the cost of payment instruments are ideally conducted through
personal interviews or through online supplementary questionnaires. In both cases, follow-ups that allow
PSP/PIP to obtain data and ensure the accuracy of the data will likely be needed. However, each visit, at
the head office, should not last much more than an hour.

154. Structure: As in the case of the demand side actors, a three-section questionnaire can capture the
relevant data for the supply side actors, the PSP and PIP. The first part should cover volume data. It is
important to collect data on the volume of transactions carried out using each payment instrument
through each transmission method (where applicable) and on the number of payment instruments issued,

                                                                                                               76
delivered, recycled, destroyed, truncated, etc. (e.g. number of banknotes, coins, paper cheques, paper
forms for direct credit transfers and direct debit transfer mandates, payment cards, etc.) within a certain
period of time. The second section deals with the cost elements. For the PSP questionnaire, a distinction
needs to be made between resource costs and transfer costs, in particular. It is important to point out
that, although many cost elements are classified as resource costs, this is only the case when the activities
associated with these cost elements are performed in-house or they are outsourced to organizations that
are not qualified as the PIP or PSP. When activities are outsourced to other surveyed PIP/PSP, the
outsourcing fees are considered to be transfer costs by definition. Therefore, the design of the PSP
questionnaire should make it possible to distinguish between activities performed internally, fees paid for
services outsourced to other PSP/PIP surveyed or non-PSP/non-PIP. This approach aims to avoid double
counting of costs. The third and final section captures general information such as number of employees,
number of branches, number of transaction accounts, operations costs, and other information of this
nature. See sample questions in Box 4 (PSP) and Box 5 (PIP).

155. Sampling: All relevant payment suppliers should be surveyed, assuming that they do not
constitute large numbers (i.e. less than 100 units, in total). If this is not possible, the aim should be to
survey at least those providers holding a total of 50 percent of all transaction accounts in a country. For a
PSP with a large branch network, such as commercial banks, savings or cooperative banks, next to the
headquarter (or head institution) a representative sample of branches can be selected and interviewed,
using urban/rural and (if applicable) connected online to the headquarter/offline as the main stratification
criteria. The number of PIP is typically even more limited. Implementing entities might decide not to
survey all PIP if they have a good understanding of the profit margin of those PIP (or the PIP works on a
cost-recovery rather than a for-profit bases). In that case the transfer costs reported by PSP (corrected by
the profit margin if needed) can be used as a proxy for the resource costs of the PIP.

156. If the implementing entity is the central bank, it might have strong moral suasion power to
convince the PSP/PIP to participate, but it will typically lack the legal power to compel them doing so. If
the implementing party is no central bank, getting the PSP/PIP on board might be even more challenging.
To get these stakeholders on board, various countries have used the argument that the results will allow
individual participants to benchmark themselves to their entire sector and provide insight in potential
areas of cost reductions. In addition, personalized letters signed by the central bank’s governor may be
used. It is also crucial to ensure the confidentiality and anonymity of the collected data. Countries may
want to clearly underline that the respondent-specific information collected from individual entities will
not be published or distributed to any other party and only be used for central bank research and policy.
Also, in case of concentrated markets, the responses of various stakeholder groups (e.g. banks and CIT
companies) may need to be merged and published as one aggregated total to ensure their confidentiality.

157. Although the costs associated with most cost elements accrue reasonably uniformly over years,
months or even more frequent time intervals, those of production/procurement, issuing, reissuing, and
destruction of cash can vary substantially from one year to the next. For example, banknotes of a
particular denomination may only be printed once in a few years and stored until they are issued. At the
same time, it is possible to have years when no banknotes are printed or coins minted. In order to arrive
at reasonable production/procurement costs of cash which do not over- or under-estimate the true costs
of cash due to the specific year chosen to conduct a cost study, it is recommended that: i) a 5-year94
average number of banknotes/coins per denomination is calculated, and ii) the current year’s cost95 of

94 Different denominations of banknotes and coins have different life times, often longer than 5 years, which suggests that a longer time period
may need to be considered for improved accuracy. However, it is possible that detailed data longer than 5 years may not be readily available.
95 The current year’s cost per coin/banknote of each denomination is chosen in order to reflect the current level of prices in the economy. This

is particularly important when the costs of cash are presented as a proportion to the country’s GDP.

                                                                                                                                            77
printing/minting a unit of each denomination is used for the purpose of the study. If a certain
denomination which is still in use was not printed/minted over the past 5 years, the number of banknotes
printed/coins minted last and the predicted life of the current stock of that denomination should be used
to estimate the average number of banknotes/coins of the denomination issued in an average year. For
example, if 1 million banknotes of denomination 50 (local currency) were last printed 7 years ago and the
current stock is expected to last for 3 more years, it is recommended to assume that, on average, a supply
of 100,000 units96 of that banknote is needed every year. When printing of banknotes and minting of coins
is outsourced, it is recommended to average the inflation-adjusted97 outsourcing fees paid annually for
the past 5 years.

158. Similarly, issuing, reissuing, and destruction of banknotes and coins may vary substantially from
year to year. Therefore, the following recommendation applies to estimating the annual costs accrued for
each of these activities/cost elements: a 5-year average of inflation-adjusted costs or outsourcing fees
should be used instead of the actual current year’s costs.98




96 This figure equals 1 million units of the banknote divided by 10 years, the expected number of years the stock will suffice for.
97 Inflation in some countries can be high (or negative); therefore, not adjusting prices paid in past years to reflect current price levels may
substantially bias the results of the study.
98 Current year’s costs may be used in case the volume of banknotes and coins issued, reissued, and destroyed is reasonably uniform each year.

III.2.3. Calculation and reporting of retail payment costs for payment service and payment
infrastructure providers

159. The following steps need to be followed to ensure the necessary level of detail for cost calculation
and cost reporting on the supply side.

160. First step: The comprehensive lists of cost elements (activities) per PSP/PIP, payment instrument
and transmission method provided in the above tables should be used as guidance.

161. Second step: The costs for supporting activities (mainly overhead cost) needs to be allocated so
that only the payments-related proportion can be used further in the calculations. A simple way to allocate
those costs between payment services and other services performed by the PSP/PIP is to assess the
relative size of payment vs. non-payment-related services either based on the number of employees
providing these types of services or based on the share of revenues earned by offering payment vs. non-
payment-related services.

162. Third step: The costs for each cost element must be allocated across payment instruments and
transmission methods (where applicable) on the basis of their use during the production process. The
costs directly related to a payment instrument can easily be assigned to a particular cost element.
Allocation keys should be carefully designed to assign the accurate proportion of indirect costs to each
payment instrument/transmission method. Payments volume is an appropriate and readily available
allocation key. Alternatively, roughly estimated shares of costs can be used, along with the number of
months/years of circulation and the use of certain payment instruments such as cash and cards. The latter
information is particularly useful for the cost distribution in the case of the PIP. It is important to keep in
mind that all relevant supporting activities’ costs need to be allocated as accurately as possible. The
indirect nature of some of the cost elements comes from the fact that many payments-related products
and services are offered as bundles, cutting across multiple payment instruments and transmission
methods. As previously suggested, the indirect costs associated with each payment instrument and/or
transmission method can be disaggregated using volume as the main allocation key.

163. Fourth step: Since each payment service and payment instrument/service channel combination
has a specific set of cost elements attached, total costs related to a specific combination are obtained
from the sum of the costs imputed to the activities needed to make the instrument available through the
particular channel (where applicable). Given that data for many of the costs of payment suppliers is
collected on an annual basis, it is recommended to first annualize all costs per payment instrument-
transmission method combination and then estimate the costs per transaction. The unit costs for each
PSP/PIP and payment instrument are calculated from the total direct and indirect costs and the volume
of transactions. With the sum of direct and indirect costs, the total cost per PSP/PIP, per payment
instrument, and per transmission method (wherever applicable) is then obtained.

164. As such, this approach allows for understanding and reporting cost results on three bases: first,
on PSP/PIP basis, for all relevant payment instruments and, if applicable, service channels; second, on a
structural per processed payment basis, identifying the instrument and the transmission method
associated with it; and third, on an annual basis, for all payments processed annually through a specific
payment instrument and transmission method.

               IV. OVERVIEW OF COST ELEMENTS FOR THE ENTIRE ECONOMY

165. The costs for the whole economy are calculated based on the demand side and the supply side
data as collected and analyzed in parts II and III. Three main goals are of interest here: i) calculating the
total resource costs, total transfer costs of retail payments and consequently the total economic costs; ii)
calculating the total annual costs to the economy associated with each payment instrument (expressed
as percentage of the country’s GDP); iii) exploring different approaches of creating savings for the national
payment system.

IV.1.    CALCULATING THE TOTAL COSTS FOR THE ECONOMY

166. The retail payment costs for the whole economy are the sum of all resource (internal) costs
associated with making or accepting payments (from demand side perspective) and those associated with
making payment instruments/services available (from supply side perspective). In order to calculate the
total retail payment costs for the economy, the demand side (PSU) and the supply side (PSP and PIP)
resource costs need to be aggregated (see Table 33, same as Table 6, repeated below for convenience).

              Total costs for the economy              Σ (RCP, RCB, RCG, RCPSP, RCPIP)
   *A  PIP typically acts as service providers for a PSP. As a result, they typically do not incur transfer costs by other
     stakeholders in the retail payment chain. In that case their transfer cost would be 0.

167. It is instrumental to sum up all resource costs and all transfer costs and look at the ratio of
resource costs (or transfer costs) to the total costs for the economy. The ratio of resource costs to total
costs shows how much of the costs associated with payment services are true production costs. However,
it is important to stress that aggregating the demand side and the supply side costs to arrive at the total
costs for the economy is not as simple as adding up all measured costs. In order to avoid double-counting,
transfer costs need to be excluded from the total costs calculation. That is, fees paid to those PSP and PIP
within the scope of the survey for services performed or services outsourced must be excluded from the
total economy cost calculation. The rationales behind this are the following:

    a. When calculating the total costs for the economy, only resource costs are relevant since those are
       the internal (production) cost for the performed activities. Businesses or governments on the
       demand side or the PSP/PIP on the supply side may choose to outsource some of their internal
       payment-related processes, which can consist of one or more activities as defined in section III.1,
       to (other) PSP/PIP. The costs of these activities are counted twice: once as transfer costs for the

                                                                                                                                    87
           stakeholder outsourcing the process, and once as resource costs for the stakeholder performing
           the process. When activities are performed in-house, only the internal (production) costs of
           performing those activities are reflected in the reported resource costs. On the other hand, when
           activities are outsourced, outsourcing fees include a profit margin in addition to the actual cost
           incurred for performing the activities. If outsourced activities are performed by the PSP/PIP within
           the scope of the cost study, outsourcing fees paid are treated as transfer costs, while the costs
           incurred by the PSP/PIP are treated as resource costs. However, if outsourced activities are
           performed by non-PSP/non-PIP, outsourcing fees paid are treated as resource costs since the
           actual production costs are unknown. In this case, the reported resource costs exceed the true
           production costs by the profit margin charged by the outsourcee99.

     b. When the PSU and PSP pay service fees to (other) PSPs or PIPs comprised in the scope of the
        survey, the costs for performing the particular services are also counted twice: once as transfer
        costs for the stakeholder requiring the services, and once as resource costs for the stakeholder
        performing the services. Again, when calculating the total costs for the economy, only the
        resource costs are relevant, since those are the internal (production) costs for the performed
        services and do not include the profit margin charged.

168. When the PSU/PSP/PIP pays payment-related service fees or outsources payment-related
functions to third parties whose resource costs are not accounted for in one of the retail payment costs
surveys, those service or outsourcing fees are conceptually considered as resource costs. Since the parties
receiving the fees do not report their resource costs, those costs are not counted twice. For example,
since agents are not surveyed for the purpose of this study, the cost element agent commission is
considered a resource cost and it must be included in the total costs for the economy. If agents were
surveyed, their internal costs would be considered as resource costs and the commissions that they are
paid would be considered as transfer costs. At the same time, outsourcing fees or payment-related service
fees include a profit margin on top of the true production costs required for performing the service.
Therefore, when service fees are treated as resource costs, resource costs are overestimated, while
transfer costs are underestimated. It is important to recognize this shortcoming, even if it cannot be
addressed.

169. Table 34 summarizes the resource cost and the transfer cost elements for the demand side (PSU)
and the supply side (PSP & PIP) actors, respectively. It is assumed that all activities associated with the
cost elements listed under resource costs are performed in-house, unless explicitly stated otherwise.




99It is difficult to estimate the profit margins charged and there is no consensus in the literature on how to do that. This guide does not provide
specific guidelines on calculating profit margins and suggests omitting them, although this leads to overestimation of resource costs and
underestimation of transfer costs.

                                                                                                                                               88
Box 6: The difference between resource costs and transfer costs when activities are performed in-house vs.
                          outsourced to PIP/PSP vs. outsourced to third parties

Example 1:
A retail business owner (that is a PSU) needs to deposit cash/cheques and get change from the bank on a regular
basis. The business owner has the options to i) do this in-house (perform those tasks on his/her own or have an
employee responsible for performing them), or to ii) pay a cash logistic company (cash-in-transit / CIT company) to
do that (that is, outsource to a PIP). When those tasks are performed in-house, their cost is considered to be a
resource cost. However, if the tasks are outsourced to a CIT company those costs are accounted for twice: first, they
are reported by the business in the business survey and, second, they are reported by the CIT company in the PIP
survey. In this case, the costs reported by the CIT company are the true production costs incurred for performing
the outsourced task and they need to be categorized as resource costs. The outsourcing fees paid by the business to
the CIT company are categorized as transfer costs and they cover the CIT’s pro duction costs and a profit margin
charged by the CIT.

Example 2:
A mobile money provider (that is a PSP) has the following ways of reaching its customers: i) to open offices/branches
where it can service its clients (that is perform the task at hand in-house), or ii) to outsource the task to agents (who
are neither PSP, nor PIP). Again, when performed in-house, the costs incurred by the mobile money provider are
categorized as resource costs. Since agents are beyond the scope of this study (they are neither PSP, nor PIP) and
they are not surveyed, the calculation of the true costs of agents for offering services to mobile money provider
customers comprised in the study. Therefore, the costs for performing this task are reported only once by the mobile
money providers themselves. In this case, those costs are categorized as resource costs, even though they exceed
the true production costs (by the profit margin agents might be able to achieve). If the profit margin of agents is
known, it could be subtracted from the agent fees paid reported by the mobile money provider.

 TC = Transfer costs (assumes that the entity performing the service/receiving the fees is also within the scope of the cost study).

170. The total costs for the economy per payment instrument and the total costs for the economy of
all retail payments are of interest. First, the procedure described above can be repeated for each payment
instrument separately. Second, the total costs for all payment instruments can be added in order to arrive
at the total costs for the economy.

171. In order to assess the economic value of the calculated cost for the economy as a whole and per
payment instrument, the costs can be expressed as proportion to the surveyed country’s GDP for the
survey year. The costs per GDP for the whole economy (per payment instrument and for all retail
payments) are useful in assessing the efficiency of a country’s payments system against other countries.
It can also be effectively used as a benchmark for future reference. Since time based costs opportunity
costs of PSUs are likely to have a substantial impact on the overall resource costs, it is recommended to
calculate the total costs for the economy with and without time based costs for PSUs.

172. The average cost per payment transaction made with a particular payment instrument can also
be calculated by dividing the total costs for the economy for that payment instrument by the annual
volume of payments made with the particular instrument. The average total costs of payment instruments
can be compared in order to assess efficiency. However, it is important to keep in mind that some
payment instruments are more efficient for some use cases than others. Therefore, simply comparing
average total costs per payment instrument may lead to wrong conclusions.

173. In order to make more accurate comparisons of the relative efficiency of payment instruments
across all stakeholders, more detailed analysis may be performed by exploring the average economic costs
of payment instruments for a specific use case and a specific service channel. The resource costs of the

PSU per use case and transmission method are available from the demand side data analysis. On the
supply side, the average resource costs of the PSP per payment instrument-transmission method
combination, as well as the resource costs of the PIP per payment instrument (the transmission method
does not affect the cost in this case), can be calculated. As such, the resource costs borne by the three
aforementioned stakeholders can be added for a specific payment instrument-transmission method-use
case combination, so that the total economy costs associated with such combinations can be calculated
(transfer costs are not considered by the equation when calculating the costs for the total economy).

IV.2    SAVINGS SCENARIOS

174. One of the objectives of this methodological framework is to provide insights on the potential
savings that may arise when migrating from paper-based to electronic payments. Different substitution
scenarios can be considered, depending on a country’s goals. This section outlines some simple
approaches that can be used to estimate savings due to migrating from paper-based to electronic
payments, without suggesting a specific strategy to be followed by a country. It also outlines the steps
that need to be followed to predict the potential cost savings resulting from the implementation of the
specific strategies chosen by each country.

175. One way to show savings is to use the overall annual figures calculated in the previous section
(annual costs borne by all stakeholders per payment instrument) and consider certain reduction
projections resulting from the migration of one payment instrument (e.g. cheques) to another (e.g. direct
credit transfers). For example, a scenario would be converting 10 percent of a country’s cheque payments
to direct credit transfers. More complex scenarios would include paper-based payments migrating to
multiple electronic payment instrument equivalents, rather than to a single one. For example, converting
10 percent of cash payments into credit transfers, and 50 percent of cheque payments into debit transfers
would constitute another scenario.

176. A second approach is to derive savings by also incorporating the service channels. More
specifically, this approach uses cost per payment transaction, given a specific combination of payment
instrument and service channel. This would allow for comparison of the costs of the different
combinations and derive savings per single transaction migrating from one pair of payment instrument-
service channel to another. This can be done separately for the payments received and initiated on the
demand side, and for payments processed on the supply side. In the case of utility bill payments, for
example, payers may benefit from migrating from cash to card payments, either in-person or different
remote service channels. From a supply side perspective, migrating from cheque payments to direct credit
transfer payments can be most beneficial for this particular use case. Again, the specific scenarios
explored are country-specific and depend on the current state of the payment system and payment
patterns, as well as policy objectives. It may be useful to explore the use cases with the highest volume or
value of payments, those where authorities or large billers can steer migration (e.g. government payments
or utility payments), and/or those supposed to be most inefficient and with the highest potential savings.
It is important to mention here that electronic payments have greater potential to realize economies of
scale (resulting from increased use) due to the higher level of fixed costs incurred for making them
available and processing electronic payment instrument transactions, for which reason a linear
extrapolation of costs might overestimate the real costs incurred by a substantial increase of the volume
of electronic payments.

177. Once viable savings scenarios are selected, it is suggested that the potential savings that can be
realized by replacing one or a set of payment instruments with another be estimated. When the volume

                                                                                                         92
of transactions initiated with a particular payment instrument increases, in most cases economies of scale
are achieved and the costs per transaction decrease and vice versa. In order to correctly estimate the
costs of initiating payments under a hypothetical scenario (that is, after implementing one or more of the
chosen strategies), it is important to calculate the new cost of a single transaction with each payment
instrument involved. This can be done as follows:

      a. First, the new transaction volumes and (average and/or aggregate) values per payment
         instrument need to be calculated.

      b. Second, the fixed costs for each relevant payment instrument need to be distributed based on
         the new transactions volume.100 If a payment instrument is replaced, then its transaction volume
         under the hypothetical scenario will decrease, therefore the fixed costs per transaction will
         increase. If a payment instrument replaces another one, then its transaction volume will increase
         and its fixed costs per transaction will decrease.

      c. Third, variable costs have to be split up according to their variability with transaction volume or
         transaction value and their elasticity with volume and/or value needs to be estimated. For
         example, error costs will vary in direct proportion with the number of transactions: when, for
         example, cheque transactions decreases by 10 percent, error costs associated with cheques will
         decrease by 10 percent as well. However, if cash transactions decrease by 10 percent, cash logistic
         costs may only decrease by 7 percent, for example. In a similar way, the variability of costs with
         transaction value needs to be assessed. Although it may not be possible to estimate exact
         elasticities, it is important to examine each variable cost element carefully and make an informed
         prediction about its variability with transaction volume and/or value.

      d. Fourth, the new variable costs per transaction with each relevant payment instrument need to be
         estimated using the new transaction volumes and values and the elasticities of each cost element.

      e. Fifth, the new estimated fixed and variable costs per transaction should be added and the total
         costs per payment instrument should be estimated by multiplying the total cost per transaction
         by the transaction volume.

      f.   Finally, for each scenario the total costs of making payments before and after implementing a
           chosen strategy can be compared in order to verify that the strategy will lead to significant
           savings.

178. Following these six working steps (as shown in Box 7) can be instrumental in finding the value of
implementing specific savings strategies. However, this methodology is cost-driven and ignores the




100Fixed cost per payment instrument may increase or decrease because of the need for infrastructural changes due to drastic variations in
demand. For the sake of simplicity, it can be assumed that significant infrastructural changes will be unnecessary unless the use of a particular
payment instrument is completely or nearly eliminated.

                                                                                                                                             93
benefits of certain payment instruments over others. Those benefits should be considered when choosing
strategies and creating new policies.

        Box 8: Substitutions scenarios based on a cost study conducted by the Hungarian central bank

In 2011, Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) published a report named “Nothing is free: A survey of the social cost of the main payment
instruments in Hungary” (see Turján et al. (2011) for further details), based on the results of a cost of payments study initiated
by the European Central Bank. The number, value, and costs per transaction/100 Hungarian forints (HUF) of payment value from
the study based on data from 2009 are summarized in the table below (based on Table 66 of the original report).

   * This is a paper-based payment instrument particular to Hungary. Payments are initiated and processed by the Hungarian Post (Magyar
   Posta). Postal outpayment money orders are mainly used by the government for pension payments and postal inpayment money orders
   are mainly used by PSUs for bill payments and domestic remittances.

It is evident that most transactions are conducted in cash and, at the same time, cash payments have the lowest resource (social)
cost per transaction. However, this does not mean that they are the most cost efficient. Paper-based payments (including cash
and postal inpayment/outpayment money orders) have lower proportion of fixed costs and higher proportion of variable costs
compared to electronic payments, which suggests that electronic payments can be more efficient if used at a scale. Recognizing
this and other disadvantages of cash (and other paper-based payments), the MNB developed three scenarios under which they
aimed to reduce the resource (social) costs of making and accepting payments from 1.49% to 1.09% of Hungary’s GDP. Various
unquantified positive externalities are also likely to take place. The following proposed scenarios are independent and can be
applied at the same time or separately.
Scenario 1: High volume substitution of cash transactions with debit card transactions in the retail sector.
Scenario 2: Shifting of paper-based remote payment instruments (direct credit transfers and postal inpayment money orders) to
electronic channels (direct debit/credit transfers) in the private sector.
Scenario 3: Shifting of pension outpayments to bank accounts (using direct credit transfers).
Incorporating the above three scenarios and assuming that fixed costs for each payment instrument remain the same, the
following results can be achieved in Hungary (based on Table 66 and Table 79 of the original report):

                                        Resource (social) costs per transaction (in HUF)

                                    V.    IMPLEMENTATION

179. The steps outlined in this guide can be grouped into four phases: project scope, survey design,
survey execution, and finally, data analysis and follow up. Each phase involves a series of steps, as
summarized Figure 3 and further described below. For each step, reference to the relevant information
in the guide is made to help the implementation of that step. Overall, a comprehensive retail payments
cost study is a major effort, and will realistically take one year at minimum.

                                                                                                   96
V.1     PHASE 1: PROJECT SCOPE

180. Scope definition: Prior to launching the study, the scope of the project must be determined. The
most significant factors in defining the scope or focus of the study are the project’s objectives and
resource constraints. Part I.3 of this document is relevant to the demand side, while Part II is relevant to
the supply side. If both the demand and supply side of the methodology have been implemented, the
total costs for the economy can be calculated, as described in Part III. The demand side and the supply
side methodologies can be implemented independently of each other, and in any order or simultaneously.

181. Stocktaking and categorization: A key step in the definition phase of the project is to identify the
key characteristics of the currently available retail payment instruments and group the instruments
accordingly. This step is necessary to appropriately identify the cost elements associated with each, and
streamline the survey by addressing similar instruments as a group. By creating a “dictionary” and
assigning domestically used terms and product names to common and internationally recognized
definitions, as described in Part I, international comparability can be facilitated. Despite variations in the
details of retail payment service offerings, with ten different retail payment instruments most of the retail
payment instruments offered worldwide can be categorized. As outlined in this guide, these payment
instruments are cash, cheque, voucher, debit card, credit card, prepaid card, direct credit transfer, direct
debit transfer, mobile money, and online money. In defining a national retail payment instrument
universe, all payment instruments relevant to the particular economy need to be considered. The World
Bank (2012) publication “A practical guide for retail payments stocktaking” provides valuable guidelines
on who to take stock of the payment instruments within a country’s context. For convenience, Box 10
shortly describes those guidelines.

182. Payment instruments selection: Given the fact that cost savings are likely to be among the goals
of the cost study, focusing on retail payment instruments that currently serve a significant proportion of
market and/or those that have the potential to serve a growing proportion of demand seems to be most
efficient. Niche payment instruments, like cheques for example, in most of the European countries (with
the notable exceptions of France and the UK), may not need to be included in the study. In this regard, a
threshold of a percentage of the total retail payment volumes may be chosen (e.g. 5 percent) can be
considered – i.e. only payment instruments above the volume-threshold are taken into consideration for
the cost study. In addition payment instruments below the threshold but with a clear potential and/or
upward trend can be relevant too. For countries that currently lack information on volume and value of
retail payments by instrument, guidance on the collection, organization, validation and analysis of such
data is provided in Guideline 4 of the World Bank (2012).




                                                                                                           97
                                Box 9: Guidelines for retail payments stocktaking

The below text is a direct excerpt from the World Bank, the European Central Bank, and Banco Central do Brasil’s
2012 publication “A practical guide for retail payments stocktaking”.
Guideline 1: The overall scope and structure of the stocktaking exercise shall be driven by the high-level public
policy goals set forth in the area of retail payments. The public policy goals would vary from country to country,
but in general are associated with the safety and efficiency of retail payment systems in the country. Some other
relevant public policy areas may include increased access and affordability, the availability of a socially optimal
mix of payment instruments, and the availability of the required industry infrastructure to process such payment
instruments. The retail payments stocktaking exercise should be designed so as to enable a clear understanding
of the issues and areas of improvements required for achieving the stated public policy goals. The scope should
be broad-based and should be developed in close co-ordination with all stakeholders.
Guideline 2: Adequate attention needs to be devoted to the planning and organization of the stocktaking
exercise. Retail payments stocktaking is a complex undertaking requiring meticulous planning and active
involvement of numerous stakeholders. A wide-range of information sources should be used, including the
information available in the broader payment systems community and also other sources. This information helps
in benchmarking the status in the particular country. Where obtaining direct data might be difficult, information
from other sources will help in assessing the intended aspects or variables in an indirect manner.
Guideline 3: Industry players should be involved from the very early stages. The retail payments industry will
require adequate background information and sufficient time to ensure availability of good quality information
when the stocktaking exercise is rolled out. In addition, the central bank should actively seek dialogue with
industry participants as the latter can provide valuable inputs in structuring the exercise, including agreeing on
certain common terminologies and helping to determine the appropriateness of the data being required as well
as the feasibility of obtaining such data reliably.
Guideline 4: Obtaining sufficient, high-quality data and other types of information is at the heart of the
stocktaking exercise. The collection, organization, validation and analysis of data is a critical part of the stocktaking
exercise, and is probably the most resource-intensive one. Appropriate human and technological resources should
therefore be devoted to this element of the exercise, including a strong emphasis on validating the data received
from the industry. A retail payments stocktaking exercise is also not a one-off exercise; hence, an approach to
enable comparison across iterations to measure evolution should also be considered.
Guideline 5: Devote sufficient time to report preparation and to designing the strategy for the wide
dissemination of results. Being able to properly document and communicate the results of the stocktaking
exercise as well as the alternatives available to address the underlying shortfalls is of outmost importance. A
carefully designed strategy for the communication and dissemination of the diagnosis report should be developed
to provide useful feedback to the various stakeholders and relevant information to the overall public.




                                                                                                                     98
183. Stakeholders and types of payments selection: Part I of this document explains the categories of
PSU and the types of retail payments on the basis of the payer/payee role of the PSU. A clear
categorization of PSU into consumers, businesses and government agencies should be made. It is
recommended to use a functional rather than an institutional approach. In other words, government
agencies acting as businesses (e.g. when providing utilities) should be covered under the business
category for this part of their retail payments share, unless they are departments of a Ministry or other
government agency rather than a separate entity. On the other hand, individuals who are selling goods
and/or providing services should be covered under businesses, even if they are not a legal entity. Based
on this categorization, different types of retail payments can be identified, depending on the role of the
PSU as payer or payee. To this extent, the collaboration of the participating stakeholders in the initial
consultation phases are crucial for the successful implementation of the survey, in a way that full
participation is ensured. This can be achieved by holding pre-survey workshops and working groups so
that the ground is prepared for the actual survey implementation and all parties are fully aware of the
content and objectives of the survey. Particularly for the business surveys, the involvement of business
associations can be helpful in the process. It is worth emphasizing that for businesses and payment service
providers (i.e. commercial banks), data might be needed at both, the branch level, and the head office
level.

184. Service channel selection: Part I also elaborates on the range of service channels (part of payment
transmission methods) via which retail payments can be effected. All relevant service channels for each
category of payment instruments should be identified and the set of use cases as developed in this report
should be assessed.

185. Use cases selection: Retail payments serve three main purposes: i) the compensation for an
economic transaction, ii) a transfer due to an entitlement or obligation, iii) a personal transfer, or iv) the
reorganization of the payer’s own funds. For each of these purposes, typical use cases can be identified.
Only the use cases of relevance in the particular retail payment landscape should be considered.
Adaptations to the use cases identified in this guide can be made as appropriate and/or additional use
cases can be introduced as necessary. Such modifications should not significantly compromise the cross-
country comparability of cost study results.

186. Assignment of payment instruments to use cases: The next step is to identify the payment
instruments that can be used for each use case by consumers, businesses, and government agencies.
Entities conducting a retail payment cost study typically can draw on prior knowledge to complete the
instrument/use case matching. If this is not the case, this information should be obtained prior to the
completing the survey design. Focus discussions with industry stakeholders are recommended to yield
this information.

187. Identification of relevant cost categories and cost elements: For every payment instrument
identified as relevant for at least one use case and the associated transmission method, cost elements for
both the payer and the payee need to be identified. More often than not, these cost elements differ for
the payer and the payee. The scope of the cost study, as defined earlier, will determine which cost
elements are relevant.




                                                                                                           99
V.2.    PHASE 2: SURVEY DESIGN

188. Market research firm/institute involvement: One of the key steps in the survey design phase is
to determine whether or not to engage a professional market research firm/institute. Professional market
researchers can offer significant advantages in terms of the quality and representativeness of the data
derived from the survey, enhance the timeliness of the collection and analysis of the data, and allow the
interested public and private parties, as well as policy makers, to focus on substantive aspects of the study
and its policy and regulatory implications. Bearing in mind the specifics of payment services, market
research firms/institutes with a proven track record in the area of payment services are to be preferred.
Several factors should be taken into consideration in determining whether to engage a market research
firms/institutes: (i) weather the organization implementing the cost study methodology has a research
unit that can conduct the study in-house, (ii) the scope of the retail payment cost study, (iii) the number
of respondents to be surveyed, (iv) the degree of representativeness and (v) the time and funds available
for the cost study. This decision may need to be reevaluated once some of the initial steps of the survey
design phase are implemented.

189. Survey specifications: A retail payment cost study should aim to capture appropriate
representation for every PSU category (i.e. consumers, businesses, government agencies), and for the
range of use cases the instruments and transmission methods identified as relevant for the economy. If a
representative sample is not feasible due to time and/or budgetary constraints, it might be decided to
conduct a retail payment cost study that is representative at least for certain geographic areas (e.g. urban
areas), PSU categories (e.g. businesses of a certain size) or for certain use cases (e.g. payment for retail
goods purchased at the point of interaction). In some cases, e.g. for certain payment instruments, even
anecdotal evidence for the cost of retail payments may be collected. It is important that the decision on
the representativeness is taken consciously and that any resulting limitations of findings are recognized.
It is also recommended that the degree of representativeness is made transparent if findings of the retail
payment cost study are published. Ideally, broad confidence intervals associated with cost estimates need
to be disclosed and a sensitivity analysis should be performed, as cost estimates have proven to be highly
sensitive to underlying assumptions and inputs.

190. Questionnaire development: There are two aspects to questionnaire design: (i) question
development and (ii) questionnaire format and structure design. On question development, the parties
implementing the study need to be deeply involved, even if a market research firm has been engaged, to
ensure the survey yields the information needed on the cost elements and volume-related aspects of the
retail payment uses. A comprehensive set of sample questions covering the relevant questions on
volume/value-related aspects of retail payment use cases and questions on the cost elements, for both
the demand and supply side, has been developed in the context of the present report, tested in several
markets and can be shared with implementing countries upon request. On the question of the format and
structure of the questionnaire, further consultations in the national context may be needed.

V.3.    PHASE 3: SURVEY EXECUTION

191. Interviewer training: Providing sufficient training to the interviewers is imperative in order to
ensure high quality data collection. The entity implementing the cost study can choose the same group of
interviewers to conduct the surveys on both the demand and supply side (if the different stakeholders are
interviewed at different points in time), or different groups of interviewers for each stakeholder survey (if
the different stakeholders are interviewed simultaneously). Either way, training has to be provided
separately for each survey pertaining to a different stakeholder (on the demand and supply side). Given

                                                                                                         100
that in many countries payment cost data have not been gathered before through surveys, the
interviewers have to fully understand the overall context and content of the surveys. This is why time and
resources have to be invested in interviewer training, so that the quality of the data gathered is not
compromised. At the same time, a detailed question-by-question training has to be offered so that clarity
is obtained in terms of the question wording, the question objective, and the units in which the answers
are reported. Being equipped with this knowledge, the interviewer can then probe whenever necessary
during the personal interviews. The training can also be complemented by an instruction handbook for
the interviewers for each stakeholder survey.

192. Survey pre-testing: The step of pre-testing is crucial in order to make further adjustments to the
questionnaire based on the in-field experience, before launching the survey. A small sample (ranging from
10-50 units, depending on the stakeholder and the final sample size) can be selected in order to test the
questionnaire for each stakeholder. In addition to recording the answers to the actual questions, the
interviewers should also keep notes of challenges they or the interviewees face during the process with
wording, sensitive information or other issues. Typically, the pre-testing sample is not considered part of
the final sample. However, in cases where no major issues are identified during pretesting and hence, no
major changes are made to the questionnaire, the pre-testing sample could be incorporated into the final
sample. During the pre-testing step, the interviewers can also test the use of supportive material such as
visual images of payment instruments and transmission methods so that it becomes easier for the
interviewee to distinguish among them in a tangible way. This approach ensures the minimization of
confusion and misreporting by the interviewees. Ideally, in-field pre-testing should be conducted even if
the final surveys are planned to be conducted electronically. In parallel, the implementing entity can also
organize focus groups or information workshops in order to test the questionnaire. This pre-testing
method can be particularly useful for stakeholders such as government agencies and payment service
providers which might be harder to reach for in-field pretest. Such workshops can also function as a
dissemination platform to announce to industry and government agency representatives the launching of
the payment cost survey and the usefulness of the results for the different stakeholders. Indeed, this
approach could potentially increase the participation in the survey since experience has shown that
stakeholders such as government agencies and payment service providers are more hesitant to participate
in payment cost studies. Moreover, this step will allow implementing authorities to anticipate potential
challenges that could be encountered during the actual survey.

193. Survey launch: After the successful completion of interviewer training, pretesting, and
questionnaire adjustments, the final step in the execution phase is the survey launch. Surveys can be
conducted either through personal interviews, telephone interviews, or online questionnaire fill-out by
the respondent, depending on the stakeholder being interviewed. The duration of the survey has to be
determined in advance so that the implementing market research firm or organization can allocate the
interviewers accordingly in the different parts of the country. Data entry and quality checks can take place
either during data collection or after the survey is completed. For instance, the implementing entity can
agree in advance with the interviewers to send in completed questionnaires regularly, so that data entry
can occur in parallel to data collection. This approach can result in time efficiency, given that data entry
can be a time consuming task in itself, especially if it requires the conversion from a paper to an electronic
format. Alternatively, data entry can start when the data collection process has been completed and all
completed questionnaires have been submitted or computer assisted personal interviews can be
leveraged, during which the interviewer processes the data electronically during the interview instead of
filling in the paper questionnaire. It is worth emphasizing that the implementing entity should consider
providing an official letter to the interviewer to carry and show to the interviewee, stating the purpose of
the survey, the anonymity ensured in the data collection process confirming that the respondent-specific


                                                                                                          101
information will not be shared with other institutions and that individual responses will be merged and
only published as an aggregate total, and the name of the authorities that support the cost study, in order
to provide transparency and credibility in the process.

194. Finally, particular attention needs to be paid to the time and day in which the personal interviews
are conducted, particularly for consumers at their place of residence. It is likely that individuals who are
employed will be out of their residence during weekdays and working hours. In order to avoid capturing
a skewed range of socio-economic backgrounds (e.g. pensioners or unemployed), after work hours or
weekends might need to be considered.

V.4.    PHASE 4: DATA ANALYSIS AND FOLLOW UP

195. Robustness and quality checks: When collecting and before analyzing the data, several
robustness checks and quality controls should be performed to ensure the consistency and accuracy of
the data used in the report. Given the level of detail and sensitivity, the responses are likely to be prone
to measurement errors. Outliers or extreme observations should be removed from the data set as these
have the potential to impair the results, in particular in smaller sample sizes. One option is to use the
interquartile range rule (IQR). As such, any data numbers more than 1.5 interquartile ranges below the
first quartile or above the third quartile were removed. The interquartile range (IQR) measures the
difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1): Q3-Q1. The first quartile equals the
number of data points at the 25th percentile of the total data. The third quartile equals the number of
data points at the 75th percentile of the total data.

196. External sources, should be used to compare and validate the data. Also, a careful comparison
across responses may signal inconsistencies or abnormalities. Finally, since many assumptions need to be
made along the way (e.g. with respect to the breakdown between fixed versus variable costs, the
allocation of indirect costs across payment methods and what interest rates to use for foregone interest
and float), implementing entities should conduct some sensitivity analyses in order to see how sensitive
the results are to certain assumptions.

197. Calculation of costs per stakeholder: The different stakeholders on the demand and supply side
have to be examined separately, bearing in mind the specifics for each of them when initiating, receiving
and processing retail payments. When calculating the costs based on the survey results, the consistent
application of the different cost categories is necessary to allow for the calculation of the overall costs of
retail payments of an economy. Special attention has to be paid to the differentiation between resource
and transfer costs. In addition, the costs per payment instrument and the differentiation between fixed
and variable costs is required to develop a retail payment policy strategy based on the results of the cost
study.

198. Calculation of total costs for the demand and the supply side: When calculating the total costs
for the demand and supply side, in general all resource costs per stakeholder group can be totaled. More
attention has to be paid to the transfer costs. Those transfer costs paid to PSP (and if applicable to PIP),
should be included in the calculation of the total costs for the demand side, but excluded in the overall
economy costs.

199. Benchmarking: Ideally, the cost survey should be repeated in periodicity of several years in order
to assess changes in costs as a result of policy and/or regulatory measures and other changes in the
payments landscape. In particular, as the payment industry is largely a network industry and driven by
substantial network externalities technological developments are most likely to substantially drive and

                                                                                                          102
reshape the future payment landscape. The initial retail payment cost study can serve as a benchmark for
future studies, as well as its immediate goal to inform policy and regulatory decision-making. The results
of retail payment cost studies implemented based on the approach suggested in this report, can be
compared against those of other economies and international benchmarks to further inform policy
makers. Often times, the timeframe for the completion of all steps for the project might take more than
a calendar year and also, might not coincide with the year that other countries conduct their own studies.
Nevertheless, comparisons can still be made since projections and a standardized base year can be used
in order to achieve this objective. Respective implementing countries can rely on the assistance of the
Payment Systems Development Group in this respect.

200. Policy recommendations and integration into the national retail payments strategy: Overall,
establishing a sound economic baseline for national retail systems in terms of costs of different payment
instruments can better guide system development and enable high-impact changes. The resulting
efficiency gains could yield significant benefits for economic development and growth as the cost of
exchanging goods and services are reduced. Lower retail payments costs can also significantly enhance
the reach of payment services to lower income and economically isolated households, and further
improve the efficiency of the retail payments system as access to modern payment instruments is
broadened.
