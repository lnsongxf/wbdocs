     7	 Is corporate governance “costly”?
     Corporate governance reforms involve the use of time and
     resources; however, these costs should be considered as
     an investment in the future of your company. Setting up
     a board of directors, for example, will require attracting
     respected, credible, independent directors; which may
     involve considerable effort to identify the right people,
     and costs in terms of their fees. This cost, however, is
     incredibly worthwhile since a board’s presence is likely
     to offer credibility in the market and help your company
     obtain credit approval from banks.

     Another area where potential benefit exceeds cost is risk
     management; the proper management of risk inevitably
     involves various expenditures. However, such a system
     prevents losses in the face of undesirable events and
     circumstances. 28 For example, managing cash flow volatility
     is vital to ensure your company can cover its debt on time.
     This requires the establishment of certain practices, which
     will vary depending on the nature of your business, to
     minimize the risk of not being able to deliver products
     or services (e.g. relationship with suppliers), not being
     paid time by customers (e.g. customers’ credit check), or
     having inadequate internal accounting (e.g. punctuality
     of accounting records).

     While there is a certain cost involved in preparing
     documentation and establishing tools of governance,
     these represent only a fraction of the potential costs that
     could arise from disputes with partners and employees
     due to of the lack of internal transparency or poorly
                                                                                              One cannot think in terms of ‘costs’
     defined roles and responsibilities. Overall, it is important to
                                                                                       when it comes to governance systems. It is
     remember that implementing good governance practices
                                                                                    more appropriate to talk about an investment
     is a flexible and gradual process. Start by governing
                                                                                      (in time and effort), the returns one will get
     your company around good governance principles,
                                                                                from this investment, and whether one can ensure

        a well-constituted board?
     There is no such a thing as a typical board of directors, since
                                                                               Defining Different Types

     members, though the average board size across MENA
     stands at about nine members.          29
                                                 Regardless of board
     size, there are certain practices that should be followed
     to achieve optimal results.

     Overall, it is important to establish the desired board
     profile for your company by identifying the types of
     directors needed in relation to your business goals. To
                                                                                                    Independent

     24	 What governance issues do investors look at
         before investing in my business?
     As part of their pre-investment due diligence, investors in
     emerging markets tend to carefully assess the corporate
     governance of companies. In fact, there is evidence that
                                                                                                                                                                        Very Important                                               Moderate Importance
     corporate governance plays an important role in the
     decisions of emerging market-investors. 66 The outcome
     of a governance analysis often influences the financial and
     non-financial conditions of the investment transaction. IFC’s
     methodology for evaluating corporate governance risks
     and opportunities has been distilled into the “Corporate                                        Very Important

     Governance Development Framework.” This approach
     has been adopted by thirty-three Development Finance
     Institutions (DFIs) for use in their investment processes,
     though this approach has yet to be adopted by investors
     across the board.

     Typically, investors analyze the company’s governance,

     25	 Why is the equitable treatment of shareholders
         important?
     Equitable treatment of shareholders is a cardinal principle of              regulations. Showing goodwill by strengthening shareholder
     corporate governance and crucial to building shareholders’                  rights can go a long way, particularly in countries where
     trust. 69 Equitable treatment does not mean equal treatment.                the enforcement of legal provisions is weak. Examples of
     This is an important distinction, since in many countries,                  shareholder rights are numerous. These include, among
     companies are permitted to have different classes of                        others, obtaining qualified majorities in a shareholder
     shareholders with different rights: not all shareholders are                meeting for decisions of exceptional importance, and
     created equal. However, measures directed at granting                       ensuring pre-emptive rights when you want to raise
     an unfair advantage, such as disproportionate control                       capital by issuing new shares.
     to specific shareholders, raise concerns and likely hinder
                                                                                 If you want to attract international investors, it is crucial
     the capacity of your company to raise funds from the
                                                                                 that you consider practical solutions that ensure that
     capital market. For example, as the universally accepted
                                                                                 national shareholders do not have any real or perceived
     principles of corporate governance of the Organization
                                                                                 advantage over foreign ones. To guard against such an

                                                                                 unfair advantage, a company can, for example, ensure
     declare, “Within any series of a class, all shares should
                                                                                 timely disclosure in English and make extensive use of

                                                                                 its website to communicate with shareholders.
     obtain information about the rights attached to all series
     and classes of shares before they purchase.” In other
     words, not all shares must have the same rights, but
     the differences must be clear and any change should be
     subject to approval by those classes of shares which are
     negatively affected.

     The existence of minority shareholder rights tends to raise
     investors’ level of comfort when it comes to investing in a
     company. This means that you may want to consider non-
     mandatory corporate governance best practices in addition
     to the mandatory minimum rights recognized by local
