  The Sindh Millennium Development Goal (MDG) report indicates that, overall, for water supply, the MDG target of 93 percent has been met, which
demonstrates some inconsistencies in definitions and data from various surveys.

  Rural water supply is expected to increase to 89 percent and urban water supply shows a surprising declining trend and will reduce to 90.6 percent.

  Since the study, a summary of the key findings of the Multi-indicator Cluster Survey 2014 findings were released and received in January 2016. These
broad findings have been referred to in the subsector footnotes with preliminary analysis, although in the absence of the detailed report, it was not possible
or desirable to revise the detailed analysis of the study. The overall trends and conclusions of the study hold.

Agreed priority actions to tackle these challenges, and ensure finance is effectively
turned into services, are:

  Priority actions for the Institutional Framework
  •	 Urgently constitute a water and sanitation task-force based on the SDA Subcommittee/Steering Committee to
     prioritize actionable recommendations and initiate follow-up actions.
  •	 Carry out a province-wide stakeholder analysis to map and document the multiple stakeholders in the sector and
     their current roles (as mandated and de facto) by May 2016.
  •	 Review the incentive structure in the system to mitigate the supply driven capital investment focus; as part of this
     devise mechanisms for the private sector, communities and CBOs to participate and manage assets with legal cover.
  •	 Reach institutional clarity within the sector to align the sector, rationalize mandates and address historical issues
     of fragmentation. Develop a consensus based framework by June 2016 to segregate roles and responsibilities: (i)
     regulator; (ii) policy formulation (including broader water issues and integrated water management); (iii) service
     provision (water assets and O&M).
  •	 Ensure a regulatory body is created by June 2016. The watchdog body will require sustained policy and financial
     support. It will provide for a long-term sector perspective with regulatory functions to cover: (i) compliance with
     environmental regulations and monitoring of water quality; (ii) surface water use and groundwater abstraction; (iii)
     tariff setting; (iv) providers’ performance; (v) rationalization of competing uses of water; (vi) protection of customer
     interests.
  •	 Review the service cadres engaged in sector service delivery (at all levels) with a view to developing a coherent service
     cadre for the sector by FY2017. Assess existing capacities and human resources needs for: (i) strategic planning and
     management; (ii) engineering and technical; (iii) financial management; (iv) urban management; (v) social/community
     development/customer focus.
  •	 Improve sector governance through various measures including e-procurement, ensuring market-based rate
     structures which are standardized and regularly updated for civil works in Water and Sanitation Services (WSS) bids,
     and introducing mandatory design and supervision by consultants of civil works contracts above a threshold, and so
     on.
  •	 Codify in policy the role of elected representatives in relation to WSS investments, the supporting role of the
     administrative and technical arms of local governments and line departments, the roles of communities and CBOs
     and the potential roles of the private sector.



  Priority actions for Financing and Its Implementation
  •	 Policy frameworks should be reviewed to cover the critical issue of cost-recovery, both for capital investments and
     O&M. Where subsidies are to be provided, these should be targeted and explicitly stated.
  •	 High levels of advocacy within Government of Sindh to ensure that the required investment levels for each subsector
     are tapped from within provincial resources. Lobby and obtain approvals for a minimum percentage annual budget
     allocation for the water and sanitation sector. Where necessary, lobby for donor support to cover critical investment
     shortfalls.
  •	 Initiate demand-based budgeting, responsive to identify and rationalized needs, based on clear mandates and
     jurisdictions between key sector institutions (WASAs, Public Health Engineering Departments (PHEDs) and TMAs).
  •	 Support for advocacy with provincial government and selected donors to tap additional projects and funding for new
     and existing water and sanitation initiatives

Sindh Service Delivery Assessment




     Priority actions for Sector Monitoring and Evaluation
     •	 Mandate the Karachi Water and Sanitation Board (KWSB), NSUSC, WASAs, PHED and TMAs to generate sector
        funding from markets and other sources.
     •	 Promote public private partnerships in water and sanitation through a clear policy, enabling environment and
        targeted marketing campaign.
     •	 Immediate attention on comprehensive financial information management, including consolidated annual data
        collection and reporting with a particular focus on subsector allocations and expenditure tracking.
     •	 Prioritize and fast-track the development of a Sector Information Management System (SIMS). Agreement on the
        principles of management of the SIMS, integration with planning processes and sustained resourcing needs to be
        urgently reached.
     •	 Definitional consistency and harmonization between the macro-sources of data (Multi-indicator Cluster Survey (MICS),
        Pakistan Living Standards Measurement Survey (PSLMS), Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), Census, and so on),
        which will also allow for triangulation and a better understanding of coverage and equity. The indicators should be
        defined with the longer-term perspective of monitoring outcomes and adjusted to the Sustainable Development
        Goals (SDGs).
     •	 Review departmental and existing systems of monitoring (at all tiers of government) in 2016. Determine capacity
        needs and where to strengthen existing structures for better and more systematic generation of information,
        in relation to physical assets, financial management and service delivery/customer focus. Third party audits and
        performance monitoring to be systematically carried out and built into the work-plans of oversight bodies and the
        regulator.
     •	 Develop a Monitoring Cell in the LGD to bring together data from the various departments in its purview in a
        cohesive form to allow for planning.
     •	 Geo-reference databases and asset registries to allow for spatial analysis.
     •	 Put in place mechanisms to monitor the significant self and private provision (through collaborative mechanisms with
        the private sector).



     Priority actions for Rural Water Supply
     •	 Rehabilitation of nonfunctioning schemes verified as demand-based.
     •	 Accepting communities’ and small scale service providers’ role in rural water supply management, especially for
        simple to operate systems.
     •	 Agree on and ensure recovery of operational costs to ensure sustainable O&M of built assets.
     •	 Significant increases and equitable distribution of budgetary allocations (capital/recurring expenditures) from the
        provincial/federal government to ensure current level of coverage is sustained.
     •	 Clear segregation of roles and responsibilities for policy, regulation and service provision supplemented by support
        for subsector coordination and planning.




10
Sindh Service Delivery Assessment




  Priority actions for Urban Water Supply
  •	 Ensure urgent reform of urban utilities including KWSB, NSUSC and WASAs and TMAs with a view to introduce
     needed autonomy and structural changes covering performance-based systems; full authority for tariff setting and
     adjustment; hiring and firing; as well as raising of finances to ensure effective service provision.
  •	 An institutional reform plan for urban municipal services should be developed and approved by the provincial
     government in 2016-17. This should begin with the constitution of functional, representative and independent
     boards for all urban utilities.
  •	 Starting with FY 2016-17, a mandatory doubling of the subsector budget allocations (capital/recurring expenditures)
     should be ensured.
  •	 Major water supply projects such as K-IV should be fully funded and efforts made to ensure completion in the next
     two years.
  •	 A crash program for mapping and rehabilitation of all fit for repair, dysfunctional urban water schemes should be
     urgently initiated.
  •	 Immediate quality mapping of all urban water supply schemes should be ensured with a view to plan and implement
     a Sindh Drinking Water Quality Improvement Plan across Sindh.
  •	 Public awareness campaigns on water and health issues should be promoted with the help of nongovernmental
     bodies, educational institutions and mass media. This should be an on-going year round campaign with dedicated
     budgets in the public sector.
  •	 Promotion of public-private partnership models for urban service provision, collection and maintenance and
     rehabilitation should be piloted and results assessed in 2016-17.
  •	 Capacity building in areas of planning, Monitoring and Evaluation, asset management, regulation and financial
     management is a high need across all utilities.
  •	 Advocacy with the federal government and selected donors to ensure that the CAPEX gap identified by the SDA is
     fully covered and the Vision 2025 targets are met.
  •	 Clear segregation of roles and responsibilities for policy, regulation and service provision should be reflected in the
     institutional reform plan for the subsector.
  •	 Systems for need based planning and investment provision should be ensured through policy and verifiable protocols
     that are open to public scrutiny.
  •	 Quarterly multi-stakeholder review forums should be established and made mandatory for all utility companies and
     municipal service providers.
  •	 Advocacy with selected donors to plan, design and fund new sub-sector projects for Sindh. The Water and Sanitation
     Program (WSP) can play a key role with the provision of complementary technical assistance and other support.



  Priority actions for Rural Sanitation and Hygiene
  •	 The existing institutions of sanitation service delivery in rural areas (for example, District/Union Councils/PHED) as
     per the Sindh Local Government Act 2013 are not oriented to and geared to the challenges of civic engagement/
     education behavior change, and so on. They have serious capacity issues. The policy requires that a separate division
     of environmental health and sanitation should be established within LGD having at least two environmental health
     technicians per union council. Such a department will in future accumulate a mandate for addressing vulnerable
     practices and emerging challenges such as dengue control, Ebola/H1N1type outbreaks, indoor air pollution control,
     climate-change adaption for water and sanitation services, and so on.
  •	 In the interim period, a Sindh Sanitation Task Force, comprised of Health, LGD, RDD, PHED, Education department
     and other key stakeholders may be created which is mirrored at the district and subdistrict levels to collaboratively
     address the complex and ever looming challenges of climate induced disasters and environmental sanitation risks.
  •	 Mobilization of necessary Government of Sindh, local government, health and donor resources for implementation
     of the SSS program. The SSS provides a clear multi-sectoral roadmap for achieving the ODF Sindh goal by 2020.

Priority actions for Urban Sanitation
•	 Medium- and longer-term planning for the sub-sector should be urgently ensured with inputs from all urban sector
   players. In addition, a regulatory system of subsector coordination and multi-stakelholder inputs and oversight should
   be initiated.
•	 Clear segregation of roles and responsibilities for policy, regulation and service provision should be ensured and
   all service providers including the KWSB/WASAs/NSUSC and others, suitably restructured as part of the broader
   institutional reform plan for the subsector; the reform recommendations contained in the Karachi Master Plan could
   provide one basis for initiating change. In addition, updated studies could be commissioned.
•	 Urgently ensure the needed autonomy within the large urban players with a focus on the introduction of performance-
   based systems; regular tariff adjustments to meet cost of service provision; hiring and firing; and raising of finances
   to ensure effective service provision.
•	 Urgent mapping of urban sanitation priorities with a focus on smaller cities and towns of Sindh that show signs of
   long and continuing neglect. As an output, a five-year business plan should be developed, adequately resourced and
   closely monitored.
•	 Expedite and enhance resource allocations for S-III (in Karachi) and other sewage treatment projects (across Sindh)
   whose delay can seriously impact on the urban environment and the health of all residents.
•	 Build public awareness and institutional capacities for enforcement of environmental laws and regulations.
•	 Starting with FY 2016-17, an annual doubling of the subsector budget allocations (capital/recurring expenditures)
   should be ensured.
•	 Budget shortfalls for the subsector should be ensured from the federal government and selected donors to ensure
   that the CAPEX gap identified by the SDA is fully covered.
•	 Advocacy with selected donors to plan, design and fund new subsector projects for Sindh.

   •	 Urgently constitute a Water and Sanitation ‘Task Force’ based on the SDA Subcommittee/Steering Committee to

   •	 Carry out a province-wide stakeholder analysis to map and document the multiple stakeholders in the sector and
      their current roles (as mandated and de facto) by May 2016.
   •	 Review the incentive structure in the system to mitigate the supply driven capital investment focus; as part of this,
      devise mechanisms for the private sector, communities and Community Based Organizations (CBOs) to participate
      and manage assets with legal cover.
   •	 Reach institutional clarity within the sector to align the sector, rationalize mandates and address historical issues of
      fragmentation. Develop a consensus-based framework by December 2016 to segregate roles and responsibilities: (i)
      regulator; (ii) policy formulation (including broader water issues and integrated water management); (iii) service
      provision (water assets and O&M).
   •	 Ensure a “regulatory body” is created by June 2016. The watchdog body will require sustained policy and financial
      support. It will provide for a long-term sector perspective with regulatory functions to cover: (i) compliance with
      environmental regulations and monitoring of water quality; (ii) surface water use and groundwater abstraction;
      (iii) tariff setting; (iv) providers’ performance; (v) rationalization of competing uses of water; and (vi) protection of
      customer interests.
   •	 Review the service cadres engaged in sector service delivery (at all levels) with a view to developing a coherent service
      cadre for the sector by Financial Year (FY) 2017. Assess existing capacities and human resources needs for: (i) strategic
      planning and management; (ii) engineering and technical; (iii) financial management; (iv) urban management; and
      (v) social/community development/customer focus.
   •	 Improve sector governance through various measures including e-procurement, ensuring market-based rate structures
      which are standardized and regularly updated for civil works in WSS tenders, and introducing mandatory design and
      supervision by consultants of civil works contracts above a threshold, and so on.

   •	 Policy frameworks should be reviewed to cover the critical issue of cost recovery; both for capital investments and
      O&M. Where subsidies are to be provided, these should be targeted and explicitly stated.
   •	 High levels of advocacy within Government of Sindh to ensure that the required investment levels for each subsector
      are tapped from within “provincial” resources. Lobby and obtain approvals for a minimum percentage annual budget
      allocation for the W&S sector. Where necessary, lobby for federal support to cover critical investment shortfalls.
   •	 Initiate demand-based budgeting, responsive to identify and rationalized needs, based on clear mandates and
      jurisdictions between key sector institutions (WASAs, PHEDs and TMAs).
   •	 Support for advocacy with provincial government and selected donors to tap additional projects and funding for new
      and existing W&S initiatives.
   •	 Mandate the KWSB, NSUSC, WASAs, PHED and TMAs to generate sector funding from markets and other
      sources.
   •	 Promote public private partnerships in W&S through a clear policy, enabling environment and targeted marketing
      campaign.
   •	 Immediate attention on comprehensive financial information management, including consolidated annual data
      collection and reporting with a particular focus on subsector allocations and expenditure tracking.

     •	 Prioritize and fast track the development of a Sector Information and Management System (SIMS). Agreement on
        the principles of management of the SIMS, integration with planning processes and sustained resourcing needs to be
        urgently reached.
     •	 Definitional consistency and harmonization between the macro-sources of data (MICS, PSLMS, Demographic and
        Health Survey (DHSO, Census, and so on), which will also allow for triangulation and a better understanding of
        coverage and equity. The indicators should be defined with the longer-term perspective of monitoring outcomes and
        adjusted to the SDGs.
     •	 Review departmental and existing systems of monitoring (at all tiers of government) in 2016. Determine capacity
        needs and where to strengthen existing structures for better and more systematic generation of information, in relation
        to physical assets, financial management and service delivery/customer focus. Third party audits and performance
        monitoring to be systematically carried out and built into the work plans of oversight bodies and the regulator.
     •	 Develop a Monitoring Cell in the LGD to bring together data from the various departments in its purview in a
        cohesive form to allow for planning.
     •	 Geo-reference databases and asset registries to allow for spatial analysis.
     •	 Put in place mechanisms to monitor the significant self and private provision (through collaborative mechanisms
        with the private sector).

   Priority actions for Urban Water Supply
   •	 Ensure urgent reform of the urban utilities including KWSB, NSUSC and WASAs and TMAs with a view to
      introduce needed autonomy and structural changes covering performance-based systems; full authority for tariff
      setting and adjustment; hiring and firing; as well as raising of finances to ensure effective service provision.
   •	 An institutional reform plan for urban municipal services should be developed and approved by the provincial
      government in 2016-17. This should begin with the constitution of functional, representative and independent
      boards for all urban utilities.
   •	 Starting with FY 2016-17, a mandatory doubling of the subsector budget allocations (capital/recurring expenditures)
      should be ensured.
   •	 Major water supply projects such as K-IV should be fully funded and efforts made to ensure completion in the next
      two years.
   •	 A crash program for mapping and rehabilitation of all fit for repair, dysfunctional urban water schemes should be
      urgently initiated.
   •	 Immediate quality mapping of all UWS should be ensured with a view to plan and implement a Sindh Drinking
      Water Quality Improvement plan across entire Sindh.
   •	 Public awareness campaigns on water and health issues should be promoted with the help of nongovernmental
      bodies, educational institutions and mass media. This should be an on-going year round campaign with dedicated
      budgets in the public sector.
   •	 Promotion of public-private partnership models for urban service provision, collection and M&R should be piloted
      and results assessed in 2016-17.
   •	 Capacity building in areas of planning, M&E , asset management, regulation and financial management is a high
      need across all utilities.
   •	 Advocacy with the federal government and selected donors to ensure that the CAPEX gap identified by the SDA is
      fully covered and Vision 2025 targets are met.
   •	 Clear segregation of roles and responsibilities for policy, regulation and service provision should be reflected in the
      institutional reform plan for the subsector.
   •	 Systems for need-based planning and investment provision should be ensured through policy and verifiable protocols
      that are open to public scrutiny.
   •	 Quarterly multi-stakeholder review forums should be established and made mandatory for all utility companies and
      municipal service providers.
   •	 Advocacy with selected donors to plan, design and fund new subsector projects for Sindh. WSP can play a key role
      with the provision of technical assistance and other support.

        health and sanitation should be established within LGD having at least two environmental health technicians per
        Union Council. Such a department will, in future, accumulate a mandate for addressing vulnerable practices and
        emerging challenges such as dengue control, Ebola/H1N1 type outbreaks, indoor air pollution control, climate-

     •	 In the interim period, a Sindh Sanitation Task Force, comprised of LGD, RDD, PHED, Education and Health
        departments and other key stakeholders may be created which is mirrored at the district and subdistrict levels to
        collaboratively address the complex and ever looming challenges of climate induced disasters and environmental
        sanitation risks.

       •	 Medium- and longer-term planning for the subsector should be urgently ensured with inputs from all urban sector
          players. In addition, a regular system of subsector coordination and multi-stakelholder inputs and oversight should
          be initiated.
       •	 Clear segregation of roles and responsibilities for policy, regulation and service provision should be ensured and all
          service providers including the KWSB, WASAs, NSUSC and others, suitably restructured as part of the broader
          institutional reform plan for the subsector; the reform recommendations contained in the Karachi Master Plan could
          provide one basis for initiating change. In addition, updated studies could be commissioned.
       •	 Urgently ensure the needed autonomy within the large urban players with a focus on the introduction of performance-
          based systems; regular tariff adjustments to meet cost of service provision; hiring and firing; and raising of finances

          long and continuing neglect. As an output, a five-year business plan should be developed, adequately resourced and
          closely monitored.
       •	 Expedite and enhance resource allocations for S-III (in Karachi) and other sewage treatment projects (across Sindh)
          whose delay can seriously impact the urban environment and health of all residents.
       •	 Build public awareness and institutional capacities for enforcement of environmental laws and regulations.
       •	 Starting with FY 2016-17, an annual doubling of the subsector budget allocations (capital/recurring expenditures)
          should be ensured.
       •	 Budget shortfalls for the subsector should be ensured from the federal government and selected donors to ensure that
          the CAPEX gap identified by the SDA is fully covered.
       •	 Advocacy with selected donors to plan, design and fund new subsector projects for Sindh.
