THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW

environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

Following is a detailed summary of those procedures,
along with the associated time and cost. These                Start-up Capital: 10 times GNI per capita
procedures are those that apply to a company
matching      the    standard     assumptions      (the
“standardized company”) used by Doing Business in
collecting the data (see the section in this chapter on
what the indicators measure).
Table 2.2 Summary of time, cost and procedures for starting a business in Slovenia -

                                                                                 complete
       Deposit capital in a bank account and get a receipt from the bank

       The minimum founding capital is EUR 7,500. The founding capital or the
       base capital contribution can be paid in cash or as a non-cash
       contribution. Non-cash contribution includes movables, real property,
       rights or any other non-cash assets. Before filing the application for
       entry, the partner must provide at least one-quarter of the nominal
       capital, and the total value of all guaranteed contributions must be at
       least EUR 7,500.

       In order for the entrepreneurs to be able to file the application for
       registration at the e-VEM access point, they must demonstrate a
   1   certificate on the paid-in founding capital. The deposit account where      1 day           no charge
       the founding capital is deposited can be opened at a bank teller or
       electronically via the e-VEM web portal, which some banks already
       support and others are expected to join the system in the near future.
       The participating corporate banks allow e-VEM points to check for
       themselves whether the capital has been deposited to the bank
       account, and they can print out the certificate on the payment of the
       founding capital using the bank's information system data.

        Founders may establish a LLC at the VEM point under three conditions:
        (1) all the contributions have to be paid in cash and prior to the
        registration of the company (2) the articles of association have to be
        drafted in a special form (only mandatory and most common provisions
        can be incorporated in this form) and (3) the founders/shareholders
        wish to manage the book of decisions in an electronic form.

        If these conditions are not applicable, the company can be registered at
        the Public Notary

        In order to found an LLC, founders have to visit the VEM entry point in
        person, as an authorized person has to carry out their identification.
        VEM points will allow procedures to be done online:
        • Limited Liability companies can go directly to the VEM, the deed is
        sent to point VEM or to the registration body through electronic
        channels, it must be signed by means of a safe electronic signature with
        qualified certificate (the qualified certificate is the special digital
        certificate for identity check and electronic operation at the VEM point

        • Standard Articles of Association: help the founders to draft the articles
        of association, verify their signatures where necessary and draft the
        corresponding preposition for registration of the company at the court
        register. However it is still the common practice to have the statutes
        and the article of association prepared and certified by the notary.
        • Publication: Even if this requirement is not mandatory anymore, E-
        VEM allows for the company information to be available online.
        • Register with the Statistical Office of Slovenia: the court register
        automatically forwards all the required information to AJPES. The
        information is then entered in the Business Register and published
        online. Court register and business register are technically united in one
        information base and are now both run by AJPES.
        • Register with the tax administration - the tax information is
        transmitted through E-VEM and data is entered automatically when it is
        received from E-VEM.
        • Register with the Health Institute.

        building permit. All data included in the location information must be
        obtained ex officio by the local administration that issues the building
        permit. However, in practice obtaining the location information is still
        done by most applicants to provide an additional guarantee.
        Furthermore, the location information provides a clear list of project
        approvals that must be obtained in the process of obtaining the
        building permit for the area in question. Location documents can be
        obtained online on http://www.gu.gov.si/en. This has allowed anybody
        to obtain land maps and geodetic data directly online.

      The government of Slovenia amended its Construction Act in July 2012.
      The amended law eliminated the requirement for obtaining project
      conditions from the water and sewage provider company before
      completing the project design. An investor may now directly obtain the
      project approval from the water and sewage provider without obtaining
      the project conditions.

      The water and sewage provider must issue its approval (or disapproval)         30 days       no charge

      to the project solutions in 30 days from submitting the application. If
      the agency's approval (disapproval) is not issued within the 30 days, it is
      deemed that the agency has given its approval (i.e. the investor may
      start with the building permit obtaining procedure without attaching
      the project approval to the application).

      Apply for and obtain a building permit from the Administration
      Unit Ljubljana

      According to the amended Construction Act, the required documents
      that must be submitted along with the application for the building
      permit are the project design (at least two copies), the certificate of the
      right to build (i.e. except for the land registry as a proof of ownership of
      the land) and previously obtained approvals to the project solutions.
      The project design must be prepared by the licensed architect. The
      project design includes data on location of the building, schemes,
      architectural plan, plan of building structures, plan on electrical
      installations, etc.

      The Administrative Unit issues the building permit if the following
      conditions are fulfilled:
      • Project design is completed in accordance with the applicable spatial
      plans
      • Project design is prepared by a licensed architect                           60 days       EUR 773

      • All required approvals have been obtained
      • Project design is prepared in accordance with the valid legislation
      • Contributions prescribed by law have been paid (i.e. administrative tax
      for the application for the building permit, public utilities charge,
      compensation for degradation of the environment)
      • Building will be furnished with the minimal standard of the utility
      services (i.e. electricity, water and sewage etc.)

      The building permit is no longer valid if the investor fails to commence
      construction of the building in three years (two years in the case of the
      less complex constructions) from the date the building permit became
      final.

      According to the law, the administrative unit shall issue a building
      permit in 2 months (60 days) from the day the application (including all
      obligatory attachments) was submitted. This can take longer in practice
      but the legal time limit of 60 days is generally met.

      The cost depends on the value of the construction. The method for
      calculating the cost for issuing the building permit is the following: the
      administrative tax is EUR 4.54 for the application itself + EUR 724.88
      that applies to the value of the construction up to EUR 420,000.00 +
      0.01% of the construction value that applies only to the value of the
      construction exceeding EUR 420,000.00.

      * Hire a geodesist company to conduct marking out before
      construction and after construction

      BuildCo would be using the services of a licensed geodesist company
      or specialist before the construction and after the new building is
      completed. Before construction, BuildCo must ensure that the
      construction is marked out according to the building permit. A written
      notice stating the date and the place of marking out shall be sent to
      the municipal administration at least 8 days before commencement of
      the works. The associated cost depends on the size of the construction
      and on the number of corners (for example, for the building with 4
      corners the price is between EUR 370.00 and EUR 700.00). This
      procedure is a prerequisite for the Technical Examination by the              1 day        EUR 960

      After construction, the company needs to undertake a new study and
      prepare a geodetic plan of the new state of the plot. The associated
      cost depends on the size of the construction and on the number of
      corners (for example, for the building with 4 corners the price is
      between EUR 370.00 and EUR 700.00). This segment came as a reform
      under the Construction Act (2008).

      If the Administrative Unit establishes that the application has all the
      necessary documentation, it appoints the Commission for Technical
      Examination of the building and determines the date of the
      examination.

      If the Commission for Technical Examination establishes that the
      building was constructed in accordance with the issued building permit,
      the Administrative Unit issues the license for use.

      The costs of the license for use are EUR 3.88 for the application and
      EUR 15.49 for the decision on issuance of the license for use. According

        An application can be submitted in person, by mail and by e-mail. The
        following approvals and contracts are needed in the process of
        connecting a new customer to the power grid:
        • approval of warehouse project (Statement that the warehouse matches
        requirements of the power connection conditions),
        • connection approval (Detailed technical specification; metering, rights
        and obligations of utility and investor-owner),
        • connection contract.
        The customer has to send applications for each of those approvals and
        contract at the same time to the utility to the same department. In
        addition, the customer has to request at the same time the technical
        conditions from the utility. The customer is sending an application to ask
        for the “power connection conditions”. The technical conditions are
   1    needed to get information about the location, the point of ''hook up'',    25 calendar days         EUR 0

        design the connection. Documents to be attached to apply for those
        approvals and the technical conditions are (varies for each one):
        Location, electrical power needed, project documents and ownership
        documents. The documents do not need to be notarized. There are no
        extra costs associated. The customer gets the approvals by mail or can
        come and pick them up. There is no external inspection. If the external
        connection work is done by a private electrical contractor, an inspection
        by the utility is done during the connection works. The customer can
        apply for the internal inspection at this point by submitting an extra
        form.

      The customer has to submit a separate application for the supply

      Transformers usually have enough capacity to accommodate an
      additional load of 140kVA inside and around the motorway ring (the
      area where warehouses usually locate). Therefore, no extra transformer
      needs to be built for the new customer and the warehouse is connected
      via simple hook-up to the next utility distribution transformer (usually
      200 meters distance). Either the utility or an outside company is in
      charge of the external works including designing the details of the

       Seller presents a tax declaration to the Tax Authority, and the land
       tax is assessed

       The seller is principally required to make a land tax declaration to the
       competent department of the Tax Administration of the Republic of
       Slovenia within 15 days after the day on which the purchase agreement
       was concluded. The Tax Administration is required to assess the land tax
       within 30 days of the day on which the tax declaration was made. If the
       purchase price of real estate is lower than 80% of generalized market
   2   value (assessed by the Surveying and Mapping Authority of the Republic          1-30 days               no cost
       of Slovenia, GURS), the tax base is set at 80% of generalized market
       value (based on Mass Real Estate Valuation Act published in the Official
       Gazette of RS of 16 May 2006 and 2 November 2011 and put in practice
       on 26 December 2011). If taxpayer does not agree with such tax base, he
       can, till the end of appealing period, argue it by individual valuation
       carrying the valuation cost. The documentation shall include: Filled-in

      Payment and procedure of the real estate transfer tax or VAT tax at
      the Tax Administration Office

      The VAT does not have to be paid if the transaction of real estate is
      taxed by Real Estate Transfer Tax. VAT is obligatory only for new real
      estate. The Real Estate Transfer Tax Procedure is as follows: The
      taxpayer has to insert the tax declaration within 15 days at the Tax
      Authority, after the deed of sale is signed. The Tax Authority has to
      assess the real estate transfer tax within 30 days after receiving the
      declaration. When the real estate transfer tax is assessed on the basis of
      the selling price, the tax must be paid at the competent Tax
      Administration Office within 30 days after the receipt of the decision on                 2% of property

      tax assessment. The VAT Procedure is as follows: VAT by transfer of                      price (transfer tax)
      property is paid only if the seller, who is liable for VAT, agrees with the
      buyer of real estate, who is also liable for VAT with the right to deduct
      the full input VAT to charge for VAT at the prescribed rate on the supply
      that should be exempted from VAT. VAT rate for transfer of property is
      20%, except the transfer of apartments, residential and other buildings
      for permanent living and other parts of buildings as part of social policy,
      including their building, renovation and repair, which is 8.5%.

      proposal. The amendments to the Land Registry Act adopted on 27
      March 2009 and implemented on 1 May 2011 have enacted the

      the courts. The land registry procedure is completely computerized. The
      submissions should be entered via a notary public or attorneys and real-
      estate agencies acting on behalf of the applicant. However, the amended
      Land Register Act still provides some exceptions that registrations may
      also be submitted directly by the applicant. Simultaneously, the                                EUR 37 + EUR 8.14
