  The NFHS (2006) data indicate 18.8 percent of urban households connected to sewers (estimated as 12.6 million households), which has increased to 25.8 million in
2011 (Census, 2011), which indicates an addition of about 2.6 million annually over the five years. Assuming that a substantial reason for this uptake is the grounding of
JNNURM, the model has assumed a similar range of conversion. It is also felt that unless proactive steps are taken to ease the process of connection (household investment a
major factor), connection rates could taper off and hence fewer households connecting are assumed in the 13th plan. In reality, this obstacle might play out differently with
fewer conversions at the earlier stages, followed by increased connections later, but keeping to the aggregate volume over the model period.

  The Reserve Bank of India’s estimated historical average long-term inflation rate is 7.5 percent (Mohanty, 2011). However, a conservative estimate of 6.5 percent has been
taken for the model. Appropriate sensitivity analysis can be carried out for other inflation estimators.

  The households with onsite sanitation arrangements include flush/pour-flush connections to septic tanks (38.2 percent), to pit latrines (7.1 percent), other systems (1.7
percent) and with night soil serviced by humans/animals (0.5 percent) or disposed to drain (1.2 percent).

   Unit costs for onsite and community sanitation were not available from MoUD or HPEC at the time of model generation.

   At this point, we have no clear estimate of what the conversion/adoption rate would be for existing latrine owners in urban India where sewer networks are being put in
place.

   A cursory examination of data for the states indicates data showing households connected to sewers in most districts of Kerala. Reportedly, the state has only two cities
having working sewerage systems and hence networks. However, households connected to sewers are reported in most districts (14)!
