﻿INTRODUCTION
The Nigeria Economic Report (NER) is a regular publication of the World Bank. Each edition
provides an overview of recent macroeconomic developments and devotes special attention
to a topic of particular relevance or urgency. In this edition the macroeconomic overview is
followed by both a detailed analysis of the country's fuel subsidy and an assessment of the current
state and economic potential of its natural gas sector.
2015 has been a momentous year for Nigeria. The general elections held in March brought about
the first democratic transition of power from a ruling party to an opposition party, heightening
expectations for meaningful political change. The new Government is taking power during a very
challenging time, however, marked by a sharp decline in global oil prices and continuing violence in
the country's northeast.This creates a difficult context for realizing the new administration's ambitious
reform agenda for job creation, the power sector, oil and gas, agriculture, and public administration.
As noted above, this edition of the NER examines two prominent subjects of debate in Nigeria: the
fuel subsidy and the natural gas sector.The current budgetary crisis has again motivated Nigeria to
reconsider the fiscal costs of the fuel subsidy, while the acute inadequacy of power generation in
Nigeria has cast increasing attention on the natural gas sector. Chapter 2 of the report analyzes the
costs and benefits of Nigeria's fuel subsidy, including their implications for low-income households.
Fuel subsidy costs are expected to amount to 18 percent of government oil revenues in 2015, and
this share could increase to more than 30 percent by 2018 even if oil prices remain low.
There is a general consensus that increasing the supply of power in Nigeria is critical to the future
development of the country. The success of the current plans to boost generation capacity will
hinge on the development of the natural gas sector. Nigeria is endowed with substantial natural
gas reserves, but major reforms will be necessary to attract the investment necessary to harness the
potential of the natural gas sector to supply the domestic energy market. Chapter 3 of this report
summarizes the current regulatory situation in the natural gas sector and outlines potential avenues
for reform.
This edition of the NER was prepared by a World Bank team led by John Litwack (Lead Economist)
and Khwima Nthara (Program Leader and Lead Economist). Masami Kojima (Lead Energy Specialist)
is the primary author of Chapter 3, and also contributed to other sections. Andrew Dabalen (Lead
Economist), Jariya Hoffman (Senior Economist), Gloria Joseph-Raji (Senior Economist), and Olayinka
Babalola (Economist-Consultant) also made contributions.

MACROECONOMIC OVERVIEW
Summary
Given the high dependency of Nigeria on oil revenues,the recent sharp decline in oil prices has given
rise to major challenges in the form of external imbalance, steep falls in government revenues, and
slower economic growth. In contrast to the period of 2008-2009, Nigeria no longer has a large fiscal
reserve to buffer government budgets from the revenue shortfalls. As a result, distributions to federal
and state government budgets declined in nominal terms by 39 percent in the first half of 2015
relative to the same period of 2014. Federal and state governments have slashed capital spending,
and a number of states have struggled just to pay salaries to civil servants and service domestic
debt obligations.The pace of growth in Nigeria has slowed in light of lower foreign inflows from oil
and thefiscal contraction.The national currency has depreciated by 20 percent between November
2014 and March, 2015, leading to a significant import contraction that has alleviated some of the
pressure on the naira. New currency controls on the forex market should bring further significant
import contraction, although they are also expected to negatively impact trade and GDP growth.
Other recent policy initiatives include a financial assistance package for State budgets, measures to
rationalize the management and operation of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC),
fight corruption, and resolve the conflict in the North East of the country.The fuel subsidy, which is
imposing a large and increasing burden on public finance, has become the focus of renewed policy
debate.
For the medium term, Nigeria will need to create the fiscal space needed to provide the public
services essential for maintaining and accelerating progress in job creation and poverty reduction.
However, it will likely be unable to rely on oil revenues as in the past. Oil prices are expected to remain
weaker over the medium term than their recent historical levels. Even if oil prices rebound to those
levels, the absence of growth in the oil sector implies that oil revenues will most likely continue to
decline relative to the size of the Nigerian economy, as illustrated in Chapter 2 of this Report. On
the positive side, the sovereign debt position of Nigeria is still strong, there is potential for boosting
non-oil revenue generation, and investors stand ready to bring significant resources to the country
if they receive signals of commitment by the new Government to policy directions and regulations
consistent with strong private-sector-led growth.
The Oil Price Shock
Crude oil prices have declined sharply since June 2014 and are expected to remain significantly
below their recent historical levels over the medium term. Bonny Light crude prices fell by almost 60

OIL REVENUES AND THE FUEL SUBSIDY
Summary
This Chapter examines the costs and benefits of the fuel subsidy in Nigeria in light of current
prospects for oil prices and revenue. Overall, the fuel subsidy appears to have very modest benefits
for everyday Nigerians, particularly given the fact that the administratively set prices for petrol and
kerosene are no longer enforced in most of Nigeria. The lack of enforcement means that almost all
benefits are captured by importers and traders; moreover, even if these prices were fully enforced,
it is estimated that the richest 20 percent of Nigerians would capture most of the benefits. On
the other hand, the costs of the subsidy are very high and growing with time, as increasing petrol
demand in Nigeria outpaces growth in oil output or revenues. The US$35 billion cost of the fuel
subsidy during 2010-2014 was a primary reason why Nigeria was unable to accumulate a fiscal
reserve in the Excess Crude Account that could have protected the country from the recent oil price
shock. Fuel subsidy obligations are expected to reach 18 percent of all government oil revenues in
2015, and, if the current regulated prices are maintained, this is projected to increase to more than
30 percent by 2018.
Introduction
A recent sharp decline in oil prices and revenues has once again motivated Nigeria to
reconsider its commitment to the fuel subsidy, which compensates importers and traders
of petrol and kerosene the difference between estimated world market prices and fixed
pump prices of 87 and 50 naira per liter, respectively. The fuel subsidy has been a continual
source of controversy in Nigeria. Previous governments have tried to remove it, but popular unrest
led to its reinstatement. Some Nigerians considered the fuel subsidy to be one of the only tangible
benefits that they receive from the Government, and have been skeptical that the Government
would put the resources to better use for them in the event of its removal.
The fiscal cost of the fuel subsidy is very high, reaching an estimated US$35 billion during
2010-2014. Moreover, annual costs are increasing over time due to rising fuel demand and the
depreciation of the naira. In recent years numerous audits and reports have identified widespread
corruption and fraud in the administration of the fuel subsidy, and official petrol imports have
substantially exceeded actual consumption. Attempts by the Government to crack down on fraud
and delay payment of the subsidy have commonly met with severe fuel shortages in the country
that also impose high economic and welfare costs on Nigerians. This Chapter intends to inform the
current discussions in Nigeria on the future of the fuel subsidy by seeking to clarify its current costs

UNLOCKING THE POTENTIAL OF
NIGERIA'S NATURAL GAS SECTOR
Summary
Nigeria's natural gas sector has enormous potential to boost the country's power supply, driving
accelerated growth and diversification. However, attracting the billions of dollars of investment
necessary to develop the sector will require a well-designed institutional and policy framework
backed by a credible political commitment.The authorities will need to re-examine a range of critical
issues, including the impact of obliging many gas producers to supply the bulk of the gas delivered to
the domestic market at a single low price, continuing uncertainty about future gas prices and other
critical parameters, the absence of contractual terms to commercialize gas in certain felds, and the
pseudo-regulatory roles played by some market operators. In this context, realizing the vast potential
of Nigeria's natural gas sector will demand a bold new strategy that includes the establishment of an
independent regulator.
Introduction
Nigeria's natural gas reserves are the gth largest in the world,' yet the country suffers from chronic
gas shortages. Most of Nigeria's electricity is generated by natural gas, and gas shortages have
contributed to an inadequate power supply that slows economic growth and inhibits diversifcation
(Figure 3.1). In the first nine months of 2015, Nigeria produced 7.8 billion cubic feet (bcf) of natural
gas per day, of which 44 percent was exported and another 43 percent was used for purposes
other than commercial sale,6 leaving just 13 percent, or about I bcf/day, for the domestic market.
Moreover, only two-thirds of the natural gas supplied to the domestic market-or 9 percent of total
gas production-was used for power generation (Figure 3.2).
Even in the midst of serious disruptions to the gas supply in the first half of 2015, more gas was
being flared than used to generate electricity.7 Although gas shortages have now subsided, meeting
5 Nigeria's natural gas reserves are estimated at 180 trillion cubic feet.
6 These include re-injection for enhanced oil recovery, flaring, and fueling other oil and gas operations.
7 A large proportion of natural gas is associated gas, which is a byproduct of oil production. Being far more prof-
itable than gas, oil production is the main commercial interest. If gas prices are lower than costs of processing
and transporting associated gas, it is more economic to flare (burn) than to commercialize it. While some flaring
is unavoidable for safety and other technical reasons, it is possible to commercialize production of associated gas
and eliminate routine flaring, enabling more productive use of the gas.
