Executive Summary
Climate change is a huge challenge for the ARD sector in Romania. On the one hand, agriculture is a
source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and must therefore be expected to contribute towards the
climate change mitigation goals of the Europe 2020 Strategy. On the other hand, the ARD sector is
highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change since the capacity of the “rural space” to provide
adequate food supply; deliver ecosystem services; support economic growth, and; provide a safe
living environment for rural communities is directly dependent upon favourable climatic conditions.

However, there are opportunities in the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) for helping to address
these challenges during the next programme period of 2014-2020 – in particular, the new rural
development policy (Pillar II of the CAP) which has been significantly strengthened regarding actions
for climate change mitigation and adaptation.

This rapid sectoral analysis aims to contribute to the successful mainstreaming of climate action into
Romania’s post-2013 rural development policy – namely the National Rural Development
Programme (NRDP) for Romania 2014-2020 that will be co-financed by the European Agricultural
Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).

This report is one of six rapid sectoral analyses1 undertaken within the framework of Component B of
the World Bank’s Romania Climate Change Reimbursable Advisory Service (RAS) Programme. The
title of Component B is “Identify and integrate climate actions into the 2014 -2020 sector Operational
Programmes”.

Characteristics of the Agricultural and Rural Development (ARD) Sector

Compared to other EU Member States, the ARD sector in Romania is an extensive sector occupying
59.8% of total territory and providing a home to 44.9% of the total population. A relatively high
proportion of national Gross Added Value (32.4%) and employment (41.5%) is also generated in rural
areas. However, the ARD sector in Romania is also diverse and complex with much variability in
socio-economic context and human / institutional capacity.

Rural areas in Romania are characterised by low quality infrastructure and relatively undeveloped
basic services (health and education systems, finance and credit facilities etc.) compared to the urban
areas.

The total area of agricultural land in Romania is 15.9 million hectares, of which around 13.3 million
ha (approximately 56% of total territory) is currently being used. Around 1.5 million ha of utilised
agricultural covered by economically viable / marginally viable irrigation systems, although only
about 800 000 ha is currently functional. The rehabilitation of public and private irrigation
infrastructure serving 100,000 ha and 300,000 ha, respectively, was finalized in 2012.

Livestock production in Romania declined rapidly following the collapse of the socialist regime and
has continued (except for poultry) to follow a downward trend ever since.

The ARD sector is comprised of two distinct and clearly defined sub-sectors with i) around one half
of the agricultural land managed by a small number of very large-scale, capital intensive and
technologically advanced farms, and; ii) the other half of agricultural land occupied by communities
of very small-scale farmers practicing more traditional farming methods and largely producing for
their own consumption.
1
    The other sector reports are energy, transport, urban, water and forestry
                                                                                                          3
There are a total of 3.86 million agricultural holdings in Romania, of which 96.6% fall into this
“small-scale, subsistence farm” sub-sector. These small farms provide an important socio-economic
buffer and basic livelihood for a significant proportion of the rural population. They also have an
important role to play in maintaining the vitality of rural communities and providing important social,
cultural and environmental services to the wider Romanian society. In the short-term context of
2014-2020 it is reasonable to assume that this small-scale farm sector will continue to persist, but in
the longer-term there is a clear governmental commitment to structural reform of the highly polarised
agricultural sector and a decline in the number of small farms is likely.

Romania has a diverse rural environment and an abundance of natural resources. Water resources are
not in short supply, but there is a need for good management to ensure sustainability. However, while
the overall situation appears good because of over-capacity there are areas of water scarcity in many
basins where summer droughts are a significant concern. In particular the basins of Jiu, Arges-Vedea,
Buzau-Ialomita, Siret, Prut-Barlad, and Dobrogea-Litoral face significant scarcity, with the last one
being the most water-scarce basin in Romania. This situation will become more serious as the impacts
of climate change become more pronounced.

Pollution of groundwater with nitrates continues to be a serious problem and is largely associated with
the poor management of livestock manure and human waste in rural areas.

Vulnerabilities and Risks from Climate Change in the ARD Sector

Romania’s temperate continental climate is changing and is predicted to be significantly different in
the next 50-100 years.

The average annual air temperature is increasing and Romania should expect a continued steady
increase in annual average temperature similar to that projected for the whole of Europe. There is
some variation in the projections of the different models used, but compared to the period 1980-1990
further rises in annual average temperature should be expected of between:

   0.5°C – 1.5°C by 2029, and;
   2.0°C – 5.0°C by 2099 (depending upon global scenario).

The total amount of annual precipitation is decreasing and a continued reduction in mean annual
precipitation of 10-20% should be expected by the end of the century, although this is likely to vary
greatly between i) the north and south of the country, and ii) the mountains and lowland areas.

The pattern of precipitation is also expected to continue to change with a greater frequency of shorter,
more intense and localised rainfall events. Rainfall patterns may also become more chaotic and
difficult to predict.

Romania is already increasingly encountering the negative impacts of climate change (including
extreme events) and the modelling of future climate trends suggests that these negative impacts will
continue to become more severe. These impacts include:

   the increased incidence of severe flooding;
   the increased intensity and frequency of drought;
   increased risk of soil erosion and desertification.




                                                                                                           4
Overall the ARD sector appears highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and it is expected
that the livelihoods of many rural people will be more and more affected by the changing climatic
conditions that are predicted.

But the risk of impact is not equally distributed. There are regional differences in the likelihood of
negative impacts such as drought and extreme rainfall events, as well differences in the vulnerability,
resilience and adaptive capacity of rural actors and communities to climate change. Differences
which are further accentuated by the huge polarity in farm size and structure that is characteristic of
the ARD sector in Romania.

Probably one of the most affected groups of producers will be subsistence farmers in the lowlands,
especially in southern and south-eastern Romania.

Key vulnerabilities are:

   reduced agricultural productivity;
   water supply for rural consumers;
   other social (e.g. human health) and economic hazards for rural communities and households,
    and;
   environment and the ‘health’ of natural ecosystems.

Although there has been a significant reduction in GHG emissions from agriculture in Romania in
recent years, there remains the very real possibility that GHG emissions will increase again as the
agricultural economy improves – especially if livestock numbers increase and / or crop production
becomes significantly more intensive again.

Mitigation measures therefore need to be put in place in the ARD sector that limit / cap GHG
emissions. The big question remains whether the necessary mitigation can be balanced with the
inevitable longer-term demands upon agriculture for increased food production. An appropriate mix
of actions is therefore needed to manage, offset and avoid emissions across the whole ARD sector.

Adaptation is clearly also a high priority – progressive climate change is occurring and significant
impacts upon the ARD sector are developing. The ARD sector needs to start responding more rapidly
to prepare for future impacts and there is a need to build both the resilience and adaptive capacity of
the two ARD sub-sectors (the large commercial farms and the communities of small-scale subsistence
farms).

Existing National Strategies, Policies and Initiatives of Relevance to the ARD Sector

The National Climate Change Strategy for Romania 2013-2020 (recently approved by Government
Decision no. 529/2013 in July 2013) provides clear guidance on appropriate climate action in the
ARD sector and identifies the EU budget (Multi-annual Financial Framework) for 2014-2020 as
playing an important role in “catalysing the specific investments that will be needed to meet climate
targets and to ensure climate resilience”.

The Strategy contains two main components on mitigation and adaptation - agriculture is identified as
a priority sector in both components.

There are also various other existing strategies of specific relevance to climate action in the ARD
sector, including the draft National Strategy on Drought Effects Mitigation and on the Prevention and
Combating the Land Degradation and the Desertification (elaborated in 2008, but not yet approved).

                                                                                                          5
In June 2006, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development drafted a National Strategic Plan
(NSP) for Rural Development in preparation for EU accession in 2007 and the launch of the National
Rural Development Programme (NRDP) for Romania 2007-2013 that was co-financed by the
European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).

The fight against climate change was mentioned in the NSP as an important priority for Romania and
the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions was set as a key priority for the NRDP 2007-2013. A total
of 8 measures were programmed in the NRDP 2007-2013 that are targeted at, or directly relevant to,
climate change mitigation and adaptation, as well as the transition to a low carbon economy.

The total financial allocation to these 8 measures was 6 399.1 million EUR, of which 46.2% (2 958.9
million EUR) had been committed to beneficiaries (i.e. absorbed) by the end of 2012. Whilst this
only gives a very general indication of the success to-date of targeting NRDP measures / funding at
climate action, good experience has been generated with the implementation of individual measures
that should be built upon and developed when programming the forthcoming NRDP 2014-2020.

Priorities for Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation in the ARD Sector

The table below presents a set of interventions selected through the analysis for mitigation and
adaptation in the ARD sector. All of the interventions have the potential to be initiated (to some
extent) in the forthcoming programming period of 2014-2020 and are clustered in terms of: a) Short-
Term Priority – immediate potential to support under the NRDP 2014-2020, and; b) Medium-Term
Priority – accompanying action to NRDP 2014-2020 with longer-term horizon.

                   includes improvements in the efficiency of energy use and the
                   better management of carbon and nitrogen flows in the

                   livestock manure, and; investment in the small- and large-scale
                   technologies available for solar and wind power generation.
Priority Actions   Investment in irrigation infrastructure in the most vulnerable        Investments
for Adaptation     regions. Priority action is needed at the national level to
                   improve / rehabilitate the economically viable irrigation
                   infrastructure in south, south-east and east of Romania where
                   the occurrence of drought is predicted to be most frequent and
                   to reach the highest intensity values. The comprehensive
                   conditions attached to EAFRD-financed investments in
                   irrigation (Article 46 of EC Regulation No. 1305/2013) aim to
                   avoid maladaptation to climate change, for example by
                   expanding irrigation in catchments already suffering from water
                   stress and where climate change projections indicate reduced
                   precipitation.

                   investing in their farms in the face of the uncertainty associated
                   with extreme weather events. Specific tools for consideration
                   include: i) insurance schemes against natural disasters and
                   against pest and disease of livestock and crops, and ii) the
                   setting-up of farmers' mutual funds for stabilizing incomes in
                   case of price volatility or losses from natural disasters or
                   livestock/crop diseases.

                   complementary objectives: i) to encourage farmers and rural          Investments /
                   communities to adopt technologies and practices which build          Incentives
                   their resilience / adaptive capacity to deal with the
                   uncertainties of climate change, and; ii) to promote and foster
                   innovation co-operation and other bottom-up initiatives
                   amongst local communities, including farmers and other
                   businesses, which build their resilience / adaptive capacity to
                   deal with the uncertainties of climate change

                                                                                                             7
These actions present a major challenge to the ARD sector in terms of science, policy and practice – a
challenge that is complicated by the variability in socio-economic context of rural areas and the highly
polarised structure of agriculture. For example, very different approaches are required to address
contrasting vulnerabilities in the sector such as large-scale crop production in the lowland areas of
south and south-east Romania, compared to small farmers in geographically remote and economically
disadvantaged communities in the mountains where access to relevant information and advice is
currently very limited.

Opportunities for Mainstreaming Climate Actions in the NRDP 2014-2020

There is a comprehensive suite of mitigation and adaptation measures eligible for EAFRD co-
financing under the National Rural Development Program (NRDP) for Romania 2014-2020. In broad
terms the menu of actions supported by the EAFRD Regulation (EC Regulation No. 1305/2013)
include "knowledge transfer and innovation" under Priority 1; "investments" in farm modernisation
and competitiveness under Priorities 2 and 3, and; the encouragement of sustainable land management
via "area-based compensatory payments" under Priorities 4 and 5. Of course the measures selected for
inclusion in the NRDP 2014-2020 will not be able to address all climate-related challenges faced by
farmers and other rural stakeholders. Prioritization and careful targeting of the NRDP measures will
therefore be needed.

The main entry point for climate actions in the NRDP 2014-2020 is under priority 5 of the new EC
rural development proposals, namely: “promoting resource efficiency and supporting the shift
towards a low carbon and climate resilient economy in the agriculture, food and forestry sectors”.
But since climate change mitigation and adaptation are also cross-cutting objectives for the EAFRD,
climate actions should also be introduced under other priorities.

A basic intervention logic for the mainstreaming of climate actions in the NRDP 2014-2020 is
included in the report. Some examples of climate-related measures that can be financed in the NRDP
2014-2020 are listed below – note that the Article numbers are taken directly from EC Regulation No.

It must be kept in mind that the ARD sector in Romania is a complex sector and the successful
mainstreaming of climate action into the NRDP 2014-2020 will require the careful tailoring of
measures. A “one-size fits all” approach to mainstreaming climate action in the NRDP 2014-2020
will not be appropriate – a flexible and localised approach should be encouraged as much as possible
and the potential of bottom-up, community-based initiatives should not be under-estimated (for
example, utilising the LEADER-approach).

Broad-based Actions in the Face of Uncertainty

Significant uncertainty exists in the ARD sector regarding a) the direction and magnitude of climate
change; b) its impacts upon agriculture and the wider rural community, and; c) the effectiveness and
economics of different actions and strategies for mitigation and adaptation. This uncertainty is
inevitably reflected in this rapid sectoral analysis and some very broad-based actions have been
recommended that reflect a generic understanding of the most appropriate actions for supporting
farmers, including small-holder farmers, to maintain viable and productive systems in the face of
climate change.

But uncertainty does not mean that action should be postponed and the immediate opportunity
to embed climate action in the programming of the NRDP 2014-2020 must be fully and
effectively acted upon for the short- to medium-term benefit of the ARD sector.

But in parallel further work does need to be done sharpen the generic recommendations in this rapid
sectoral analysis. In particular:

1. A robust evidence base needs to be built-up that ensures all future policy decisions relating to
   mitigation and adaptation in the ARD sector are cost effective. For example, impact studies are
   needed that integrate climate, land use and macroeconomic policies, whilst financial and
   socioeconomic analyses are needed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of deploying the various
   technologies. This will require the Romanian government and research institutions to work more
   closely together to develop evidence and inform policy.
2. A more strategic approach is needed that reconciles and integrates the climate challenges faced
   by the ARD sector with the need to also significantly reform the sector towards “a more e xport-
   driven, high-value and climate-resilient agriculture, with rural living conditions more closely
   aligned to urban”;
3. A macro-economic model for the impacts of climate change upon the ARD sector would be
   useful, but there is an inevitable trade-off that needs to be resolved between a single complex
   model that allows exploration of multiple policy questions and a suite of simple models that seek
   to answer the same questions individually.

1. Introduction
Romania joined the European Union (EU) in 2007 and, after Poland, is the 2nd largest of the “new”
EU Member States with a total area of 238,839 km2 and an estimated population of 21.4 million
inhabitants2.

Climate change is a huge challenge for the agriculture and rural development (ARD) sector in
all 28 Member States of the European Union (EU) - including Romania.

On the one hand, agriculture is a source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and must therefore be
expected to contribute towards the climate change mitigation goals of the Europe 2020 Strategy –
namely to achieve:

i) a reduction in GHG emissions of at least 20% below 1990 goals;
ii) at least 20% of energy consumption to come from renewable energy sources, and;
iii) at least 20% increase in energy efficiency.

On the other hand, the ARD sector is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change since the
capacity of the “rural space” to provide adequate food supply; deliver ecosystem services; support
economic growth, and; provide a safe living environment for rural communities is directly dependent
upon favourable climatic conditions.

European farmers, foresters, rural businesses and other local people therefore need to start paying
much greater attention to climate change and the growing uncertainty that it will bring to their day-to-
day lives and longer term strategies for production, management, investment and community
development.

The EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has an important role to play in supporting
appropriate climate action in the ARD sector. This role will be strengthened significantly in the
2014-2020 programme period as follows:

1. With the reform of Pillar I of the CAP, 30% of direct payments to farmers in all Member States,
   including Romania will be linked to a “greening payment”. In order to receive this payment
   farmers will have to follow requirements for a) crop diversification on arable land; b) the
   maintenance of permanent grassland, and; c) the maintenance of “Ecological Focus Areas” (5% of
   cultivated land must be planted with hedges, trees, buffer strips etc.) – all of which are relevant to
   climate action;

2. In the new rural development policy (Pillar II of the CAP), two out of the six rural development
   priorities in the proposed EAFRD regulation refer specifically to climate change mitigation and
   adaptation. Climate action is also an important cross-cutting objective that should touch upon all
   rural development measures that are implemented

3. Furthermore, Member States are recommended to spend a minimum of 30% of the total EAFRD
   funding for rural development programmes on environmental actions, including climate change
   mitigation and adaptation.

    Estimated from the January 2012 population census
                                                                                                            10
The integration of such climate actions into the CAP aims to bring benefits for the economy and
society as a whole by ensuring that:

     the productive capacity and viability of the ARD sector is maintained;
     agricultural systems are developed with greater resilience to environmental, climatic and
      economic risks, and;
     essential biodiversity and ecosystem services dependent on land management continue to thrive.

This report is one of six rapid sectoral analyses3 undertaken within the framework of Component B of
the World Bank’s Romania Climate Change Reimbursable Advisory Service (RAS) Programme. The
title of Component B is “Identify and integrate climate actions into the 2014 -2020 sector Operational
Programmes”.

The specific objective of this report is to contribute to the successful mainstreaming of climate
action into Romania’s post-2013 rural development policy – namely the EAFRD co-financed
National Rural Development Programme (NRDP) for Romania 2014-2020.

The report is addressed first and foremost towards those policy-makers in the Romanian government
that are directly or indirectly involved in the programming of the National Rural Development
Programme (NRDP) for Romania 2014-2020. As such this report builds upon a number of working
documents produced by the European Commission on the theme of mainstreaming climate change in
2014-2020 rural development policy (EC, 2013a; EC, 2013b; EC, 2013c).

The report contains 6 main sections:

     An introduction to the characteristics of the agricultural and rural development (ARD) sector in
      Romania. Note that the Forestry sector is covered in another sector report;
     An overview of the vulnerabilities and risks from climate change in the ARD sector in Romania,
      beginning with an introduction to the changes in baseline climate that are currently observed and
      predicted;
     A brief review of existing national strategies, policies and initiatives of relevance to the ARD
      sector in Romania, including a description of the EAFRD measures related to climate action that
      were included in the NRDP for Romania 2007-2013;
     The identification and description of priorities for climate change mitigation and adaptation in the
      ARD sector in Romania;
     An introduction to the opportunities for mainstreaming climate actions in the forthcoming NRDP
      for Romania for 2014-2020, including a basic intervention logic (the foundation of all strategic
      programming for the EAFRD) and some examples of specific climate actions that can be
      supported by the EAFRD;
     A closing section highlighting the uncertainties regarding the findings of this rapid sectoral
      analysis and the need for further work.

2. Characteristics of the Agricultural and Rural Development (ARD)
   Sector
2.1 Rural Economy and Quality of Life

Romania is a predominantly rural country with agriculture playing an important role in the
rural economy, including the generation of employment.

According to the modified OECD definition of “rural” areas that is used by the EC 4 to allow
comparison between EU Member States, 59.8% of the total national territory and 45.7% of the
population in Romania is classified as predominantly rural (EC, 2012). Population density in these
predominantly rural areas is 71.6 inhabitants / km2, which is significantly higher than the EU-27
average of 48.3 inhabitants / km2. At the same time it is estimated (2011) that the population of
predominantly rural areas in Romania is declining by an average of 4.5% / year with population
declines in individual counties varying from 1.0 - 11.6% / year (EC, 2013d).

The relatively high share of the population living in rural areas reflects the large number (compared to
the EU countries) of less densely populated, smaller-scale settlements that exist in Romania, rather
than large-scale urban concentrations. Many of these small rural communities contribute
relatively little to economic growth, but play a vital role in preserving the social fabric / cultural
identity of the rural areas, as well as the delivery of a range of ecosystem services that are of
great national and international significance.

A relatively high proportion of national Gross Added Value5 (32.4%) and employment (41.5%) is also
generated in predominantly rural areas in Romania, compared to averages of 17.2% and 21.7%
respectively for all predominantly rural areas in the EU-27 (EC, 2012). However, rural incomes are
relatively low and the gap with urban areas is widening. GDP per rural capita is significantly lower
than found in most other Member States and approximately 50% of the average for the EU-27 - it is
also only 30-40% of that generated in the urban areas (EC, 2012). More than 70% of the Romanian
poor live in rural areas and the rural relative poverty6 rate is 42%, compared to 18% in urban areas.

Agriculture and forestry are significantly more important sources of employment in Romania than in
any other Member States with 32.6% of the population employed in agriculture and forestry compared
to an average of only 5.3% in the EU-27 (EC, 2012). However, the productivity of this labour force is
very low (2,464 Euro / employee in 2012) – around 20% of the national average and 26% of the EU
average (EC, 2012).

An estimated 37.1% of farmers in predominantly rural areas have “other gainful activities” (EC,
2012), in other words, sources of income in addition to work on the farm. There are numerous
sources of potential alternative employment including construction, forestry, tourism-related activities
etc.

The Institute of Agricultural Economics proposed a typology (Rusu, 2006) that takes account of the
increasing disparities in the economic development of rural areas observed during the last 15+ years.
The typology uses 10 indicators relating to agriculture, forestry, tourism, industry and labor force, and
identifies that 3 types of rural area exist in Romania:
4
  In 2010, the European Commission agreed on a new typology of predominantly rural, intermediate and
predominantly urban regions based on a variation of the previously used OECD methodology.
5
  Gross Value Added (GVA) is a baseline context indicator for the structure of the economy that is calculated by
Eurostat for all EU Member States - it is defined as the value of output (at basic prices) less the value of
intermediate consumption (at purchasers prices).
6
  Defined as households with incomes that are less than 60% of the national median disposable income.
                                                                                                                   12
1. Rural areas with mainly agricultural resources and poor or medium economic situation –
   located mainly in the lowland plain areas (25% of rural area and 26% of rural population);

2. Rural areas with resources for a medium diversified economy and medium economic
   situation – no specific location (40% of rural area and 43% of rural population);

3. Rural areas with resources for a diversified economy and medium economic situation –
   located in the Carpathians Mountains and Black Sea coast (35% of rural area and 31% of rural
   population).

There is substantial potential for economic growth in the rural areas of Romania, but this
potential is not equally distributed since there are big differences between the economic ‘base’
of different rural territories in Romania.

Rural areas in Romania are characterised by very low quality infrastructure. For example according
to data from the National Institute of Statistics (NIS) only 13.6% of rural communities were
connected to a drinking water supply in 2012 and the majority of rural households continue to use
water pulled / pumped from shallow wells, whilst only 10.6% of rural roads are considered of
“adequate standard” with asphalt cover and only few potholes. Around 29% of rural roads are gravel
/ dirt roads.

The basic social infrastructure (health and education systems, finance and credit provision etc.) is also
much less developed than in urban areas. For example, only 7.4% of the total number of
kindergartens registered at national level in the 2012-2013 school year are located in rural areas,
whilst the number of rural inhabitants per doctor is estimated to be 1,722 - almost 7 times more than
in urban areas (MARD, 2013).

All of these factors affect the quality of life in rural areas, hamper economic development,
increase out-migration and exacerbate health and environmental problems.

2.2 Agriculture

According to the 2010 Agricultural Census (EUROSTAT, 2010), the total area of agricultural land in
Romania is 15.9 million hectares 7 , of which around 13.3 million ha (approximately 56% of total
territory) is currently being used – so-called Utilised Agricultural Area (UAA).

Out of the total UAA:            8.3 million ha (62.4%) is arable land
                                 4.5 million ha (33.9%) is permanent grassland and meadow
                                 0.3 million ha (2.3%) is permanent crops, and
                                 0.2 million ha (1.4%) is kitchen gardens.

Cereal grains, particularly maize and wheat, are the most important crops occupying around 60% of
all arable land, followed by potatoes, sugar beet and industrial crops. Romania is noted for its
vegetable production, with tomatoes, onions, cabbages and peppers among the crops grown. Orchards
and vineyards are also important.

During the 1960s and 1980s the previous socialist regime constructed irrigation facilities in the semi-
arid south and south-east of the country covering around 3.2 million ha of arable land, much of it
operated with subsidised electricity and little consideration of real costs. With the collapse of the

7
 National sources suggest that 14.7 million hectares is a more reasonable estimate of the total area of
agricultural land
                                                                                                            13
former regime, the economics of irrigation changed completely, the irrigated area declined
significantly and much of the irrigation infrastructure fell into disrepair. Very little investment has
been made in the rehabilitation / modernisation of irrigation systems for the last 20+ years and none
governed by a comprehensive strategy responding to real demand.

Around 1.5 million ha (9.4% of total UAA) is now estimated to be covered by economically viable /
marginally viable irrigation systems, although only about 800,000 ha is currently functional. Since
most irrigation in Romania is “supplementary” the actual area irrigated varies greatly from year to
year depending upon annual rainfall (and until 2010 also the availability of governmental subsidy).
From 2000-2011 the greatest area irrigated was 569,000 ha in 2003 and the smallest area irrigated was
46,000 ha in 2005 (World Bank, 2012). The public infrastructure serving about 100,000 ha, plus the
infrastructure owned by water users’ organizations (WUOs) and covering over 300,000 ha , was
rehabilitated in 2008-2012.

Key obstacles to using the existing irrigation infrastructure are: i) its low hydraulic efficiency; ii) the
high cost of electricity consumed for pumping, and; iii) high water tariffs. Irrigation in Romania is
mainly used by larger-scale commercial producers who can afford to pay for the water, however
there is currently little evidence of farmers’ demand – or willingness to pay – for more
irrigation.

Livestock production in Romania declined rapidly following the collapse of the socialist regime and
has continued (except for poultry) to follow a downward trend ever since, thereby placing Romania
significantly below the average performance in EU-27 (see 2005-2012 data in Table 1 below).

The overall pattern of land use and agricultural production in Romania is not significantly different
from that observed across the EU-27. However, the main characteristic of Romanian agriculture
which sets it apart from other Member States is a) its highly polarised structure, and b) the huge
number of small-scale farms.

According to MARD (2012), out of a total of 3.86 million holdings - less than 0.4% are large scale
commercial units (average size of 421 ha accounting for 48.9% of UAA), whilst the remaining 99.6%
are small-scale holdings of average size of 1.77 ha and accounting for 51.1% of UAA.

  The production of sheep-goat meat decreased between 2005 and 2012 by 45 times, which indicate a reduction
of 4,500%. The same stands for the consumption of sheep-goat meat.
                                                                                                              14
The ARD sector is therefore actually comprised of two distinct sub-sectors. One sub-sector consists
of large-scale, capital intensive and technologically advanced farms. Whilst in contrast, the other sub-
sector consists of small-scale farms which practice more traditional farming methods – often on a
part-time basis.

In the current National Rural Development Programme (NRDP) for Romania 2007-2013 (MARD,
2007), these small-scale holdings are further broken down as follows:

1. Semi-subsistence farms are defined as being between 2 and 8 ESU 9 . These comprise
   approximately 359,000 holdings covering 20.5% of UAA. Average size for the farms between 2
   and 4 ESU is 4.9 ha, and 9.4 ha for farms between 4 and 8 ESU. Semi-subsistence farms were
   targeted for support by the current NRDP 2007-2013 in order to encourage their greater market
   integration and development into larger-scale “family farms”.

2. Subsistence farms are defined as smaller than 2 ESU, comprising an estimated 3.8 million
   holdings and estimated to cover 45% of the UAA. Most of these units lack legal personality
   (although there are some exceptions) and lie in the farm size range of 0-5 ha farm with an average
   size of 1.63 ha. Subsistence farms were not eligible for many forms of support under the current
   NRDP 2007-2013.

Subsistence farming is recognized by the Romanian System of National Accounts (SNA) as
"household production for its own final consumption" and forms a distinct sector of the so-called
Non-Observed / Non-Registered economy. About 80% of individual holdings are estimated to use
more than 50% of their output for self-consumption (MLFEO, 2007).

The specific situation of subsistence farmers in Romania is an extreme example in Europe. There is
currently no other EU Member State where such a huge number of very small-scale farms have
persisted to such an extent. On the one hand, the fragmentation of land ownership and low levels of
capital investment by small-holders has undoubtedly in some regions (notably the highly productive
lowland areas) been blocking agricultural development and the exploitation of Romania’s
considerable competitive advantage by impeding the structural adjustment and modernization of crop
and animal production.

On the other hand, small-holdings across the whole territory of Romania continue to provide a very
important socio-economic buffer in times of economic uncertainty by providing a basic livelihood for
a significant proportion of the rural population, as well as a supplementary source of cheap,
wholesome food for their networks of family members in the urban areas.

Furthermore these same small-holders also have a fundamentally important role to play in maintaining
the vitality of rural communities and providing important social, cultural and environmental services
(public goods) to wider society. Since many small-scale farms are located in the mountain and sub-
mountainous areas, they are also essential for the maintenance of traditional farming practices
(pastoralism) on the wealth of ‘high nature value’ (HNV) grasslands that are characteristic of
Romania. Without the maintenance of these HNV pastures and meadows many internationally-
important wildlife habitats and species would be lost (Oppermann et al., 2012).

In the short-term context of 2014-2020 it is reasonable to assume that this small-scale farm sector will
continue to persist, but in the longer-term there is a clear governmental commitment to structural
reform of the highly polarised agricultural sector and a decline in the number of small farms is likely.

  The economic size of farms in the EU is defined as Economic Size Units (ESU), where 1 ESU is equivalent to
an annual turnover of approximately 1 200 EUR
                                                                                                               15
2.3 Environment and Natural Resources

Romania’s water resources are equivalent to 2,000 m3 / inhabitant / year 10 and are far below the
European average of 4,500 m3 / inhabitant / year – thereby highlighting the need for good
management to ensure resource management and sustainability. The total theoretical annual surface
water resources amount to 140 billion m3 - of which about 50 billion m3 are derived from internal
rivers and 90 billion m3 from the Danube. Of this only about 40 billion m3 can be fully utilized with
the current status of water infrastructure development.

The groundwater resources are estimated to be about 12 billion m3 annually, almost equally divided
between phreatic and deep aquifers. Romania has 1,200 reservoirs with a total water storage capacity
of 11 billion m3. However, many of these reservoirs are small and only around 400 have a storage
capacity of over 1 million m3. Of these only 240 are large reservoirs with capacity of hundreds of
millions of cubic metres.

Water availability in Romania is characterized by high variability in space and time. Most river flow
stems from the mountain areas. Catchment discharges per unit area are much higher in the mountains
(40 litres / second / km2) compared to the lowlands where discharge flows drop to under 1 litre /
second / km2. The flow rate also varies significantly throughout the year from the (sometimes severe)
floods in spring and early summer to very low values during summer and early autumn. During
heavy rainfall on small catchment areas, the runoff can create high flow rates reaching 1000 - 2000
times the minimum flow, thereby resulting in highly localised and devastating flash floods.

The economic and social changes in Romania have led to a substantial change in the demand for
water from the main users: population, agriculture and industry (see Table 2).

Table 2: Demand for water (billion m3) in Romania as actual abstraction (1990-2012, selected
years)

Between 1990 and 2012 the annual demand for water decreased from 17.5 billion m3 to 6.5 billion m3
- equivalent to 37% of the 1990 demand. The water used for agriculture (irrigation) was the most
affected (falling to 16% of the demand in 1990), while the demand for population and industry
decreased in 2012 to about 50% of the demand of 1990.

It is clear from these figures that a large amount of water available annually in Romania is not
utilized, either because much of it flows during flood periods or there is insufficient storage capacity
to allow for an efficient multi-annual management of water stock.

However, while the overall situation appears good because of over-capacity there are areas of water
scarcity in many basins where summer droughts are a significant concern. In particular it can be seen
from Figure 1 that the basins of Jiu, Arges-Vedea, Buzau-Ialomita, Siret, Prut-Barlad, and Dobrogea-

situation will become more serious as the impacts of climate change become more pronounced

Regarding water quality, although the use of manufactured fertilisers is relatively low in Romania
(and well below EU-15 and EU-27 averages), the pollution of groundwater with nitrates is a serious
problem in Romania, especially in the south of the country where there are regions with groundwater
in excess of 40 mg nitrate per litre (EC, 2010).

This problem is largely associated with the poor management of livestock manure, notably pigs and
cattle. The majority of these livestock are kept by individual farm households with very poor
facilities for the collection, storage and spreading of manure management. In addition to causing
water pollution, this manure is also a source of CH4 and N2O emissions.

Romania has a diverse natural environment with various rivers, mountains and lakes contributing to a
high level of biodiversity. In particular, the Carpathian Mountains and one of the most important
wetlands in Europe, the Danube Delta, provide a unique natural heritage.

One of the most striking features of the ARD sector in Romania is the importance of traditional
agriculture and traditional agricultural practices for creating and maintaining the biodiversity of
species-rich semi-natural grasslands – notably in the more marginal, mountainous areas where
agricultural productivity is limited by high altitude, poor soils and steep slopes. Studies of the
meadows associated with just one village in southern Transylvania identified 11 different semi-natural
plant communities, including 4 types of plant association that are listed as being of European
Community interest under the EU Habitats Directive with 12 plant species classified as “vulnerable”
or “rare” on the Romanian Red List of Vascular Plants (Huband, 2008; Sârbu et al., 2004).

This so-called “high nature value” (HNV) farming is characterised by low intensity land use; presence
and/or utilization of semi-natural vegetation, and; diversity of land cover and land use. A total of 2.4
million hectares of semi-natural grasslands were categorised as ‘high nature value’ (HNV) grasslands
in the 2007-2013 National Rural Development Programme (NRDP) and over 70% of this total area
was entered into agri-environment commitments relating to the maintenance of traditional farming
practices.

3. Vulnerabilities and Risks from Climate Change in the ARD Sector
3.1 Changes in the Baseline Climate

Romania has a transitional temperate continental climate with four distinct seasons. Routine climatic
variation occurs due to influences from:

a) Neighbouring climatic zones – notably oceanic influences from the West, Mediterranean
   influences from the South-west and less temperate influences from the north and north-east. For
   example, during the winter the country is frequently affected by Arctic anticyclones which bring
   specific features of the sub-polar Scandinavian climate;
b) Geographical elements such as the position of the main mountain ranges, latitude, elevation etc.
   For example, the average annual temperature currently varies from 8°C in the north to 11°C in the
   south, and from 2.6°C in the mountains to 11.7°C in the lowland plains.

In addition to these existing sources of climatic variation, the influence of climate change is also now
becoming more and more apparent as the temperate continental climate progressively becomes
warmer, drier, more variable and prone to extreme events (MECC, 2010).

Temperature

The average ‘whole-country’ annual air temperature for Romania rose by 0.5°C during the period
1901 – 2010.

But this long-term trend does not tell the full story:

1. Firstly, there are differences in the change in mean annual air temperature for different regions.
   Warming is more pronounced (up to 0.8°C) in the south and east of the country, whilst less
   warming (even slight cooling) is evident in the mountainous and sub-mountainous regions of the
   Carpathians.



                                                                                                                                                                                           18
2. Secondly, the rate of warming appears to be increasing in recent years (see Figure 3). For
   example, data collected in 94 weather stations between 1961 and 2010 shows an increase of the
   average temperature in summer, winter and spring of around 2°C (in the eastern side of Romania
   the temperature increase exceeds 2 °C during winter). At the same time there is a slight trend
   towards a decreased average temperature in autumn.

According to assessments presented by Working Group I of the Fourth IPCC Report (IPCC, 2007),
Romania should expect a continued steady increase in annual average temperature similar to that
projected for the whole of Europe. There is some variation in the projections of the different models
used, but compared to the period 1980-1990 further rises in annual average temperature should be
expected of between:

       0.5°C – 1.5°C by 2029, and;
       2.0°C – 5.0°C by 2099 (depending upon global scenario).

Similar projections have been generated at national level by the National Administration for
Meteorology (MECC, 2010). These projections also predict that areas outside of the Carpathians are
likely to experience the greatest temperature increases in winter, while the south and south-east of the
country will experience the greatest temperature increases in summer. Projections also show an
increased frequency, duration and intensity of ‘heat waves’.

Precipitation

Long-term data for 1901-2010 shows that the total amount of annual precipitation (mm) in Romania
has been decreasing since 1960, especially in the south and south-east of the country.




                                                                                                           19
Figure 4: Annual precipitation (mm) in Romania (1901 – 2010)

But this long-term trend again masks considerable variability, as well as some more subtle localised
trends. For example, data collected from 104 weather stations between 1961 and 2007 shows that the
pattern of precipitation during the year is also changing in some regions, including:

   an increase in the length of the periods of time without precipitation in the south during winter
    and in the west during summer;
   an increase of the number of “very rainy” days with more than 10 mm/day of precipitation in the
    north of the country, especially in autumn, and;
   significant decreases in the thickness of snow layers (accumulated winter precipitation) in the
    north-east, centre and west of the country.

According to projections in the Fourth IPCC Report (IPCC, 2007), Romania should expect a
continued reduction in mean annual precipitation of 10-20% by the end of the century, but this is
likely to vary greatly between i) the north and south of the country, and ii) the mountains and lowland
areas.

The pattern of precipitation is also expected to continue to change with a greater frequency of
shorter, more intense and localised rainfall events. Rainfall patterns may also become more
chaotic and difficult to predict.

In conclusion - Romania’s temperate climate is changing and is predicted to be very different in the
next 50-100 years. This is hugely significant to the ARD sector, although it is also obvious that the
effects of the changing climate upon temperature, precipitation and the occurrence / frequency of
extreme events will continue to vary from region to region.

3.2 Impact of Climate Change on the ARD Sector

The impacts of climate change may be positive or negative, but those currently encountered by the
ARD sector in Romania are predominantly negative. These include:

   Increased incidence of flooding
   Increased intensity and frequency of drought

                                                                                                          20
   Increased risk of soil erosion and desertification
   Reduced agricultural productivity
   Other social and economic costs

According to McCallum et al. (2013), Romania suffered average annual “weather related losses” of
8,452 million US dollars from 1980 to 2011 – equivalent to 0.26% of GDP - of which 34% was linked
specifically to drought. The modelling of future climate trends suggests that such negative impacts
will continue to become more severe. Annex 1 contains a summary of relevant national and
international projects which are currently underway or have been completed, and which provide
further detailed information on climate change impacts and vulnerabilities.

Increased Incidence of Flooding

Flooding is an increasing problem for the ARD sector in Romania with an estimated 1.3 million
hectares at risk potentially affecting approximately 500,000 inhabitants.

Flooding occurs frequently due to melting snow, blockage of rivers by ice and heavy torrential rains,
but during the last 20 years the occurrence of severe floods has increased due to a number of
additional factors. These include the over-exploitation of forests and modification of local hydrology;
the lack of well-maintained flood prevention infrastructure (thereby increasing the incidence and
intensity of flooding), and; the effects of climate change.

The main areas affected by flooding have been located along the Danube, plus on the Romanian Plain
(Siret, Arges, Olt and Jiu Rivers) and the Banat-Crisana Plain (Somes Cris and Mures rivers). In
mountainous and hilly areas where river beds are steeply sloping (100-200 m/km) and in narrow
floodplains, powerful floods may be accompanied by intensive erosion of river banks resulting in
landslides that block valleys.

During the last 10 years, Romania has been hit by severe floods virtually every year. The floods, both
large scale and flash-floods, have led to human, economic and social losses, including disruption of
local infrastructure and services for weeks or even months. From 2005-2010, a total of 142 people
were killed by floods, 27,000 houses and thousands of km of national roads were damaged and
hundreds of thousands of hectares of land were inundated. The total cost of these damages has been
estimated at around €6 billion. The major floods of 2005 and 2006 had a particular impact in terms of
population affected, loss of life and destruction to infrastructure and private property.

In late April 2005, about 100,000 ha were flooded in Timis county and the agricultural production
could not resume that year because the water was standing for many weeks. In the same year, the
Siret River flooded about 40,000 ha and completely destroyed a village. In 2006, the Danube River
flooded about 30,000 ha, destroyed two villages and threatened low areas in Braila and Galati.

Recent years have also highlighted that Romania is particularly vulnerable to flooding (particularly
flash floods) because of the extensive forest cuts in the hilly areas and high intensity of rainstorms.
Well-managed forests are particularly important for reducing the risk of local flooding by attenuating
surface run-off and peak flows following intensive rainfall events.

Increased Intensity and Frequency of Drought

In the ARD sector, one of the most negative impacts observed to-date is the increasing incidence of
water deficit and drought due to the combined effect of reduced precipitation and rising temperatures,
especially in the south and south-east of the country (Mateescu et al., 2013).
                                                                                                          21
Drought is characterized by the absence of rainfall in at least 14 consecutive days during the cold
season (October-March) and at least 10 consecutive days during the warm season (April-September).
If precipitation occurred during these periods, but did not exceed a certain threshold, then drought
identification can be subject to different interpretations. The most harmful are spring droughts caused
by limited snowfall during winter and thus low water reserves in the soil. Once a spring drought
occurs, even abundant rains in later months cannot mitigate its negative consequences.

The occurrence of moisture stress during flowering, pollination, and grain-filling is harmful to most
crops and particularly maize, soybeans, and wheat. Increased evaporation from the soil and
accelerated transpiration in the plants themselves due to elevated temperatures will also cause /
accentuate moisture stress. Although droughts may last from a few days to several months, they
affect the outcomes of the entire agricultural production year.

Since 1901 until now, Romania has seen in every decade one to four extremely droughty/rainy years
with an increasing number of droughts being more and more apparent after 1981 (see Table 3).

Since 2000 there have been 6 growing seasons (2000-2001, 2001-2002, 2002-2003, 2006-2007, 2008-
2009 and 2011-2012) with a large rainfall deficit in which drought diminished crop yields
significantly. 2007 was the driest year and associated with the lowest yields of cereals and other
annual crops, while 2010-2011 was most favourable with average yields between 1.5 and 3 times
higher compared to 2007.

More recently, November 2011 was the droughtiest month in the last 52 years in Romania, with a
monthly mean rainfall of only 1.2 mm as against the multi-annual mean of 43.9 mm. July 2012 was
also the warmest month in the last 52 years in Romania, the monthly mean temperature being 23.7 °C
as against the multi-annual mean of 19.2 °C – a positive deviation of 4.5 °C. (Mateescu et al., 2013).

Increased Risk of Soil Erosion and Desertification

The increased incidence of heavy rain storms, with high intensity and short duration, will generate
increased short-term surface runoff and the risk of increased soil erosion by water on sloping land -
particularly in those areas with the most vulnerable soil types.
                                                                                                          22
On the other hand, with an increasing trend towards more frequent and intense drought there is likely
to be increasing soil aridity, which combined with hot winds, will increase the risk of wind erosion
and soil degradation particularly in south, south-east and east of Romania. This includes the risk of
desertification, marginalisation and abandonment of agricultural land in the areas where soils are most
light and vulnerable to erosion.

Desertification is a complex phenomenon and the consequence of a set of important processes which
are active in arid and semi-arid environments where water is the main limiting factor for agriculture
and other land uses. Desertification occurs when certain environmental factors trigger irreversible
change in the plant-soil system. Climate change itself does not trigger desertification directly, but it
impacts upon other processes - for example, the increased wind erosion of light arid soils – which do
trigger desertification.

There is particular concern about the risk of desertification in southern and eastern Romania where
recent studies have provoked a serious warning that some 13 counties (Timiş, Mehedinţi, Dolj, Olt,
Teleorman, Giurgiu, Călăraşi, Constanţa, Ialomiţa, Brăila, Tulcea, Galaţi and Vaslui) face the risk of
desertification even during the current decade.

3.3 Key Vulnerabilities and Risks for the ARD Sector

“Vulnerability” to climate change is the degree to which any system is susceptible to, and unable to
cope with, the negative impacts that climate change imposes upon it.

“Resilience” is the opposite of vulnerability and is defined by the IPCC as “…the ability of a social or
ecological system to absorb disturbances while retaining the same basic structure and ways of
functioning, the capacity for self-organisation, and the capacity to adapt to stress and change”.

The extent to which the ARD sector in Romania is either “vulnerable” or “resilient” to the
negative impacts of climate change is not well understood – but needs further investigation and
consideration.

The “risk” of the ARD sector system being significantly affected by the negative impacts of climate
change is linked to criteria such as:

    the likelihood of the negative impacts occurring;
    the timing of the impacts (short- or long-term);
    the magnitude of the impacts;
    the persistence and reversibility of the impacts, and;
    the system’s potential and capacity for adaptation.

But these criteria are also highly variable. As described in 3.1 above, the effects of the changing
climate upon temperature, precipitation and the occurrence / frequency of extreme events vary from
region to region – but this variability is also laid on top of the variability in the resource base,
economic development and social structure of the regions which in turn influences both i) the
resilience of rural actors / communities to climate change, and; ii) also their capacity to adapt11 to the
related risk and uncertainties.



11
   Adaptive capacity is “…the ability of individuals, organisations or entire sectors to design or implement
effective strategies / actions to adjust to information about potential climate change and / or its consequences /
damages”. Adaptive capacity is strongly linked with resilience.
                                                                                                                     23
Furthermore there are substantial differences in resilience and adaptive capacity associated with the
huge polarity in farm size with large-scale commercial farms facing different challenges from climate
change to the very small-scale subsistence farmers.

For example, large-scale farms commonly have very specialised production systems and are highly
vulnerable to the impact of frequent and long periods of drought upon crop yields and farm profits.
But they are well-informed professionals with good technical and financial resources and have a good
capacity and many options to adapt their farming systems, including the diversification of cropping
systems, adoption of new technologies and use of irrigation.

Small-scale subsistence farmers are also socially and economically very vulnerable to adverse climate
events with farming directly engaging around one-third of the working population and supplying
significant proportions of the household diet. In some cases individual farmers and / or local
communities are also highly specialised in the production of specific crops, such as onions or
potatoes, which further increases their vulnerability hugely.

In other cases some intrinsic resilience can be found within communities of small farmers due to their
low inputs and recycling of resources, existing low carbon economies, diversity of production, strong
social relations and (in some regions) alternative sources of off-farm income. The resilience and
adaptive capacity of these more diverse communities has the potential to be further developed if
obstacles such as low educational standards, geographical / social isolation and lack of access to
investment capital can be overcome.

Reduced Agricultural Productivity

Agricultural production is inextricably tied to climate, making the ARD sector one of the most
climate-sensitive of all economic sectors. As already noted, the impact of climate change upon the
ARD sector in Romania is a particularly immediate and important problem because the majority of
the rural population depends either directly or indirectly on agriculture for their livelihoods.

Analysis of the potential impact of climate change upon the ARD sector is a complex task. For
example, according to Olesen et al. (2011) climate change affects crop production in many different
ways – both directly and indirectly:

1. directly though the effects of increasing CO2 concentration on crop productivity;
2. directly through effects of temperature, rainfall, radiation, humidity etc. on crop development and
   growth;
3. indirectly through shifts in suitability of different crops, primarily a northward expansion of
   warm-season crops;
4. directly through damages caused by extreme events such as extreme heat waves, hail and
   flooding;
5. indirectly through changes in crop nutrition and occurrence of weeds, pests and diseases, and;
6. indirectly through degradation of the resource base (e.g. soil erosion).

At a European level, climate change is expected to impact more and more on food supply and
security. According to Iglesias et al. (2007), global warming is expected to generate mixed effects
that are unevenly distributed across the EU. Under a moderate warming scenario, Europe overall is
expected to even benefit from small increases in crop productivity, but there will be regional
variations. Northern Europe and the mountains (most notably the Alpine regions) could initially see
an increase in productivity and an expansion of crops and crop land, but Southern regions will be

                                                                                                         24
negatively impacted by heat stress and water scarcity. Yet, even the former are expected, over time,
to see these initial benefits outweighed by more frequent flooding and soil instability.

Figure 5: Expected climate change implications in EU agriculture

The crops that experience the most severe impacts are typically rain-fed crops grown in the traditional
summer season, such as maize, sunflower, vegetables and fruits. Some crops, however, may benefit
from the direct effects of climate change (as well as elevated CO2 levels) – notably those that will
benefit from a longer, warmer growing seasons such as autumn-sown winter wheat or grasslands
(meadows and pastures). There are also potential benefits for irrigated crops, assuming that sufficient
water is available.

According to the sixth national communication of Romania to the UNFCC (MECC, 2013a), “In the
near future (2011 - 2040), under climate change conditions, stronger and more spatially extended
droughts will likely affect Romanian territory in the growing season, with significant impact on
agriculture activities”. The report continued to identify key vulnerabilities in the adaptability of
agriculture as the ageing of farmers, lack of infrastructure for irrigation, low productivity of small
farmers, fragmentation of land ownership and youth migration from rural areas.

In particular, yields of grain and other crops are predicted to decrease across the southern and south
eastern part of Romania due to increased frequency of drought (JRC, 2012). While losses may be
partially offset by beneficial effects from carbon dioxide, crop production will be further threatened
by increases in competition for water and the prevalence of pest and diseases and land losses through
desertification.

Perennial crops (orchards and vineyards) are also very vulnerable with partial or total loss of crop and
premature ageing of plantations. Reductions in grassland / forage productivity due to drought will
have knock-on effects to livestock productivity / viability.

Not forgetting also the direct impact of increased heat stress / water shortage upon the productivity,
conception rates and health of farm animals. This includes the potential health risks for livestock and
                                                                                                           25
humans, including the resurgence of some transmissible diseases (anthrax, tetanus, rabies and chronic
respiratory disease).

Overall, the potential impacts of climate change in Romania are likely to greatly increase the risk of
crop failure and reduce the financial security of farmers in many areas, especially the south and south-
east of the country.

However, it must be noted that the combined effects of changes in temperature and
precipitation regimes in different climate change scenarios are not yet well understood, thus
additional work is required for impact assessment at regional level . Down-scaling the predictions
of Global Circulation models (GCM) and taking into account the local conditions of the area of
interest will improve the accuracy of crop yield estimations in the new conditions of climate change.

Water Supply for Rural Consumers

Water supply in rural communities will be adversely affected because the warmer and shorter
winters will lead to the decrease of the seasonal snow volume and to the early and fast snow
melting, leading to shortages in summer months. There is already evidence of this occurring in
those mountain areas (e.g. the Rucar-Bran corridor) where there is increased demand for water due to
tourism and serious shortages of water occur at weekends and peak holiday periods due to the influx
of visitors.

Supply will also suffer from a lowering of groundwater table in summer months, due to reductions in
the surface flow regime. Higher summer temperatures will lead to increased evapo-transpiration and
therefore higher water demands in agriculture, during the same period when supplies will suffer a
shortfall. The domestic water demands and supply will experience the same (but less pronounced)
effect.

It is also likely that hotter and drier summers will also cause a deterioration in the quality of water
resources, thereby effectively reducing the supply.

Other Social and Economic Hazards

Climate change brings many other hazards to rural communities other than the direct impacts outlined
above of flooding on rural infrastructure or drought upon agricultural productivity. For example,
there are many direct hazards for human health. The higher frequency and longer duration of heat
waves has a serious impact upon the health of the elderly. There is also the risk of increased disease,
including the reoccurrence of diseases that have been eradicated. The need for good food hygiene to
avoid food poisoning etc. is also increased greatly in hot weather. These are all factors which in turn
place great pressure upon rural health services, which are already very stressed and over-burdened in
normal weather conditions.

There are multiple indirect effects of climate change upon rural communities and households.
For example:

   local ecosystems yield many useful (and economically important) products for rural communities,
    including fruits, mushrooms and herbs for harvesting. The abundance and distribution of these
    will change as the climate becomes warmer and drier;
   forest fires will become a new risk in rural areas and impact negatively upon the local availability
    of wood for fuel and construction;

                                                                                                           26
   around 36% of all electricity in rural areas is produced by small-scale hydro-electric plants which
    may be affected by drought and declining river flows;
   many rural communities are already disadvantaged by the poor quality of rural roads – public
    transport is slow, many modern goods and services are not available and it is difficult to reach
    new markets with local products. These disadvantages will become even worse with the negative
    impacts of heavy rainfall and flooding upon dirt / gravel roads.

Environment

According to McCallum et al. (2013), there is already clear evidence throughout the EU to show that
biodiversity is directly responding to climate change and will continue to do so. Species respond
individualistically, with direct impacts including changes in phenology, species abundance and
distribution, community composition, habitat structure and ecosystem processes.

Climate change is also leading to indirect impacts on biodiversity through changes in the use of land
and other resources, notably water. For example in Romania it is anticipated that the flora and fauna
in the aquatic ecosystems (rivers and lakes) as well as in those dependent on precipitation and river
flows (such as wetlands) will suffer from a quantitative reduction in summer water flows, and from
increased frequency of floods and droughts. Higher summer temperatures leading to water quality
degradation (through decreases in dissolved oxygen, eutrophication and algal blooms) will also
adversely affect the environment. Changes in aquifer levels will also adversely affect the water
balance in wetlands, which are sustained by groundwater in the low flow season.

These indirect impacts may be more damaging than the direct impacts due to their scale, scope and
speed. They will further reduce the resilience of ecosystems to climate change and their capacity to
deliver essential services, such as climate regulation, food, clean air and water, and control of floods
or erosion.

3.4 The Need for Mitigation and Adaptation in the ARD Sector

According to Romania’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1989-2011 (MECC, 2013b), the agriculture
sector accounted for 14% (16 679.72 Gg CO2 equivalent) of the total GHG emissions estimated for
Romania in 2010. This exceeds the regional and EU averages (see Figure 6) which are around 10%.
N2O emissions account for the largest proportion (52%) of Romanian agriculture’s total CO2
equivalent emissions, followed by the CH4 emissions that account for the remaining 48%.

N2O emissions are derived from i) manure management (production and storage), and; ii) agricultural
soils (notably due to denitrification following the application of inorganic fertilisers or manure).
Domestic livestock are the major source of CH4 emissions from agriculture, both from enteric
fermentation and manure management. It is also likely that the continued use of open pit latrines in
many rural households and villages is contributing to CH4 emissions. Some N2O and CH4 emissions
are also derived from the field burning of agricultural residues (this is also a source of NOx and CO
emissions).

On the plus side, agriculture’s GHG emissions were 53% in 2010 lower compared to emissions in
1989 due to:

   the decline in livestock numbers;
   the reduced area of rice cultivatation (another potential source of CH4 emissions);
   the decreased intensity of crop production, notably the reduction in the application of inorganic
    nitrogen fertiliser applied.
                                                                                                           27
However this also highlights the very real possibility that agricultural GHG emissions will increase
again as the agricultural economy improves – especially if livestock numbers increase and / or crop
production becomes more intensive again.

Mitigation measures therefore need to be put in place in the ARD sector. Opportunities for
mitigation in the ARD sector fall into three broad categories, based on the underlying mechanism:

   Directly reducing emissions – improvements in the efficiency of energy use, plus the
    management of carbon and nitrogen flows in the agricultural ecosystem, can help to reduce
    emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O from the ARD sector;
   Offsetting emissions with carbon sequestration measures – agricultural ecosystems hold large
    reserves of carbon and can store more through a range of practices suited to local conditions;
   Avoiding (or displacing) emissions – notably through the production of renewable energy
    sources and the avoidance of agricultural management practices that it is known will contribute to
    significant GHG emissions e.g. the cultivation of old grasslands.

There is also an important need for adaptation in the ARD sector to address the progressive climate
change observed and predicted over the coming decades However, there are several socio-economic
factors which are influence the ability of farmers and other members of the rural community to adapt
– these include:

   Overall socio-economic context (i.e. farmers with limited resources have the lowest capacity to
    adapt);
   Characteristics of the agricultural production system (type of production; size of holding; level of
    intensity; diversity of cropping etc.);
   The availability of other sources of income;
   Access to information, skills and knowledge concerning climate change and adaptation solutions;
   Access to technology and infrastructure.

4. Existing National Strategies, Policies and Initiatives of Relevance to the
   ARD Sector
4.1 National Policy Framework for Climate Action

In order to effectively implement coherent and complementary climate actions in the ARD sector,
Romania needs to have a clear policy framework for both sector specific and territorial actions at
national, regional and local level. Building-up this policy framework is a step-by-step process, but
positive progress is being made with the on-going development of the national climate change
strategy for Romania which provides useful strategic guidance for the ARD sector.

The first National Climate Change Strategy for Romania was drawn up for 2005-2007 and briefly
detailed the importance / effects of climate change adaptation on various sectors including agriculture
and forestry.

In response to the 2007 European Commission Green Paper 12 on Adapting to climate change in
Europe - options for EU action, the Ministry of Environment developed a Guide on the Adaptation to
the Climate Change Effects (MoE, 2007) which provided more detailed recommendations on
measures for reducing the risk of negative effects of climate change in 13 key sectors of the economy,
including agriculture, biodiversity, water resources and forests.

Regarding recommendations for agriculture, the Guide focused upon the selection of appropriate crop
species, varieties and hybrids for changing climatic conditions; the efficient use of water resources,
including better management of irrigation; more optimal use of crop rotations; improved soil
management etc.

The National Climate Change Strategy for Romania 2013-2020 (recently approved by Government
Decision no. 529/2013 in July 2013) is a more comprehensive document (MECC, 2013c) that updates
previous documents and aims to provide an action framework and guidelines for all priority sectors to
develop an individual action plan in line with national strategic principles.

The Strategy contains two main components on mitigation and adaptation13. Agriculture is again
identified as a priority sector in both components.

The adaptation component integrates a lot of new information from extensive consultation with
experts and stakeholders and includes sections on Adapting to Climate Change Effects, Institutional
Cooperation, Taking Action, Resources, and Sector Level Challenges and Actions.

The National Climate Change Strategy for Romania 2013-2020 provides clear guidance on
appropriate climate action in the ARD sector and identifies the EU budget (Multi-annual Financial
Framework) for 2014-2020 as playing an important role in “catalysing the specific investments that
will be needed to meet climate targets and to ensure climate resilience”.

4.2 Project-based Initiatives for Research / Exchange of Experience

There is a growing knowledge base in Romania regarding national / regional specific actions for
climate change mitigation and adaptation in the ARD sector. A comprehensive review of this
knowledge base is beyond the scope of this sectoral analysis, however a brief summary of existing
research and other initiatives is included in Annex 2.

4.3 Sector Specific Strategies and Action Plans

There are several existing ARD sector specific strategies of relevance to climate action:

National Strategic Framework for Sustainable Development of Agriculture, the Food Sector and
Rural Areas during the period 2014-2020–2030 – finalised in 2013 this presents a comprehensive
framework for guiding national public policy options regarding development of the ARD and food
processing sector. Supported by a Medium- and Long-term Vision document (2020/2030 horizon)
prepared by the World Bank.

National Strategy on Sustainable Development: Horizons 2013-2020-2050 – a broad strategic
framework adopted in 2008 that sets high level national objectives for all sectors. Key strategic
objectives for the ARD sector are:

   Horizon 2013 - enhance the economic vitality of Romania’s rural areas while maintaining social
    balance by means of the sustainable development of agriculture and forestry;
   Horizon 2020 - strengthen production structures in agriculture and forestry while promoting the
    economic and social development of the rural areas in order to further reduce the existing
    disparities and to attain the current average performance level of the other EU Member States;
   Horizon 2030 - achieve full implementation of EC policies and practices in agriculture and
    forestry, including those relating to climate change mitigation and adaptation.

National Strategy on Drought Effects Mitigation and on the Prevention and Combating the
Land Degradation and the Desertification (elaborated in 2008, but not yet approved) – this strategy
aims to mitigate the increasing social, economic and environmental impacts of drought via the
elaboration of drought management strategies / actions; introduction of measures to protect and
restore the capacity of water-stressed natural ecosystems, agricultural crops and other drought and
desertification affected assets, and; the improvement of water and soil resource management.

Agricultural farm modernization programme – adopted in 2008, this national programme offered
financial support for the replacement of outdated tractors and agricultural equipment with more
energy-efficient and less polluting equipment and technologies.

National Strategic Plan for Agriculture and Rural Development 2007–2013 (adopted in 2006) -
this plan identifies development priorities for agriculture, forestry and rural areas in the context of
Romania being a new EU member State from 2007. The plan is implemented through the National
Rural Development Programme (NRDP) for Romania 2007-2013 which is reviewed in more detail in
section 4.4 below.

Programme for the Stimulation of Energy Crops, including Biofuels (adopted in 2006) – based on
an EU support programme for the promotion of energy crops this national payment scheme was
operated in Romania during 2007-2009 and led to an increase of the cultivated area for energy crops
to 27,000 ha in 2007 and 39,000 ha in 2008.


                                                                                                          30
Strategy for Rehabilitation of Irrigation Infrastructure (approved by MARD in 2013) –developed
under the Irrigation Rehabilitation and Reform Project financed by the World Bank and the
Government of Romania and implemented through the Romanian Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development from 2004-2012. The Strategy only encompasses those irrigation schemes with proven
economic viability where the farmers interest in continue irrigation has been demonstrated.

4.4 Measures implemented in the NRDP 2007 - 2013

In June 2006, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development drafted a National Strategic Plan
(NSP) for Rural Development in preparation for EU accession in 2007 (see section 4.3 above) and the
launch of the National Rural Development Programme (NRDP) for Romania 2007-2013 that was co-
financed by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).

The fight against climate change was mentioned in the NSP as an important priority for Romania and
the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) was set as a key priority for axis 2 (sustainable
land management) of the NRDP, together with the increased production / use of renewable energy
sources that was set as a priority under axis 1 (competitiveness) and axis 3 (economic diversification
and quality of life). The NRDP 2007-2013 specifically mentions solar, wind, biomass and geothermal
energy, but gave most attention to the cultivation and processing of agricultural / forestry biomass as a
substitute for conventional energy sources – including reference to the need to develop a domestic
biofuel market in order to meet EU membership requirements.

This commitment to climate / energy-related actions was strengthened with the allocation of an
additional 53.9 million EUR from the EAFRD during revision of the NRDP following the 2008 CAP
Health Check and adoption of the European Economic Recovery Package (EERP). This comprised a
total of 18.19 million EUR allocated to climate action and 35.72 million EUR allocated to renewable
energy.

A precise breakdown of EAFRD funding that has spent on climate actions in the 2007-2013
programme period is not currently available, but Table 4 provides a summary of expenditure upon the
measures implemented in the NRDP 2007-2013 with potential to support climate action (mitigation,
adaptation and renewable energies).

It can be seen that a total of 8 measures were programmed in the NRDP 2007-2013 that were targeted
at, or relevant to, climate change mitigation and adaptation, as well as the transition to a low carbon
economy.

The total financial allocation to these 8 measures was 6,399.1 million EUR, of which 46.2% (2 958.9
million EUR) had been committed to beneficiaries (i.e. absorbed) by the end of 2012.

Of course, this only gives a very general indication of the success to-date of targeting NRDP
measures / funding at climate action, but good experience has been generated with the implementation
of individual measures that should be built upon and developed when programming the forthcoming
NRDP 2014-2020.

For example, one of the most important actions targeted specifically at climate change mitigation and
adaptation was first afforestation of agricultural land. This measure referred explicitly to the
importance of afforestation for a) carbon sequestration; b) prevention of soil erosion and other natural
hazards, such as floods, and; c) the increased production of a renewable energy source.



                                                                                                            31
The target for afforestation was 50,000 ha of degraded agricultural lands, but to-date the uptake of
measure 221 has been negligible with less than 500 ha afforested and only 11 452 EUR absorbed out
of a total of 229.3 million EUR allocated! The problem was that the measure was badly designed and
too difficult to access. For the PNDR 2014-2020, the eligibility criteria need to be clarified and
implementation procedures improved.

On the other hand, the highest level of absorption (76.5%) observed to-date has been for agri-
environment payments. These are area-based compensatory payments that were targeted in the
PNDR 2007-2013 at the maintenance of extensive farming practices and the avoidance of fertilizer
and pesticide application on high nature value grasslands. These grasslands are important for carbon
sequestration and the maintenance of functional ecosystems that deliver important environmental
services and support the livelihoods of millions of small-scale farmers.

Agri-environment payments will continued to be financed as a compulsory measure during the 2014-
2020 programme period and according to Article 29 of the new EAFRD Regulation will be renamed
as “agri-environment-climate payments” and must include a specific focus upon “the promotion of the
necessary changes into agricultural practices that make a positive contribution to the environment and
climate.” It is encouraging therefore that these payments have proved so popular to-date with farmers
and they will be an important climate action for promoting in the PNDR 2014-2020.

A useful source of further information on climate-relevant rural development measures used by other
EU Member States during the 2007-2013 programming period is the Synthesis Report from the
European Network for Rural Development (ENRD) on Addressing Climate Change within the post
Health Check Rural Development Programmes (2007-2013) (ENRD, 2010).

5. Priorities for Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation in the ARD
   Sector
5.1 General Actions for Supporting Mitigation and Adaptation in the ARD Sector

Improve awareness of climate change amongst farmers and rural communities

As a first key step towards addressing the response of the ARD sector to climate change it is
important to acknowledge the top–down “gradient” in the knowledge on climate change impacts on
agriculture with a higher level of understanding in national governmental / research institutes and a
very much lower level of knowledge at regional and local level.

Rural people, including farmers and other businesses, do not have a good understanding of the
consequences of climate change on their enterprise and livelihoods. Furthermore, the flow of relevant
knowledge from “top to bottom” is impeded by:

   the over-centralisation of climate change issues in the Ministry of Environment and Climate
    Change (MECC) which means that policy makers in other institutions are not sufficiently
    informed about the risks associated with the climate change impacts on the ARD sector;
   the “gap” that has developed in Romania (and many other European countries) between
    agricultural research and practice;
   the current lack of a fully functional agricultural extension and advisory service in Romania
    following the dismantling of the national agricultural advisory service in recent years, and;
   the continuing low standards of education in many rural areas.

Rural communities are undoubtedly aware of, and sensitised to, what they perceive as
increasingly variable weather – but clear and simple messages need to be articulated and
communicated related to the trends, risks and uncertainties that are associated with their
perceptions of a changing climate.

Public awareness should be raised regarding a range of climate-related risks. Messages should be
tailored according to the localized risks and vulnerabilities ranging from heat waves, seasonal water
scarcity, drought and desertification to local flood hazards.

Proactive information campaigns should be organised involving the central and regional offices of the
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MADR); the Agricultural Chambers; the county and
local branches of the Paying Agencies (APIA and APDRP) and all key farmers / producer
organisations.

There are numerous popular TV programmes, newspapers and magazines serving rural interests.
These should all be targeted. Civil society organisations and other NGOs should also be engaged.

Where appropriate, information campaigns should also be linked to capacity-building for emergency
planning. Some rural communities will inevitably be at greater risk of extreme events and climate-
related emergencies than others.

Climate information services will also have a role to play in supporting these communication
campaigns. The National Meteorological Administration (NMA) already has a range of relevant
information services, but these focus mainly upon national and regional forecasting. New information
tools need to be developed that communicate and raise awareness of the risks associated with climate
change - for example, hazard maps that clearly communicate the risk of drought, heat waves, water
scarcity, localised flooding etc.

The agro-meteorological research activities of the NMA are continuously improving and a range of
modeling / GIS techniques are used to monitor the spatial extent of extreme weather phenomena and
to assess the most vulnerable areas. The information provided covers agricultural areas ranging from
regional, sub-regional and national level depending on specific needs of the end-users.

This information is already extremely useful for assisting farmers with their day-to-day management
decisions, especially on the larger-scale, commercial crop production units. However, the needs of
many other farmers are not being met. For example, an early warning system (e.g. mobile telephone /
SMS-based) for extreme weather events, notably thunderstorms, would be extremely valuable for
mountain farmers and shepherds when livestock are grazing on high altitude pastures in summer and
autumn. One thunderstorm in 2001 killed 70 sheep and 4 people in the mountains in Neamt county,
eastern Romania.

Target research and advisory support at climate change mitigation and adaptation

Much greater understanding is needed of what climate actions are relevent and effective in the
specific context of the Romanian ARD sector, and this knowledge needs to be communicated via a
functional advisory and extension system that engages with the entire ARD sector, not just specific
components of it.

Targeted research

Applied research is needed across a range of domains to both develop new, and enhance existing,
practices and technologies for climate change mitigation and adaptation. This requires a multi-faceted
and cross-sectoral approach. Immediate priorities for applied research include:

1. The continued study of climate variability, climate change and climate prediction by the
   Climatology Department of the National Meteorological Administration (NMA). Key research
   topics continue to be:

       analysis of the main characteristics of Romanian climate variability using long term
        observations (trends, shifts, extreme events);
       connection between Romanian climate and large-scale mechanisms (atmospheric circulation,
        North Atlantic Oscillation, etc.);
       projection of climate predictions to the Romanian context using statistical downscaling
        models, and;
       the validation of global/regional climate models on large-scale and regional scale.

2. The analysis of existing food and farming systems to identify their vulnerability / resilience
   to different climate change scenarios. The farming systems that currently prevail in Romania
   have adapted to current climate conditions over long periods of time, however relatively little is
   known about how well they will stand up to progressive climate change. Work must continue
   with the use of dynamic simulation models - combined with different climatic scenarios forecast
   by the global climatic models – to model of the impacts of climate change upon crop growth,
   development and yield. This work should be extended to include the economic modelling of
   whole farm systems that not only takes account of the direct effects of climate change in
   Romania, but also the indirect effects of climate change at a global level (e.g. volatility of world
   market prices).
                                                                                                          36
    On-going collaborative research between the Agro-meteorological Laboratory of the NMA and
    other research institutes such the National Research and Development Institute for Soil Science,
    Agro-chemistry and Environment (ICPA) should be encouraged. Existing research has tended to
    focus upon winter wheat and maize in the south and east of Romania, but should be extended to
    other crops and farming systems.

3. Researching new technologies and better practices (whatever their origin). Many broad-scale
   analyses (e.g. JRC, 2012) identify regions and crops in the EU that will be sensitive to progressive
   climate change, but there is little scientific knowledge about: a) how current farming systems in
   Romania can actually be adapted, and; b) which current farming systems and agricultural
   practices have the greatest potential to enable adaptation.

    On the one hand, there is clearly much potential for the development of new technologies and
    more climate-proof farming practices.        Investment in conventional crop breeding and
    biotechnology to address the progressively changing climate (e.g. heat, drought, water logging,
    increased and disease pest attack) will inevitably be an important part of Romania’s effort to
    adapt its farming systems.

    Existing research work by research institutes, such as the Research Institute for Cereals and
    Industrial Crops (Fundulea) and Research Institute for Fruit Growing (Piteşti-Mărăcineni (fruit
    trees), should therefore be expanded. This should include the development of collaborative,
    multi-partner research projects since crop breeding for future climate scenarios will have a
    significantly greater chance of success if conducted with farmers, taking account of their ability
    and willingness to adopt new risks and / or methods. Other high priority research topics include
    increased efficiency of water use by crops and the development of specific measures to counter
    land degradation and desertification.

    As climates effectively migrate within the EU, the transfer of best practices from one region /
    country to another will be crucial and this should also be considered as a high priority for
    research. For example, there will be many best practices relating to dryland farming from the
    Mediterranean region that become increasingly relevant to Romania. Indeed, there may be some
    promising practices already grounded in local knowledge, traditional rural practices and customs
    from Romania that simply need re-discovering.

Targeted advisory support

Farmers and rural communities confronted by the risks and uncertainties of climate change will need
on-going, robust and targeted technical support on a range of issues. Unfortunately, the agricultural
advisory system in Romania is currently very weak following the dismantling / decentralization of the
governmental agricultural advisory and extension system in 2010.

An appropriate advisory and extension system needs to be rebuilt. Most of the former advisory
network continues to perform as Chambers of Agriculture subordinated to the local public
administration of the County Councils, but recent joint projects by the World Bank and Romanian
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) have also introduced some additional actors
to the market:

   Training and Information Centres (TICs) set up in the main regions in Romania, as knowledge
    resource bases for improvement and updating the professional capacity of the extension, food
    safety and research specialists;


                                                                                                          37
   Integrated Agricultural Offices (designed on the model “one stop shop”) established in 4 pilot
    areas, that bring together under a single roof, agricultural advisory and administration services,
    and;
   Socio-economic guidance service capacities and mechanisms established in 15 counties, seeking
    to increase the ability of the agricultural population to sustainably manage its income and assets
    with respect to the available national and EU support programmes.

All of these actors – if sustained – have a role to play in supporting climate change mitigation and
adaptation.

Assess the economic feasibility of investments and incentives for climate action

Knowledge of the economic feasibility and cost-effectiveness of different mitigation and adaptation
actions needs to be improved. For example, Smith et al. (2007) estimate that less than 35% of the
total biophysical potential for agricultural mitigation at a global level is likely to be achieved by 2030
due to various economic constraints, notably the transaction costs associated with starting-up
mitigation actions.

Lessons need to be gleaned from the existing experiences with investment support and compensatory
payments in the NRDP 2007-2013 (as well as from other EU Member States) since it is obvious that
farmers will need clear financial incentives to engage with many climate actions.

5.2 Priority Actions for Mitigation in the ARD Sector

Although there has been a significant reduction in GHG emissions from agriculture in Romania in
recent years, at a European level agriculture continues to be the most important source of nitrous
oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions and in accordance with the Europe 2020 Strategy it is
anticipated that all Member States will continue to promote the reduction of GHG emissions from the
ARD sector.

Furthermore there is also considerable potential in the ARD sector for a) carbon sequestration in
agriculture and forestry, and b) the production of biomass (including biofuels) as an alternative to
fossil fuels.

The priorities for mitigation highlighted below are broadly in accordance with the strategic objectives
of the National Climate Change Strategy 2013-2020. However, the big question remains whether the
necessary mitigation can be balanced with the inevitable longer-term demands upon agriculture for
increased food production. An appropriate mix of actions is therefore needed to manage, offset and
avoid emissions across the whole ARD sector.

Support farmers with the continued reduction of GHG emissions and the adoption of
low carbon technologies

Investments and incentive schemes are needed to encourage farmers to adopt technologies and
practices which directly contribute to reducing emissions – this includes improvements in the
efficiency of energy use and the better management of carbon and nitrogen flows in the agricultural
ecosystem.

For example, nitrogen (N) applied to cultivated soils as inorganic fertilizers and organic manures is
not always used efficiently by crops. Surplus N remaining in the soil is – under certain conditions -
particularly susceptible to microbial denitrification and loss to the atmosphere as nitrous oxide (N 2O).
                                                                                                             38
Improving the efficiency of N use can therefore greatly reduce N2O emissions. Typical practices that
improve N use efficiency include:

   adjusting fertiliser N application rates to match crop needs;
   avoiding N applications in excess of immediate plant requirements.
   applying fertiliser and manure N when it is least susceptible to loss i.e. when crops are growing
    most actively.

One important short-term priority for the mitigation of GHG emissions is therefore continued
investment in the up-grading and modernisation of i) facilities (both large and small-scale) for the
storage of livestock manures, and; ii) equipment for the spreading of fertilisers and manures. This
will greatly help to improve the efficiency of N use, reduce N2O emissions and also have additional
positive benefits for water quality due to the reduced risk of nitrate leaching.

Grazing ruminants such as cattle and sheep, are important sources of GHG emissions. According to
Steinfeld et al. (2006), global livestock production is responsible for 18% of all GHG emissions,
including 9% of all carbon dioxide emissions, 45% of methane emissions and 65% of nitrous oxide
emissions.

Cattle and sheep grazing semi-natural grassland at low stocking densities release large quantities of
methane because the vegetation soon becomes mature, developing higher concentrations of cellulose
which produces larger amounts of methane. This contrasts with animals which are either grazed at
high density on intensively-managed grasslands (which accumulate less cellulose), or; are kept
indoors and fed on cereals.

This raises some interesting questions about the mitigation of GHG emissions from grazing livestock
in Romania – a large proportion of which (if not the majority) are associated with small-holdings and
the extensive grazing of semi-natural grasslands.

 On the one hand there is an argument that the best way to mitigate the impact of livestock production
upon climate change is to increase the efficiency of the livestock sector by promoting more intensive
livestock systems. On the other hand, it is argued (e.g. Grayson, 2008) that although extensively
grazed sheep and cattle generate greater amounts of methane per animal than their intensively reared
counterparts, this is offset by the lower densities at which they are stocked. Therefore extensive
livestock farming systems, such as commonly found in Romania, produce less CH4 than conventional
livestock systems. Further research into this issue is warranted.

Support for the reduction of soil carbon losses and increased carbon sequestration

Soil carbon sequestration by farmers is estimated to have a high economic mitigation potential (Smith
et al., 2008). It also has good potential to be promoted in Romania through existing interest in
organic farming and zero / conservation tillage techniques. The afforestation of low quality and
unproductive land must also be encouraged, especially in those areas where soils are most vulnerable
to degradation and loss.

Enhancing soil carbon content also has important benefits in terms of water storage (combating water
stress), soil biodiversity (maintaining soil fertility) and soil aggregate stability (combating soil
erosion).

However, there are uncertainties. Appropriate levels of incentive for the adoption of soil carbon
sequestration by farmers remains unclear and influenced by a range of potential barriers to adoption.
                                                                                                         39
The effectiveness, variability and permanence of different practices for soil carbon sequestration still
needs to be evaluated in the Romanian context and is likely to vary according to individual
agricultural systems based on climate, edaphic, social setting / behaviour, economic conditions, and
historical patterns of land use and management. More research is needed.

Support for the increased production of renewable energy in rural areas

Agriculture has to-date only made a very small contribution (1.7% in 2010) to total renewable energy
production in Romania – this is one of the lowest contributions in the region and sits well below EU-
15 and New Member State averages (see Figure 7 below).

Farmers and other rural businesses have many opportunities for the production of renewable energy
from crop residues and dedicated energy crops; rural biogas production from livestock manure, and;
investment in the small- and large-scale technologies available for solar and wind power generation
(not discussed further here).

There is untapped potential for small-scale, community-based initiatives where the full socio-
economic benefits of investment in appropriate technologies are retained locally. The LEADER
approach promoted by EU rural development policy could be used to support this.

Crop residues can be used as a source of fuel, either directly or after conversion to fuels such as
ethanol or diesel. These bio-energy feedstocks still release CO2 upon combustion, but the carbon is
of recent atmospheric origin (via photosynthesis) rather than from fossil carbon. The net benefit of
these bio-energy sources to the atmosphere is equal to the fossil-derived emissions displaced, less any
emissions from producing, transporting, and processing.

The straw remaining after the harvesting of cereal crops, such as wheat, is a potentially very important
fuel source. It occurs in large quantities, is renewable, and has low sulphur and zero emissions of
carbon dioxide.



                                                                                                           40
GHG emissions could be reduced by substituting fossil fuels with energy produced from agricultural
feed stocks (e.g. crop residues, dung, energy crops), which would be counted in sectors using the
energy. The contribution of agriculture to the mitigation potential by using bioenergy depends on
relative prices of the fuels and the balance of supply and demand.

The energy production and GHG mitigation potentials of dedicated energy crops depends on
availability of land, which must also meet demands for food as well as for nature protection,
sustainable management of soils and water reserves, and other sustainability criteria.

Large-scale production of modern bioenergy crops, partly for export, could generate income and
employment for rural regions. Nevertheless, these benefits will not necessarily flow to the rural
populations that need them most. The net impacts for a region as a whole, including possible changes
and improvements in agricultural production methods should be considered when developing biomass
and bioenergy production capacity. Although experience around the globe (e.g. Brazil, India biofuels)
shows that major socioeconomic benefits can be achieved, new bioenergy production schemes could
benefit from the involvement of the regional stakeholders, particularly the farmers.

The anaerobic digestion of animal manures can release significant amounts of CH4 and this can be
exploited in rural biogas production. Some small-scale plants have already been piloted in Romania
and have proved successful.

5.3 Priority Actions for Adaptation in the ARD Sector

In addition to the cross-cutting general actions to support mitigation and adaptation outlined in
Section 5.1, further priority actions for adaptation therefore promotion climate change adaptation in
the ARD sector fall into three main categories:

1. Investment in irrigation infrastructure and improved water management in the south and south-
   east of Romania where drought will be most frequent and intense;
2. Support for accelerated adaptation by farmers and rural communities to the progressive climate
   change that is increasingly observed;
3. Better management of the risks in the ARD sector that are associated with climate variability and
   extreme events.

These actions present a major challenge in terms of science, policy and practice – a challenge that is
complicated by the variability in socio-economic context of rural areas and the highly polarised
structure of agriculture. For example, very different approaches are required to address contrasting
vulnerabilities in the sector such as:

a) large-scale crop production in the lowland areas of south and south-east Romania where the
   increased frequency of drought is likely to significantly reduce the yields of grains and other
   crops. While losses may be partially offset by the beneficial effects of increased CO2
   concentrations, crop production will be further threatened by potential increases in the prevalence
   of pest and diseases and through the loss of productive land due to desertification, and;
b) small farmers in geographically remote and economically disadvantaged communities in the
   mountains where access to relevant information and advice is currently very limited. Although
   many small farming communities in Romania are intrinsically resilient to social and economic
   change, they are highly dependent upon their traditional agricultural systems and therefore very
   exposed to increasing climate variability and extreme events.



                                                                                                         41
Investment in irrigation infrastructure in the most vulnerable regions

Priority action is needed at the national level to improve / rehabilitate the economically viable
irrigation infrastructure in south, south-east and east of Romania where the occurrence of drought is
predicted to be most frequent and to reach the highest intensity values (extreme/Co-300 m3/ha and
severe/600-900 m3/ha) (Mateescu et al., 2013).

As of July 2013, the strategy of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) for
supporting investment in irrigation infrastructure and improved water resource management was as
follows:

1. Continued construction of the inter-basin Siret – Bărăgan channel between the Buzau and Ialomiţa
   rivers for water supply and irrigation use;
2. Rehabilitation of publically-owned irrigation infrastructure serving approx. 823,000 hectares of
   agricultural land (but only where irrigation is economically viable);
3. Changing the supply of 3 existing irrigation systems serving approximately 56,000 hectares of
   agricultural land the Siret and Prut rivers to the Siret – Bărăgan channel;
4. Establishing new irrigation works to serve 425,000 hectares adjacent to the Siret – Bărăgan
   channel.

All plans for the expansion of irrigation infrastructure and facilities (including on-farm tertiary
infrastructure) must be prepared with reference to the relevant River Basin Management Plan
(RBMP).

Further work will need to be done with the RBMPs to assess the specific levels and types of irrigated
agriculture that can be sustained in each of the river basins. This exercise should entail quantitative
assessments of water availability and crop water needs under different climate scenarios, and is best
conducted in a Decision Support System framework, so that the trade-offs between different choices
can be explicitly analysed and discussed with the stakeholders.

Wastewater reuse in irrigation should be encouraged in accordance with the EU guidelines, especially
in water-scarce basins. A new EC directive on water reuse us understood to be due for proposal by
2015.

In the areas where groundwater over-abstraction is leading to serious depletion of aquifers, the use of
groundwater should be reserved for domestic water supplies.

Support for accelerated adaptation by farmers and rural communities

Support for accelerated adaptation to climate change at farm and community level is urgently needed.
One of the most pressing tasks is to reduce the effects of extreme weather events, such as droughts
and floods. Land and water management practices therefore need to be improved, including the
rehabilitation and better management of irrigation services.

Innovation, co-operation and bottom-up initiatives need fostering and promoting amongst local
people, including farmers and other businesses. Not all solutions can be expected to come from the
top-down.

This is a huge undertaking and must be deeply embedded in public policy, including the National
Rural Development Programme 2014-2020. Actions for the accelerated adaptation of agricultural


                                                                                                          42
holdings and rural communities must be built upon a solid base of relevant applied research and
advisory support (see Section 5.1 above).

There is also a strong need for fostering and promotion of innovation, co-operation and bottom-
up initiatives by local people, including farmers and other businesses.

Typical changes in cropping systems already observed across the EU are (Olesen et al., 2011):

   Minor to moderate changes in the cultivation timing - mainly shifts in sowing dates (e.g. earlier
    sowing of spring crops)
   Changes in cultivation / tillage practices
   Tendency of farmers to reduce crops that are unsuitable under the changing climatic conditions
    and to introduce new crops to the crop rotation
   Increase of interest in the cultivars that are able to cope better with drought and other weather
    extremes
   Widespread effort to promote techniques that preserve soil water, especially in the most drought
    prone regions
   Modernization and rehabilitation of existing, economically viable irrigation infrastructure, mostly
    located in areas with high risk of drought
   Some expansion of irrigation, especially in the most arid zones. But interestingly although an
    expansion of irrigation is the most obvious response in those regions where water resources are
    most limited, there has actually been marked drop in the area under irrigation in these regions
    when farmers have chosen to change their cropping systems to include crops which demand less
    water
   Efforts to introduce cultivation techniques reducing soil erosion. This may be a response to a
    higher frequency of more intense precipitation leading to water erosion, but also the result of
    more frequent droughts as a prerequisite of wind erosion over the area.

Farmers in Romania need more information, training and advisory support on how to adapt their
agricultural production to the increasing risks, uncertainties and impacts of climate change. This
information, training and advisory support must be delivered according to the demands and
circumstances of specific localities or individual farms since the impacts of climate change are
variable.

It cannot be assumed – in the short- to medium-term at least – that all impacts of climate change upon
Romanian agriculture will be negative. There may be some areas that experience positive impacts.
There may be a shift, for example, in the distribution of less-favoured areas with some current less-
favoured areas benefiting from the effects of climate change (and no longer needing support), whilst
new areas may come to be considered as less-favoured and thus be eligible for support.

There must be an enhancement of cooperation, as well as constant transfer of technology, know-how
and best practices. Exchange of knowledge and experience should also include a database of case
studies that showcase different approaches to climate change adaptation in agriculture.

All of which requires a solid foundation of sound knowledge about farming and food systems;
learning from community-based approaches; generation and use of new technologies; changes in
agricultural and food-supply practices, including diversification of production systems; improved
institutional settings; enabling policies and infrastructural improvements, and above all a greater
understanding of what is entailed in increasing adaptive capacity.


                                                                                                          43
Some general recommended actions at farm / local level for supporting / promoting adaptation in the
ARD sector include:

   Promote the use of agro-meteorological services by farmers;
   Promote the use of available information sources by farmers to support the adaptation of their
    production systems, including the selection of crops and cultivars that are better adapted to the
    changing growing conditions;
   Introduce new / alternative technologies for addressing extreme weather events;
   Promote the use of farm advisers with specialist climate change-related knowledge (based upon
    relevant applied research);
   Develop Best Practice Guides for agriculture and climate change, especially non-irrigated
    agriculture;
   Encourage on-farm experimentation to modify soil management techniques, test novel crop
    rotations, select new crops, and diversify production to suit the new climatic conditions;
   Introduce animal husbandry techniques / technologies that reduce stress in livestock caused by
    extreme weather;
   Develop crop / farm insurance products and promote their use;
   Develop and implement local action plans (at commune level) for climate change adaptation,
    including local / communal water management schemes;
   Develop and implement land management plans, especially for those areas that are most
    vulnerable to soil loss and degradation;
   Support the preparation and use of irrigation planning / scheduling.

Better management of climate-related risks

Climate change will mainly be experienced by farmers and other members of the rural population
through the increasing intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. This will introduce new
risks and uncertainties for rural people that come on top of the 'traditional' sources of uncertainties,
such as animal and crop diseases, normally associated with rural life.

Climate change will amplify existing vulnerabilities and instabilities in the ARD sectors. The
increased frequency and intensity of drought, for example, will undermine the confidence of farmers
to adopt new practices and invest in new technologies. Many local communities will be increasingly
subject to the disruption of day-to-day life due to water shortages, flooding and heat waves – as well
as the risk of loss of life and long-term declines in livelihood due to the loss of their productive assets
(e.g. soil). Local authorities will face unexpected costs due to damaged infrastructure. In many
regions of Romania these increased risks and uncertainties will intensify existing cycles of poverty
and vulnerability.

The concept of managing “climate-related risk” must be firmly embedded in decision-making
processes that take place at all levels of the ARD sector. There needs to be a paradigm shift in
attitudes to the risks and uncertainties associated with climate change that ranges from farming
households through local and regional administrations to national government.

The effective management of climate-related risk and shock should be both: i) holistic involving
prevention, response and planning, and; ii) tailored to local context. There is, for example, huge
potential for the direct engagement of local communities in mapping local hazards, assessing local
risks and vulnerabilities and developing local adaptation plans.



                                                                                                              44
This is clearly linked to many of the priority actions already mentioned above including the need to
improve awareness of climate change amongst farmers and rural communities; target research and
advisory support at climate change mitigation and adaptation; assess the economic feasibility of
investments and incentives for climate action, and; support accelerated adaptation by farmers and
rural communities.

New policy / financial instruments will also need to be created to manage the economic consequences
of the impacts of climate change in the rural areas. Relevant risk management tools for agriculture
include: i) insurance schemes against extreme climate events and / or against pest and disease of
livestock and crops linked to changing climate, and ii) the setting-up of farmers' mutual funds for
stabilizing incomes in case of price volatility or losses from extreme climate events or livestock/crop
diseases.

Both of these instruments are eligible for supporting under the EAFRD as of part of a new ‘risk
management toolkit’ that has been introduced for the 2014-2020 programming period. The new
proposed new EAFRD Regulation offers flexibility for such instruments to be i) carefully tailored to
the specific context of Romania on the basis of the needs of specific rural areas and farmers, and; ii)
combined with other complementary rural development measures, such as knowledge transfer,
investments in physical assets, diversification into non-agricultural activities, etc.

Risk management is a rapidly developing policy area and there are many opportunities to
develop new and innovative approaches, including the development of tools for the use of index-
based systems for climate-related loss assessment in agriculture.

One innovative risk management tool that could be very appropriate for the large number of small-
scale subsistence farmers in Romania is “Weather Index Insurance” (IFAD, 2010). This is a financial
product that has been developed and tested in developing countries, such as India and Mexico, for
managing the covariate risk 14 associated with extreme weather events. Weather Index Insurance
triggers pay-outs based on a meteorological index correlated with agricultural losses (e.g. rainfall or
modelled water stress), rather than actual observed losses. Basing pay-outs on an objectively
measured index overcomes problems, such the high cost of verifying the losses of individual
producers, which make traditional crop insurance unfeasible to introduce for smallholder farmers.

     Covariate risks are those risk that affect large numbers of people at one time
                                                                                                          45
6. Opportunities for Mainstreaming Climate Actions in the NRDP 2014 –
   2020
6.1 Mainstreaming Climate Actions

Strategic programming of the NRDP 2014-2020 involves a number of key steps beginning with the
development of a Partnership Agreement which establishes the binding terms between the Member
State and the European Commission.

The Partnership Agreement covers all of the European Structural and Investment (ESI) Funds and
provides a good opportunity to ‘lock-in’ climate mitigation and adaptation issues / considerations
right at the start of the strategic programming process. These issues / considerations need to be
developed in full consultation with all relevant government departments and stakeholders.

In accordance with the new EAFRD regulation for 2014-2020 (EC, 2013e), there is a comprehensive
suite of mitigation and adaptation measures eligible for co-financing under the National Rural
Development Program (NRDP) for Romania 2014-2020. However, the NRDP measures will not be
able to address all climate-related challenges faced by farmers and other rural stakeholders.
Prioritization and careful targeting of the NRDP measures will therefore be needed.

The main entry point for climate actions in the NRDP 2014-2020 is under priority 5 of the new EC
rural development proposals, namely: “promoting resource efficiency and supporting the shift
towards a low carbon and climate resilient economy in the agriculture, food and forestry sectors” .
But since climate change mitigation and adaptation are also cross-cutting objectives for the EAFRD,
climate actions should also be introduced under other priorities.

In order to ensure that farmers, foresters and other rural stakeholders will be in a position to achieve
this, all Member States are further encouraged to i) provide them with the required skills and
knowledge (also agreed to be very important in Romania), and; ii) to spend a minimum of 30% of
their total EAFRD expenditure on climate change mitigation and adaptation.

The experts consulted during the preparation of this rapid sectoral analysis acknowledged that this
mainstreaming of climate actions into Romanian rural development policy will require a significant
shift of emphasis towards climate action in the planning and implementation of the NRDP 2014-2020
compared to the NRDP 2007-2013. It is important to ensure that this policy shift is not only in line
with EU2020, but also the Romanian National Strategy for Climate Change 2013-2020, the upcoming
national strategy for the ARD sector (currently under development), as well as the cross-compliance
and ‘greening’ components of the EU direct payment system for farmers.

6.2 Basic Intervention Logic for the NRDP 2014-2020

At the time of writing (December 2013), the Romanian Partnership Agreement for the 2014-2020
Programming Period is still at the first draft stage, and work on the strategic programming of the
National Rural Development Programme (NRDP) for Romania 2014-2020 has only just started.

A basic intervention logic is proposed in Table 5 for using the available EAFRD funding to
effectively mainstream relevant climate actions in the NRDP 2014-2020. This intervention logic
incorporates the following elements:

1. The Thematic Objectives (TOs) that are expressed at the level of the Romanian Partnership
   Agreement for 2014-2020;

                                                                                                           46
2. The Rural Development Priorities for 2014-2020 that are expressed in the EAFRD regulation
   (EC, 2013e);
3. The Focus Areas that are elaborated for each Rural Development Priority in the EAFRD
   regulation, and;
4. The potential measures (with relevant Articles from the EAFRD regulation) for inclusion in the
   NRDP 2014-2020.

6.3 Examples of Specific Climate Actions that can be supported by the EAFRD

Table 5 above identifies a number of potential measures (with reference to the relevant articles) from
the EAFRD regulation (EC, 2013e) for mainstreaming climate actions in the NRDP for Romania
2014-2020. These measures are explained in further detail below.

However, it must be kept in mind that the ARD sector is complex and the successful mainstreaming
of climate action into the NRDP 2014-2020 will require the tailoring of measures to take account of:

i) the huge variability in socio-economic context and human / institutional capacity;
ii) the fact that effects of the changing climate upon temperature, precipitation and the occurrence /
     frequency of extreme events will continue to vary from region to region, and;
iii) the very specific characteristics of Romanian agriculture – notably its highly polarized structure
     and very large number of small-scale farmers which occupy around two-thirds of agricultural
     land.

A “one-size fits all” approach to mainstreaming climate action in the NRDP 2014-2020 will not be
appropriate – a flexible and localised approach should be encouraged as much as possible and the
potential of bottom-up, community-based initiatives should not be under-estimated (for example,
utilising the LEADER-approach).

7. Broad-based Action in the Face of Uncertainty
Significant uncertainty exists in the ARD sector regarding a) the direction and magnitude of climate
change; b) its impacts upon agriculture and the wider rural community, and; c) the effectiveness and
economics of different actions and strategies for mitigation and adaptation.

This uncertainty is inevitably reflected in this rapid sectoral analysis and some very broad-based
actions have been recommended that reflect a generic understanding of the most appropriate actions
for supporting farmers, including small-holder farmers, to maintain viable and productive systems in
the face of climate change.

But uncertainty does not mean that action should be postponed and the immediate opportunity
to embed climate action in the programming of the NRDP 2014-2020 must be fully and
effectively acted upon for the short- to medium-term benefit of the ARD sector.

But in parallel further work does need to be done sharpen the generic recommendations in this rapid
sectoral analysis. In particular:

1. A robust evidence base needs to be built-up that ensures all future policy decisions relating to
   mitigation and adaptation in the ARD sector are cost effective. This will require the Romanian
   government and research institutions to work more closely together to develop evidence and
   inform policy.

   For example, impact studies are needed that integrating climate, land use and
   macroeconomic policies in models such as EPIC (the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate
   model). EPIC is a process-based agricultural systems model composed of simulation components
   for weather, hydrology, nutrient cycling, pesticide fate, cultivation practices, crop growth, soil
   erosion, crop and soil management and economics. There needs to be an assessment of the full
   costs and benefits of climate actions for mitigation and adaptation to ensure that net benefit is
   delivered.

   Financial and socioeconomic analyses are needed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of deploying
   the various technologies. Marginal Abatement Cost Analyses can reveal costs and benefits in
   addition to carbon savings from various technologies. Given the public good nature of many of
   the interventions e.g. carbon sequestration public and private costs/benefits should be assessed to
   guide policy interventions.

2. A more strategic approach is needed that reconciles and integrates the climate challenges faced
   by the ARD sector with the need to also significantly reform the sector towards “a more e xport-
   driven, high-value and climate-resilient agriculture, with rural living conditions more closely
   aligned to urban”.

3. A macro-economic model for the impacts of climate change upon the ARD sector would be
   useful, but there is an inevitable trade-off that needs to be resolved between a single complex
   model that allows exploration of multiple policy questions and a suite of simple models that seek
   to answer the same questions individually.
