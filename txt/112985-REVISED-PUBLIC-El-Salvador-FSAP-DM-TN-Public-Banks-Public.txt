A World Bank (WB) mission visited San Salvador from March 6 to 16, 2016 to update the
developmental aspects of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) conducted in
2010. 1 As agreed with the authorities, this FSAP Development Module focused on
(i) financial systems issues, including competition and efficiency; (ii) financial inclusion and
non-bank financial institution issues, (iii) public sector banks, (iv) financial system
infrastructure, including payments, remittances transfers, and credit information systems;
(v) capital market and private pensions development issues; and (iv) insurance.

Specifically to address the issue of development banks, there were meetings with the main
stakeholders, including the Central Bank of El Salvador (Banco Central de la Reserva –
BCR), the Financial Sector Superintendence (Superintendencia del Sistema Financiero,
SSF), and the public banks. Other complementary meetings were held with other financial
institutions and the associations representing them.

The Technical Note 2 describes the background and current situation of the public sector and
development banks, and continues with specific recommendations directly linked with the
assessment and diagnosis performed.

                                    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

El Salvador has two public sector banks and one public development bank, who are subject to
the same regulation and supervision as private banks.

The 2011 Law of the Financial System for Development Promotion (LFSDP) produced
significant changes in the development bank Banco de Desarollo de El Salvador (Bandesal),
including the ability to act as a first-tier bank. Although Bandesal has granted first tier loans
under this new legal framework, they have been of relatively small number and magnitude.
The LFSDP also created the Economic Development Fund (FDE) and the Salvadoran
Guarantee Fund (FSG), assigning the administration of both to Bandesal. Bandesal cannot
take deposits of any kind, and its funding is based on its capital, loans from international and
regional financial institutions as well from bonds issued in the capital market.

Through the FDE, Bandesal provides direct loans as a first-tier bank assisting several sectors
including microcredit loans to the commerce sector. Among the type of credit products
launched by Bandesal, there is a program on microcredit directed to women, with credits of
up to $500. The operations of Bandesal’s first-tier banking through the FDE have presented
certain pitfalls and inefficiencies.

Through the FSG, Bandesal provides partial guarantees for specific type of loans operating as
second-tier bank, directed to loans with specific destinations and for amounts that cannot
exceed $350,000. The market participants have a good opinion on the role and functioning of
the FSG as a guarantee mechanism.

The Mutual Guarantee System (MGS) of El Salvador has its specific legal framework, with
the SSF as a supervisor. Only one private mutual guarantee company has been registered,
with relatively good performance albeit limited impact due to, among other factors, the lack
of reinsurance.

The Banco Hipotecario (BH) has been performing well in recent years, although faces capital
constraints to be able to continue its growth. It has been providing financial assistance to
sectors not attended by other financial institutions; its entire portfolio has some type of
collateral.

The third public bank, Banco de Fomento Agropecuario (BFA), provides financial services to
an underserved market segment, mainly in the agricultural sector. BFA business structure
comprises high risks and high costs, both for funding and lending, being also negatively
affected by public credit program of subsidized interest rate with no compensation. Results of
BFA have been positive, although meager and declining, with Capital Asset Ratio (CAR)
levels that limit its future growth.

Bandesal should focus its first tier activity on large size operations, and deepen its second tier
operations, both for loans and guarantees. To stimulate greater financing through capital
markets for strategic sectors such as infrastructure and Small and Medium Size Enterprises
(SME), Bandesal could expand its offering of credit enhancement instruments. Bandesal
could also expand its guarantee offerings for the SME sector by supporting SME lenders –
institutions solely dedicated to extending credit to SMEs – to obtaining funding through
capital markets.


                                                iii
The subsidies and associated costs to government program lending to the agricultural sector
that are attended by BFA, should be calculated prior to launch, with appropriate
compensation. The Government should advance in the consideration and approval of a new
updated law for BFA.

Both BH and BFA will be unable to expand their outreach without an increase in regulatory
capital. There is room for improvement in the coordination of policies and strategies among
the various public banks and other public institutions.

The Government should work to facilitate the creation and development of a reinsurance
mechanism for the Mutual Guarantee System (MGS).



                                     TABLE OF RECOMMENDATIONS


                                            Timeframe                    Priority

 Bandesal should refocus its          ST                        High
 strategy on second-tier
 operations, expand its offering
 of guarantees by providing
 credit enhancements for
 specific bond issuances, and
 engage in first-tier banking
 primarily for large transactions
 related with infrastructure and
 key sectors of the economy.

 Before launching programs            ST                        High
 with subsidized interest rates to
 be implemented by public
 sector banks, the Government
 should require the
 corresponding bank to
 calculate the cost of the
 subsidy and compensate the
 public institution accordingly
 with a separate subsidy grant
 element.

 The Government should                MT                        Medium
 consider enabling expanded
 outreach of BH and BFA
 through an increase in
 regulatory capital.




                                                iv
The Government should            ST       High
promote a framework for
improving the coordination of
policies and strategies of the
public banks with the aim to
improve efficiency and
minimize overlapping
activities.

Put in place a reinsurance       MT       Medium
mechanism for the MGS
(either through the support
for the creation of a
reinsurance company or the
renewal of the reinsurance
role of the specific trust for
supporting MGS)

The Government should            MT       Medium
advance in the consideration
and approval of a new updated
law for BFA.




                                      v
                               BACKGROUND AND CURRENT SITUATION

1.     El Salvador has two public sector banks and a public development bank. These are
Banco Hipotecario (BH), with an orientation of lending to SMEs, Banco de Fomento
Agropecuario (BFA) focused mainly in the agricultural sector, and Banco de Desarollo de El
Salvador (Bandesal) a second-tier bank (and, since 2012, also conducting first-tier banking).

2.      They are subject to the same regulation and supervision. The SSF has a specific team
in charge of the supervision of public sector financial institutions 3. The regulation has no
difference with the regulation applicable to private banks, and the process of supervision follows
the same process than the implemented for other institutions.

3.       The 2011 Law of the Financial System for Development Promotion (LFSDP)
produced significant changes in the development bank, including the ability to act as a
first-tier bank. This law created Bandesal as the continuation of the Banco Multisectorial de
Inversiones (BMI). In addition to making some changes in corporate governance (changing the
mechanism of electing president, composition of the board of governors 4) it included the
possibility of acting as first-tier bank for loans of large amounts, financing up to 50 percent of a
project at a minimum of 2 percent of Bandesal´s regulatory capital ($ 4.5 million); hence the
project should need a loan of a minimum of $ 10 million. Bandesal cannot take any kind of
deposits.,Its main sources of its funding (in addition to its capital) have been credit lines from
International and Regional Financial Institutions and the issuance of bonds in the market.

4.      Although Bandesal has granted first tier loans under the new legal framework, they
have been of relatively small number and magnitude. One of the factors that limits these
transactions is the requirement that the financial conditions (interest rate, collateral required,
etc.) provided by the other financial institution (e.g. domestic or foreign bank) participating in
the transaction cannot be different from the one applicable by Bandesal . The loans provided by
Bandesal have been focused in financing projects on key sectors, including infrastructure; with
amounts ranging from $ 5 million to $ 25 million per project.

5.     The LFSDP also created the Economic Development Fund (FDE) and the
Salvadoran Guarantee Fund (FSG), assigning the administration of both to Bandesal.
These two funds are outside the balance sheet of Bandesal. Their relative performance and
impact in the financial system were quite different.

6.      Through the FDE, Bandesal provides direct loans as a first-tier bank, assisting
several sectors including microcredit loans to the commerce sector. According to LFSDP the
maximum amount FDE could provide to each debtor cannot surpass the 5 percent of FDE´s
capital (currently estimated at $ 60 million). Additionally, the loans could be up to 90% of the
project when they are below $ 100,000 and 80% when they are above it. The total amount of
loans was $ 49.1 million as of December 2015 (Figure 1 shows the evolution from its beginning
in 2012). The main sectors attended include manufacturing, service, agricultural and

3
 Additionally to BH, BFA and Bandesal, the SSF supervises other public financial institutions such as: BCR,
Deposit Insurance Agency (IGD), Social Housing Fund (Fondo Social para la Vivienda) and other public sector
credit institutions (FOSAFFI, FOSOFAMILIA, CORSAIN, FONAVIPO).
4
  The Board of Governors is composed by the Ministry of Finance, the Governor of the BCR, the Minister of
Economy, the Technical Secretary of the Presidency, the President of Bandesal, one representative for each of the
following sector: agricultural sector, industrial, SME and private university.

construction. (The Annexes of Section VII has a table with the sectoral breakdown of FDE
assistance, including its evolution in the last 3 years). Since FDE has no more lending capacity,
Bandesal has started to fund it 5.

7.      Among the type of credit products launched by Bandesal, there is a microcredit
program directed to women (“Banca Mujer”), with credits of up to $ 500. These types of
loans are very demanding in terms of resources. Bandesal has no branches and personnel for
processing and managing these type of loans, they had to outsource the process. First they
started with 8 banks that were contracted for the origination of the credit, but it presented
problems on the quality of the loans (in part as a consequence of the distortive incentive
mechanism, where banks had the incentive to send the “worst” clients). Afterwards, they
changed the mechanism and selected only 4 banks for just the administration of the credits; but
Bandesal detected that this management was inadequate, with problems in the maintenance of
the client´s file (e.g. banks moved the client´s documentation from Bandesal´s files to the ones
corresponding to other financial services provided by the bank to the client). Finally, Bandesal
decided to manage the entire process of the credit (origination, management, recovery) and only
to contract the services of banks for the disbursement of the loan and collection of the
installments. During this process, Bandesal started to hire and train new staff, attracting people
from specialized microcredit institutions (who perceived it as a form of “crowding out”).

8.      The operations of Bandesal’s first-tier banking through the FDE have presented
certain pitfalls and inefficiencies. Bandesal is an institution with a tradition and experience in
second-tier banking. When using FDE funds, Bandesal started providing first-tier loans for low-
value credits, which demanded considerable resources (staff, structures, organization). As a
consequence of entering into the new market where Bandesal has not much competitive
advantage, the past due loans of FDE started to rise, reaching levels a Non-Performing Loan
Ratio –NPL- of nearly 5% in 2015. Figure 2 shows the evolution of the loan growth and at the
NPLfor the end of the last 3 years. The fact that Bandesal had to change 3 times its business
model for its first-tier banking operation through FDE, as well as the negative performance of
the NPL, validates the need of Bandesal to review its strategy of operating as a first-tier bank,
with respect to low-size transactions. Additionally, this type of role could be played –with a
greater competitive advantage- by other public banks or private financial entities.




5
 LFSDP authorizes the transfer of reimbursable resources to FDE which must not exceed 50% of the loan portfolio
of FDE, nor exceed the maximum amount of financing approved by Bandesal to any other eligible institutions.

9.      Through the FSG 6, Bandesal provides partial guarantees for specific type of loans
operating as second-tier bank, directed to loans with specific destinations and for amounts
that cannot exceed $350,000. The guarantee ranges from 50 percent of the loan (most of the
cases) up to 90 percent (for loans to students), with annual premiums of around 2 percent of the
total credit amount 7. The credit risk analyses for the provision of these guarantees are based
solely on the client bank´s assessment. FSG has granted 11,000 guarantees, with outstanding
guarantees of $ 48 million (Figure 3 shows their evolution.), being close to reach the maximum
amount allowed for their current capital. The FSG has paid out claims for $ 700,000, which
represents 1.6% of the guarantees granted (see Annex for the evolution of these concepts since
2013).

10.     The market participants have a good opinion of the role and functioning of the FSG
as a guarantee mechanism. Banks as well as Non-Bank Saving and Credit Institutions (NBSCI)
are active users of the guarantee provided by the FSG, which performs in an efficient way. The
process to grant guarantees is quite quick, since Bandesal does not perform any specific risk
analysis, and there have been no major delays in the payments of claims once default occurs).
This type of collateral encourages financial institutions to analyze and assume certain type of
credit exposure that would not be attractive without this partial guarantee.

6
 The design of the FSG was the result of implementing the best practices and after a revision of the older programs,
which were subject to improvements through several technical assistances received by ES authorities in key areas.
7
 For a 50 percent guarantee of FSG, the 2 percent annual premium would turn into an effective premium of 4
percent.

11.     The Mutual Guarantee System (MGS) of El Salvador has its specific legal
framework. Only one private mutual guarantee company has been registered, with
relatively good performance albeit limited impact due to, among other factors, the lack of
reinsurance. There is a specific legal framework for the mutual guarantee system activity,
which is supervised by the SSF (subject to prudential regulation, such as capital requirements
and loan loss provisioning). The only company registered (Garantía yServicios –GyS) started in
2004, and has 8 foundational partners (including one specific trust fund created for supporting
the MGS -called Development Trust for MGS -, 5 banks and one private company), with $213
million of guarantees granted and more the 4,000 requirements analyzed. Currently, the
outstanding guarantees are $ 24 million, and its CAR is of 47% (compared with the minimum of
12% required). For its risk analysis, it combines parametric scoring (for requirements below $
25,000) and deeper analysis (as well as coaching) of the cases with higher amounts required. The
reinsurance mechanism, included in the legal framework, contemplated the creation of a
reinsurance company that never happened. Until the end of 2015 the role of reinsurance has been
performed by the specific Trust Fund for supporting MGS (managed by Bandesal), which has
expired. The implementation of an effective and stable mechanism for reinsuring the activity of
mutual guarantee could help for, among other factors, further developing and reinforcing the
MGS, which complements other public efforts to facilitate the financial inclusion and access to
credit.

12.     The BH has been performing well in recent years, although it faces capital
constraints to continue its growth. Total loans ($ 622 million) have been growing steadily,
being 55 percent higher than in 2011 (Figure 4). Although it is concentrated in the SME sector, it
is diversified within the economic sectors it serves. Its NPL ratio was 1.1 percent as of
December 2015 (with similar percentages in the last 3 years and half of the ratio observed in
2010/2011), and performance has been positive (average Return on Equity –ROE- of around 10
percent in the latest years, with a slight decrease in 2015). Although BH has not been
distributing dividends, its CAR (13.8 percent versus a regulatory minimum of 12.0 percent)
limits the future growth of its risk portfolio. A $10 million capitalization from the Government
was committed, but has not yet materialized. Due to the potential high financial cost, BH has not
been planning to issue subordinated debt to be computed as regulatory capital.

13.      BH has been providing financial assistance to sectors not attended by other
financial institutions; its entire portfolio has some type of collateral. BH has been receiving
credit lines from Bandesal ($59 million), as well as from other regional institutions (BCIE,
BICSA), which is complemented with the funding coming from deposits (individual, companies
and institutional). Two key sectors that have been attended by BH in the latest year are coffee
(with a market share of 60% of the total loans directed to this sectorwith medium and large size
loans to companies that BFA is not able to attended due to its capital limitation), and public
transportation. 80 percent of the loans have some type of real guarantee (e.g mortgage, pledge of
vehicles) complemented with guarantees from the FSG. There has been some initial approaches

                                                   4
for BH to use the branches network of BFA, although its expansion faces operational, IT and
data challenges, among others.

14.     BFA provides financial services to an underserved market segment. 88 percent of
loans granted in 2015 ($152 million) were for amounts less than $ 5,000. The $ 88 million of
disbursed loans to the agricultural sector ($ 39 million for basic grains) accounted for 39 percent
of the total system. It uses the Agricultural Guarantee Program (PROGARA) as well as the FSG.
The distribution of BFA´s loan portfolio comprises: 60 percent to the agricultural and
agroindustry sector; 13 percent to small commerce and service sector, including microcredit (of
which 80% is related with the agricultural sector) and the remaining is oriented to several sectors
(tourism, popular housing, among others).

15.     BFA business structure comprises high risks and high costs, both for funding and
lending, which is being negatively affected by public credit program of subsidized interest
rate. The main source of funding are deposits, whose cost is affected by the low average amount
(with high administrative costs) and the high interest rate and volatility from the institutional
depositors (many of them, public institutions for which the government has established as a
benchmark the financial system average reference rate plus 100 basis points). The administrative
cost of handling small credits loans (BFA manages around 50,000 loans) plus the high credit risk
and, in some cases, limitations in terms of the active interest rate that could be applied to the
loan, have a negative impact in BFA´s performance. The subsidized loans comprise public
programs targeted to specific sector for which the government establishes an interest rate level
that is well below the one needed for breakeven of BFA 8. BFA is, among the public sector
financial institutions, the one with most branches and presence in the interior of the country
(which also has a significant impact in the structure of its costs). Risk management has been
improving, but has yet to implement improvements in the Information Technology (IT) area
including a new banking core system. Certain procedures of BFA have received an International
Standard Organization (ISO) quality certification.

16.      Results of BFA have been positive, although meager and declining, with CAR levels
that limit its future growth. During 2015 the ROE was only 1.0%, representing a significant
decline compared with the already low level observed in the previous years (average of 5.5%).
This performance reflects the impact on BFA´s income statement from the high cost and risks
that it faces (previously described). The CAR of 14.4 % at year end- 2015 (which has been quite
stable in the latest years), reflects the capital needs of BFA to continue growing within the
minimum regulatory requirements (a compromise from the Government to capitalize BFA has
not been materialized yet). There is a draft law for reforming BFA legal framework (the current
one dates from more than 30 years ago), with the aim of including structures and practices more
in line with best practices for managing financial institutions.

    To be described more in depth in the Section of Recommendations

                                                           5
                                            RECOMMENDATIONS
17.     Bandesal should focus its first tier operations on large size operations, and deepen
its second tier operations, both for loans and guarantees. Bandesal has a significant excess of
regulatory capital (CAR of 47.2%), which allows it to boost lending and guarantees (the latter
have the advantage of not requiring immediate liquidity, which turns to be one of the limitations
for Bandesal´s expansion). Additionally, for both types of businesses, Bandesal has a
competitive advantage, as there is no other institution in El Salvador performing such roles.

18.     To stimulate greater financing through capital markets for strategic sectors such as
infrastructure and SMEs, Bandesal could expand its offering of credit enhancement
instruments. For large infrastructure development needs of the country (e.g., for projects over $
100 million, such as the expansion of airport, ports, roads, utilities, etc.), Bandesal would not
have the financial capacity to provide such direct financing. Here, credit enhancement
instruments could be more effective, especially if the projects are considering financing through
capital markets, such as partial credit guarantees for principal or coupon payments of bond
investors, including liquidity and/or interest payment guarantees during the construction period,
all of which give more comfort and confidence on the project to potential bond investors as well
as an increase in the crediting rating (e.g provided by a credit rating agency).

19.     Bandesal could also expand its guarantee offerings to the SME sector by supporting
institutions dedicated to extending credit to SMEs in obtaining funding through capital
markets. By partially guaranteeing their bond offerings, Bandesal could help these usually first-
time issuers improve their credit rating and achieve greater success in attracting investors at
favorable prices, and thus allow them to increase their scope of lending to underserved sectors.

20.      The subsidies and associated costs to government program lending to the
agricultural sector that are attended by BFA, should be calculated prior to launch, with
appropriate compensation. Some programs with very low interest rate loans (e.g. the program
of low-interest rate directed to low value loans for financing basic grains) involve a total cost to
BFA of up to 6 times the rate of interest rate established by the government for the program 9. An
alternative to implement these types of loans without affecting the operations of BFA (or any
other public bank) would be to channel them through a specific fund provided by the
Government to BFA to be assigned to a specific financing program. The subsidy element should
be separated from the interest rate element to make clear to the end-borrower what the market
rate is and what portion is government subsidized. Additionally to measuring the direct cost of
the subsidized loan programs, it should be considered the potential indirect negative impact on
the rest of the loans to the sector that are not included in the program (e.g. they could perceive
that the market interest rate they are charged is “unfair and abusive”).

21.      Both BH as BFA will be unable to expand their outreach without an increase in
regulatory capital. They will be unable to continue increasing their risk assets (loans) within
the prudential regulation limits. If the capital injection would not be feasible in the short term
(e.g., because of fiscal constraints), the possibility could be considered for Bandesal to subscribe
a subordinated debt amount, computable in the regulatory capital of these banks.

22.    There is room for improvement in the coordination of policies and strategies among
the various public banks and other public institutions. There is currently a financial sub-

 The Ministry of Agriculture, through the Special Trust Fund for the Agricultural Sector (FIDEAGRO), has
partially compensated BFA with five percentage points.

cabinet, not formalized and coordinated by the Technical Secretary of the Presidency, which
meets every eight days, comprising the heads of the BH, BFA, Bandesal, BCR, SSF, Social
Fund for Housing (FSV) and National Fund for the Popular Housing (FONAVIPO). This type of
meeting could be suitable to discuss better coordination and complementarity of the actions of
the public sector banks. To substantiate these discussions, it is advisable to encourage the
creation of technical working groups with representatives of public sector banks.

23.      The Government should advance in the consideration and approval of a new law for
BFA. The current outdated law of BFA should be replaced with a new legal framework that
introduce structures and practices more in line with the best practices for managing financial
institutions.

24.     A reinsurance mechanism for the MGS should be put in place. The reinsurance is a
key component for reinforcing the development of the MGS, which could be instrumented either
through the support for the creation of a reinsurance company or by renewing the reinsurance
activity performed by the specific Trust Fund for supporting MGS (managed by Bandesal).
