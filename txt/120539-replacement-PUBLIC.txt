Executive Summary

Economic growth in Europe and Central Asia (ECA) is set to reach 2.2 percent in 2017, the
strongest growth in six years and 0.3 percentage point faster than estimated in May 2017.
Most ECA economies are showing more rapid growth than previously expected, reflecting
a strengthening of growth in industrial production and exports in recent months. Export
growth in the region continues to exceed that in the rest of the world. The relatively favor-
able growth outlook comes with a normalization of inflation; a decline in unemployment
rates; and, in many countries, moderate fiscal deficits.
    With the robust cyclical performance, countries are shifting their focus toward struc-
tural challenges that are part of the new normal after the financial crisis and the fall in
commodity prices.
    In the eastern part of the region, adjustment to the change in relative prices and the
dramatic fall in income caused by the decline in oil prices is incomplete. Needed reforms
could help boost exports. Several countries, especially Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, have
taken first steps toward such reforms.
    In the western part of the region, platform networks and the sharing economy have
grown rapidly since the global financial crisis, after which investors began looking for new
investment opportunities, workers demonstrated a new willingness to engage in more
flexible working arrangements, and individuals became eager to commercialize some of
their underutilized assets. These changes have created many opportunities—but they have
also increased uncertainty and anxiety. The challenge is to adjust the design of social secu-
rity systems and the regulation of labor markets to this new reality.
    Technological advancement, the globalization of production and work, and the chal-
lenges caused by lower commodity prices have contributed to a rise in public anxiety. It
came to the surface as the number of asylum seekers and undocumented migrants in the
region rose, leading to concerns about immigration in general. Often lost in the current
debate is the fact that the number of refugees in ECA is not unprecedented, that surges tend
to be temporary, that refugees represent just a small share of the total number of migrants—
and that migration has long been vital to the region, with ECA economies reaping substan-
tial benefits from cross-border labor mobility.
    Migration patterns are likely to change with technological progress and further cross-
border connectivity, and competition for high-quality jobs will become more intense. Re-
forms should help both migrants and nonmigrants cope with the inevitable increase in
flexibility in labor markets—by, for example, ensuring the portability of benefits, increas-
ing income security for workers, and better integrating migrants in host countries.

Overview
GDP growth in Europe and Central Asia (ECA) is shaping up to reach 2.2 percent
in 2017, the strongest growth in six years. The current estimate is 0.3 percentage
points higher than forecast in ECA’s May Economic Update.
    Almost all parts of the region show stronger growth than earlier expected,
reflecting a strengthening of industrial production and exports in recent months.
ECA’s export volume growth continues to exceed the global average. Central
Europe and the Western Balkans continue to register solid GDP growth, while the
Russian Federation and Belarus have come out of recession. Only Azerbaijan, the
country that was hardest hit by the fall in oil prices and that responded with some
delay, is expected to remain in recession this year.
    The improved growth outlook comes with a normalization of inflation, lower
unemployment rates, and in many countries moderate fiscal deficits. Average
inflation in the European Union is approaching 2 percent this year, after close to
zero inflation a year ago. Inflation in Kazakhstan and Russia has plummeted
from the double-digit rates after the fall in oil prices—confirmation that the re-
cent low inflation in oil-importing countries and high inflation in oil-exporting
countries merely reflected one-time adjustments in relative import prices. In sev-
eral countries, unemployment rates have fallen below pre-2008 levels and labor
participation rates are above pre-crisis levels. The average fiscal deficit this year
is 1.6 percent of GDP, down from 5 percent in 2009.
    Despite this robust cyclical performance, daunting structural challenges have
come to the surface:

•	 In many countries, the share of full-time permanent jobs in total employment
   has declined. The rising share of flexible contracts is driven by a wave of new
   technologies and the rapid growth of digital platforms for commercial activi-
   ties. These new technologies will increase efficiency, but they will also change


                                                                                   3

             the distributions of wealth and income.

          •	 The banking sector remains fragile in many countries, and weaknesses have
             become more exposed in countries that directly or indirectly depend on com-
             modity exports. Moreover, the financial sectors in ECA are struggling to ab-
             sorb new technologies and meet new demand for risky capital.

          •	 Regional economic and political cohesion is being tested, as exemplified by
             the Brexit vote. After the European banking crises, enthusiasm for deeper and
             broader integration has waned in the western part of the region. Meanwhile,
             the fall in oil prices has somewhat diminished the expected economic benefits
             of the Eurasian Economic Union.

          •	 The eastern part of the region has still not fully adjusted to the change in rela-
             tive prices and the dramatic fall in income triggered by the drop in oil prices.
             The unavoidable decline in private consumption has been steep. Over the last
             two years, consumption declined 16.4 percent in Tajikistan, 14.2 percent in
             Russia, 9.1 percent in Armenia, and 6.2 percent in Belarus. In other countries,
             where adjustment to new realities was slower, a sharp downward adjustment
             in income might still occur. Relative price changes have opened up the op-
             portunity for sharply increased exports, but in most cases reform programs
             are needed to realize these opportunities. Several countries (Belarus, Kazakh-
             stan, and Uzbekistan) have taken first steps toward such reforms.

GDP growth is strong throughout the region

GDP growth in ECA is shaping up to reach 2.2 percent in 2017, the strongest
growth in six years and 0.3 percentage points higher than estimated in the May
Economic Update (Table 1.1). Almost all parts of the region show higher growth
than earlier expected, reflecting a strengthening of activity in recent months.
    In the western part of the region, defined as the European Union (EU) and the
Western Balkans, countries in Central Europe are expected to grow the most rap-
idly during this and coming years. GDP growth in these new EU member states
is forecast to be almost twice the average growth in the European Union. This
pattern represents a continuation of the historical convergence trend that earned
the European Union the title of convergence machine (Gill and Raiser 2012). In the
seven boom years before the global financial crisis (2001–07), GDP in Central Eu-
rope grew 4.7 percent a year—twice the 2.3 percent annual growth in the European
Union. In the seven years after the crisis (2011–17), Central European economies
continued to grow twice as rapidly (2.5 percent versus 1.3 percent). As growth is
strengthening throughout the region, this relationship is likely to be sustained.
    The Western Balkans are the only subregion in ECA for which growth rates
have been reduced since April. The downgrading mainly indicates delayed ac-
celeration of growth. As during the last two decades, GDP growth in the Western
Balkans resembles growth in Central Europe much more than growth in the rest
of the European Union.

              High-frequency data for Southern Europe point at stronger growth than ear-
          lier expected. Still, the upgraded growth outlook for this part of Europe, which
          was hardest hit by the European banking crises, is still not strong enough to make
          up lost ground. Before the global financial crisis, growth in Southern Europe
          virtually equaled growth in the rest of the European Union. During the crisis
          years (2008–10), the cumulative contraction in Southern Europe was 4.2 percent,
          versus 1.8 percent for the European Union as a whole. Divergence continued dur-
          ing the seven years after the crisis, with the European Union growing at an aver-
          age annual rate of 1.3 percent and Southern Europe experiencing no growth at all.
          The current outlook suggests that this trend will not soon be reversed.
              The picture in the eastern part of ECA is mixed. Oil- and gas-exporting coun-
          tries and some neighboring countries are coming out of a recession that was trig-
          gered by the fall in oil prices at the end of 2014. Only Azerbaijan, which is more
          dependent on the export of fossil fuels than other countries in the region and
          which responded with some delay, is still in recession. High and rising oil prices
          brought a decade of exceptionally strong growth, with a short interruption in
          2009. The outlook is now more fragile for oil-dependent countries.
              In an idiosyncratic crisis caused largely by geopolitical tension and a legacy of
          macroeconomic problems, Ukraine lost cumulatively more than 16 percent of its
          GDP in 2014 and 2015. It is registering positive growth again, but not nearly
          enough to undo the damage done during these two years.
              Turkey showed remarkably strong GDP growth after the global financial cri-
          sis, largely because of effective fiscal stimulus. Average annual GDP growth in
          2011–16 was 6.4 percent. In 2016 growth declined to 3.2 percent, with rising infla-
          tion, rising long-term interest rates, and a depreciating lira. However, the first
          half of 2017 showed a strengthening of growth again, leading to higher expected
          growth than in other parts of the ECA region.



          ECA is outperforming the rest of the world in exports

          The upward revision of the growth forecasts follows data releases of high-fre-
          quency indicators that point at strong activity during the first half of 2017. In July
          the volume of industrial production in ECA was 4.2 percent above its level a year
          earlier (Figure 1.1). The increase constitutes a sharp acceleration from perfor-
          mance in recent years and is well above the annual average 1.5 percent growth
          since 2000. Stronger growth is broad-based within ECA. One of the few excep-
          tions is the United Kingdom, where the approaching break with the European
          Union has depressed growth in industrial activity.
             The recent acceleration of economic activity is part of a global trend. In the rest
          of the world excluding ECA and China, industrial production increased 3.2
          percent during the 12 months ending in July 2017, a much faster rate than the
          long-term annual growth rate of 1.2 percent. Growth of industrial production in
          China is of a different order of magnitude (6.2 percent over the last 12 months).

Inflation has normalized and unemployment fallen

The improved growth outlook comes with a normalization of inflation, lower
unemployment rates, and in many countries moderate fiscal deficits and close to
balanced current accounts. In the European Union, average inflation is approach-
ing 2 percent this year, up from about zero a year ago. In Kazakhstan and Russia,
inflation declined significantly from the double-digit rates that prevailed after
the fall in oil prices—confirmation that the recent low inflation in oil-importing
countries and high inflation in oil-exporting countries reflected one-time adjust-
ments in relative import prices.
    The average unemployment rate in the 28 EU countries has fallen to 4.2 per-
centage points below the peak in the wake of the 2008 crisis; it is now just 0.7
percentage points above the 2007 low (Figure 1.5). In several countries, unem-
ployment rates have fallen below pre-2008 lows and labor participation rates are
in many cases above pre-2008 levels.
     Germany provides a clear example of labor market improvements. For de-
cades, its unemployment rate moved stepwise to ever higher levels: After every
crisis—the oil crises of the 1970s, the recession of 1992—unemployment increased
and then stayed at the elevated level.
    As in the rest of Europe, the German labor market was a textbook example of
hysteresis. Its experience has been very different from that of the United States,
where unemployment rates fluctuated at about 4–5 percent during the last 50
years. The German hysteresis ended around the time of the 2008 crisis; since the
crisis its unemployment rate has fallen by more than half (Figure 1.6). One contribut-
ing factor to this turnaround may have been the labor market reforms enacted in
2003, which increased support for job training and capped unemployment benefits.

Fiscal positions in the region are consistent with much
improved cyclical conditions
Most ECA countries entered the global financial crisis with small fiscal deficits or
comfortable surpluses. For the region as a whole, the fiscal deficit was 0.3 percent
of GDP in 2007. In 2009 large deficits were built up, averaging 6.4 percent of GDP.
    Throughout the region, fiscal balances have now returned to normal levels,
with an average deficit of 1.6 percent of GDP. Countries in Central Asia, which
are still struggling to absorb the impacts of lower oil prices, are among the few
places in the region where deficits recently increased (Table 1.2).
    Despite this robust cyclical performance, economic challenges of a structural
nature have come to the surface. Among them are transformational changes in
the character of employment caused by digital platforms for commercial activi-
ties, vulnerabilities in the banking sector and the emergence of new financial in-
termediation, fragility in regional economic and political cohesion, and dramatic
changes in relative prices that force countries, especially in the eastern part of
ECA, to adjust their production structures and consumption patterns. All these
structural challenges are part of the new normal that tends to emerge after a ma-
jor global crisis. Many of them are linked to disruptive technologies that find
fertile ground in the wake of such crises.

           thetic leg was created by a 3D printer, genome sequencing costs fell dramatically,
           bitcoin was invented, and Airbnb was created. Uber came on the scene in 2009.
               The success of all these technologies and companies in the decade after the
           crisis may not be a coincidence. The major recession changed the behavior of in-
           vestors, workers, and consumers. Investors had lost traditional investment opportu-
           nities and were looking for yields in a zero-interest-rate environment. Many workers
           had lost their jobs and were willing to experiment with more flexible contracts in
           the digital economy. Many consumers were looking for cheaper services and
           were open to sharing some of their underutilized assets in the sharing economy.
               New disruptive technologies continue to emerge. The Internet of things will
           change the way products are produced, as illustrated by Internet 4.0, promoted
           by German industry. The commercial use of drones will change the way products
           are delivered. Personalized precision medicine will change the way people con-
           sume health services. Self-driving cars will revolutionize the automobile
           industry.
               New technologies increase efficiency and improve services—but they are also
           disruptive. They will require changes in labor market policies and social security
           systems. Digital technologies create winners and losers and thus change the dis-
           tribution of income and wealth. Firms that create successful digital networks can
           grow at an unprecedented rate with small initial investments, while traditional
           firms may experience sharp losses in valuation. Workers may face a new, digital
           divide between skill levels.
               Flexible contracts have become the dominant employment arrangement for
           younger workers. In Poland the share of nonpermanent employment increased
           from less than 5 percent in 2000 to more than 15 percent in 2017. In the Nether-
           lands the share of part-time workers and the self-employed is high and rising.
           Surveys show a similar rise of nontraditional employment contracts in Austria,
           Hungary, Italy, and Portugal. A forthcoming World Bank report—Leveling the
           Playing Field: Rethinking the Social Contract in Europe and Central Asia—shows that
           income inequality among young cohorts is greater today than it was in the past.
               Many social security systems in ECA are based on a corporate model that
           serves people with long-term employment contracts and a government system
           that protects the poorest in society. Supporting large numbers of people with flex-
           ible contracts in an adequate way, while preserving incentives to take risks and
           innovate, represents a formidable challenge.



           Low interest rates, vulnerable banking sectors, and new
           technologies pose financial risks

           ECA’s financial landscape changed dramatically during the decade after the cri-
           sis. Low and even negative real interest rates are a central feature of that new
           landscape. New vulnerabilities in the banking sector, the decline in foreign direct
           investment (FDI) flows to Central Europe and the Baltics, and an increased need
           for venture capital are other features. These new features can complicate the fu-
           ture role of financial intermediation in ECA.

    There have been good reasons for the European Central Bank’s zero interest
rate policy and quantitative easing in response to the financial crisis. Loose mon-
etary policy in the eastern part of the region is the proper response to the fall in
oil prices and remittances. But low interest rates come with risks.
    For one thing, they can create new bubbles. Corporate bond lending has
surged in the region, which is likely to create distress once interest rates inevita-
bly start rising. This risk is primarily a corporate sector risk in ECA, but some
sovereigns could also find themselves in the danger zone, especially in Southern
Europe, where government debt has increased to 120 percent of GDP.
    Low interest rates while the real economy is no longer in a cyclical downturn
also reduce the stock of monetary ammunition, which could be a problem if fu-
ture stimulus is needed. Low interest rates in Europe also make it difficult for
banks to earn profits.
    Low interest rate policies have been partly a response to low GDP growth and
low productivity growth. However, it is unclear how much of the low productiv-
ity growth after the crisis was a real phenomenon and how much simply reflected
measurement problems. The surge in applications of new technologies has cre-
ated formidable measurement challenges. It is virtually impossible to measure
improvements in the quality of services; it is difficult to value services that are
provided for free and financed by advertising; and it is challenging to measure
production in the sharing economy when consumers use underutilized assets
(Ahmad and Schreyer 2016). Moreover, the new technologies may have rendered
some of the old capacity obsolete, accelerating the scrap rate of existing capital.
If this phenomenon is significant, it can lead to an underestimation of the rate of
technological progress. No conclusions have yet been reached about the causes
of the observed productivity slowdown in the new normal, but the potential
measurement problem argues for caution about adopting far-reaching policies to
counteract the observed slowdown.
    In the eastern part of the region, many banks find themselves in a very vulner-
able situation. They have suffered significant losses as a result of unavoidable
exchange rate depreciations, triggered by the decline in oil prices, and they cu-
mulated losses on their investments in commodity production and real estate. In
many cases, they entered this challenging period in a vulnerable position, having
engaged in loss-making “connected” lending (lending in which the bank and the
borrowing firm are connected to the same entity).
    A big challenge for the financial sectors in the eastern part of the region is to
provide funding for new companies in new sectors that use new technologies. It
is an open question whether banks with entrenched ties to the nontradable sec-
tors are flexible enough to finance new export sectors. Without new companies
that are competitive in international markets, oil-exporting and surrounding
countries will not be able to fully adjust to all the large changes in relative prices
triggered by the decline in oil prices.
    European banks shrunk after the crisis and are now well capitalized. But their
profitability has declined, and some banks remain vulnerable. As in the rest of the
region, it is unclear whether European financial sectors can provide the risky
capital needed to develop new technologies. Globally, venture capital increased

           70 percent in real terms over the last decade, while initial public offerings (IPOs)
           declined by half (Wright and Asimakopoulos 2017).
              One of the manifestations of the decline in traditional financing could be the
           drop in FDI flowing into Central Europe and the Baltics (Table 1.3). These inflows
           are now less than half the level before the global financial crisis. The large inflow
           of FDI into the EU accession countries during the early 2000s may have been
           temporary; as these countries develop, the focus should naturally shift from in-
           ward FDI to outward FDI. Still, reduced FDI inflows have become part of the new
           normal for this part of the region. The big challenge for ECA’s financial sectors is
           to accommodate these and other changes in funding activities.



           Regional political and economic cohesion is
           being tested

           Regional integration has long been a driving force for prosperity in ECA. With
           many small nations, there is no alternative to close cross-border cooperation.
           Without regional integration, it is impossible to achieve the economies of scale
           and the degree of competition required to increase prosperity.
               New technologies have made it even more important to be connected to inter-
           national markets that spark innovations. It is increasingly vital to be connected in
           multiple dimensions, as a forthcoming World Bank report—Critical Connections:
           Why ECA’s Regional and Global Network of Interconnections Matter for Inclusive
           Growth and Stability—demonstrates. Trade, migration, financial flows, and infor-
           mation and communications technology (ICT) connectivity tend to reinforce one
           another; combined they are a conduit for essential knowledge spillovers. If connec-
           tivity falls behind in one dimension, the other dimensions become less effective.

    Despite the growing economic importance of cross-border connectivity, the
political trend seems to be moving in the opposite direction; the Brexit vote is the
prime example of this phenomenon. In many small regions throughout ECA,
voices are being raised for more autonomy, or even independence, as recent
events in Catalonia illustrated. More generally, enthusiasm for deeper and
broader integration seems to have waned in the new EU member states. Despite
an impressive convergence process, keenness for the European Union has cooled
after a series of European banking crises in recent years. Meanwhile, the fall in oil
prices has somewhat diminished the expected economic benefits of the Eurasian
Economic Union, and tensions between Russia and the European Union have
strained ECA-wide economic cooperation.
    The structural challenge is to rediscover a collective passion for regional coop-
eration with shared goals, in order to benefit from new technological opportuni-
ties while protecting local diversity and preventing new forms of inequality. The
connectivity agenda is intertwined with the technology or growth agenda and
the inclusion agenda. Separating one from the other is not productive and threat-
ens to produce adverse consequences. Without connectivity, new technologies, or
inclusion, social cohesion in ECA could erode and the region could fall behind in
applying the new technologies that are reshaping the global economy.



The greatest structural challenge is the sweeping
change in relative prices in eastern ECA

The eastern part of the region has still not fully adjusted to the change in relative
prices and the dramatic fall in income triggered by the plunge in oil prices and
the subsequent drop in remittances. The unavoidable decline in private con-
sumption has been steep: over the last two years, consumption declined 16.4
percent in Tajikistan, 14.2 percent in Russia, 9.1 percent in Armenia, and 6.2 per-
cent in Belarus. In other countries, where adjustment to new realities was slower,
a sharp downward adjustment in income might still come.
    Countries can adjust successfully only if they seize the new export opportuni-
ties created by the relative price changes rather than merely defending against
the negative impacts of these changes. In most cases reform programs are needed
to realize the new export opportunities. Changes in exchange rate policies are
needed, to smoothly achieve the unavoidable real depreciation. Extrapolations of
a model that captures historical patterns of real exchange rates suggest that oil
exporters have achieved the required real depreciation. Of the remittance-receiv-
ing countries that indirectly depend on the oil price, only Georgia seems to have
reached the new equilibrium (Figure 1.7).
    Realizing new export opportunities also requires reforms of the banking sec-
tor, in order to eliminate distortions that benefit banks that engage in connected
lending in nontradable sectors and create new funding possibilities for start-ups.
It requires mitigation of the artificial monopoly power that state-owned enter-
prises or enterprises controlled by oligarchs enjoy. It requires adjustments in fis-
cal policies, to avoid too much domestic stimulus, which can offset the newly

sharply increased exports and amplified opportunities to compete with imports,
even in sectors where countries have not been competitive for a long time.
   Uzbekistan recently initiated a bold reform program. As a first step, it depreci-
ated the official exchange rate and lifted restrictions on currency convertibility,
with the aim of eliminating the black market for currency exchange. This policy
change should lead to improved export incentives in the formal sector and re-
duce distortions in the domestic economy that were created by the dual exchange
rate system. It is an important step in a series of reforms that could make the
Uzbek economy competitive in international markets. Kazakhstan has devel-
oped an ambitious reform strategy that aims to boost technology and unleash
private sector initiatives. Belarus, a country with a large unfinished transition
agenda, is also exploring reforms. If these initiatives are successful, the region
could experience a second transition, after the opening up during the early
1990s—the right response to current structural challenges.

Migration and Mobility in
Europe and Central Asia
                                                                                       2
Overview
The sharp increase in asylum seekers and undocumented migrants has greatly
exacerbated public concerns in Europe and Central Asia (ECA) over immigration
in general. This response seems to reflect broader anxiety about reduced job se-
curity, caused by the technological developments and the internationalization of
production and work discussed in Chapter 1 of this report.
    The current debate often overlooks the fact that the number of forced mi-
grants in ECA is not unprecedented, that an influx of refugees tends to be tempo-
rary in nature, and that there are stark differences between refugees and other
types of migrants. Migration has been vital in ECA’s social and economic history.
For centuries, it has helped vulnerable households in the region escape poverty
and political persecution. In recent decades, ECA economies have benefited from
cross-border labor mobility.
    Migration patterns in the region are likely to change, along with technological
advancement and further cross-border connectivity. The competition for high-
quality jobs will become more intense. The share of high-skilled and circular
migration may increase, and the duration of skilled migration may decline.
    Policy reforms should not focus on migration challenges in isolation. Rather,
reforms should help both migrants and nonmigrants cope with increased and
unavoidable flexibility in labor markets. Successful reforms will likely improve
the portability of benefits, increase income security for workers with flexible con-
tracts, and better integrate migrants in host countries. Programs in origin coun-
tries could improve the mixed effects on family members left behind, who benefit
from increased resources but suffer from the prolonged absence of parents,
spouses, and adult children.
    The refugee crisis seems to have made it politically more difficult to fully
benefit from cross-border mobility. However, the heightened attention the topic
receives could also present an opportunity to establish a more coherent multilat-
eral framework for migration while respecting country-specific idiosyncrasies.

                                        The refugee crisis is raising Europeans’ concerns
                                        about migration

                                        Refugee flows have increased sharply
                                        The region is facing a steep increase in arrivals of refugees and undocumented
                                        migrants fleeing conflict or poverty in their home countries. The stock of refugees
                                        and asylum seekers in ECA rose about 75 percent between 2014 and 2016, from
                                        3.7 million to 6.4 million. Turkey alone hosted 3.1 million refugees and asylum
                                        seekers in 2016, making it the top host country in the world, and several countries
                                        in the European Union (EU) experienced large increases over this period. The
                                        region accounted for the bulk of the 3.7 million increase in the global stock of
                                        refugees and asylum seekers between 2014 and 2016.
                                           The public debate over immigration has blurred the distinction between refu-
                                        gees and other types of migrants (Box 2.1). First, refugees are forced to move,
                                        because of conflict or persecution, whereas economic migrants seek better em-
                                        ployment opportunities in destination countries. Second, refugees are more con-
                                        centrated in space and time and may lack the resources to become fully inte-
                                        grated in the labor markets in destination countries. They account for only a
                                        small share of total migration.

The increase in the number of refugees and undocumented migrants has
contributed to public concerns over immigration
   The share of survey respondents citing immigration as the most important issue facing the European Union
rose from about 9–10 percent in 2011–12 to a peak of 58 percent in November 2015 (Figure 2.2). The increase coin-
cided with a sharp rise in the number of refugees and asylum seekers. By May 2017 this share had fallen to 38
percent, with terrorism seen as a more important issue. Immigration continued to be the top issue in Estonia (62
percent), Hungary (60 percent), Denmark (56 percent), the Netherlands (51 percent), Sweden (45 percent), Ger-
many (40 percent), and Austria (34 percent), however. In 20 other EU countries immigration was the second-most
important concern; Portugal was the only EU country in which immigration was not among the three most impor-
tant issues (European Commission 2017).
   Even before the most recent rise in inflows, public attitudes in ECA largely opposed further increases in im-
migration. According to a survey conducted by the International Organization for Migration/Gallup in 2012–14,
only 8 percent of respondents in Europe favored an increase in immigration; 52 percent favored a decrease and 30
percent wanted to maintain the current level. These attitudes differed widely across countries. For example, 70
percent of Russian and British respondents and 84 percent of Greeks wanted immigration to decrease, whereas
only 45 percent of respondents in France favored a decrease. Results from the International Social Survey Program
also show that only a small minority of people surveyed in all ECA countries think that the number of immigrants
should be increased.

                                                 When it comes to the question of whether immigration makes their country a
                                             better or worse place to live, public perceptions remained stable or became
                                             slightly more positive between 2002 and 2014 (Figure 2.3). This finding suggests
                                             that the recent rise in public concerns over immigration might not reflect the
                                             long-term trend. There is also significant variation across countries in terms of
                                             public perceptions toward immigration in general. Figure 2.3 indicates that atti-
                                             tudes are more negative in Central Europe (EU-13) than in Western and Northern
                                             Europe (EU-15). In general, researchers find Nordic countries to be more positive
                                             toward immigration, particularly compared with Central and Eastern European
                                             countries (Heath and Richards 2016). Within the EU-13, Poland appears to have
                                             more favorable views toward immigration than other countries.
                                                 Attitudes toward immigration tend to be more negative in ECA than in other
                                             regions. Gallup created a Migrant Acceptance Index based on three questions.1
                                             Nine of the top 10 least-accepting countries in the 2016 poll were in ECA (the
                                             former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Hungary, Serbia, the Slo-
                                             vak Republic, Latvia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, and Croatia). The 2012–14
                                             International Organization for Migration/Gallup survey also shows that atti-
                                             tudes toward immigration are more negative in Europe than in other regions.2
                                                 Attitudes toward migrants at the country level are not uniform, however, and
                                             are influenced by various factors. Research suggests that although there is anxi-
                                             ety about overall immigration, there is strong support for intraregional mobility;
                                             younger generations see more benefits from inward migration than older genera-
                                             tions; and economic hardship tends to fuel anti-immigrant sentiments (Box 2.2).

Source: European Social Survey.
Note: Ratings are based on responses to question “Has immigration made the country a better or worse place to live?” Responses from worse (0)
to better (10) were rescaled from –5 to 5, multiplied by the shares of each response category, and then summed to arrive at each aggregate coun-
try score. Total refers to the weighted aggregate of countries with data for that year. Poststratification weights were applied in the aggregation at
the country level; in addition, population weights were applied for the aggregated total. Data were unavailable for Greece, Italy, and Luxembourg
in 2014 and for Estonia and Lithuania in 2002.

      Individual characteristics, such as education, also                        Information can change attitudes toward migration
      seem to matter
                                                                                 The 2013 Transatlantic Trends Survey provides evi-
      People with a higher level of education are more                           dence that the public overestimates the number
      likely to favor migration. The role of other factors,                      of immigrants by wide margins; the 2014 and 2015
      such as age and gender, varies according to the                            IPSOS Mori surveys corroborate these results. The
      context (OECD 2010). According to some surveys,                            2010 and 2014 Transatlantic Trends Surveys show
      such as the European Social Survey, people over                            that people who were given accurate immigration
      65 tend to have more negative attitudes toward                             statistics beforehand were significantly less likely to
      immigration. This result could reflect generational                        say there were “too many” immigrants in the coun-
      differences rather than people becoming more                               try (German Marshall Fund 2014). Besides informa-

                                               Perceptions of current migration policies are also negative. In most countries,
                                           the majority of survey respondents do not approve their government’s handling
                                           of immigration (German Marshall Fund 2014). In all 12 ECA countries, a majority
                                           of people surveyed in 2007 thought that their country should restrict and control
                                           the entry of migrants more than it did (Pew Research Center 2007). In the spring
                                           of 2017, about 90 percent of respondents in the European Union thought that ad-
                                           ditional measures should be taken to fight irregular migration (European Com-
                                           mission 2017). In all ECA countries participating in the International Social Sur-
                                           vey Program, a majority of respondents favored stronger measures to exclude
                                           illegal immigrants. In 2013 more than 40 percent of respondents in Russia agreed
                                           that all migrants—legal and illegal—and their children should be deported. Only
                                           18 percent agreed that all migrants and their children should be granted resi-
                                           dency rights where they want to live (Alexseev 2015).


                                           Refugee flows are not unprecedented and represent a
                                           small share of total migration
                                           The stock of refugees in ECA in 2016 was somewhat higher than in 1993, and the
                                           composition had changed significantly. In 1993 the top five origin countries of
                                           refugees in ECA were other ECA countries; in 2016 Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq
                                           were the major origin countries of refugees and asylum seekers (Figure 2.4).
                                              Refugees and asylum seekers account for only a small share of the total num-
                                           ber of migrants in ECA, except in Turkey, where almost all migrants are refugees.
                                           Indeed, the share of refugees in the total stock of migrants fell sharply in most of
                                           the top 10 ECA country hosts between 1993 and 2016. For example, refugees
                                           made up 19 percent of the stock of migrants in Germany in 1993 and 10.5 percent
                                           in 2016 (with asylum seekers included only in the latter year). Overall, refugees

and asylum seekers made up 7.8 percent of the total number of migrants in the
ECA region in 2016.3
    The sudden, large rise in the inflow of refugees and asylum seekers is likely to
be temporary. Irregular border crossings into the European Union increased
sharply in 2015 to 1.8 million but decreased to 511,000 in 2016 and seemed to
decline further in 2017.4 Many of these people will not be granted refugee status.
Asylum rejection rates vary widely by country of origin but averaged about 40
percent in 2016 (Figure 2.5). Return rates of refugees vary greatly and tend to be
lower than those of other migrants, but some of the people granted refugee or
subsidiary protection status are likely to return home or move onward once the
situation in their country of origin improves. The number of refugees in the ECA
region from the former Yugoslavia (mainly Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croa-
tia), for example, dropped from 1.3 million in 1996 (after the Dayton Peace Agree-
ment was signed, in December 1995) to 932,000 in 1998 and 311,000 by 2006 (au-
thor’s calculations based on UNHCR data).



Migration has long helped Europeans respond to
economic and political challenges

Cross-border labor mobility in ECA is not
unprecedented and has helped reduce poverty
During the last few decades, workers in ECA took advantage of employment op-
portunities across borders arising from regional economic integration. The com-
mon market provided the opportunity to connect workers in new EU member
states with demand for services in Western Europe. High oil prices, and subse-
quently heavy domestic demand in Russia, created opportunities for workers in
surrounding countries.

               Movement of workers across borders is not a recent phenomenon. Emigration
           has long been a way to escape economic hardship, and immigration has been one
           of the mechanisms to fuel economic growth. The ECA region also has a history of
           relocation of large numbers of people before and after conflicts.
               Emigration from ECA during the age of mass migration was a response to
           severe economic difficulties. More than 40 million people emigrated from Europe
           to the New World between 1850 and 1913, about two-thirds of them to the United
           States; Canada, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, and Cuba were also large recipients.
           Initially, famine, revolution and persecution in Europe drove emigration. Later
           waves of emigrants reflected rising fertility and declines in infant mortality,
           which created a large cohort of young, largely single potential emigrants, as well
           as large differences in workers’ living standards between Europe and much of the
           New World. Technological progress, particularly the advent of the steamship,
           also facilitated emigration. The massive outflow of workers lifted the wages of
           workers who remained, resulting in a convergence between real wages in the
           New and Old Worlds, albeit at rates that varied across countries (Hatton and Wil-
           liamson 1992; Chiswick and Hatton 2003).
               Migration in Russia supported its overland expansion to the east and south.
           Russian peasants settled on lands formerly controlled by Turkic nomads in the
           mid-16th century (Brubaker 1995). Other ethnic groups allied with the Russian
           Empire, such as the Cossacks, also joined this process of migration, settling new
           lands. The process of out-migration of people from Russia from a core toward an
           expanding periphery continued into the post-war Soviet Union, which had
           ethno-demographic impacts in Estonia, Latvia, and Kazakhstan.


           Large population movements accompanied the
           reorganizations of states in ECA over the past century
           The long decline of the Ottoman Empire led to the rise of several national states
           on its former territories, resulting in large-scale restructuring of populations. Mil-
           lions of people were displaced from Bulgaria, Macedonia, Thrace, and western
           Anatolia (between about 1875 and 1924). The outmigration of Turks, especially
           from Bulgaria, continued for decades, up to the 1989 migration of 370,000 Bulgar-
           ian Turks to Turkey (Brubaker 1995).
              Following World War II, about 4.7 million displaced persons and prisoners of
           wars were repatriated (sometimes against their will) from Germany to Eastern
           Europe and the Soviet Union. Under fear or duress, another 12 million ethnic
           Germans moved from eastern parts of the former Reich, German occupied areas,
           and countries previously allied with Germany. The new international boundaries
           decided at Yalta and Potsdam and other adjustments of territory resulted in fur-
           ther displacement. The sum of all these movements of 1945–50 is estimated at
           more than 20 million.
              The period from 1950 to 1992 saw the movement of about 14 million people,
           largely out of the eastern parts of ECA, including continued ethnic migration
           (about 75 percent), refugees from repression under regimes behind the Iron Cur-
           tain (about 10 percent), and economically oriented migrants (less than 15 percent)
           (Fassmann and Munz 1994).
Chapter 2: Migration and Mobility in Europe and Central Asia	                           ●  29



Migration helped accommodate the desire for ethnic
reunification following the collapse of the Soviet Union
Besides the 25 million Russians in the successor states, people of other ethnic
groups had social and economic links with states other than the one in which
they found themselves after the divisions came into effect. (Net outflows of Rus-
sians from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Moldova, and other Cen-
tral Asian republics took place even before the demise of the Soviet Union
[Brubaker 1995], but they would have been considered internal migration.) From
1959 to 1974, average annual out-migration from Russia to the other Soviet re-
publics was about 1.1 per thousand. Between 1975 and 1992, there was in-migra-
tion of about the same rate to Russia; it increased to 5.5 per thousand in 1994.
Return migration of ethnic Russians from former Soviet republics was responsi-
ble for about half the migrants entering Russia between 1993 and 1995, who set-
tled in 17 southern border oblasts (Heleniak 1997). Despite the initial political re-
alignments and ramifications of separate states, linguistic commonalities, family
and cultural ties, and economic imperatives ensured that the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) continues to have strong migration interlinkages.
   Migration helped support European economies in the postwar era. Conver-
gence in wages and living standards reduced European emigration to North
America and Oceania from about 400,000 a year in the early 1950s to less than
100,000 a year in the early 1990s. Europe became a net immigration region, as
large numbers of workers came to Western Europe (particularly through the Ger-
man guest worker program) to meet the increasing demand for labor in the re-
gion. Immigrant inflows into Europe from developing Asia, then Africa, and then
from the rest of the world increased (Chiswick and Hatton 2003). There have been
periodic ebbs in these flows, driven by economic changes, such as reduced labor
absorption capacity in the mid-1970s following the oil price shock of 1973, and
resulting policy changes (Fassmann and Munz 1992). But the overall trend of
Europe as a migrant destination for migrants from poorer countries, accompa-
nied by greater intra-European migration, persists.



Migration patterns in ECA are likely to change

Migration is likely to remain a critical element of an
economically vibrant ECA
Differences in income and unemployment rates, as well as demand for skilled
labor from the region’s economic powerhouses, will remain key drivers of volun-
tary migration—and deep regional economic integration will intensify migration
flows. Migration will thus continue to play an important role in the economic and
social development of the region.


Technology has reshaped migration patterns
The nature and composition of international migration in the region is changing,
as a result of technological advancement and the global integration of product

                                              and labor markets. Technology is boosting the integration of labor markets and
                                              increasing demand for high-skilled workers. Improvements in transport and
                                              communications have greatly increased the integration of labor markets, in part
                                              through the rise of global value chains, and general technological improvements
                                              have intensified competition for high-skilled workers. Workers everywhere are
                                              also increasingly in direct competition with workers from the rest of the world.
                                                  The Internet has lowered the cost of offshoring, as Internet-based platforms
                                              connect workers and employers across the world. ECA countries participate sig-
                                              nificantly in online digital labor platforms: Russia and Ukraine are the fifth- and
                                              sixth-largest suppliers, respectively, of contract labor to the U.S. market, and
                                              Ukraine had the third-largest cumulative online worker wage bill through 2014
                                              (Horton, Kerr, and Stanton 2017). It is easier to facilitate trade in goods and ser-
                                              vices than to obtain labor inputs by attracting and hosting individuals near the
                                              location of work. Thus, labor market integration does not necessarily lead di-
                                              rectly to more migration. It can first lead to more services trade.
                                                  However, integration of labor markets and production chains will boost cross-
                                              border connectivity in many dimensions, which may indirectly lead to more mi-
                                              gration. In general, technological advancement is complementary to global
                                              movements of skilled workers (Kerr et al. 2016). Indeed, the level of high-skilled
                                              migration to ECA/OECD countries increased more than that of less skilled types
                                              of migration during 2000–10 (Figure 2.6). ECA countries are trying to increase the
                                              number of high-skilled immigrants (Figure 2.7). It is the broader rise in connec-
                                              tivity, rather than direct migration, that intensifies competition for high-quality
                                              jobs. Competition occurs almost irrespective of where competing workers are
                                              located. Indeed, empirical evidence suggests that migration has only a small and
                                              temporary impact on average domestic workers’ wages and employment (see,

Note: Bars represent the share of country official responses to regional or country total that indicate the government’s policy to lower, maintain, or
raise the level of immigration of high-skilled workers into the country. Regions include all ECA countries (Table E.1) except Kosovo (part of the
Western Balkans) for both years and Denmark, Finland, and Sweden (all part of EU-15) for 2005.



of increased connectivity depend on the flexibility of labor markets and the com-
plementarity between the skills of native-born workers and migrants. Among the
people who lose out are often migrants who arrived previously.


Greater labor mobility for high-skilled labor has
occurred in tandem with the globalization of education
Globalization of education reflects the integration of labor markets for high-
skilled workers across borders. Greater global integration and rising demand for
skilled workers may reduce their ties to a location or national identity and in-
crease their global perspectives and connections. The duration of skilled migra-
tion is therefore likely to decline, and circular migration (as opposed to one-way
and long-term movement) is likely to increase. The increasing globalization of
education is supportive of this trend (Box 2.3). Given these trends in global labor
markets, individuals, employers, and countries may be more successful if they
can find out how best to navigate these new, more integrated global labor mar-
kets, taking into account their own regulatory constraints (Kerr et al. 2016).
   Technological change is increasing the share of alternative work arrange-
ments, which may be affecting migration patterns. The share of temporary em-
ployment rose between 2002 and 2016 in most ECA subregions (Figure 2.8), more
than two-thirds of OECD host countries for which migration data are available
witnessed a rise in the share of temporary migration between 2000 and 2010 (Fig-
ure 2.9), and countries with larger shares of temporary employment tended to have
larger shares of temporary immigration (Figure 2.10).5 These trends are likely to
contribute to the rise in the importance of temporary and circular migration.

   New developments are a challenge for immigration countries, emigration
countries, and migrant families. But successful adjustment toward more inte-
grated labor markets will unlock new growth potential. This adjustment will also
ultimately result in circular migration, as it becomes increasingly feasible and
attractive to return or stay connected to the country of origin.


Migrants have higher unemployment and poverty rates
and lower rates of tertiary education than the native-
born population
    The integration of migrants into the society of the host country is key to maxi-
mizing the gains from international migration for both origin and host countries
(Eurostat 2017). Lack of economic integration can increase tension between im-
migrants and the native population in destination countries.
    In most countries in ECA, unemployment rates are higher among the foreign-
born than the native-born population (Figure 2.11); youth unemployment in
some countries is particularly high among immigrants. Tertiary education rates
are much lower among immigrants in most countries (Figure 2.12). On average
in the EU-28, unemployment rates are higher, employment rates are lower, hous-

ing overcrowding is greater, housing costs represent a larger share of income,
mean income is lower, the severe material deprivation rate is greater, and the risk
of poverty is higher among immigrants from non-EU countries than among na-
tives (Table 2.1).
    The polarization between immigrants and the native population is consistent
with the finding that skills of migrants are often complementary to existing skills
in rich host countries. Bussolo, Koettl, and Sinnott (2015) show that people who
immigrated to Western Europe between 1990 and 2000 had complementary skills
to natives and contributed to increasing wages and reducing inequality among
natives. The effect of immigration also depends on the responses of natives. Cat-
taneo, Fiorio and Peri (2015) find that native workers in Europe are more likely
to move to occupations associated with higher skills and status when they are
faced with a large inflow of migrants into the labor market. Foged and Peri (2015)
find that in Denmark the presence of low-skilled migrants was associated with
upward wage and skill mobility of low-skilled native workers.
    The gap between the foreign-born and native-born population in terms of
material deprivation and the risk of poverty for children ranges widely across EU
countries (Figure 2.13). In most EU-15 countries, the foreign-born population has
higher rates of severe material deprivation and children at risk of poverty than
the native-born population. Elsewhere—in Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, and Po-
land—the foreign-born population seems to do better than the native-born popu-
lation. This pattern is atypical. In Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, and Portugal, the
at-risk-of-poverty rates of both EU and non-EU migrants are lower than the rates
of the local population. This apparent anomaly may reflect the fact that these
countries have relatively small migrant groups (Lelkes and Eszter 2010).6

                                 Policies have not been very supportive of efforts to
                                 integrate migrants
                                 The Migrant Integration Policy Index (MIPEX) indicates that the average ECA
                                 country has a lower degree of migrant integration for labor market mobility than
                                 other regions (Huddleston and others 2015).7 There has been little policy prog-
                                 ress toward higher integration over time, and the trend in the political participa-
                                 tion dimension is negative.
                                     Policy efforts to support the integration of migrants vary considerably across
                                 countries. More comprehensive programs are more common in the EU-15 coun-
                                 tries than in the rest of the region (Figure 2.14).
                                     According to the 2014 MIPEX index, policies were weak in Turkey and Central
                                 Europe. Western, Southern, and Northern Europe performed almost as well as
                                 the best performers outside ECA. Since 2015 the government of Turkey started
                                 implementing new migration legislation and is currently working on a national
                                 integration strategy. Progress is also apparent in Northern and Central Europe.
                                     Support for integration is even more important for refugees than for other
                                 migrants. Refugees typically must leave their homes with little notice; they have
                                 little time to prepare or choose their destination. As a result, they are less likely
                                 to find jobs that match their qualifications or have access to documents certifying
                                 their skills. Many refugees are also traumatized. Evidence from the 2008 EU La-
                                 bour Force Survey shows that refugees take 6 years to achieve the labor force

Note: Regions include all ECA countries (Table E.1) except Kosovo (part of the Western Balkans), for which data are not available. The bars represent the
share of country official responses to regional or country total that indicate the existence of policy or combination of policies aimed at integrating
immigrants into the host society. For instance, bar “1,3” in EU-13 means that two countries out of 13 (i.e., 15%) indicated that they provide migrants
with language skills training and protection against discrimination as measures for integration of immigrants in their community. Russia also
indicated having both of these programs for migrants.


Emigration has generated substantial benefits in ECA
origin countries
Massive emigration seems to have had positive effects on the average wages of
nonemigrants in ECA countries. Workers who are close substitutes were more
likely to have benefitted; people with complementary skills may not have bene-
fited or may even have lost (see Elsner 2013 for Lithuania; Bouton, Paul, and Tiong-
son 2011 for Moldova; and Dustmann, Frattini and Rosso 2015 for Poland).
    Remittances are large relative to GDP and an important source of foreign ex-
change in the region (Figure 2.15). They have a mildly positive impact on long-
term economic growth in emigration countries in ECA and a positive impact on
poverty reduction for the poorest households (Mansoor and Quillin 2006). They
can also improve access to international capital markets.
    There is considerable anecdotal evidence on diaspora investments and the
promotion of trade and knowledge transfer. The return of migrants to their home
country can support economic development, particularly when they bring capi-
tal and knowledge with them and the origin country provides the framework
conditions to help them make use of their skills and investments. The return of

Emigration can also create challenges
These benefits notwithstanding, over the medium to long term, reliance on remit-
tances may reduce the macroeconomic stability and competitiveness of ECA ori-
gin countries. Remittance inflows have a positive income effect on the consump-
tion of tradable and nontradable goods. For small open economies, the prices of
tradable goods are given, whereas growing aggregate demand may lead to
higher relative prices for nontradable goods and higher wages. Such effects may
discourage investment and labor movements into export-oriented or import-
competing sectors. As a result, the external sector of economies relying on remit-
tances may lose competitiveness. In addition, large remittance inflows may result
in real exchange rate appreciation, as well as higher reservation wages and lower
incentive to work. These effects may further exacerbate the decline in competi-
tiveness of the exporting sectors. In response to these challenges, authorities in
origin economies such as Tajikistan and the Kyrgyz Republic—the world’s top
remittance-dependent countries—could implement reforms that reduce the ri-
gidities in factor and output markets, such as financial sector deepening and
deregulation in labor and product markets (World Bank forthcoming b).
    High emigration rates in some ECA countries have exacerbated population
decline and aging and may have reduced the supply of skilled workers. After EU
enlargement, mainly young and skilled people left Central European countries,
most of them for Western Europe. Their emigration accelerated population de-
clines in some ECA countries (Bussolo, Koettl, and Sinnott 2015) and may have
slowed growth (IMF 2016). Emigration of high-skilled workers, particularly
workers specializing in critical public services that are predominantly supplied
domestically (health, education), may lower productivity and welfare. However,
the opportunity to emigrate can also increase incentives for human capital acqui-
sition in the country of origin. Ambrosini et al. (2015), for example, find a positive
effect of emigration on average schooling in Romania.
    International migration of parents can have both positive and negative effects
on the children they leave behind. Remittances can allow children to attend
school for longer, fund healthcare and better housing, and increase consumption.
The positive economic impact of migration and remittances, however, can be
outweighed by the negative effects of parental absence, which can be detrimental
to the social and psychological development of the children left behind (Antman
2013). Children may also need to spend more time helping in the household after
a family member leaves. Negative effects seem to be greater when both parents
leave and children are raised by their grandparents or other relatives. The effect
may also depend on the age and gender of the child. Antman (2011) finds that
families in Mexico spend more on girls than on boys when the (male) head of the
household migrates.
    Results on the educational impact in ECA countries are mixed. Giannelli and
Mangiavacchi (2010) find a negative impact of parental migration on long-term
school attendance of the children left behind in Albania. Griogrian and Melk-
onyan (2011) find that remittance-receiving households spend less on the educa-
tion of their children than households that do not receive remittances. Studies
conducted by UNICEF in Moldova (UNICEF 2008; UNICEF-CRIC 2008) reveal
44  ●  	                                    World Bank ECA Economic Update October 2017



           negative emotional and social impacts but no clear evidence of negative impacts
           on health, nutrition, and education. Gassmann and others (2013) find that migra-
           tion of a household member does not play a significant role in the well-being of
           the children in the household. Research on Romania indicates that the net impact
           of emigration on the education of children left behind is positive (Saurav 2017a).
           Allowing migrants to move freely back and forth would help them cater to the
           demands of their children left behind and improve their educational outcomes.
              Migration and remittances affect the employment of spouses left behind. Most
           research finds a negative impact on paid labor supply outside the home, because
           remittances raise the reservation wage of household members left behind and the
           emigration of a spouse increases the need for more unpaid work in the household
           (Antman 2013). Remittance-receiving households in Armenia reduce their hours
           of work (Grigorian and Melkonyan 2011). Estimates for Albania show that hav-
           ing a migrant abroad decreases the wife’s paid labor supply and increases unpaid
           work (Mendola and Carletto 2012). Remittances and migrant savings can also
           provide capital for starting a business. Women whose husbands returned are
           significantly more likely to engage in self-employment and less likely to supply
           unpaid work (Mendola and Carletto 2012). Results for Romania indicate that left-
           behind spouses whose husbands were absent for a year or more were six times
           more likely to engage in entrepreneurial activity than women in nonmigrant
           households (Saurav 2017b). Norms in the migrants’ countries of destination can
           affect gender norms at home, creating more or less gender equality and auton-
           omy of the women left behind, depending on the destination (Fleury 2016).
              Migration also affects elderly parents left behind. Parents may benefit from
           more financial support through remittances. Migrant children will not be able to
           personally help and care for them, however, and may not be able to visit them.
           This aspect of the impact of migration on families left behind is often overlooked;
           more research on the topic is needed, especially in ECA, given its aging popula-
           tion (Antman 2013). Governments in ECA need to build up social safety systems
           that take account of the fact that not all parents will be able to rely on their chil-
           dren for support in old-age.


           The refugee crisis presents opportunities for crafting a
           multilateral approach to migration
           Adverse public reaction to the influx of refugees and undocumented migrants
           may result in tightening restrictions on immigration, uncoordinated approaches,
           and increased social tensions between immigrant and native communities. The
           refugee crisis has led to the reintroduction of border controls in the European
           Union, which could impose economic costs of up to €58 billion a year (Auf dem
           Brinke 2016).8 The Dublin system, which defines which member state is respon-
           sible for the examination of an asylum application, has come under strain. The
           crisis may provide an opportunity for a needed overhaul of European asylum
           and migration policies. About 70 percent of the population in EU member states
           support a common European policy on migration (Eurobarometer 2017), with
           support more limited in some EU-13 countries. However, further integration is
Chapter 2: Migration and Mobility in Europe and Central Asia	                             ●  45



challenged by national interests. One example is the opposition of a number of
Central European countries to mandatory relocation quotas for refugees within
the European Union, even after the European Court of Justice confirmed the
scheme. Right-wing parties in ECA may benefit from the political polarization
the refugee crisis has helped foment (see the ECA Economic Update from No-
vember 2016).
    The refugee crisis is, however, an opportunity to adopt a more coordinated,
multilateral approach to migration. Global institutions and norms to assist refu-
gees were established in response to the vast number of displaced persons at the
end of World War II, which uprooted an estimated 11 million Europeans.9 By
contrast, migration has been dealt with largely on a bilateral basis, with receiving
countries playing the leading role. Multilateral agreements have been partial (the
multilateral Mode 4 of the General Agreement on Trade in Services [GATS], for
example, affects a very small subgroup of migrants) or ratified by only a small
number of states (an example is the 1990 International Convention on the Protec-
tion of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, which
has been ratified by only 49 states, mainly countries of origin of migrants).
    The crisis has heightened awareness of the need for a comprehensive and co-
operative approach to migration. The UN General Assembly’s Summit on Large
Movements of Refugees and Migrants adopted the New York Declaration in Sep-
tember 2016. It calls for the development of two global compacts, which are ex-
pected to be adopted in 2018: a global compact for safe, orderly, and regular mi-
gration and a global compact on refugees. The global compact on migration
would be the first intergovernmental agreement, prepared under the auspices of
the United Nations, to cover all dimensions of international migration in a com-
prehensive manner. Agreement still needs to be reached on several issues in the
ongoing negotiations.
    The goal of the compact should be to resolve the current policy challenges and
intergovernmental impasses. Although there is no clarity yet on the definition of
a global compact for migration, a working definition could be “an internationally
negotiated framework for governments and international organizations to har-
ness the benefits of migration while navigating its challenges” (World Bank
2017a). Both host and origin countries have several concerns, including the need
to (a) support safe, orderly, and regular migration that relieves pressures for un-
documented migration; (b) tackle the issue of job competition for native-born
workers in host countries; (c) address concerns about national identity while fa-
cilitating the integration of migrants in the host community; and (d) retain critical
skills in origin countries and address the needs of family left behind in origin
countries. Ahead of the UN international conference in 2018, the global commu-
nity needs to (a) identify the thematic priorities; (b) suggest an institutional archi-
tecture to support the compact by mapping the current institutional arrange-
ments, clarifying the missions of key organizations and how their work programs
and budget allocations are aligned with those missions; and (c) develop a norma-
tive framework or guidelines for governments and international organizations
building on existing global conventions, and regional and bilateral agreements
that address migration.10

           Conclusion

           Migration has played a key role in resolving economic and political problems in
           the ECA region for centuries. Maintaining supportive policies toward migration
           would make a critical contribution to prosperity in the region. Although dealing
           with the refugee crisis is understandably a central focus of national policy mak-
           ers, a broader, longer-term perspective is critical to reaping the gains from migra-
           tion. Measures to increase the integration of migrants in destination countries
           and greater support for families left behind in origin countries would improve
           equity and productivity. Increasing the flexibility of labor market institutions and
           improving skills would help promote employment; increasing the portability of
           benefits and improving income security could reduce fears over the economic
           impact of immigrants on native workers. Reaching international agreement on a
           multilateral framework for migration could enhance the benefits of migration for
           origin countries, destination countries, and migrants.

           Notes

           1.	 Respondents were asked to indicate whether each of the following was a “good thing,”
               a “bad thing,” or “it depends”: (a) immigrants living in this country, (b) an immigrant
               becoming your neighbor, and (c) an immigrant marrying one of your close relatives. See
               http://www.gallup.com/poll/216377/new-index-shows-least-accepting-countries-
               migrants.aspx?g_source=mn2-us.
           2.	 The survey defined Europe as the European Union, the Western Balkans, Russia, Belar-
               us, Moldova, Ukraine, Norway, and Switzerland.
           3.	 This estimate was calculated by dividing the refugee and asylum seeker stock in 2016 by
               the migrant stock in 2015, except for Turkey, for which the migrant stock for 2016 was
               estimated using the following formula: migrant stock 2015 plus refugee flow in 2016
               minus number of returnees in 2016. Data on asylum seekers are not available for years
               before 2000. Migrant stock data are available only for 1995 (not 1993) and 2015 (not 2016).
               Data on refugees and asylum seekers is from UNHCR, data on migrant stocks is from
               UNDESA.
           4.	 The number of “illegal border crossings” recorded by Frontex (the European Border and
               Coast Guard Agency) may differ from the number of people crossing the border, because
               some people cross several times. The number of border crossings also differs from the
               number of asylum applicants. Not everyone who enters illegally is recorded, not every-
               one who enters illegally requests asylum, and not everyone who requests asylum enters
               illegally (for example, Serbs do not require a visa to enter the European Union).
           5.	 Temporary migrants are defined as foreign-born residents who have been in the host
               country for less than five years. They could stay longer.
           6.	 If these countries have more stringent policies for low-skilled immigrants than the tradi-
               tional destination countries, the relatively strong position of foreign-born workers may
               reflect their higher qualifications. For instance, in 2016 Bulgaria relaxed work-permit
               rules for high-skilled non-EU workers; it maintains strict work permit requirements for
               other workers.
           7.	 For the definitions for MIPEX indicators, see http://www.mipex.eu/sites/default/files/
               downloads/Definitions_of_Who_Benefits_Outcome_and_Beneficiaries_Indicators.pdf.
           8.	 This figure includes costs related to trade and commuters (as a result of longer waiting
               times at the border) and actual border controls.
           9.	 The early 1950s saw the adoption of the 1951 Geneva Convention Relating to the Status
               of Refugees, a creation of the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refu-
               gees (UNHCR) to provide humanitarian protection for refugees, and the founding of the
               International Organization for Migration (IOM), with a mandate to identify resettlement
               countries and arrange transport. (The IOM was established in 1951 as the Provisional
               Intergovernmental Committee for the Movement of Migrants from Europe [PICMME].
               Its name went through a succession of changes.)
           10.	Analysis of the World Bank Group’s activities and consultations with partners and stake-
               holders suggest that it and other international financial institutions could contribute to
               the global migration agenda in four areas: (a) financing migration programs, (b) address-
               ing fundamental drivers of migration, (c) maximizing the benefits and managing the
               risks of migration in sending and receiving countries, and (d) providing knowledge for
               informed policy making and improving public perceptions (World Bank 2016).
