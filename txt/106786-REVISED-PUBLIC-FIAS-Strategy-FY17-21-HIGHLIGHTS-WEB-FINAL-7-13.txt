 The FIAS agenda for the next five years continues this progress
 while expanding into new fields, such as global value chains, and
 offering a wider array of advisory, technical, and financial options
 to clients.
THE FIAS FY17-21 STRATEGY
rests on three pillars designed to
help the private sector realize its
growth and development potential
within client countries


1}

3}      operationalizing programs to
        increase firm-level

 THE PILLARS ARE SUPPORTED BY FOUR PROGRAMMATIC THEMES

The FIAS Strategic Pillars:
Project Examples
 Pillar 1: IMPROVING BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
 In Kenya, FIAS-supported teams have implemented
 online services for business licensing in the Mombasa
                                                                     Pillar 2: Expanding Market Opportunities

 food safety work in the Europe and Central Asia
                                                                     path to growth.

 the Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, and Uzbekistan. The
 result has been millions in cost savings, new local
 and foreign investments, and improved links with the
 European market.




 Pillar 3: Increasing Firm-Level Competitiveness
 FIAS is supporting improvements in the sustainability and competitiveness of the seafood sector in Mauritania. The
 government has designated the Nouadhibou Free Zone (NFZ) as a core element of its national growth strategy. Nouadhibou,
 the country’s main fisheries center, holds 80 percent of the national market. Yet the sector’s competitiveness is suffering due
 to problems with firm productivity and resource use, resulting in fish product losses and high operational costs.

 Support for the sector combines several initiatives including a $47 million program involving the Bank Group’s Environment
 Global Practice and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) program, supporting sustainability of the fish stock; a T&C-GEF
 lending operation to develop trade infrastructure and enhance the competitiveness of the NFZ; and a FIAS-supported
 advisory services initiative which aims to integrate sustainability into the NFZ development strategy, establish a public-
 private dialogue platform, and generate clean-technology investments.
FIAS is managed by the World Bank
Group’s Trade & Competitiveness

ORGANIZATION OF IFC and the World
Bank. T&C has enriched its suite
of offerings and organized them

EVOLUTION OF FIAS IMPACT MEASUREMENT
FIAS has made significant advances in measuring
impact through considerable investment in measurement
tools and techniques in three areas:


1}                 Refining the log frame of standard indicators to better
                   articulate the expected theory of change;




2}                 Developing and tracking impact indicators
                   as committed to in the FIAS strategy; and




3}                 Developing an impact program to fill critical
                   knowledge gaps and learn from operational experience.
