After reaching $100/bbl in early 2011 for the first time
since the 2008 financial crisis, crude oil prices have fluc-
tuated within a remarkably tight band around $105/bbl,
which is also within OPEC’s “desired range” (figure 3). In
fact, 2011-13 has been one of the least volatile 3-year peri-
ods of the recent history of the oil market. This pattern
continued in the 2014Q1, when crude oil price averaged
$103.7/bbl, 0.8 percent lower than 2013Q4.

Fluctuations in oil prices have been driven mainly by geo-
political concerns and output disruptions (Libya, Nige-
ria) on the supply side, and changing developing-country

ent Russian military intervention in Crimea, they retreated                          elsewhere
subsequently since no physical disruptions took place
in the oil supplies. Russia, world’s largest oil producer,
accounts for 12 percent of global oil production, thus any
supply disruption either on the export side, in transit due
to a conflict, or on the import side could have led to a
significant price spike. On the positive side, the Novem-
ber 2013 interim deal with Iran led to increased Iranian
crude production (up 4 percent in 2014Q1), the first sig-
nificant quarterly gain in years; exports increased as well.
Iraq’s production surged in the 2014Q1 as long-awaited
upgrades in the southern export terminals were brought
on-line. The Libyan government has started negotiations
with the rebels in the east who control the four export
terminals, but the results have been limited so far.                Source: World Bank, International Energy Agency.

Supply disruptions in the Middle East have been counter-
balanced almost barrel for barrel by rapid expansion of
unconventional oil production in North America (figure
4). These developments have kept the global oil market
broadly in balance and prices in the $100-110/bbl range
for the last three years. The Saudi government—the bal-
ancing producer with the largest spare capacity—has
promised to keep the global market well supplied within
that range, which it considers to be a fair price.

an additional 1.3 mb/d during 2013, mainly reflecting ear-

Supply shortfalls in Iran, Libya and Nigeria during 2014Q1          Figure 7          OPEC spare capacity and OECD inventory
(estimated at 2.6 mb/d) were balanced by increases in
Iraqi and Saudi output, thus resulting in a small increase
in OPEC output— it averaged 36.5 mb/d in 2014Q1, up
from 36.1 mb/d in the previous quarter. For 2013 as a
whole, OPEC’s output declined by 0.7 mb/d. Yet, this
production level is still 10 mb/d higher than in 2002Q2,
OPEC’s lowest producing quarter in recent history.

OPEC’s spare production capacity that began declining in
early 2010 has been reversed since 2012Q1 to reach almost
5 mb/d in 2013Q4, the highest since 2011Q1, before eas-

over the past few years where OECD demand has fallen
by 4.5 mb/d, or 9 percent, from its 2005Q1 peak of 51

Outlook and Risks
Nominal oil prices are expected to average $103/bbl
during 2014 (down from $104/bbl in 2013) and decline                 Source: International Energy Agency.
to $99/bbl in 2015. In the longer term, real prices are
expected to fall due to growing supplies of unconven-
tional oil, efficiency gains, and (less so) substitution away        Figure 10         Energy prices
from oil. The key assumption underpinning these projec-
tions reflects the upper-end cost of developing additional
oil capacity from Canadian oil sands, currently estimated
at $80/bbl in constant 2014 dollars.

World demand for crude oil is expected to grow at less
than 1.5 percent annually over the projection period, with
all the growth coming from non-OECD countries, as has
been the case in recent years (figure 8). Consumption
growth in OECD economies will continue to be subdued
by slow economic growth and efficiency improvements
in vehicle transport induced by high prices—including
a switch to hybrid, natural gas, and electrically powered
transport. Pressure to reduce emissions due to environ-
mental concerns is expected to dampen demand growth                  Source: World Bank.
at the global level as well.

On the supply side, non-OPEC oil production is expected              Figure 11         Natural gas prices
to continue its upward climb, as high prices have prompted
increased use of innovative exploration techniques
(including deep-water offshore drilling and extraction of
shale liquids) and the implementation of new extractive
technologies to increase the output from existing wells.

Last, prices of natural gas (in the U.S.) and coal are
expected to remain low relative to crude oil and European
and Japanese natural gas prices as has been the case during
the past few years (figures 10 & 11). Some convergence
in prices may take place but its speed (which is expected
to be slow) will depend on several factors, including the
development of unconventional oil supplies outside the
U.S., the construction of LNG export facilities and gas
pipelines, relocation of energy intensive industries to the          Source: World Bank.

Apart from the coffee-induced rally in the beverage price
index, agricultural prices did not move much in 2014Q1.
The overall agricultural price index is up 1.8 percent for the
quarter but 4.3 percent lower than a year ago. Among key
sub-indices, grains are up less than 1 percent for the quar-
ter (almost 25 percent lower than a year ago). Likewise,
edible oils & meals and other food items changed very
little (figure 16). The large surprise was coffee (Arabica),
which gained more than 60 percent in just two months,
pushing the beverage price index to a 2.5 year high.

are still 31 percent lower than a year ago. Wheat prices
gained ground as well to average $324/ton in March 2014,
the highest since October 2013. The recovery in maize                 Figure 17         Grains stock-to-use ratios
and wheat prices has been aided by adverse weather in
the U.S. and (less so) in South America. Concerns that the
Ukraine-Russia conflict may disrupt trade in maize and
wheat (and hence trigger a price spike) did not materi-
alize—these countries account for 12 of global trade in
these two markets.

Despite the uptick in prices, the global grain market
appears to be well supplied. In its April 2014 update, the
U.S. Department of Agriculture placed the global maize
production estimate at 974 million tons, up from 867
million tons in 2012/13, in turn increasing the S/U ratio
from 15.4 to 16.6 percent. Similarly, the global wheat pro-
duction estimate for 2013/14 stands at 713 million tons,
increasing the S/U ratio from 25.9 to 26.5 percent.                   Source: U.S. Department of Agriculture. (April 2014 update)

Rice prices averaged $422/ton in March 2014, the lowest
since February 2008. The U.S. Department of Agriculture             Figure 18        Grain prices
assessment puts the global rice production at 476 million
tons, almost 4 million tons above last season’s record. The
S/U ratio for rice is expected to reach 23.4 percent in
2013/14, the highest since 2002/03. In addition to well-
supplied conditions, the rice market has been subjected
to the considerable stockpiling by the Thai government.
Should Thailand release large amounts of stocks, rice
prices may come under downward pressure.

The edible oil & meal price index moved slightly upwards,
up 1 percent since 2013Q4 and 2 percent higher than a
year ago (figure 19). Although little changes occurred in
the three most important components of the index (soy-
beans, soybean oil, and palm oil), some minor oils moved
considerably, palm kernel oil up 21 percent and ground-             Source: World Bank.
nut oil down 15 percent since 2013Q4. However, soy-
bean prices declined considerably in March (15 percent
down from February) following an upbeat report by the               Figure 19        Edible oil prices
U.S. Department of Agriculture that, based on planting
intentions, soybean area in the U.S. will hit a record high.
Drought concerns in South America have not impacted
the soybean complex much.

The beverage price index was the big mover of the quar-
ter, 12 percent up since 2013Q4 and 14 percent higher
than a year ago, mostly aided by a rally in coffee (Arabica)
prices, which increased more than 60 percent in just two
months (figure 20). Because of adverse weather in Brazil,
the global coffee market is expected to experience a deficit
of 5 million bags, from an expected surplus of 1 million
bags. Robusta and cocoa prices gained ground as well, up
15 and 6.5 percent in 2014Q1.
                                                                    Source: World Bank.
Although raw material prices did not change much in
2014Q1 (2.3 percent lower than a year ago), individual
prices followed different paths (figure 21). Cotton prices          Figure 20        Beverage prices
are up 8 percent in the quarter and 5 percent higher than
a year ago, mainly in response to the massive purchases
by China, mostly for stockpiling purposes—currently
China accounts for almost 60 percent of global cotton
stocks, pushing the S/U ratio to 86 percent, the highest
of the sector’s history. On the contrary, natural rubber
prices have weakened considerable, down 11 percent
since 2013Q4 and almost 30 percent lower than a year ago
on ample supplies and weakening demand, especially by
China—most natural rubber goes for tire manufacturing.

Outlook and Risks

food items are not expected to change much. The larg-
est declines among food commodities will be in the grain              Figure 21         Raw material prices
group with maize and rice down 13.3 and 15 percent,
respectively (wheat prices will remain virtually unchanged).
While edible oils & meals will change little at the aggre-
gate, palm oil and soybeans are expected to increase 3.9
and 2.2 percent while soybean oil and soybean meal will
decline about 2.5 percent each. Likewise, raw material
prices are not expected to change much at the aggregate
but a large decline in natural rubber (-14 percent) will be
balanced by moderate increases in Logs (Cameroon) and
Sawnwood (Malaysia).

A number of assumptions (along with associated risks)
underpin this outlook. They include crop conditions,
energy prices, and trade policies on the supply side and
biofuels along with macroeconomic conditions on the                   Source: World Bank.
demand side. On crop conditions, it is assumed that the
remaining of the 2013/14 and the 2014/15 season’s
outlook will be along normal trends. In its April 2014                Figure 22         Biofuels production
update, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated
the 2013/14 crop season’s grain supplies (production plus
stocks of maize, wheat, and rice) at 2.57 billion tons, up
5 percent from last season. Such supplies are adequate to
bring stocks to comfortable levels. Furthermore, given
that the season is well advanced, the probability of adverse
weather impacting the outlook is very low. However, as
noted earlier, next season may be impacted by El Nino.
Although to is too early to assess, if the 2014/15 season
becomes an El Nino year, crops in the Southern Hemi-
sphere are likely to be affected, including edible oils, oil-
seeds, and tropical commodities.

The baseline forecast also assumes that oil price will
remain elevated at $103/bbl in 2014 declining to $99/bbl              Source: International Energy Agency, BP.
in 2015. However, fertilizer prices are expected to decline
considerably, almost 11 percent in 2014 and an additional
2 percent in 2015. Given agriculture’s high energy inten-             Figure 23         Assets under management
sity, the easing of fertilizer prices will relieve some of the
input price pressure that the sector has been subjected the
past decade. Furthermore, given that oil price risks are
on the downside, risks emanating from energy prices are
lower compared to last year’s assessment.

Other risks, including biofuels, trade policies, and invest-
ment fund activity, pose less of a threat now than they
used to. With the exception of 2013 when biofuel produc-
tion posted a moderate increase, production changed only
modestly during the past three years (figure 22). Based on
the experience of the past few years, if the baseline out-
look materializes, policy actions are unlikely and, if they
take place, will be isolated with only a limited impact. Last,
investment fund activity, which was rising until two years            Source: BarkleyHedge.
ago appears to have stabilized (figure 23).
