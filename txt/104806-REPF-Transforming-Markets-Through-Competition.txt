                            Message from the
                            Senior Director
                            at The World Bank Group

  This publication showcases the results of the 2014–2015 Competition Advocacy Contest, the result of a fruitful collaboration between the
  World Bank Group’s Trade & Competitiveness Global Practice and the International Competition Network (ICN). The awardees for this,
  the second round of the contest, have been recognized under the theme of “inclusive growth for shared prosperity.” The winning entries
  submitted by competition authorities in countries around the world differ, but they all touch upon a unifying theme. It is that successful
  experiences in competition advocacy go beyond the mission profile or legal mandate of a single competition authority; the best results come
  from an integrated and coordinated strategy to infuse competition principles in all government interventions in the economy.

  The initiative got its start when the Bank Group’s Competition Policy practice launched a Global Competition Advocacy Contest to formally
  recognize countries for their efforts in conducting competition advocacy. Competition authorities play a key role in shaping market outcomes
  and increasing the effectiveness of broader public policies aimed at promoting robust competition in various business sectors. Competition
  authorities do more than enforce laws against anti-competitive practices. They also advocate against public and private sector actions that
  tolerate or even promote such practices. When government interventions facilitate cartels, favor specific firms, or allow incumbent firms
  to control markets, or where professional associations assist in coordination among competitors, competition authorities can identify and
  advise on the downsides of such policies and present options that strengthen competition.

  Advocacy initiatives lay the foundation for a pro-competition vision of Central Banks, Ministries and Sector Regulators. In Israel, a
  focused study on a financial services segment led the central bank and cabinet to implement more effective measures to increase sector
  performance. In Mexico, analysis of the effects on competition of draft laws and regulations gradually trained ministries and regulators to
  consider effects of policies on markets. Through advocacy in Moldova, public officials now more consistently embed non-discrimination
  criteria in public aids. In El Salvador, working with limited resources, the government was able to generate substantial citizen engagement in
  competition policy.

  As past contest winners have demonstrated, successful competition advocacy delivers tangible economic benefits. Preventing an
  association of healthcare providers in Kenya from increasing charges saved consumers around $1.7 million a year. Prices for domestic
  flights came down by 70 percent in Indonesia following removal of restrictive air fare regulation. Twenty-two percent more Colombians use
  mobile internet since a 4G spectrum auction allowed for entry of additional operators. Mexican authorities were able to spend $185 million
  more on public health thanks to changes in the procurement process that improved competition conditions.

  This publication is intended to be useful as well as celebratory. It shares broader lessons-learned on effective advocacy tools and strategies,
  and discusses innovative ways of adapting to new competition challenges. Whether reacting to disruptive technologies, focusing on subnational
  entities, or combining advocacy with enforcement measures, competition advocacy can be the seed to better understanding of market features
  and competition dynamics all across the government and generates momentum for a comprehensive national competition policy.

  The Competition Advocacy Contest has become a public good for sharing knowledge and practical experience among countries. As the
  Bank Group continues its collaboration with the ICN, I am confident that the emerging success will positively influence public policymaking
  for the benefit of consumers and businesses everywhere.

                              of the International
                              Competition Network

    Competition advocacy is nowadays considered, together with enforcement, a core business of an antitrust authority and plays a
    key role in promoting a competitive environment, to the benefit of consumers and the economy overall.

    This is why competition agencies around the world devote constant efforts to build public support for competitive markets and
    address disproportionate or unnecessary public restrictions that may undermine the benefits of competition, by providing inputs to
    government and legislators on proposed or existing legislation, regulations, or policies. In many jurisdictions, competition advocacy
    appears to be the only way to address the challenges of their negative economic climate and foster growth.

    Recognizing its crucial importance, the International Competition Network (ICN) — a project-oriented, consensus-based, virtual
    network of antitrust agencies – focused on competition advocacy since its foundation in 2001, when it was formed by officials
    of 14 jurisdictions. Today, with more than 130 member jurisdictions, ICN provides for competition authorities a platform to share
    their experiences, the advocacy tools and strategies used in various contexts, for example during an economic recession, or a
    liberalization process, or in the contest of emerging economies.

    It is no surprise that as ICN chair I was delighted by the invitation of the World Bank Group to jointly launch a Competition
    Advocacy Contest in 2014/15 after the successful first round of the Advocacy Contest carried out by the World Bank in 2013/14.
    The idea of a contest to showcase successful advocacy stories was also well received within ICN as an innovative way to share
    experiences and learn from each other.

    The general theme of the 2014/15 Contest, “Inclusive growth for shared prosperity,” reflects the concerns of the wide membership
    of these two international organizations and the winning stories proved to be so inspiring that the Advocacy Working Group of ICN
    decided to present them in more detail to its members in an ICN teleseminar in November 2015. The reader will be also impressed
    by the stories and actions of the winning agencies reported in this publication.

    Building on this fruitful experience, the joint work proceeds with the organization of the 2015/16 edition of the Contest which is
    focused on “How to Build a Culture of Competition for Private Sector Development and Economic Growth.” I am confident that the
    close cooperation between ICN and World Bank will entail further opportunities for joint initiatives in the near future. The best is yet
    to come.

  Milestones
  Early 2013:	       Allegations of anti-competitive trade practices
                     by certain warehouse administrators are
                     brought to the attention of the Commission by
                     a business association in Northern region of
                     Malawi.

  January 2013:	     A notice of investigation is issued by the
                     Commission.

  March 2013:	       A meeting is held between the Commission and
                     the warehouse administrators and Illovo Sugar
                     Ltd.

  April 2013:	       The CFTC Board determines that warehouse
                     administrators had engaged in anti-competitive
                     trade practices contrary to the Competition and
                     Fair Trading Act and are ordered to cease and
                     desist from the practice.

  May 2013:	         Illovo and the warehouse administrators
                     (SIMAMA) go to Court and obtain an injunction
                     stopping the Commission from enforcing the
                     Order it had issued. The injunction is granted
                     suspending the enforcement of orders of the
                     CFTC. An Appeals process commenced,
                     brought by both Illovo and the warehouse
                     administrators against the order itself. Later,
                     Illovo opts for an out of court settlement with the
                     Commission, but the warehouse administrators’
                     case proceeds to full trial. The courts rule in
                     favor of the Commission, agreeing that the
                     conduct and the warehouse management
                     system had resulted in anti-competitive effect.

  July 2014:	        A new system for the distribution of Illovo sugar
                     comes into effect.

     possible and thus help ensure that reconstruction contracts
     were efficiently managed and fulfilled.

     Through discussions and meetings with government
     departments, construction trade associations and individual
     construction and insurance companies, the NZCC con-
     cluded that the most effective advocacy tool would be an
     accessible user friendly guide tailored to suppliers of goods
     and services in the construction sector. This included trades
     people, building professionals and builders’ merchants.
     The resultant “one-stop shop” microsite is a straightforward
     guide to the three pieces of legislation the Commerce
     Commission enforces: the Commerce, Fair Trading, Credit
     Contracts and Consumer Finance Acts.

     So as to cater to the different interests and attention-spans
     of users, guidance on the website was broken down into
     several layers of detail, moving from high-level summaries
     at the first level and progressively more detailed information
     at the second and third levels. The website incorporated
     feedback from test-users to make sure it was easily
     navigable, successfully used everyday language to explain
     difficult legal concepts and was user–friendly in layout
     and design. (Later in 2014 it was selected as a finalist in a
     national Plain English competition.)The website was rolled
     out in May 2014 at two separate launch events and was
     promoted through workshops, webinars, industry newslet-
     ters, publications and stories.

  marizes the key lessons: “The most important aspects contributing
  to the success of this advocacy tool was the fact that we already
  had existing relationships with the construction sector from which
  we could leverage. This was vital in helping us to understand what
  kind of information this audience needed, and in what format, in
  order to raise awareness and compliance. It was also a major
  factor in helping us to successfully disseminate the website to the
  target audience after it was launched. We did this by using our
  industry contacts with whom we had already built up good relation-
  ships and goodwill.”
