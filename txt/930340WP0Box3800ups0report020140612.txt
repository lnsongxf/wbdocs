capital markets) in developing countries could be attributed
to three reasons. First, identifying which companies are
viable investment opportunities is cumbersome and
costly. Second, these companies typically need, not
just growth capital, but technical assistance and
capacity building to manage high growth efficiently and
sustainably. Thus, transaction costs for private investors,
relative to the return on their modest investments, are too
high1. Third, developing countries vary widely with respect
to their size, stages of development, education, skill levels
of workforce and infrastructure. Therefore, HI start-ups in
Vietnam, Cambodia and Nepal face unique challenges
in their local contexts as they grow and scale their ventures.

 For instance, in Vietnam transaction costs on investments in HI start-ups can on average go up to $40,000. These costs will vary based
on investor profile and jurisdiction, and the complexity of the investment (including extent of due diligence, investment certificate, and
holding investment structure).                                                                                                               9

     Demand-side barriers include:

     •• HI start-ups’ (and other SMEs) tendency to rely heavily on
        informal funding sources (such as family) to fund
        businesses rather than explore formal funding sources.

     •• Lack of financial literacy, including complicated and
        non-tailored application procedures, that generally deters
        HI start-ups from exploring formal funding.

     •• Lack of funding/investment process awareness
        leading to poor presentations of business cases by HI
        start-ups. This ultimately has an adverse effect on access
        to finance. For instance, HI start-ups may not convey
        adequate information on their market as part of their
        business case. This could be due to a lack of access to
        market intelligence, which in turn leads to not properly
        identifying the right market segment(s) and wrongly
        estimating market potential.

     •• Entrepreneurs in developing countries historically
        prefer to maintain control over their businesses. They
        therefore tend to avoid financing that can lead to equity
        dilution and loss of control.

    Article 6.12(a) of the [aw on Securities of Vietnam dated 29 June 2006 as amended on 24 November 2010 (the “Securities Law”)
6
 It is noted that only JSCs not LLCs have “shares” per se. LLCs have chunks of “charter capital” to be contributed. “Shares” is used here
throughout for consistency and to refer to a discrete amount of paid-in capital that a person (a “shareholder” in the case of a JSC and a
“member” in the case of an LLC) has paid to a company. “Shareholder” is used here for both purposes.
7
    NOTE: this report does not touch on share acquisition or share subscription in public companies.
8
 Similarly, all other forms of seed investment such as angle investors, company matching or crowd investment would ultimately result in
either share acquisition or share subscription in the investee company.
9
  Investors may purchase “treasury” shares of existing JSCs, which are “stock issued by a joint stock company [arguably both public and
non-public companies] and redeemed by that issuing company”. While Vietnamese law on securities sets out a number of conditions
on the sale and purchase of treasury stock of public companies (Article 39 of Decree 58 dated July 20, 2012), it is silent on the same in
relation to non-public companies. The better view is that the sale of treasury stock by a non-public company is treated the same as a
typical JSC share subscription in terms of general conditions and licensing process.

3. Vietnam Fieldwork Findings




 Classification    Views from investors and investee firms in Vietnam
 Finance           ••Investors agree that there is no shortage of capital for equity investments in the missing middle.
                     Investors say they have spare financial resources (‘dry powder’) to make investments but they are
                     unable to deploy capital due to the following reasons:

                    ººInvestments pitched to investors are of poor quality; the products are not strong enough and
                      entrepreneurs cannot differentiate themselves enough. Their differentiation strategy is generally
                      price competitiveness and better customer service.

                    ººEntrepreneurs do display innovation in their ideas and replicate offshore models in local markets
                      without properly understanding how and whether the particular business model will fit.

                    ººGenerally, entrepreneurs do not assess their markets properly and demonstrate how their ventures
                      can realistically capture a share of the market. A lack of market assessment, which is partly due to
                      a lack of access to market intelligence, negatively impacts credibility of the investment proposal.
                   ••Family and friends tend to be the main source of finance for pre-seed and seed funding stages.
                   ••Entrepreneurs would like to see more venture capital firms operating in Vietnam. There are only
                     three main VC firms servicing the local market: IDG Ventures Vietnam, DFJ VinaCapital, and
                     CyberAgent Ventures.
                   ••Entrepreneurs want more exposure to angel investors. An intermediary network/platform is needed
                     to link the two groups together while providing angel investors with the opportunity to invest in
                     vetted investment opportunities. In contrast, entrepreneurs easily get access to venture capital
                     firms, but this does not necessarily translate into investments due to the reasons mentioned above.
                   ••Entrepreneurs want more focus on two stages of financing: seed funding and later stage venture
                     capital funding ($5 million+, which cannot be serviced by local venture capital firms).
                   ••Younger entrepreneurs are more open to equity dilution compared to traditional entrepreneurs.
 Legal, business   ••The investment regime in Vietnam is not conducive to venture capital investment. Investment is
 and start-up        subject to red tape and is a costly procedure. For instance, since most venture capital investors
 infrastructure      operate via offshore investment vehicles, each investment requires an investment certificate, and
                     the fee for this can be costly. This has deterred foreign investors from entering the Vietnam market.
                     Some foreign investors choose to co-invest with existing venture capital fund managers already
                     operating in Vietnam and are familiar with the investment rules.
                   ••While physical infrastructure in Vietnam is good (for instance, (free) wi-fi access), the legal/ business
                     infrastructure needs to stimulate investments in HI start-ups. Respondents feel that the start-up
                     sector is not a high priority for the government and there are little or no government initiatives to
                     stimulate investments by improving the legal and regulatory framework. There is strong view that
                     a separate start-up regime that is not subject to the same regulatory/compliance regime as other
                     enterprises needs to be developed.
                   ••There is a need for more effective business incubators and accelerators that would help
                     entrepreneurs address the shortcomings mentioned above.
                   ••A matching funding mechanism to encourage new equity providers in the Vietnamese venture
                     capital market needs to be created. Development agencies and/or relevant government bodies
                     can provide financial support to new venture capital funds through co-contributions to newly
                     established funds. There are similar regimes in Singapore and Australia.
 Investment        ••Focus is needed on an investment-readiness program to ensure entrepreneurs make their venture
 readiness           investment-friendly before approaching investors.

       Entrepreneurial        ••Young entrepreneurs do not have appropriate business background (‘lack of business mind’), which
       skills                   has an impact on the management of the business. Investors prefer diversified teams where at least
                                one key person has a business background to ensure that the team can execute its idea and still be
                                well-equipped to handle financial aspects (such as cash flow monitoring/burn rate).
                              ••Educating entrepreneurs needs stronger focus. A mix of formal (entrepreneurship courses/subjects
                                at university level) and informal education packages should be developed.
       Mentoring              ••Mentoring is seen as vital for entrepreneurs to up-skill themselves and benefit from sounding
                                boards.

 Classification    Views from investors and investee firms in Cambodia
 Finance           ••Most investors agree that start-ups have specific needs in Cambodia, and most require small-sized
                     investments at the beginning. Cambodia does not have investment resources that cater to this size
                     (unless the focus is on social impact), and access to loans are restricted. As a result, start-ups that
                     need small amounts of funding to get started struggle to grow.
                   ••Sectors that have good growth potential are agribusiness, food and beverage, other consumer
                     products (such as health and beauty products), finance solutions (leasing), and logistics. While ICT is
                     a sector of interest, most investors consider the market is not mature enough to experience a tech
                     explosion (most foresee the advent of new technologies in about 4-5 years).
                   ••Cambodia can be a ‘closed shop’ with business arrangements based largely on personal
                     relationships and within close networks. This approach can be a challenge for foreign investors.
                   ••There is a disconnect between investors and entrepreneurs, which is due to a lack of visibility of
                     each to the other. More networking events are needed to facilitate connections between the two
                     groups and more (online) coverage through, say, Geeks in Cambodia can increase visibility of the
                     two groups.
                   ••Family and/or friends tend to be the main source of finance for pre-seed and seed funding stages
                     for local entrepreneurs. While there are local angel investors who support Cambodian start-ups,
                     finding start-ups is difficult if they do are not part of entrepreneur networks or introductions are
                     not made through mutually known intermediaries.
                   ••Entrepreneurs feel that foreign investors see the Cambodian economy as too small, and do not
                     understand its peculiarities and opportunities. Further, they feel that Cambodian firms are slotted
                     into strong stereotypes. This must overcome by increasing visibility of local markets, its resources
                     and opportunities.
                   ••Cambodia is subject to a talent drain. Promising local entrepreneurs leave the country to find
                     support elsewhere (such as the U.S. and Singapore). As a result, the probability of investors finding
                     promising start-ups in Cambodia is low. There is a need to retain existing talent and also attract
                     entrepreneurs back to Cambodia.
 Legal, business   ••Businesses are run in an informal manner. Some businesses are not legally registered and/or do not
 and start-up        keep proper records. This presents a challenge for investors when assessing a business and acts as
 infrastructure      an investment deterrence since it is hard to verify information, confirm real balance sheet positions,
                     and properly value businesses. Focus should be on transitioning to more formal levels of business
                     with proper business processes and procedures in place.
                   ••Increase in regulatory risks have negative impacts on business confidence and hinders investment
                     (this applies to political uncertainty in Cambodia).
                   ••The start-up industry is still nascent. Considerable time and resources needs to be committed to
                     develop the sector. Every entrepreneur interviewed said they were eager to see the sector being
                     further developed.
 Investment        ••Local companies and entrepreneurs are unfamiliar with the investment processes of investors
 readiness           currently servicing Cambodia. They generally do not meet investor requirements of the investors
                     in terms of their businesses being investment ready and/or their ability to supply appropriate
                     information. This limits access to quality investment opportunities. From a foreign investor’s point of
                     view, entrepreneurs need education on how to make their businesses investment friendly and how
                     to approach the investment process. The survey found that entrepreneurs were aware of this.
 Entrepreneurial   ••There is an urgent need to up-skill entrepreneurs to develop management, accounting, financial
 skills              and broader business skills, and develop holistic business acumen. This calls for a focus on training,
                     professional development, mentorship, and incubation services.
                   ••Foreign entrepreneurs based in Cambodia felt that there is a lack of resources to educate, train,
                     advice, and support local entrepreneurs in Cambodia.

5. Nepal Fieldwork Findings




 Classification    Views from investors/investee firms
 Finance           ••Investors are mostly attracted to matured enterprises with solid financial histories, to the detriment of start-ups.

                   ••Similar to other early evolving markets, most funding is still handled by the traditional banking sector. This is
                     not a feasible option for start-ups since banks focus on larger established businesses, and almost always lend
                     against collateral. There is a need for alternative debt funding (such as venture debt) to cater to start-ups.

                   ••Alternative financing solutions should be explored to determine whether these are suitable in Nepal and
                     can help overcome some of the impediments that restrict start-ups from accessing finance. For instance, a
                     crowdfunding platform can be an option to attract foreign investors.

                   ••Another option to explore is equity guarantee; this may potentially increase the investment risk appetite of
                     investors since it will limit possible losses.

                   ••The majority view from investee firms is that the financing gap in Nepal is high, especially at the pre-seed to
                     start-up stages. This is in line with the view from the investors who cite high risk and poor quality of deals in
                     the start-up space as impediments.

                   ••Pre-seed stage funding is hardest to fund, with the least access to finance.

                   ••There is a strong reliance on family and/or friends to finance start-ups at the pre-seed, seed, and start-up
                     funding rounds as there is no real alternative. There is a lack of awareness in the start-up community of venture
                     capital in general, how it can be used to fund start-ups, how deals are structured and on what terms, and
                     what are the investment criteria of venture capital providers. Some entrepreneurs are not even familiar with the
                     existing venture capital providers in Nepal and there are no opportunities for entrepreneurs and the venture
                     capital providers to network and collaborate.
 Legal, business   ••A legal and regulatory regime for investments should be implemented with the intent to develop the venture
 or start-up         capital industry in Nepal. Measures such as tax incentives for venture capital investment and flow-through
                     investment vehicle(s) could be considered. Separately, a legal framework dedicated to the start-up industry
 infrastructure
                     should also be considered.

                   ••Legal uncertainty poses a major hindrance to attracting offshore investors in the venture capital sector (this also
                     to the unstable political climate).
 Investment        ••Entrepreneurs need appropriate training to make them investment ready and ensure that the business case
 readiness           they present to investors is investment friendly and of adequate standard. They also need to understand their
                     markets better and how their products fit into that market.
 Entrepreneurial   ••Nepal lacks quality and quantity of investment deal flows. This is partly due to a lack of vision in entrepreneurs,
 skills              lack of business experience, and their inflexibility to learn and adapt.

                   ••Start-ups need technical assistance, such as legal and business support. This is as important as access to
                     finance.
 Mentoring         ••Nepal lacks the ‘grey hair’ factor; there is not enough mentoring available for young entrepreneurs to assist
                     them in their ventures. Mentoring programs need to be developed to help young entrepreneurs.

Investment Readiness Checklist
This investment readiness checklist contains practical and non-exhaustive steps that entrepreneurs of HI start-ups in
Vietnam, Cambodia, and Nepal can follow when seeking equity financing from professional investors such as angel investors
and venture capital funds. This checklist takes into account feedback received from investors during the fieldwork. Being
investment-ready is a gradual process and incorporates several important aspects of the business (for instance, revenue
model and market assessment). Addressing the criteria in the checklist will help entrepreneurs with their capital raising
campaign and help them identify gaps in their business.
