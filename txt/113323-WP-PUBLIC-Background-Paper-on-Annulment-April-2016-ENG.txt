I.         Purpose of Background Paper

      1. This paper is an updated version of the Background Paper on Annulment for the
         Administrative Council of ICSID dated August 2, 2012.1 It provides new data and updated
         charts and tables concerning developments in case law on annulment from August 2, 2012
         through April 15, 2016.2 In particular, it considers 37 new annulment proceedings, 22 new
         annulment decisions and 19 new decisions on the stay of enforcement of an award issued
         since the original Background Paper was published.

II.        Introduction to the Annulment Mechanism in the ICSID Convention

      2. One of the unique features of the ICSID system is its autonomous nature. ICSID arbitration
         is known as self-contained, or de-localized, arbitration because local courts in any
         particular State have no role in the ICSID proceeding. Instead, the ICSID Convention and
         rules contain all provisions necessary for the arbitration of disputes, including provisions
         addressing the institution of proceedings, jurisdiction, procedure, the award to be rendered
         by the Tribunal, post-award remedies, and recognition and enforcement of the award.3

      3. An important aspect of the self-contained nature of the system is the remedies available to
         the parties after an award has been rendered. ICSID awards are binding on the disputing
         parties, may not be appealed and are not subject to any remedies except those provided for
         in the Convention.4 As a result, unlike other international arbitral awards, ICSID awards
         cannot be challenged before national courts. Challenges to ICSID awards must be brought
         within the framework of the Convention and pursuant to its provisions.

      4. The choice of remedies offered by the ICSID Convention reflects a deliberate election by
         the drafters of the Convention to ensure finality of awards. The only way to review an
         award is pursuant to the five specific remedies provided by the Convention. These remedies
         are:

                       rectification (Article 49) – the Tribunal can rectify any clerical, arithmetical or
                        similar error in its award;

 The original background paper was prepared to assist Contracting States at the 45 th Annual Meeting of the ICSID
Administrative Council on September 23, 2011.

  The ICSID Secretariat takes no position in this paper as to whether a specific decision of an ICSID ad hoc Committee
is correct or is within the proper scope of review allowed by Article 52 of the ICSID Convention. Annex 1, which is
attached to this paper, lists all annulment cases, including the full and short form citations, members of the Tribunals
and ad hoc Committees, and the outcome in each case.
3
 In accordance with Article 54 of the ICSID Convention, an award must be recognized by all ICSID Contracting
States and pecuniary obligations imposed by an award are enforceable as a final judgment of the courts of a
Contracting State.

                      supplementary decision (Article 49) – the Tribunal may decide any question it
                       omitted to decide in its award;

                      interpretation (Article 50) – the Tribunal may interpret its award where there
                       is a dispute between the parties as to the meaning or scope of the award
                       rendered;

                      revision (Article 51) – the Tribunal may revise its award on the basis of a newly
                       discovered fact of such a nature as to decisively affect the award; and

                      annulment (Article 52) – an ad hoc Committee may fully or partially annul an
                       award on the basis of one or more of the following grounds: (a) the Tribunal
                       was not properly constituted; (b) the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers;
                       (c) there was corruption on the part of a Tribunal member; (d) there was a
                       serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; or (e) the award failed
                       to state the reasons on which it is based.

       5. The following sections focus on the annulment remedy. Section III describes the drafting
          history of the annulment provisions in the Convention, Section IV outlines the conduct of
          an annulment proceeding before ICSID and Section V describes the general standards and
          the grounds for annulment invoked in ICSID case law.

III.      The Drafting History of the Annulment Provisions in the ICSID Convention

       6. The approval of the ICSID Convention by the Executive Directors of the World Bank in
          1965 was preceded by five years of negotiation and consultation among government
          officials and international legal experts. It involved preparatory work by World Bank staff
          and Executive Directors in 1961 and 1962, a series of Regional Consultative Meetings of
          Experts convened by the World Bank in 1963 and 1964, and meetings of a Legal
          Committee consisting of representatives of all interested States held at the end of 1964.
          The final text was approved by the Executive Directors on March 18, 1965 and came into
          force on October 14, 1966.5 As of April 15, 2016, there were 152 Contracting States to
          ICSID.

A.        The Origin of the Annulment Provision

       7. The grounds for annulment in the ICSID Convention derive from the 1953 United Nations
          International Law Commission Draft Convention on Arbitral Procedure (“ILC Draft”),
          which was an effort to codify existing international law on arbitral procedure in State-to-
          State arbitration.6 The ILC recognized that the finality of an award is an essential feature

Yearbook of the International Law Commission 211, U.N. Doc. A/CN.4/SER.A/1953/Add.1 (“1953 ILC
Yearbook II”) (Article 30 of the Draft Convention on Arbitral Procedure); Aron Broches, “Observations on the

                                                        2
           of arbitral practice, but also recognized that there was a need for “exceptional remedies
           calculated to uphold the judicial character of the award as well as the will of the parties as
           a source of the jurisdiction of the tribunal.”7 It thus “sought to reconcile finality of the
           award with the need to prevent flagrant cases of excess of jurisdiction and injustice.”8
           During its deliberations, the ILC decided that no appeal against an arbitral award should
           be allowed, but that the validity of an award might be challenged “within rigidly fixed
           limits.”9 An independent body, the International Court of Justice, would rule on whether a
           challenge should lead to the annulment of the award.10

       8. The provision in the ILC Draft read as follows:

                    (1) The validity of an award may be challenged by either party on one or more of
                        the following grounds:
                         (a) That the tribunal has exceeded its powers;
                         (b) That there was corruption on the part of a member of the tribunal;
                         (c) That there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of
                             procedure, including failure to state the reasons for the award.11

       9. During its deliberations, the ILC debated the scope of specific grounds, including whether
          an excess of jurisdiction might warrant annulment, while misapplication of the law would
          not.12 Ultimately, the ILC Draft made no attempt to define what conduct each ground
          would cover, with the exception of the express reference to the “failure to state the reasons
          for the award” as an example of a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.13

  The ILC adopted the Model Rules on Arbitral Procedure in 1958. The provision on annulment, Article 35, remained
the same as to grounds (a) and (b), but ground (c) was phrased “failure to state the reasons for the award or a serious
departure from a fundamental rule of procedure” and an additional ground was added: “(d) that the undertaking to
arbitrate or the compromis is a nullity.” Documents of the Tenth Session Including the Report of the Commission to

            award] - - the grounds on which the annulment of the award may be sought.”14

B.          Preliminary Draft ICSID Convention – 1963

       10. The ICSID Convention’s earliest draft, an internal World Bank document entitled
           “Working Paper in the Form of a Draft Convention” of June 5, 1962, made no provision
           for annulment.15 However, a text on annulment identical to the 1953 ILC Draft was
           included in the Preliminary Draft of a Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes
           between States and Nationals of other States (“Preliminary Draft”) in 1963.16 The
           Preliminary Draft was a second working paper prepared by World Bank staff for
           consideration at the regional consultative meetings of experts. Section 13(1) read as
           follows:

                     (1) The validity of an award may be challenged by either party on one or
                         more of the following grounds:
                          (a) that the Tribunal has exceeded its powers;
                          (b) that there was corruption on the part of a member of the Tribunal; or
                          (c) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of
                              procedure, including failure to state the reasons for the award.17

       11. The comment accompanying Section 13 explained the purpose of the provision:

                     […] As a general rule the award of the Tribunal is final, and there is no
                     provision for appeal. Sections 11 and 12, however, provide for
                     interpretation and revision of the award, respectively. In addition, where
                     there has been some violation of the fundamental principles of law
                     governing the Tribunal’s proceedings such as are listed in Section 13, the
                     aggrieved party may apply to the Chairman [of the Administrative Council
                     of ICSID] for a declaration that the award is invalid. Under that section the
                     Chairman is required to refer the matter to a Committee of three persons
                     which shall be competent to declare the nullity of the award. It may be noted
                     that this is not a procedure by way of appeal requiring consideration of the
                     merits of the case, but one that merely calls for an affirmative or negative
                     ruling based upon one or other of the three grounds listed in Section 13(1).18

C.          Regional Consultative Meetings – 1964

       12. The inclusion of a provision on annulment in the ICSID Convention does not appear to
           have been questioned or debated, nor is there any account of discussion concerning the
           general purpose and scope of annulment in the drafting history of the Convention. Indeed,
           a summary report of the meetings by the General Counsel of the World Bank concluded
           that no controversial issues of policy were raised by the draft annulment provision, but that
           a considerable number of detailed suggestions of a technical character had been raised.19
           The specific grounds for annulment were discussed at a series of Regional Consultative
           Meetings.

       13. During the first set of Regional Consultative Meetings, legal experts from various countries
           made suggestions for changes to the Preliminary Draft.20 Among other things, a proposal
           was made that the grounds for annulment be set out in greater detail and modeled on
           commercial arbitration laws.21 However, Aron Broches, then General Counsel of the World
           Bank and Chair of the Regional Consultative Meetings and the subsequent meetings of the
           Legal Committee, discouraged the comparison with commercial arbitration.22 He recalled
           that “it had been fully recognized that only limited recourse had been provided and that
           acceptance of the binding character of the award went beyond what was normally expected
           in respect of an arbitral tribunal.”23

       14. A concern was raised by a legal expert from Germany that annulment posed a risk of
           frustrating awards and therefore the annulment provision should be made more restrictive.
           To that effect, this expert proposed a requirement that an excess of powers be “manifest”
           to warrant annulment.24 In the context of the discussions on the meaning of “excess of
           powers,” Chairman Broches confirmed that the intention was to cover the situation where
           a decision of the Tribunal went beyond the terms of the parties’ arbitration agreement.25

       15. Other suggestions were to add the words “a serious misapplication of the law” or
           “including the failure to apply the proper law” to the ground concerning excess of powers.26
           In this connection, Chairman Broches remarked that “a mistake in the application of the
           law would not be a valid ground for annulment of the award,” stating that “[a] mistake of
           law as well as a mistake of fact constituted an inherent risk in judicial or arbitral decision
           for which appeal was not provided.”27 However, the legal expert from Lebanon observed

            that if the parties had agreed to apply a particular law and the Tribunal in fact applied a
            different law, the award would violate the parties’ arbitration agreement and could be
            annulled.28

       16. A further suggestion sought to clarify that “departure from a fundamental rule of
           procedure” excluded challenges on the basis of inobservance of ordinary arbitration rules,
           as opposed to “breaches of procedural rules which would constitute a violation of the rules
           of natural justice.”29 One proposal was to add the phrase “a serious departure from the
           principles of natural justice.”30 Another proposal was to replace the term by “fundamental
           principles of justice.”31 Chairman Broches subsequently explained that “fundamental rule
           of procedure” was to be understood to have a wider connotation, and to include under its
           ambit the so-called principles of natural justice. As an example, he mentioned the parties’
           right to be heard.32

D.          First Draft Convention – September 1964

       17. In light of the discussions at the Regional Consultative Meetings, World Bank staff
           prepared a further Draft of a Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between
           States and Nationals of other States (the “First Draft”),33 for consideration by the Legal
           Committee. This Committee was composed of experts representing member governments
           of the World Bank. The annulment provision in the First Draft read as follows:

                     (1) Either party may request annulment of the award by an application in
                         writing addressed to the Secretary-General on one or more of the
                         following grounds:
                               (a) that the Tribunal was not properly constituted;
                               (b) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;
                               (c) that there was corruption on the part of a member of the
                                   Tribunal;
                               (d) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule
                                   of procedure; or
                               (e) failure to state the reasons for the award, unless the parties have
                                   agreed that reasons need not be stated.34

E.          Legal Committee Meetings – 1964

        18. The Legal Committee held a series of meetings in November and December 1964, chaired
            by Broches. At the meetings, clarification was sought by an Ethiopian Committee member
            regarding the meaning of the additional ground of improper constitution of the Tribunal.35
            It was explained that this expression was “intended to cover a variety of situations such as,
            for instance, absence of agreement or invalid agreement between the parties, the fact that
            the investor was not a national of a Contracting State, that a member of the Tribunal was
            not entitled to be an arbitrator, etc.”36 Two experts were in favor of deleting the ground of
            improper constitution but the majority of the Legal Committee decided to retain this
            ground.37

        19. The Ethiopian Committee member also asked whether there was a contradiction in
            providing that a Tribunal is the sole judge of its competence and at the same time providing
            for excess of power as a ground of annulment.38 Chairman Broches replied that:

                    …the expression ‘manifestly exceeded its powers’ concerned the cases […]
                    where the Tribunal would have gone beyond the scope of agreement of the
                    parties or would have thus decided points which had not been submitted to
                    it or had been improperly submitted to it. […] the ad hoc Committee would
                    limit itself to cases of manifest excess of those powers.39

        20. Suggestions that the word “manifestly” be omitted were defeated by a majority of 23 to 11
            votes.40 A proposal to include as a ground of annulment that the Tribunal had made a
            decision beyond the scope of the submissions was also defeated on a vote.41

        21. Chairman Broches confirmed during the meetings that failure to apply the proper law could
            amount to an excess of power if the parties had agreed on an applicable law.42 One proposal
            suggested adding the “manifestly incorrect application of the law” by the Tribunal as a
            ground of annulment, but it was defeated by a vote of 17 to 8.43

        22. In regard to the ground concerning corruption on the part of a member of the Tribunal,
            there were suggestions by various legal experts to replace “corruption” with

            “misconduct,”44 “lack of integrity”45 or “a defect in moral character.”46 There were further
            suggestions that the ground be limited to cases where the corruption was evidenced by a
            judgment of a court, or in instances where there was “reasonable proof that corruption
            might exist.”47 These proposals were put to a vote and defeated by a large majority.48

       23. The ground for annulment relating to a serious departure from a fundamental rule of
           procedure had become a stand-alone ground under the First Draft. A discussion was held
           about whether to add the words “or substance” after the words “rule of procedure,” but the
           proposal was seen as confusing.49 A further suggestion to replace the word “rule” by
           “principle” was also rejected because the reference to “fundamental” rules of procedure
           was considered to be a clear reference to principles.50 Likewise, a specific reference noting
           that both parties must have a fair hearing was defeated.51

       24. The last ground, failure to state reasons, also became a stand-alone ground in the First
           Draft. The possibility of raising this ground of annulment was subject to the parties’
           agreement on whether reasons for the award would have to be stated. The rationale for this
           discretion was to reconcile it with another provision which allowed the parties to agree that
           the award need not state the reasons.52 However, during one of the Legal Committee’s
           meetings, it was decided to remove the parties’ discretion in this regard and, as a
           consequence, the discretion was also removed from the ground for annulment.53

F.          Revised Draft Convention – December 1964

       25. Following the Legal Committee’s meetings, a Revised Draft Convention on the Settlement
           of Investment Disputes (“Revised Draft”) was prepared.54 Article 52 of the Revised Draft
           read as follows:

                    (1) Either party may request annulment of the award by an application in
                        writing addressed to the Secretary-General on one or more of the
                        following grounds:

the reasons upon which it is based.”

                           (a) that the Tribunal was not properly constituted;
                           (b) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;
                           (c) that there was corruption on the part of a member of the
                               Tribunal;
                           (d) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule
                               of procedure; or
                           (e) that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is
                               based.55

       26. Since the First Draft, the only modification made to the provision was to subsection
           (1)(e).56 As explained above, the ground was no longer subject to the parties’ agreement
           that reasons need not be stated and, therefore, the words “unless the parties have agreed
           that reasons need not be stated” were deleted.

       27. The Revised Draft was submitted for consideration by the Executive Directors of the World
           Bank. While further changes were subsequently made to other provisions of the Revised
           Draft, Article 52 remained the same and thus became the text of the ICSID Convention.

IV.        The Conduct of an Annulment Proceeding

       28. In addition to stipulating the grounds for annulment, Article 52 of the ICSID Convention
           sets out the general procedural framework for an annulment proceeding. It is implemented
           by the ICSID Arbitration Rules, which apply to all ICSID Convention arbitration
           proceedings and govern ICSID post-award remedy proceedings. ICSID Arbitration Rules
           50 and 52 through 55 implement the annulment remedy in the Convention, including the
           institution of annulment proceedings, the appointment of an ad hoc Committee to decide
           the application, and stays of enforcement of the award while the annulment application is
           pending. The various steps in an annulment proceeding are described below.

A.         Filing an Application for Annulment

       29. Either disputing party may initiate an annulment proceeding by filing an application for
           annulment with the ICSID Secretary-General. The application must: (i) identify the award
           to which it relates; (ii) indicate the date of the application; (iii) state in detail the grounds
           on which it is based pursuant to Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention; and (iv) be
           accompanied by the payment of a fee for lodging the application.57 It must be filed within
           120 days after the date on which the award (or any subsequent decision or correction) was
           rendered, except that, in the case of corruption on the part of a Tribunal member, the

  As to ground (d), in the French version of the Revised Draft, the word “dérogation” was replaced by “inobservation”
and in the Spanish version the words “grave apartamiento” were replaced by “quebrantamiento.”
57
   See Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (“Arbitration Rules”), Arbitration Rule 50(1) . The fee for
lodging an application for annulment is currently US$25,000.


                                                         9
            application may be filed within 120 days after discovery of the corruption, and in any event
            within three years after the date on which the award was rendered.58 The Secretary-General
            must refuse registration of an application for annulment that is not filed within the
            prescribed time limits.59

       30. The application for annulment must concern an ICSID award, which is the final decision
           concluding a case. Since there can be only one award in the ICSID system, the parties must
           wait until that award is rendered before initiating any post-award remedies.60 An
           application for annulment concerning a decision issued prior to the award (e.g. a decision
           on a challenge, a provisional measure, or a decision upholding jurisdiction) cannot be
           challenged before it becomes part of the eventual award, even if it raises issues that may
           constitute the basis for an annulment application.61

       31. Since the entry into force of the ICSID Convention in 1966, annulment proceedings have
           been instituted in 87 cases.62 In 3 of those cases, annulment proceedings were instituted a
           second time after a resubmission proceeding, meaning 90 annulment proceedings have
           been instituted in total.

       32. A greater number of annulment applications have been registered since 2001 than in prior
           years. This reflects the increased number of awards issued, and not an increased rate of

  See in particular ICSID Convention Articles 48-49 (addressing “the award”). Under the same principle, only the
award is capable of enforcement under ICSID Convention Article 54. For enforcement purposes, ICSID Convention
Article 53(2) provides that an “award” includes any decision interpreting, revising or annulling such award.
61
  Annulment applications in respect of decisions on jurisdiction in pending cases have consistently been refused
registration. See Broches, supra note 6, at 302.

           were initiated by claimants. In 5 cases (approximately 6 percent of all annulment

B.          Constitution of an ad hoc Committee

       35. Once an application for annulment is registered, the Chairman of the Administrative
           Council must appoint an ad hoc Committee of three persons to decide the application.66
           The function of an ad hoc Committee is either to reject the application for annulment or to
           annul the award or a part thereof on the basis of the grounds enumerated in Article 52.67 Its
           function is not to rule on the merits of the parties’ dispute if it decides to annul, which
           would be the task of a new Tribunal should either party resubmit the dispute following
           annulment of the award.68

       36. Ad hoc Committee members are appointed from the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators, which
           consists of persons designated by ICSID Contracting States and ten designees named by
           the Chairman of the Administrative Council.69 The ICSID Convention requires that Panel
           designees be “persons of high moral character and recognized competence in the fields of
65
  Fifteen applications sought partial annulment of the award. As noted in para. 67, applicant-Nationals of Another
State and applicant-States have had a similar rate of success in annulment applications.

            law, commerce, industry or finance, who may be relied upon to exercise independent
            judgment.”70 Both arbitrators and ad hoc Committee members are expected to be
            independent and impartial, and to decide the case solely on the basis of the facts before
            them and the applicable law.

       37. Unlike the Centre’s appointment of Tribunal members, which may in certain circumstances
           be made outside of the Panel of Arbitrators with the parties’ consent,71 the Chairman of the
           Administrative Council is restricted to appointing ad hoc Committee members from
           persons on the Panel of Arbitrators.72 Many persons on the Panel of Arbitrators have served
           as members of both Tribunals and Committees.

       38. The Panel of Arbitrators currently consists of 424 persons designated by 117 of the 152
           Member States and the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID.73 As of April
           15, 2016, ICSID appointed 271 ad hoc Committee members from the Panel, 141 of whom
           were appointed since 2011.

       39. In addition to the general qualifications required for designation to the Panel of Arbitrators
           (see above, paragraph 36), a member of an ad hoc Committee must meet specific
           requirements prescribed by the ICSID Convention. First, the member of the ad hoc
           Committee cannot have been a member of the Tribunal which rendered the award or be of
           the same nationality as any of that Tribunal’s members.74 Second, the member cannot have
           the same nationality as the disputing parties (State and National of Another State) and
           cannot have been designated to the Panel of Arbitrators either by the State party to the

           dispute or the State whose national is a party to the dispute.75 Third, the member cannot
           have acted as a conciliator in the same dispute.76 As a result, in each annulment proceeding
           there are usually 5 or more excluded nationalities.77

       40. A number of case-specific factors are considered, in addition to the formal requirements
           for appointment to an ad hoc Committee established by the ICSID Convention. For
           example, the languages used in the Tribunal proceeding and likely to be used before the ad
           hoc Committee are relevant, as is the experience of each candidate, including their past and
           current appointments. The internal process usually involves consultations among counsel,
           case management Team Leaders and the Secretary-General. Before the name of the
           candidate is proposed to the parties, the Centre researches whether there are any conflicts
           of interest and, if none are found, the candidate is asked to confirm that he/she is free of
           any conflicts, has time to dedicate to the proceeding, and is willing to act as a member of
           the ad hoc Committee.

       41. Unlike the process for appointment of Tribunal members,78 the ICSID Convention imposes
           no obligation on the Chairman to consult the parties about ad hoc Committee appointments.
           Nonetheless, before ad hoc Committee members are appointed, ICSID informs the parties
           of the proposed appointees and circulates their curricula vitae. This gives the parties an
           opportunity to submit comments indicating that there might be a manifest lack of the
           qualities required for serving as a Committee member;79 for example, that there is a conflict
           of interest which the Centre or the candidate was unaware of. In exceptional circumstances,
           a proposed candidate is withdrawn and replaced by another person.

       42. The Centre makes its best effort to complete the appointment process as soon as possible
           after registration of the annulment application. In recent years, the average time to complete
           the process has been reduced to 8 weeks, and efforts are being made to further reduce that
           average. This includes the time spent corresponding with the parties.

       43. Approximately 41percent of all Committee member appointments have been nationals of
           States which are classified by the World Bank Group as developing countries.80 This
           corresponds to slightly more than one developing country national per case.81 The number
           of women appointed to ad hoc Committees has historically been low (only 15 ad hoc

  These requirements cannot be modified by agreement of the parties in annulment proceedings. This contrasts with
Tribunal proceedings, where an arbitrator of an excluded nationality may be appointed in accordance with Arbitration
Rule 1(3).

        Committee appointments involved women to date). This reflects the few women
        designated to the Panel of Arbitrators (approximately 13 percent of the members on the
        Panel of Arbitrators are women).82

     44. Parties sometimes request that ad hoc Committee members meet specific criteria; for
         example that they have investment arbitration experience, they do not sit on any pending
         case with any of the members of the original Tribunal or that they have not decided any
         legal issue similar to that considered in the annulment proceeding. At the same time, there
         is a call for greater diversity in ICSID arbitration and for the expansion of the pool of
         arbitrators and ad hoc Committee members. ICSID endeavors to take all of these
         considerations into account as far as possible when considering candidates from the Panel
         of Arbitrators, with due regard to the nationality restrictions.

C.      The Proceeding

     45. Once the ad hoc Committee members have accepted their appointments,83 the Secretary-
         General of ICSID notifies the parties of the constitution of the Committee. The party
         requesting annulment of the award is usually referred to as the “Applicant,” and the other
         party is usually the “Respondent” or “Respondent on Annulment.” A claimant in the
         Tribunal proceeding may thus become the respondent in the annulment proceeding.

     46. A Secretary to the ad hoc Committee is appointed from among ICSID staff to assist the
         Committee and the parties. Where possible, the Secretary of the Committee is the same
         person as the Secretary of the Tribunal. This ensures the best possible assistance in view
         of the Secretary’s knowledge of the procedural history and submissions in the original
         proceeding. However, parties sometimes ask the Secretariat to appoint a different person,
         which the Secretariat is willing to do.


82
  In September 2011 the Chairman of the Administrative Council designated 3 women and 6 developing country
nationals out of 10 designees to the Chairman’s list for the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators.
83
 The members of the ad hoc Committee must sign a declaration in a form analogous to that specified in Arbitration
Rule 6(2) for Tribunal members.


                                                       15
                    (i)     Applicable Provisions

       47. The Arbitration Rules apply, mutatis mutandis, to the proceeding before the ad hoc
           Committee.84 This means that the Rules will apply with the changes necessary to take into
           account the fact that the proceeding is an annulment proceeding.

       48. In addition, Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention provides that Articles 41-45, 48, 49, 53
           and 54 apply mutatis mutandis before the ad hoc Committee. By citing specific articles of
           the Convention, Article 52(4) implies that other provisions of the Convention do not apply
           to annulment. As a result, for example, it has been disputed whether Article 47 of the ICSID
           Convention concerning a Tribunal’s power to recommend provisional measures applies to
           annulment proceedings.85 Similarly, it has been argued that Article 52(4) does not allow a
           member of an ad hoc Committee to be challenged for a manifest lack of the qualities
           required by Article 14(1) of the Convention, suggesting that an ad hoc Committee member
           could not be disqualified.86 However, this interpretation has been rejected in two annulment
           proceedings in which the ad hoc Committees found that they had the power to rule on
           disqualification but dismissed the requests.87

       49. With regard to the expedited procedure to dispose of unmeritorious claims at the
           preliminary stage of a proceeding introduced with the 2006 Arbitration Rules (Arbitration
           Rule 41(5)), ad hoc Committees have confirmed that this procedure also applies in
           annulment proceedings, but that the standard to accept an objection made under this
           provision is higher in the context of an annulment.88 With regard to non-disputing party
           submissions under Arbitration Rule 37(2), one ad hoc Committee rejected such an

     Arbitration Rule 53.

Respondents on annulment relate mainly to the enforcement of the Award.”

        submission.90

                 (ii)     The First Session

     50. The procedure before an ad hoc Committee normally corresponds to the procedure before
         a Tribunal. Ad hoc Committees must afford both parties the right to be heard and must
         respect the equality of the parties. There is an assumption that the parties’ procedural
         agreements in the original proceeding will remain the same in the annulment proceeding,
         for example with respect to the choice of procedural language, the number and sequence
         of written pleadings and the parties’ representatives.91 Nonetheless, the ad hoc Committee
         usually convenes a first session with the parties to discuss procedural matters, and it is not
         uncommon to vary certain arrangements, for example concerning the applicable rules,
         procedural language and place of proceedings. In most cases, the parties agree on a
         timetable involving two rounds of pleadings on the application for annulment (Memorial,
         Counter-Memorial, Reply and Rejoinder) and an oral hearing. In recent years, the time
         allowed for written pleadings rarely exceeded 3 months per party for the first round and 2
         months per party for the second round.

     51. The parties typically file with their written pleadings the factual and legal evidence from
         the original proceeding that they wish to rely on in the annulment proceeding. The record
         before the ad hoc Committee is usually limited to the factual evidence before the original
         Tribunal. However, new factual evidence could potentially be admitted.92

                 (iii)    Advances to ICSID

     52. Unlike the Tribunal proceedings, the Applicant is solely responsible for making all advance
         payments requested by ICSID in an annulment proceeding, unless the parties agree
         otherwise. These advances cover the hearing expenses such as transcription, translation
         and interpretation, the administrative fee of ICSID as well as fees and expenses of the ad
         hoc Committee (“Costs of Proceeding”). The payments are made without prejudice to the
         right of the ad hoc Committee to decide how and by whom the costs ultimately should be

           to the Committee’s ultimate decision on costs.

       53. The Costs of Proceeding for annulments concluded since July 2010 have averaged
           US$388,000.94 The fees and expenses of ad hoc Committee members represented
           74 percent of these costs, while the hearing costs and ICSID administrative fee accounted
           for the other 26 percent of these costs.

                    (iv)       Stay of Enforcement

       54. An Applicant may in its application for annulment, or either party may at any time during
           the proceeding, request a stay of enforcement of all or part of the Tribunal award. 95 The
           stay of enforcement could concern an award of damages, award of costs or some other form
           of relief ordered by the original Tribunal. The stay of enforcement may be either partial or
           full.96 If the request for stay is made in the application for annulment, the Secretary-General
           of ICSID must inform the parties of the provisional stay of enforcement when the
           application is registered.97

       55. The provisional stay remains in place until the ad hoc Committee, on a priority basis, rules
           on the request after having given each party an opportunity to present its observations.98

       56. Ad hoc Committees take into account the specific circumstances of each case when
           considering requests for a continued stay of enforcement of the award.99 Some have held
           that there is no presumption in favor of a stay of enforcement.100 Circumstances considered
           have included the risk of non-recovery of sums due under the award if the award is
           annulled, non-compliance with the award if the award is not annulled, any history of non-

     Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(e); ICSID Convention Article 52(4). See infra para. 65.

  This includes one case in which such cost nearly exceeded US$1 million. Excluding this case, the average cost of
an annulment proceeding amounts to approximately US$370,000.

           proceedings, adverse economic consequences on either party and the balance of both
           parties’ interests.101

       57. If a stay is granted, the ad hoc Committee may modify or terminate the stay at the request
           of either party.102 A Committee may terminate a stay if the party requesting the stay of
           enforcement has failed to fulfill a condition for the stay ordered by the Committee ( e.g.,
           the provision of adequate financial security in respect of the amount due under the award).
           If a stay is not terminated during the proceeding, it terminates automatically upon the
           issuance of the ad hoc Committee’s final decision on annulment.103

       58. There have been a total of 43 requests for the stay of enforcement in the 90 registered
           annulments, 41 of which have led to Committee decisions.104 Thirty-six decisions granted
           the stay of enforcement. In 22 of those instances where a stay was granted, it was
           conditioned upon the issuance of some type of security or written undertaking. In 11 of
           those 22 cases, the stay was terminated because the condition had not been satisfied.105

      Arbitration Rule 54(3).
103
    Id. If an ad hoc Committee annuls part of an award, it may at its discretion “order the temporary stay” of the
unannulled part. This enables the Committee to consider any advantage that the partial annulment may confer given
that the annulled portion might be reconsidered by a new tribunal under ICSID Convention Article 52(6). If a Tribunal
is reconstituted following a partial annulment, a party may request the stay of enforcement of the unannulled portion
of the award until the date of the new tribunal’s award . See Arbitration Rule 55(3). Although there have been several
partial annulments with resubmissions, this situation has not yet occurred.

                             (v)     Hearing and Post-Hearing Phase

            59. The filing of written pleadings is followed by an oral hearing which most often lasts one
                to two days. The hearing is usually limited to the parties’ oral arguments and, in some
                cases, to examination of legal experts whose opinions were submitted by the parties in the
                annulment proceeding. Because an ad hoc Committee does not reexamine the facts of the
                dispute, factual witnesses do not usually have any role in the process.106

            60. At the hearing or shortly thereafter, the ad hoc Committee invites the parties to file
                submissions on costs and sometimes also to file post-hearing briefs. The ad hoc Committee
                closes the proceeding once the presentation of the annulment case is concluded and the
                Committee has made progress in the deliberations. It must issue the decision on annulment
                within 120 days from the date of closure.107

            61. Of the 25 decisions on annulment issued since January 2011, 22 have been issued within
                one year of the hearing. The average time from the hearing to issuance of these 22 decisions

             was 7 months. Over the same period, the average time for an annulment proceeding from
             the registration of the application for annulment until the issuance of the decision was 24
             months.108 The overall average duration of all concluded annulment proceedings during
             the past 5 years is 22 months from the date of registration (20 months from the date of
             constitution of the ad hoc Committee).

D.           The Decision on Annulment

       62. The proceeding ends with the ad hoc Committee’s decision on annulment. The Committee
           may (i) reject all grounds for annulment, meaning that the award remains intact; (ii) uphold
           one or more grounds for annulment in respect of a part of the award, leading to a partial
           annulment; (iii) uphold one or more grounds for annulment in respect of the entire award,
           meaning that the whole of the award is annulled; or (iv) exercise its discretion not to annul
           notwithstanding that an error has been identified.109 The proceeding may also be
           discontinued before the Committee issues a final decision because the parties agree on a
           settlement, a party does not object to the other party’s request for discontinuance, due to
           nonpayment of the advances requested by ICSID to cover the Costs of Proceeding or
           because the parties fail to take any steps in the proceeding during six consecutive
           months.110 Several annulment proceedings have been discontinued due to an Applicant’s

       63. The ad hoc Committee’s decision on annulment is not an award and is not subject to any
           further annulment proceeding, although it is equated to an award for purposes of its binding
           force, recognition and enforcement.112 Likewise, the decision must contain the elements
           required in an award.113 Notably, the decision must include the reasons upon which it is
           based.114 As to the requirement to deal with every question, one ad hoc Committee has
           opined that once an award is annulled in full on any ground, it is unnecessary to examine
           whether other grounds may also lead to annulment.115 Similarly, some ad hoc Committees
           which partially annulled an award based on one ground did not see the need to examine
           alternative grounds for annulment of the same portion of the award that had been
           annulled.116 Other ad hoc Committees examined all grounds raised, even where one of
           these grounds warranted full annulment.117


111
   See Annex 1. As noted in para. 52, the Applicant is solely responsible for the advance payments to ICSID in
annulment proceedings. Under Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(d) and (e), if an Applicant fails to make
an advance, the Secretary-General informs both parties of the default and gives an opportunity to either of them to
make the outstanding payment within 15 days. If neither party makes the payment, the proceeding may, after
consultation with the Committee, be suspended and eventually discontinued after six months.

       64. Nothing in the ICSID Convention or rules expressly prohibits an ad hoc Committee from
           stating its opinion on any issue addressed by the Tribunal award. However, some decisions
           have stated that an ad hoc Committee should not pronounce upon aspects of the Tribunal
           award that are not essential to its decision.118

       65. The decision on annulment must also contain the ad hoc Committee’s determination on the
           allocation of costs incurred by the parties in connection with the proceeding.119 The
           Committee has discretion to decide how and by whom these costs should be paid, including
           each party’s legal fees and expenses.120 While ad hoc Committees in the past usually
           divided the Costs of Proceeding121 equally between the parties and ruled that each party
           bear its own legal fees and expenses, in recent years, a majority of Committees have
           decided that the Applicant should bear all or a majority of the Costs of Proceeding when
           the application for annulment was unsuccessful. Some ad hoc Committees have also ruled
           that the losing party should bear the legal fees and expenses of the successful party, in most
           instances the defending party.122

       66. Similar to a Tribunal award, the ad hoc Committee’s decision on annulment may be
           accompanied by the individual opinion of a member of the Committee.123 In practice, only
           5 Committee members have partially or fully dissented from the majority’s decision.124

       67. Where an award has been partially or wholly annulled, the prevailing Applicant on
           annulment was roughly evenly divided as between claimants (40%) and respondents (60%)
           in the Tribunal proceeding.

      68. The rate of annulment is low, with 2.8 percent of registered cases (6.6 percent of all awards)
          ending in full or partial annulment.125 The ratio of annulments to awards fluctuates
          historically and has shown a downward trend over the decades. In the early years, during
          the period 1971 – 2000, the rate of annulment was 13 percent. During the period 2001–
          2010, this ratio decreased to 8 percent. Since January 2011, the ratio has further decreased
          to 3 percent.

E.         Resubmission Proceedings

       69. The effect of annulment is that the award or a part thereof becomes a nullity, meaning that
           the binding force of the annulled portion of the award is terminated. However, the decision
           on annulment does not replace the award or substitute any of the reasoning in the award.
           A party is entitled to request resubmission of the dispute to a newly constituted Tribunal to
           obtain a new award concerning the same dispute following annulment of the original
           award.126 Either party may start this process by filing a request for resubmission of the
           dispute, identifying the original award and explaining in detail which aspects of the dispute
           are to be submitted to the new Tribunal.127 The new Tribunal is constituted by the same
           method as the original Tribunal128 and is not bound by the reasoning of the ad hoc
           Committee. It is, however, bound by the unannulled portions of the original award in cases
           of partial annulment.129

       70. There have been 7 resubmission proceedings registered to date,130 3 of which led to awards
           that were subject to a second annulment proceeding.131 The applications for annulment in
           those second annulment proceedings were rejected by the ad hoc Committees with the
           exception of the Amco II case, where the ad hoc Committee annulled the Tribunal’s
           Decision on Supplemental Decisions and Rectification.132

V.         Interpretation of the Annulment Mechanism, the Role of the ad hoc Committee, and
           the Individual Grounds for Annulment

A.         The General Standards Identified in the Drafting History and ICSID Cases

       71. As illustrated by Section III, the drafting history of the ICSID Convention demonstrates
           that assuring the finality of ICSID arbitration awards was a fundamental goal for the ICSID
           system. As a result, annulment was designed purposefully to confer a limited scope of
           review which would safeguard against “violation of the fundamental principles of law
           governing the Tribunal’s proceedings.”133 The remedy has thus been characterized as one

126
   ICSID Convention Article 52(6); Arbitration Rule 55(1). The new Tribunal could reach the same conclusion as the
original Tribunal whose award was annulled.
127
   Arbitration Rule 55(1). The Secretary-General has no authority to refuse registration of a resubmitted dispute.
Arbitration Rule 55(2).
128
      Arbitration Rule 55(2)(d).
129
  Arbitration Rule 55(3). A partial annulment means that only those portions of the award that have been annulled
may be resubmitted, whereas the remainder will be res judicata.

paper.

           concerning “procedural errors in the decisional process” rather than an inquiry into the
           substance of the award.134

       72. The drafting history of the ICSID Convention also demonstrates that annulment “is not a
           procedure by way of appeal requiring consideration of the merits of the case, but one that
           merely calls for an affirmative or negative ruling based upon one [of the grounds for
           annulment].”135 It does not provide a mechanism to appeal alleged misapplication of law
           or mistake in fact. The Legal Committee confirmed by a vote that even a “manifestly
           incorrect application of the law” is not a ground for annulment.136

       73. The limited and exceptional nature of the annulment remedy expressed in the drafting
           history of the Convention has been repeatedly confirmed by ICSID Secretary-Generals in
           Reports to the Administrative Council of ICSID, papers and lectures.137

       74. ICSID ad hoc Committees have also affirmed these principles in their decisions.138 These
           decisions have clearly established that: (1) the grounds listed in Article 52(1) are the only
           grounds on which an award may be annulled; (2) annulment is an exceptional and narrowly
           circumscribed remedy and the role of an ad hoc Committee is limited; (3) ad hoc
           Committees are not courts of appeal, annulment is not a remedy against an incorrect
           decision, and an ad hoc Committee cannot substitute the Tribunal’s determination on the
           merits for its own; (4) ad hoc Committees should exercise their discretion not to defeat the
           object and purpose of the remedy or erode the binding force and finality of awards; (5)
           Article 52 should be interpreted in accordance with its object and purpose, neither narrowly
           nor broadly; and (6) an ad hoc Committee’s authority to annul is circumscribed by the
           Article 52 grounds specified in the application for annulment, but an ad hoc Committee
           has discretion with respect to the extent of an annulment, i.e., either partial or full. The
           following section enumerates each of these commonly cited principles related to ICSID
           annulment, accompanied by excerpts of annulment decisions confirming the relevant
           principle.

    See e.g., Report of Secretary-General Ibrahim F.I. Shihata to the Administrative Council at its Twentieth Annual
Meeting 3 (October 2, 1986): “The history of the Convention makes it clear that the draftsmen intended to: (i) assure
the finality of ICSID awards; (ii) distinguish carefully an annulment proceeding from an appeal; and (iii) construe
narrowly the ground for annulment, so that this procedure remained exceptional;” Report of Secretary-General
Ibrahim F.I. Shihata to the Administrative Council at its Twenty-Second Annual Meeting (September 27-29, 1988):
“It may be expected that use of the annulment procedure would be a rare event because of the seriousness of the
shortcomings against which it is meant to be a safeguard. It is also wrong to confuse the annulment proceeding with
an appeals process which is not possible in respect of awards issued by ICSID’s tribunals;” Broches, supra note 6, at
354 & 355.

   All decisions on annulment have been published, either by ICSID with the consent of the parties, by the parties
themselves, or in summaries of the legal reasoning of the ad hoc Committee excerpted by ICSID. See Annex 1, which
includes references to each decision on annulment and its publication source. Pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule
48(4), the Centre has published the legal reasoning of the decisions on annulment in RFCC, Repsol, Transgabonais,

    on which a party may seek annulment. The list is exhaustive. The decision to annul cannot be
    based on a ground other than the five listed in Article 52(1). It is now well settled that this

    whether the Tribunal's reasoning is both coherent and displayed. To borrow Caron’s
    terminology, annulment is concerned with the ‘legitimacy’ of the process of decision” rather
    than with the ‘substantive correctness of decision.’ Because of its focus on procedural
    legitimacy, annulment is ‘an extraordinary remedy for unusual and important cases.’ That
    annulment is not the same thing as appeal is a principle acknowledged, although applied

    annulment (a form of specific control over the arbitral process subject to the requirements of
    Article 52 of the ICSID Convention)… The Committee insists, however, on strongly

   “Most committees have understood that this recourse of annulment must be clearly

    ways. First, as to the result of the review procedure: an appeal can modify the award under
    review, whereas annulment can only invalidate it (fully or partially) or assert its validity,
    without being able to modify its content. Second, as has been recognized (among others) by
    the Committees in Soufraki and Pey Casado in the annulment decision it is not pertinent to
    rule on the substantive correctness of the award, because the annulment regime was designed
    to protect the integrity and not the result of ICSID arbitration proceedings; therefore,

   “Annulment is fundamentally different from appeal. The result of a successful application for
    annulment is the invalidation of the original decision. The result of a successful appeal is its
    modification. A decision-maker exercising the power to annul only has the choice between
    leaving the original decision intact or annulling it in whole or in part. An appeals body may
    substitute its own decision for the decision that it has found to be deficient. Under the ICSID
    Convention, an ad hoc committee only has the power to annul the award. The ad hoc committee
    may not amend or replace the award by its own decision on the merits. Article 53(1) of the

   “ICSID ad hoc committees have adamantly stressed the distinction between annulment and

    (January 15, 2016).

   “It is not within an ad hoc committee’s remit to re-examine the facts of the case to determine
    whether a tribunal erred in appreciating or evaluating the available evidence. A tribunal’s
    discretion in such matters of appreciation and evaluation of evidence is recognized by the
    ICSID system. An ad hoc committee cannot sit in appeal on a tribunal’s assessment of the
    evidence. If the Committee were to proceed to a re-examination of the facts of the present case
    and an assessment of how the Tribunal evaluated the evidence before it, it would act as an
    appellate body. That is not a function envisaged for it by the ICSID Convention.” Adem Dogan

   “The Committee notes that ICSID ad hoc committees have repeatedly held that the annulment
    mechanism is an exceptional and narrowly circumscribed remedy, and that it is not a remedy
    against an incorrect decision. As a result, committees have stressed the distinction between
    annulment and appeal, and stated that they cannot review the correctness of an award’s findings
    on facts or law. The Committee agrees with CMS v. Argentina that a committee ‘has only
    limited jurisdiction under Article 52 of the Convention’ and ‘cannot simply substitute its own
    view of the law and its own appreciation of the facts for those of the Tribunal.’ The Committee
    will apply these general standards when considering each of the grounds for annulment pleaded
    in this case.” Ioan Micula, Viorel Micula and others v. Romania, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20,
    Decision on Annulment, para. 122 (February 26, 2016) (footnotes omitted).

   “Unreasoned awards can be annulled, because parties should be able to ascertain to what extent
    a tribunal’s findings are based on a correct interpretation of the law and on a proper evaluation
    of the facts. However, as long as reasons have been stated, even if incorrect, unconvincing or
    non-exhaustive, the award cannot be annulled on this ground. Article 52(1)(e) does not permit
    any enquiry into the quality or persuasiveness of reasons.” Ioan Micula, Viorel Micula and

   “It is nevertheless necessary to distinguish between the non-application by the arbitral Tribunal

   “Within the carefully balanced system of remedies established by the ICSID Convention and
    the Arbitration Rules, annulment is concerned with ensuring the fundamental fairness and
    integrity of the underlying proceeding. As it has often been repeated, annulment is not an
    appeal and an annulment committee is not empowered to review the substantive correctness of
    the Award, either in fact or in law. An annulment committee may not, within the confines of
    an annulment proceeding, review the assessment of the factual record by a tribunal.” TECO

   “An ad hoc Committee retains a measure of discretion in ruling on applications for annulment.
    To be sure, its discretion is not unlimited and should not be exercised to the point of defeating

    award. In this respect, the Committee agrees with Claimant that the annulment proceeding
    concerns serious procedural irregularities in the decisional process rather than an appeal on the
    merits. The limited and exceptional nature of the annulment remedy provided by Article 52 of
    the ICSID Convention forbids an inquiry on the substance of the case, on the misapplication

    committee has some discretion and is not under an obligation to annul even if it finds that there
    is a ground for annulment listed in Article 52(1). Decisions on applications for annulment

   “The Committee considers that the [final sentence of Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention]
    clearly indicate[s] that committees were intended to have a degree of discretion. To say that a
    committee ‘shall have the authority to annul the award’ is very different from saying that a
    committee ‘shall annul the award’. Moreover, the Committee notes that other ad hoc
    committees have proceeded on the basis that annulment was not mandatory and that they
    enjoyed a discretion whether or not to annul the award under consideration. The Committee
    concludes that, even if an Article 52(1) ground is made out, it nevertheless retains a discretion
    as to whether or not to annul the award. That discretion is by no means unlimited and must
    take account of all relevant circumstances, including the gravity of the circumstances which
    constitute the ground for annulment and whether or not they had – or could have had – a
    material effect upon the outcome of the case, as well as the importance of the finality of the
    award and the overall question of fairness to both Parties.” EDF International S.A., SAUR

   “[I]t is also undisputed that an annulment committee should not review the merits. It is not the
    duty of an ad hoc committee under the ICSID Convention to revisit the merits of the case, or
    to comment on what it would have decided on the merits had it acted as an arbitral tribunal.
    Annulment is an exceptional recourse that should consider the finality of the award.” Total
    S.A. v. Argentine Republic, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/1, Decision on Annulment, para. 165
    (February 1, 2016).

   “Thus, the grounds for annulment should be interpreted as being exhaustive, considering their
    object and purpose, as an exceptional remedy, against an award that is otherwise considered
    final and binding.” Total S.A. v. Argentine Republic, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/1, Decision on

(5) Article 52 should be interpreted in accordance with its object and purpose, neither
narrowly nor broadly

   “[A]pplication of the paragraph demands neither a narrow interpretation, nor a broad
    interpretation, but an appropriate interpretation, taking into account the legitimate concern to
    surround the exercise of the remedy to the maximum extent possible with guarantees in order
    to achieve a harmonious balance between the various objectives of the Convention.” Klöckner

   “The fact that annulment is a limited, and in that sense extraordinary, remedy might suggest
    either that the terms of Article 52(1), i.e., the grounds for annulment, should be strictly
    construed or, on the contrary, that they should be given a liberal interpretation since they
    represent the only remedy against unjust awards. The Committee has no difficulty in rejecting
    either suggestion. In its view, Article 52(1) should be interpreted in accordance with its object
    and purpose, which excludes on the one hand, as already stated, extending its application to

   “Article 52(1) should be interpreted in accordance with its object and purpose: this precludes
    its application to the review of an Award on the merits and in a converse case excludes an

    was intended.” Amco Asia Corporation and others v. Republic of Indonesia (Amco II), ICSID

   “As has been stated in earlier published decisions made on requests for annulment of ICSID
    awards, the remedy of Article 52 is in no sense an appeal. The power for review is limited to
    the grounds of annulment as defined in this provision. These grounds are to be interpreted

   “Article 52 of the ICSID Convention must be read in accordance with the principles of treaty

    object and purpose of the treaty. Some commentators have suggested that in case of doubt, an
    annulment committee should decide in favor of the validity of the award. Such presumption,
    however, finds no basis in the text of Article 52 and has not been used by annulment

   “ICSID ad hoc committees have affirmed in their decisions, and this Committee agrees, that
    (a) the grounds listed in Article 52(1) are the only grounds on which an award may be annulled;
    (b) annulment is an exceptional and narrowly circumscribed remedy and the role of an ad hoc
    committee is limited; (c) ad hoc committees are not courts of appeal, annulment is not a remedy
    against an incorrect decision, and an ad hoc Committee cannot substitute the tribunal’s
    determination on the merits for its own; (d) ad hoc committees should exercise their discretion
    not to defeat the object and purpose of the remedy or erode the binding force and finality of
    awards; (e) Article 52 should be interpreted in accordance with its object and purpose, neither
    narrowly nor broadly: and (f) an ad hoc committee’s authority to annul is circumscribed by the

   “[M]erely because the Parties agree on the total or partial annulment of the Award on the same

   “[W]here a ground for annulment is established, it is for the ad hoc committee, and not the
    requesting party, to determine the extent of the annulment. In making this determination, the

   “The ad hoc Committee derives its authority from the same source, the parties’ will, as the
    Arbitral Tribunal itself. Its authority is no more legitimate than that of the Arbitral Tribunal. It
    should therefore refrain from deciding to annul too hastily.” Consortium R.F.C.C. v. Kingdom

   “Once an ad hoc committee has concluded that there is one instance of manifest excess of
    powers (or any other ground for annulment), which warrants annulment of the Award in its
    entirety, this will be the end of the ad hoc committee’s examination. Since annulment of an
    award in its entirety necessarily leads to the loss of the res judicata effect of all matters
    adjudicated by the Tribunal, it is unnecessary to consider whether there are other grounds -
    whether in respect of the same matter or other matters - that may also lead to annulment. On
    the other hand, an ad hoc committee will need to proceed differently where it decides not to
    annul the Award or decides to annul the Award only in part. In those instances it will be
    necessary for the ad hoc committee to examine all of the grounds invoked by the applicant in
    support of its application.” Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic, ICSID Case

   “Awards can be annulled in their entirety ‘or any part thereof’ [Article 52 (3)]. Committees,
    however, are not empowered to amend or replace such awards, nor to review the merits of the

B.         The Interpretation of Specific Grounds

       75. The grounds for annulment in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention are: (a) the improper
           constitution of the Tribunal; (b) manifest excess of powers by the Tribunal; (c) corruption
           on the part of a Tribunal member; (d) a serious departure from a fundamental rule of
           procedure; and (e) failure to state reasons. Grounds (b), (d) and (e) are the most frequently
           relied upon grounds for annulment and they are usually invoked cumulatively in support
           of the application to annul an award.139

       76. The specific grounds for annulment were discussed in the drafting history of the ICSID
           Convention and have been extensively analyzed and interpreted in ICSID cases, in
           particular grounds (b), (d) and (e). The following is a brief summary of the meaning of
           these grounds as indicated in the drafting history and as interpreted by ad hoc Committees.
           The table at Annex 2 details the grounds invoked in annulment decisions, showing which
           were upheld and rejected.140

                    (i)       Improper Constitution of the Tribunal

       77. The drafting history of the ICSID Convention indicates that the ground of improper
           constitution of the Tribunal was intended to cover situations such as a departure from the




139
      ICSID Convention Article 52(1) provides that a party may request annulment “on one or more” grounds.
140
      See “Annulment Grounds in Concluded Proceedings,” Annex 2.


                                                                    53
            parties’ agreement on the method of constituting the Tribunal or an arbitrator’s failure to
            meet the nationality or other requirements for becoming a member of the Tribunal.141

        78. No provision of the ICSID Convention or rules explicitly addresses when a Tribunal might
            be considered to be improperly constituted. However, Chapter I of the ICSID Arbitration
            Rules, entitled “Establishment of the Tribunal,” provides detailed rules concerning
            constitution of a Tribunal, including nationality and other requirements for Tribunal
            members, the appointment process, and the arbitrator’s declaration of impartiality and
            independence.142 The parties may raise an objection concerning compliance with any of
            these provisions, which should be addressed by the Tribunal as soon as it has been
            constituted. In practice, Tribunals consistently ask the parties whether they have any
            objection to the constitution of the Tribunal or to any individual member during the
            Tribunal’s first session dealing with procedural matters.143 If a Tribunal decides that it has
            been properly constituted following an objection by a party, that party must await the
            Tribunal’s award before filing an application for annulment on this ground.144

        79. Improper constitution of a Tribunal has been raised in only 5 annulment cases leading to
            decisions. Four rejected the allegation based on this ground.145 In a fifth case, the ad hoc
            Committee did not address the ground, as it had already decided to annul the award in full
            based on another ground.146

        80. The 5 decisions indicate that annulment applications based on this ground are likely to
            succeed only in rare circumstances. One annulment decision held that the ad hoc
            Committee’s role is limited to considering whether the provisions concerning constitution
            of the Tribunal were respected in the original proceeding, and does not extend to matters
            such as review of the Tribunal’s decision on a request for disqualification of a Tribunal
            member under Article 58 of the Convention.147 Ad hoc Committees have also indicated that
            a party with knowledge of an alleged improper constitution of the Tribunal in the original
            proceeding who fails to raise such issue may be taken to have waived its right to raise this
            as a ground for annulment.148

                     (ii)       Manifest Excess of Powers

        81. The drafters of the ICSID Convention anticipated an excess of powers when a Tribunal
            went beyond the scope of the parties’ arbitration agreement, decided points which had not

           been submitted to it, or failed to apply the law agreed to by the parties.149 The main powers
           of the Tribunal that appear to have been contemplated by this provision thus relate to the
           Tribunal’s jurisdiction and to the applicable law. These two categories will be described
           separately below.

       82. Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention provides that only instances of “manifest” excess
           of the Tribunal’s powers may lead to an annulment, indicating a dual requirement of an
           “excess” that is “manifest.”150 As a result, ad hoc Committees have identified two
           methodological approaches to determine whether there is an annullable error on this
           ground. The first is a two-step analysis determining whether there was an excess of powers
           and, if so, whether the excess was “manifest.”151 The second is a prima facie test, consisting
           of a summary examination to determine whether any of the alleged excesses of power could
           be viewed as “manifest.”152

       83. The “manifest” nature of the excess of powers has been interpreted by most ad hoc
           Committees to mean an excess that is obvious, clear or self-evident,153 and which is
           discernable without the need for an elaborate analysis of the award.154 However, some ad
           hoc Committees have interpreted the meaning of “manifest” to require that the excess be
           serious or material to the outcome of the case.155

       84. Manifest excess of powers has been invoked in every case but one leading to a decision on
           annulment.156 There have been 9 instances of partial or full annulment on this basis.157

                             (a)     Manifest Excess of Powers Relating to Jurisdiction

       85. A Tribunal is expected to observe the parties’ arbitration agreement. If a Tribunal goes
           beyond the scope of the parties’ arbitration agreement, it in effect surpasses the mandate
           granted to it by the parties. In addition, the ICSID Convention prescribes certain mandatory
           requirements that must be fulfilled for a Tribunal to have jurisdiction.158 These
           jurisdictional requirements require: (i) ‘a legal dispute;’ (ii) ‘arising directly out of an
           investment;’ (iii) ‘between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency
           of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State);’ (iv) ‘and a national of
           another Contracting State;’ (v) ‘which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit
           to the Centre.’159 The parties cannot agree to derogate from these criteria. In fact, the
           Tribunal must decline jurisdiction where a mandatory requirement is not met, even if
           neither party has raised any objection to jurisdiction.160

       86. Objections to jurisdiction are often raised in international investment cases and the
           jurisdictional requirements have been extensively discussed and analyzed in such cases.

       87. Ad hoc Committees have held that there may be an excess of powers if a Tribunal
           incorrectly concludes that it has jurisdiction when in fact jurisdiction is lacking,161 or when
           the Tribunal exceeds the scope of its jurisdiction.162 It has been recognized, in the inverse
           case, that a Tribunal’s rejection of jurisdiction when jurisdiction exists also amounts to an
           excess of powers.163

       88. At the same time, ad hoc Committees have acknowledged the principle specifically
           provided by the Convention that the Tribunal is the judge of its own competence. 164 This
           means that the Tribunal has the power to decide whether it has jurisdiction to hear the
           parties’ dispute based on the parties’ arbitration agreement and the jurisdictional
           requirements in the ICSID Convention. In light of this principle, the drafting history
           suggests —and most ad hoc Committees have reasoned— that in order to annul an award
           based on a Tribunal’s determination of the scope of its own jurisdiction, the excess of
           powers must be “manifest.”165 However, one ad hoc Committee found that an excess of
           jurisdiction or failure to exercise jurisdiction is a manifest excess of powers when it is
           capable of affecting the outcome of the case.166

       89. The issue of lack or excess of jurisdiction has been ruled on in 30 annulment decisions and
           has led to one full and one partial annulment.167 In addition, the non-exercise of an existing
           jurisdiction has been decided in 13 decisions and has resulted in one full and 2 partial
           annulments.168

                              (b)       Manifest Excess of Powers Relating to the Applicable Law

       90. The drafting history of the ICSID Convention shows that a Tribunal’s failure to apply the
           proper law could constitute a manifest excess of powers, but that erroneous application of
           the law could not amount to an annullable error, even if it is manifest.169 As stated above,
           there is no basis for an annulment due to an incorrect decision by a Tribunal, a principle
           that has been expressly recognized by many ad hoc Committees.170

       91. The ICSID Convention provides as follows concerning the law to be applied by a Tribunal:

                     The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as
                     may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal
                     shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including

                     be applicable.171

       92. Where the parties’ agree on applicable law, a disregard of this law would likely be
           equivalent to a derogation from the mandate conferred on the Tribunal by the parties.

       93. Ad hoc Committees agree that a Tribunal’s complete failure to apply the proper law or
           acting ex aequo et bono without agreement of the parties to do so as required by the ICSID
           Convention could constitute a manifest excess of powers.172 However, ad hoc Committees
           have taken different approaches to whether an error in the application of the proper law
           may effectively amount to non-application of the proper law. Some ad hoc Committees
           have concluded that gross or egregious misapplication or misinterpretation of the law may
           lead to annulment,173 while others have found that such an approach comes too close to an
           appeal.174 Similarly, ad hoc Committees have discussed whether application of a law
           different from that purportedly applied by the Tribunal could be considered a manifest
           excess of powers.175 These discussions have led ad hoc Committees to observe that there
           is sometimes a fine line between failure to apply the proper law and erroneous application
           of the law.176 In this connection, one issue discussed by some ad hoc Committees concerns
           which rules of law apply when consent to arbitration is based on an arbitration clause in a
           bilateral investment treaty.177

       94. The failure to apply the proper law has been invoked in 44 out of 52 annulment decisions.
           It has led to two partial and two full annulments.178

       96. When an arbitrator agrees to serve as a member of a Tribunal, the arbitrator is required to
           sign a declaration that he or she “shall not accept any instruction or compensation with
           regard to the proceeding from any source except as provided in the ICSID Convention.”181
           An arbitrator’s conduct in breach of that declaration can thus lead to annulment of an
           award. If a party has knowledge of such conduct during the proceeding before the Tribunal,
           it should file a request for disqualification based on Article 57 of the ICSID Convention.

       97. This ground has not been dealt with in any decision on annulment to date.

                     (iv)     Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure

       98. It appears from the drafting history of the ICSID Convention that the ground of a “serious
           departure from a fundamental rule of procedure” has a wide connotation including
           principles of natural justice, but that it excludes the Tribunal’s failure to observe ordinary
           arbitration rules. The phrase “fundamental rules of procedure” was explained by the
           drafters as a reference to principles.182 One such fundamental principle mentioned during
           the negotiations was the parties’ right to be heard.183 The drafting history thus indicates
           that this ground is concerned with the integrity and fairness of the arbitral process.

       99. Based on the words “serious” and “fundamental” in this ground, ad hoc Committees have
           adopted a dual analysis: the departure from a rule of procedure must be serious and the rule
           must be fundamental.184 Ad hoc Committees have thus consistently held that not every
           departure from a rule of procedure justifies annulment.185 Examples of fundamental rules
           of procedure identified by ad hoc Committees concern: (i) the equal treatment of the
           parties; 186 (ii) the right to be heard; 187 (iii) an independent and impartial Tribunal;188 (iv)

            the treatment of evidence and burden of proof;189 and (v) deliberations among members of
            the Tribunal.190

      100. The task of determining whether an alleged fundamental rule of procedure has been
           seriously breached is usually very fact specific, involving an examination of the conduct
           of the proceeding before the Tribunal. Some ad hoc Committees have required that the
           departure have a material impact on the outcome of the award for the annulment to
           succeed.191

      101. The ground of serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure has been pursued in
           41 proceedings which led to annulment decisions. It resulted in the annulment in full of
           one award, the annulment in part of two further awards, and in the annulment of one
           decision on supplemental decisions and rectification.192

                     (v)       Failure to State the Reasons on which the Award is Based

      102. During the drafting of the ICSID Convention, the ground of “failure to state the reasons on
           which the award is based” was originally included in the ground of a “serious departure
           from a fundamental rule of procedure.”193 It subsequently became a stand-alone ground. In
           addition, a proposed qualifier enabling parties to waive the requirement that reasons be
           stated was eliminated during the negotiation of the Convention.194 This elimination of the
           proposed waiver related to the removal of the same discretion in another provision in the
           Convention, which now reads: “[t]he award shall deal with every question submitted to the
           Tribunal, and shall state the reasons upon which it is based.”195 There is thus a clear link
           between the provision in the Convention requiring the Tribunal to state the reasons for the
           award, and the ground providing for annulment when there has been a failure to provide
           the reasons on which the award is based. The drafting history of the Convention concerning
           annulment based on a failure to state reasons does not provide further guidance as to when
           such a failure has occurred, nor does the Convention specify the manner in which a
           Tribunal’s reasons should be stated.

      103. While a Tribunal must deal with every question submitted to it, the drafting history
           indicates that a failure to do so should not result in annulment.196 Instead, the ICSID
           Convention provides another remedy where a Tribunal fails to address a question: the

            concerning the question not addressed.197 In addition, if there is a dispute between the
            parties as to the meaning or scope of the award, either party may request interpretation of
            the award by the original Tribunal.198 Therefore, certain issues relating to the reasoning or
            lack of reasoning in an award can be heard by the Tribunal that rendered the award.199

      104. At the same time, if a Tribunal’s failure to address a particular question submitted to it
           might have affected the Tribunal’s ultimate decision, this could, in the view of some ad
           hoc Committees, amount to a failure to state reasons and could warrant annulment.200 Ad
           hoc Committees have also noted that such failure could amount to a serious departure from
           a fundamental rule of procedure.201 A recent Decision on Annulment found that the failure
           to address certain evidence relevant to the determination of damages amounted to a failure
           to state the reasons.202

      105. Ad hoc Committees have explained that the requirement to state reasons is intended to
           ensure that parties can understand the reasoning of the Tribunal, meaning the reader can
           understand the facts and law applied by the Tribunal in coming to its conclusion.203 The
           correctness of the reasoning or whether it is convincing is not relevant.204

that a tribunal can simply gloss over evidence upon which the Parties have placed significant emphasis, without any
analysis and without explaining why it found that evidence insufficient, unpersuasive or otherwise unsatisfactory.”

      106. Some ad hoc Committees have suggested that “insufficient” and “inadequate” reasons
           could result in annulment.205 However, the extent of insufficiency and inadequacy required
           to justify annulment on this basis has been debated.206 Other ad hoc Committees have
           suggested that they have discretion to further explain, clarify, or infer the reasoning of the
           Tribunal rather than annul the award.207

      107. Finally, a majority of ad hoc Committees have concluded that “frivolous” and
           “contradictory” reasons are equivalent to no reasons and could justify an annulment.208

      108. The ground of failure to state the reasons on which the award is based has been invoked by
           parties in 50 proceedings leading to decisions. The ground was upheld in 8 cases which
           resulted in 2 full and 6 partial annulments.209

VI.        Conclusion

      109. It is clear that annulment is a limited and exceptional recourse, available only on the basis
           of the grounds enumerated in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention. It safeguards against
           “violation of the fundamental principles of law governing the Tribunal’s proceedings.”210

      110. While there is agreement on the general standards for annulment, commentators sometimes
           disagree on whether a specific case has been decided correctly or incorrectly. 211 The
           complexity of the task assigned to ad hoc Committees was summarized by Broches as
           follows:



205
   Mitchell, para. 21 (“a failure to state reasons exists whenever reasons are... so inadequate that the coherence of the
reasoning is seriously affected”); Soufraki, paras. 122-26 (“insufficient or inadequate reasons, which are insufficient
to bring about the solution or inadequate to explain the result arrived at by the Tribunal”) ; TECO, paras. 248-250.
206
    Compare Amco I, para. 43 (“sufficiently pertinent reasons”), and Klöckner I, para. 120 (“sufficiently relevant”),
with Amco II, para. 7.55 (“no justification for adding a further requirement that the reasons stated be ‘sufficiently
pertinent’”), and MINE, para. 5.08 (“[t]he adequacy of the reasoning is not an appropriate standard of review”) ;
Iberdrola, para. 94 (“this Committee considers that the annulment mechanism does not allow it to review the adequacy
of the reasoning of the Award”) [unofficial translation from Spanish]; Occidental, para. 64; TECO, paras. 249-250.
207
   Vivendi II, para. 248; Wena, para. 83; Soufraki, para. 24; CMS, para. 127; Rumeli, para. 83 (with the caveat that if
non-stated reasons “do not necessarily follow or flow from the award’s reasoning, an ad hoc committee should not
construct reasons in order to justify the decision of the tribunal” ).

   A number of authors have analyzed and commented on annulment decisions and the annulment mechanism
generally. Such discussions are included in the bibliography at Annex 3 of this paper.

                    Annulment is an essential but exceptional remedy. It is well understood that
                    the grounds listed in Article 52(1) are the only grounds on which an award
                    may be annulled. [footnote omitted] However, the application of that
                    paragraph places a heavy responsibility on the ad hoc committees which
                    must rule on requests for annulment. For example, in relation to a Tribunal’s
                    alleged “excess of powers” they may have to make fine distinctions between
                    failure to apply the applicable law, which is a ground for annulment, and
                    incorrect interpretation of that law, which is not. With respect to allegations
                    that a tribunal’s failure to deal with questions submitted to it constitutes a
                    serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, or failure to state
                    the reasons on which the award is based, they will have to assess the
                    relevance of those questions, that is to say, their nature and potential effect,
                    had they been dealt with, on the tribunal’s award. They are also likely to be
                    called on to give specific meaning to such terms as “manifest,” “serious
                    departure” and “fundamental rule of procedure” in judging the admissibility
                    of claims for annulment.

                    After these determinations have been made on the basis of objective legal
                    analysis, the ad hoc committees may be faced with the delicate final task of
                    weighing the conflicting claims of finality of the award, on the one hand
                    and, on the other, of protection of parties against procedural injustice, as
                    defined in the five sub-paragraphs of Article 52(1). This requires that an ad
                    hoc committee be able to exercise a measure of discretion in ruling on
                    applications for annulment.212

      111. The task of an ad hoc Committee should also be assessed in the overall context of the
           ICSID case load. In its 50 year history, ICSID has registered 505 Convention arbitration
           cases and rendered 228 awards. Of these, 5 awards have been annulled in full and another
           10 awards have been partially annulled. In other words, only 2 percent of all ICSID awards
           have led to full annulment and 4 percent have led to partial annulment.

      112. While the number of applications for annulment registered annually fluctuates, the increase
           in annulment applications in the last 5 years reflects the vastly increased number of cases
           registered and awards rendered at ICSID in this same period. Since January 2011, 101
           Convention awards were rendered, 49 annulment proceedings were instituted and 3 awards
           were partially annulled.213 At the same time, the number of discontinued applications for
           annulment has increased substantially, with 14 discontinuances since 2011. By
           comparison, in the period 2001 – 2010, 96 Convention awards were rendered, 33
           annulments instituted, 8 awards were annulled in full or in part and 5 annulment
           applications were discontinued. Between 1971 – 2000, 31 awards were rendered, 6
           annulment proceedings were instituted, 4 awards were annulled in full or in part (13 percent
           of awards were annulled in part or in full) and one was discontinued. As a result, the rate
           of annulment for the period since January 2011 is 3 percent, while the annulment rate for
           the years 1971 – 2000 is 13 percent, and the rate for the decade 2001 – 2010 is 8 percent.
