x   Status of Water Sector Regulation in the Middle East and North Africa
Chapter 1   Introduction
            Thelma Triche and Yogita U. Mumssen


                                                          Abstract
            This chapter presents an overview of economic regulation of the water supply and sanitation
            (WSS) sector, briefly describes regulation of WSS in seven countries around the world, explains
            why regulation of WSS is relevant to the Middle East and North Africa, and outlines the objec-
            tives and methodology of this study.


            An Overview of Economic Regulation of Water Supply
            and Sanitation Services
            Objectives of Economic Regulation
            Economic regulation generally refers to the laws, regulations, enforcement mechanisms,
            incentives, and processes that are employed by governments to ensure that essential ser-
            vices such as water supply and sanitation services (WSS) are available to the population at
            reasonable prices. Regulation is necessary because WSS are natural monopolies and there is
            no competition in the market.1 As a result, there is little pressure on service providers to
            maintain service quality, operate efficiently to keep prices down, and serve marginal and
            less profitable areas. This is true whether service providers are public or private, but the
            formal regulation of WSS became a topic of international interest in the late 1980s when the
            rising cost of infrastructure needed to serve expanding populations and protect the environ-
            ment led policy makers to seek private investment.
              The problem of low coverage levels, particularly among poor and marginal communities, is
            of particular concern in developing countries and those with rapid rates of population growth
            and migration. The essential nature of WSS and their benefits for public health and economic
            productivity make it imperative that all households have access to service, including those in
            neighborhoods that are difficult to serve or where the cost of basic service might exceed what
            households are able to pay. Another major concern for developing countries is to ensure that
            WSS are financially viable. This is essential to ensuring that investment finance for the costly
            infrastructure can be attracted, that services do not become an unmanageable drain on pub-
            lic funds, and that they are technically and financially sustainable over the long term.
              The main objectives of economic regulation of water supply and sanitation services2 are
            thus to ensure that:

            •	 All households have access to services at reasonable prices that reflect the cost of efficient
              services.

            •	 The quality of service for households and other customers is appropriate: service is
              ­
              reliable, water for human consumption meets drinking water standards, effluents meet
              standards for reducing pollution, and so on.

    •	 The services are financially viable and sustainable, do not pose an excessive financial
      drain on public funds, and can attract necessary investment funding.

    •	 Services are managed and operated in an efficient and technically effective manner.

    •	 Tariffs (supplemented, if necessary, by other predictable and reliable sources of funding)
      reflect the cost of providing efficient services and provide incentives to both operators
      and customers to reduce waste, and processes to set tariffs are transparent and
      predictable.

    •	 Operators are responsive to customers’ complaints and inquiries, and customers have a
      voice in the planning of services and access to an appeals process to resolve conflicts.

    •	 Information about the quality of services, the full cost of providing services, and the per-
      formance of operators is available.

      A few comments on these objectives are warranted. The main challenges faced by a
    country and the objectives it needs to pursue may differ significantly from those faced in
    other countries, and they may differ over time within the same country. Thus regulators
    must determine which objectives are most important at any one time and design regula-
    tory approaches and efforts to address them. The examples presented in the second sec-
    tion of this chapter illustrate how different countries have addressed their different
    challenges.
      The affordability of services for low-income households presents a dilemma for regulators.
    The general view is that economic regulators should focus on ensuring the financial viability
    of the services, while governments should provide guidance on how to achieve social policy
    objectives, such as affordability, in a transparent manner that does not undermine the finan-
    cial viability of services.
      Finally, the basic list of objectives of regulation are the same, regardless of whether ­services
    are provided by a public or private service provider, but achieving the objectives may require
    different regulatory approaches. Experience has shown that ensuring universal access to
    services is a challenge in both public and private services. However, depending on whether
    the provider is public or private, the challenge of capturing efficiency improvements to ben-
    efit customers differs. Private operators generally have an incentive to improve efficiency in
    order to increase profits for the owners. In that case, the regulator’s challenge is to capture
    some of the cost savings for customers. Public companies are typically not motivated by
    profits and financial penalties are likely to hurt customers, so other incentives such as
    rewards and mechanisms such as the publication of performance indicators to create social
    pressure are needed to promote efficiency improvements.


    Regulatory Functions and Processes
    Although institutional arrangements and approaches may vary from one country to another,
    regulation of WSS typically includes the specification of rules, standards, and procedures,
    and enforcement of rules and standards and decisions about market structure.

  Rule-making includes the specification of regulations governing matters, such as:

•	 Principles, rules, and formulas governing tariff levels and tariff structure

•	 Procedures and conditions governing formal tariff reviews and automatic tariff adjust-
  ments (for example, to take into account price inflation or movements in exchange rates)

•	 Service access and service quality standards and targets

•	 Technical and efficiency performance standards and targets

•	 Consequences (rewards or penalties) for achieving or not achieving standards or targets

•	 Requirements for operators to submit reports and publish information on service quality
  and performance, and for independent audits of such information

•	 Customer rights and obligations

•	 Requirements governing customer contracts, customer relations, and resolution of complaints

•	 Market structure and rules governing the tendering of operational contracts.

  Enforcement activities may include:

•	 Formal tariff reviews and approval and publication of tariff levels and tariff structure

•	 Review and verification of reports on service access, service quality, and operator efficiency

•	 Imposing consequences for performance or specifying actions to be taken by the service
  providers to improve performance

•	 Resolution of conflicts between service providers and customers

•	 Comparison of operator performance with similar operators or benchmarks

•	 Publication of information about service access, service quality, customer satisfaction,
  and operator performance

•	 Rulings on proposed mergers or the award of operational contracts, and the issuing
  (or revoking) of licenses.

Two Different Approaches: Regulation by Agency and Regulation by Contract
Regulation by agency is the approach in which a regulatory body is given discretionary
powers by government to control tariffs and service standards, subject to existing law and
­
the regulatory body’s mandate. This is the approach that was adopted in the United Kingdom
when WSS services in England and Wales were privatized in 1989.
  Regulation by contract is the approach whereby a public entity and a service provider agree
on contractual clauses that determine how tariffs and service standards are controlled, also
subject to existing law. Under regulation by contract, an oversight institution (and some-
times independent auditors, mediators, or arbitrators) may be responsible for monitoring
performance and making regulatory decisions. However, the mandate of these institutions
should be governed by the contract, and should be altered only through the agreement of
both parties (Castalia Strategic Advisors 2006, 2, 8, 9). Regulation by contract has long been
used in France, where private companies operate a large portion of the WSS services.

    The Enabling Environment and Reality on the Ground
    The term regulatory framework usually refers broadly to both the enabling environment
    that supports accountability, transparency, and the achievement of regulatory objectives as
    well as the specific regulatory rules, mechanisms, and procedures that are applied as part of
    the regulatory process. The enabling environment includes: the broad economic and legal
    foundations, political economy, and prevailing cultural attitudes in a country or service
    area; specific laws, policies, and strategies for the development and regulation of water
    resources and WSS services; and the institutional structure of the sector and relationships
    among actors. All these elements are important and weakness or barriers in any one part of
    the enabling environment can undermine the effectiveness of regulation. Figure 1.1 illus-
    trates the enabling environment for water sector regulation. The regulatory framework and
    the enabling environment are situated within a physical and economic environment—the
    “reality on the ground,” which also influences regulatory priorities and choices.
      Legal and economic foundations. A country’s legal and economic foundations and conven-
    tions must be taken into account in designing a regulatory framework. Aspects of the political
    economy (such as the role that government and other interests play in the allocation of
    resources, the level of transparency of government actions, the ability of regulators to act
    independently of political interference, confidence in public authorities, and concerns about
    the political impact of tariff increases) play a role in whether a regulator can function effec-
                                historical traditions, and public solidarity are also important.
    tively. Cultural attitudes, ­
    For example, in some countries, there is an established expectation that WSS should be man-
    aged like businesses. In others, the expectation that they be provided as social services out-
    side the sphere of business is stronger. For example, in many countries in the Middle East and
    North Africa, all residential customers benefit from highly subsidized tariffs for the first block
    (or blocks) of consumption. Thus, the introduction of principles such as transparency, cost
    recovery, and financial viability must be tailored to the local context and, as discussed later in
    this chapter, strategies may need to be formulated to improve the enabling environment and
    reduce barriers to effective regulation.
      WSS laws, policies, and strategies. Laws, policies and other instruments that establish
    basic principles and objectives, such as universal access to services, financial viability, the
    sustainable management of water resources, and the autonomy of service providers,
    ­
    provide a foundation for good regulation. Policies (whether stated in law or in separate
    policy statements) that specify funding sources, the extent to which costs will be recov-
    ered through tariffs, how service providers are governed, the independence of regulators,
    how they are appointed, and the like, constitute the next rung in a good foundation.
    Finally, strategies, plans, and directives that specify how the policies will be implemented
    are equally important. However well drafted they are, laws, policies, and strategies can
    be  undermined by the reality on the ground, and aspects of the political economy and
    cultural attitudes already discussed. These must be taken into account. For example, if
    tariffs are  extremely low and high-cost investments are needed immediately to secure

                                                     separation of operational entities from political and regulatory entities. Separating these

    functions reduces conflicts of interests and makes the cost of service more transparent.
    Autonomy enables service providers to make decisions based on technical and financial cri-
    teria and makes it possible to hold them accountable for results.
      Market structure is another aspect of institutional structure.3 For example, market integra-
    tion, either horizontally or vertically, may be used to promote economies of scale, especially
    in small markets. Disaggregation may be used to attract investment in production or treat-
    ment, or to improve the responsiveness of operators to customers at the local level, to make
    the cost of each activity more transparent, or to make it possible to introduce competition
    for the market or comparative competition.4 For these reasons it may be desirable for an
                                                            ­ tructure, especially if there is no
    economic regulator to play a role in determining market s
    other agency, such as a competition authority, charged with doing so.
      Reality on the ground. In addition to the enabling environment per se, another important
    component of the context is the reality on the ground—including factors that are outside the
    immediate control of the government, such as the availability of water resources, the
    strength of the economy, the capacity of public institutions, the current physical condition
    of WSS services, and the percentage of the population that is able to pay full cost. In some
    situations, the best strategy—both technically and politically—might be to increase capacity
    and promote technical improvements and efficiency before increasing tariffs significantly.
    In some cases, very simple regulatory approaches such as the collection and analysis of
    information on operators’ performance and quality of services combined with public aware-
    ness campaigns about the value of water may be more appropriate as an initial step—and
    more likely to succeed. In others, more complex regulatory approaches may be appropriate
    and effective.


    Desirable Features of Regulation
    In addition to the importance of a strong legal framework and enabling environment,
    ­
    economic regulation is most likely to be successful when it is characterized by:

    •	 Cost-effectiveness. The cost of regulation is reasonable and does not exceed the benefits.
      It should not impose a costly burden on either the regulated entities or the regulator.

    •	 Transparency. The reasons for regulatory decisions are made public. Transparency builds
      trust in the system and engages stakeholders. When stakeholders can see that decisions
      are based on fair and objective criteria (such as improving service quality, financial viabil-
      ity or efficiency), they are more likely to accept the decisions and support enforcement.
      A lack of transparency may lead to suspicions that special interests are being favored.

    •	 Predictability. Rules are clearly specified in adequate detail, and the regulator reliably
      abides by and enforces the rules and does not arbitrarily change them without warning
      and consultation.

    •	 Fairness. The rules and regulatory decisions aim to balance the interests of customers,
      service providers, and investors (whether public or private).


6   Status of Water Sector Regulation in the Middle East and North Africa
•	 Independence. The independence of the regulator (as a separate entity, perhaps with its own
  source of funding through fees paid by customers or the regulated entities) and the insula-
  tion of regulatory decisions from short-term political interests or other special interests
  ensure that regulation is based on clearly articulated rules and principles. However, the
  degree of independence of regulators depends on the country context. Moreover, experi-
  ence has shown that regulation by political authorities may work quite well if elected author-
  ities are bound by a strong legal framework and if the other conditions listed are present.5

  In addition to these features, experience shows that several other themes are important,
such as the following:


•	 Decentralized services versus centralized regulatory agencies. Developing countries with lim-
  ited administrative capacity and budgetary resources face a dilemma. They may have no
  choice but to organize regulation at the national level, but the decentralized nature of service
  delivery requires decentralized monitoring and enforcement mechanisms, and, particularly,
  arrangements for assisting customers to submit and resolve complaints. Creative solutions
  for a decentralized regulatory presence, such as those adopted by Mozambique, are needed.

•	 Multisector and regional regulators. Countries, especially small countries or provinces,
  may choose to create multi-service regulators, as in the United Arab Emirates and states of
  the United States, as a means of reducing costs by sharing certain functions across sectors
  and to promote regulatory consistency. Very small states such as island states may choose
  to create regional regulators to serve several countries, or the regulator in a larger country
  could be engaged to provide regulatory services to a very small nearby country.

•	 Consistency of regulatory arrangements with service provider contracts. Regulation by
  contract requires an appropriate institution that has the authority and the capacity to
  ­
                                                                                     ­ onsistent
  effectively enforce the contract and resolve disputes, and its authority should be c
  with and not override the terms of the contract (Castalia Strategic Advisors 2006, 8–9).

•	 Designing in politics. Since political intervention may be inevitable, it may be best to
  explicitly include a role for elected authorities in the regulatory framework (whether reg-
  ulation by contract or by regulatory agency). Ideally, this should be done in a way that
  ensures accountability and does not undermine the financial viability of services (Castalia
  Strategic Advisors 2006, 12). In practice, this seems to be difficult to achieve and political
  decisions are often not ideal, but designing in a political role may be better than the alter-
  native of unpredictable and arbitrary political intervention.

•	 Tools for dealing with crises. Unexpected events such as a dramatic change in exchange rates or
  natural disasters can change conditions to the point that normal tariff rules and periodic
  adjustment formulas or service conditions cannot be enforced. It helps to specify procedures
  for addressing such exceptional situations in advance (Castalia Strategic Advisors 2006, 16–17).

•	 Personal qualities of key individuals. Success is more likely when persons appointed to
  regulatory positions are highly committed and professional and are trusted by all parties.


Status of Water Sector Regulation in the Middle East and North Africa                            7
      This is most likely to happen when appointments and promotions are linked to profes-
      sional performance and proven trustworthiness.

    •	 Consultation with other important actors. To promote confidence in the regulatory frame-
                                                                            stakeholders, for
      work and ensure its effectiveness, regulators should consult with all ­
      example, through the formal submission of opinions by other government agencies,
      independent professionals, or advocacy groups, and by surveys of consumers.

    The Link with Water Resources Management
    Water resources management (WRM) aims to ensure the sustainability and quality of water
    resources, manage water shortages and avoid the economic, political and national security
    risks associated with water shortages. Thus, effective WRM helps ensure the availability of
    raw water in acceptable quantities and quality for water supply. The complementarity
    between economic regulation of WSS and WRM is obvious.
      Good economic regulation of WSS protects water resources by providing incentives
    for  efficient use of water. In particular, water supply tariffs that reflect the cost of
    abstracting, treating, and delivering water promote the efficient use of water and thereby
    reduce  the waste of water resources. Tariffs (or other sources of funding) that reflect
    the cost of collecting, treating, and disposing of wastewater make it possible for sewer-
    age treatment operators to meet effluent standards that protect water resources for
    other users.
      While economic regulation of WSS is concerned with market failure due to a lack of
    ­
    competition in the market and lack of access to services, WRM is concerned with a different
    type of market failure, the problem of externalities—costs imposed by overuse of resources
    or environmental damage for which users do not bear the costs directly. Correcting for exter-
    nalities requires different regulatory tools and institutional structures altogether than those
    used to correct for lack of competition and lack of access. Thus the economic regulation of
    WRM is distinct from the economic regulation of WSS and should generally be carried out by
    a different entity. In addition, WRM applies to all users of water resources, including agricul-
    ture, industry, navigation, hydroelectricity and recreation in addition to WSS. A strong WRM
    regime generally requires that all users who abstract water from ground or surface sources
    (and even rainwater in some places) obtain abstraction permits from the WRM entity and
    they may be required to pay abstraction fees based on the volume of water taken. Regulation
    by a separate entity that has no links to any of the users helps to ensure objectivity and avoid
    conflicts of interest.
      The importance of good economic regulation and its linkage to water resource manage-
    ment is probably most obvious in the Middle East and North Africa region, where countries
    are caught between improving access and service delivery at affordable levels and rapidly
    dwindling water resources that are becoming ever more costly to access. Chapters 2 through
    6 present five case studies of regulatory approaches in the WSS sector in the Middle East and
    North Africa.

Examples of Regulation of WSS in a Variety of Countries
Countries in many parts of the world have introduced institutional reforms in the WSS sector
that have included the separation of policy making from the operation of services. These
reforms usually involve the creation of autonomous public service companies or the con-
tracting of private operators, and the establishment of economic regulators for WSS. Others
are considering doing so as part of a strategy to improve the quality and financial viability of
services. A few examples will illustrate the variety of approaches and outcomes.6


Colombia
In Colombia, the 1991 Constitution decentralized responsibility for providing WSS services
to municipalities while retaining sector policy and regulatory functions at the national level.
A 1994 law specified that all WSS service providers must be set up as public services compa-
nies (ESPs) under commercial law, the stock of which may be owned entirely by the state or
private parties or a mix of public and private parties. The law also created an independent
regulator, the Commission for the Regulation of Water Supply and Sanitation (Comisión de
                                                               ­ esponsibility to issue reg-
Regulación de Agua Potable y Saneamiento Básico, CRA) with the r
ulations and standards for WSS, including tariff methodologies, service q
                                                                        ­ uality parameters,
methodologies to evaluate the efficiency of the providers, and rules governing competition
and market structure. One of the objectives of the reforms was to attract private investors
and operators and to ensure that they were regulated properly, but the legal and regulatory
framework applies to all service providers, whether public or private.
  While CRA issues the rules and regulations, a separate regulatory entity that was created
by the Constitution, the Superintendency of Residential Public Services (Superintendencia
de Servicios Públicos Domiciliarios, SSPD), is charged with enforcement and resolution of
customer complaints. Its functions include monitoring and enforcing regulations; penaliz-
ing violations; enforcing agreements between public service companies and their users;
establishing consistent information and accounting systems; overseeing the use of subsi-
dies; and evaluating companies’ financial, technical, and administrative management
(World Bank 2010, 28–33).7 In practice, it has proven difficult to impose financial penalties,
particularly on state-owned companies (Foster 2005).
  Tariff reform was introduced gradually, starting in 1996. The initial phase focused on stan-
dardizing basic accounting processes and calculating the cost of providing services under
existing conditions. The next phase introduced efficiency parameters aimed at controlling
costs. The third phase promoted the cost-effectiveness of investments in WSS, and improve-
ments in service quality. This process has led to greater efficiency, full funding of operations, a
significant increase in the funds available for investment, and significant improvements in
                                                                                          ­ overed
coverage and quality of services. By 2007, it was estimated that national tariff revenues c
an average of 32 percent of investment costs. Additionally, the increase in tariffs—which were
too low at the time the reform was introduced—generated price signals that were economically
more efficient and resulted in significant decreases in consumption. This made it possible to


Status of Water Sector Regulation in the Middle East and North Africa                            9
     postpone investments in expanding the capacity of the systems, thus limiting the need to
     mobilize investment finance (World Bank 2010, 40, 44, 75). Surveys in 2006 and 2007 of cus-
     tomers of two private companies operating in three cities indicated that the vast majority of
     customers were satisfied and that customer satisfaction had improved significantly since the
     private operators and the regulatory reforms had been introduced (World Bank 2010, 105, 170).
     These findings are not necessarily representative of the country as a whole.
       The reforms also introduced targeted subsidies and “solidarity” contributions, according
     to the economic strata of the users (which in Colombia are defined by a range of one to six,
     with one being the poorest). Strata 1, 2, and 3 customers receive maximum subsidies of 70,
     40, and 15 percent, respectively; those in stratum 4 pay the full cost of the service, and those
     in strata 5 and 6, as well as industrial and commercial users, pay a “solidarity contribution”
     of at least 20 percent over the full cost (World Bank 2010, 49).
       Local committees (Comités de Desarrollo y Control Social) may be created at the initiative
     of users of public services, including water, sanitation, waste collection, electricity, and gas,
     to collect information on customer satisfaction, lodge any complaints with the companies
     and the regulators, and make proposals for improving services or addressing problems
     (Foster 2005, 18). In 2013, the SSPD issued a detailed manual on the committees’ formation,
     functions, and activities. Only customers and potential customers are represented on the
     committees. Neither the regulators nor the service providers may participate. No informa-
     tion was found on how many committees have been formed or their activities.

     France
     Regulation by contract is widely used in France, where WSS services are the responsibility of the
     communes (local government entities, of which there are about 37,000). Communes may either
     directly manage WSS or delegate them to a private company through a management contract,
     affermage/lease contract, or concession.8 Private operators now participate in about 80 percent
     of the market and affermage is the most common form of contract. WSS remain public services
     to which all residents should have access. The infrastructure is the property of the communes,
     which are also responsible for investments, either directly or through concession contracts.
       There is no national economic regulatory body for WSS. However, services are subject to
     the water quality regulations of the European Union (EU) and French laws regarding pro-
     curement, technical standards, and water abstraction and effluents. EU and national entities
     and their decentralized units enforce these standards and rules. The contracting of private
     operators is subject to national regulations governing both the contractual forms and the
     tendering process. French contracts do not include a great deal of detail because France uses
     civil law and most of the regulatory details are embedded in national laws and regulations.
     In countries that use common law, contracts must include a great deal more detail if they are
     to serve as a basis for effective regulation by contract.
       French law requires that tariffs recover the full cost of operations and investments for WSS
     services, whether delegated to the private sector or operated by local authorities. However, in



10   Status of Water Sector Regulation in the Middle East and North Africa
the second half of the last century, an exception was made to achieve universal coverage in rural
areas, and high levels of subsidies flowed from urban to rural areas. If services are delegated, the
operator’s remuneration (which is specified in the contract as either a portion of tariff revenues
or all tariff revenues) is established by competitive bidding and negotiation. The tariff levels,
tariff structure, formulas for periodic adjustment of tariffs, and targets for operator performance
and service quality are also specified in the contracts, which are monitored and enforced by local
authorities. The main enforcement mechanisms are termination or nonrenewal of the contract.
  A 2012 report prepared for the Association of Water Service Providers (FP2E) found that over-
all satisfaction with services was high and that users generally believed that tap water was safe:
78 percent of the French reported that they drank tap water either daily or occasionally. In 2009,
the Association of French Mayors, the Assembly of Communities in France, and the water com-
panies joined forces to set up a water mediator. This mechanism constitutes a free and flexible
alternative to legal proceedings in court. Its other stated objective over the long term is to
improve the service offered to consumers (Demouliere and others 2012, 23–25). A 2007 study
found that prices for services provided by the private sector tended to be higher than those
provided by public operators because of higher fixed costs. The study also concluded that
affordability remains a problem for some low-income households (Prasad 2007, 22–23).

Peninsular Malaysia
In 2003 the federal government of Malaysia initiated a sector reform in peninsular Malaysia
(the part that is on the mainland) that aimed to make the sector more efficient, promote finan-
cial sustainability, and improve the customer orientation of service (Lee Koon Yew 2010).9
WSS became a shared responsibility between the states and the federal government.10,11
  The Water Services Industry Act of 2006 established a national Water Asset Management
Company (PAAB in Malay) and a Water Forum to give voice to previously under-represented
stakeholders such as consumers. The National Water Services Commission Act established a
National Water Services Commission (known by its Malay acronym as SPAN). The acts sepa-
rated the functions of policy making (by government), regulation (by SPAN), asset owner-
ship (entrusted to PAAB), and service provision (by state water companies). The laws were
enacted in 2008 after extensive public consultation. As part of the reform process, for the
first time in Malaysian history, a draft bill was made available for public discussion before it
was presented to Parliament (Lee Koon Yew 2010).
  SPAN issues licenses for water operators, mainly state water companies, and sets and
enforces standards and performance indicators. Licenses can theoretically be revoked if key
performance targets or other standards are not achieved.12
  In the long term, the federal government’s policy is that state operators should achieve full
cost recovery and attain financial independence. However, tariffs remain relatively low and
there are hidden subsidies, though operating costs are covered by revenues. Capital costs are
not yet being recovered. Government subsidies are funded primarily by revenues from the
national oil company Petronas, which also provides revenues to some states.13

     Mozambique
     In 1998, the government of Mozambique introduced the Delegated Management Framework
     (DMF) for water supply services in five major cities. In 2009, the DMF was expanded to include
     water supply and sanitation services in all urban areas. The DMF introduced three key institu-
     tional reforms, including the separation of asset management from operations, operation of
     services by autonomous service providers (whether public or private) under delegated man-
     agement contracts, and creation of an independent Water Regulation Council (Conselho de
     Regulação de Água, CRA) to regulate tariffs, service quality, and consumer rights.14 There are
     two asset management and investment entities: FIPAG, which is responsible for primary water
     supply systems (generally in the larger cities); and AIAS, which is responsible for secondary
     water supply systems (generally in smaller cities) and all sanitation systems (Nathan Associates
     2010, 3–6). All WSS assets are owned by the government or local authorities.
       The regulatory activities and effectiveness of the DMF and CRA are still evolving. Where
     feasible, the asset management entities delegate operation of the water supply and ­sewerage
     systems to operators under contracts that include service quality standards and perfor-
     mance targets (in theory approved by CRA). Both longer-term lease contracts and short-
     er-term management contracts have been used. A fifteen-year lease contract with a private
     operator for the water supply system of the capital city of Maputo was not particularly suc-
     cessful and terminated in 2014 (World Bank 2009). Currently about 20 small systems are
     operated by local private companies. The remainder of the systems are operated by state or
     municipal companies or semi-autonomous ringfenced operating departments of FIPAG.
     Contracts for secondary systems can be introduced only gradually as investment funds
     become available to repair and upgrade the systems, most of which are in disrepair. It is
     anticipated that CRA and FIPAG or AIAS will sign a regulatory agreement for each system
     specifying performance targets, initial tariffs, and other regulated matters, and this regula-
     tory agreement will be attached to the operator’s contract for each system.
       Tariffs for each system are reviewed and revised periodically by CRA and published in the offi-
     cial gazette. It is the government’s policy that tariffs for water supplied by primary systems
     should eventually recover the full cost of service, including debt service. In 2009, tariff revenues
     in eight of the larger systems were approaching levels where they would recover all operating and
     maintenance costs, including depreciation, and would begin to contribute to debt service (World
     Bank 2009, 28). The policy for secondary water supply systems and sanitation systems is that
     tariffs should eventually recover the cost of operation, maintenance, and management, and pro-
     vide for the repair and replacement of small equipment, while investments will continue to be
     subsidized by government. This goal will be achieved only gradually as the systems are upgraded.
       CRA monitors and intervenes to resolve problems in the primary systems directly. To deal
     with the large number of secondary water supply systems and sanitation systems, CRA has
     developed a decentralized approach to monitoring and problem solving that engages local
     regulatory committees. This approach, which was designed in collaboration with local author-
     ities, minimizes the cost of regulation and promotes local engagement and capacity building.

The agents are respected members of the community who volunteer their time. They are on
duty only a few hours a week and are paid a small stipend to cover expenses. Initial and peri-
odic training is provided by regular CRA staff and supported by CRA’s international develop-
ment partners. Local regulatory committees are being introduced gradually as systems are
upgraded because regulation is practical only when the systems can operate in a relatively
normal manner. This gradual approach also keeps the burden on CRA to a manageable level
and allows CRA to take advantage of lessons learned. As of 2016, five local regulatory commit-
tees had been created and were functioning well. All enforcement decisions remain with CRA.


United Arab Emirates
Economic growth and population growth are placing unprecedented pressure on the scarce
water resources and WSS providers of United Arab Emirates. The Emirates of Abu Dhabi
and Dubai have encouraged private participation, particularly in the desalinization of
water and production and transmission of electricity, while the local distribution of water
and electricity is generally the responsibility of each emirate’s respective water and elec-
tricity department and its subsidiary distribution companies. Both Abu Dhabi and Dubai
have created Regulatory Service Bureaus (RSBs) to regulate water supply, sanitation, and
electricity services.
  RSB Abu Dhabi, the older of the two, was created in 1998. It has the authority to issue
licenses to all service providers (including bulk water producers, and transmission, distribu-
tion, and waste water collection and treatment companies), make decisions regarding mar-
ket structure, and promote competition. It establishes, monitors, and enforces compliance
with standards and conditions governing technical matters, operator performance, safety,
customer care, contracts for bulk water, consumer prices, and terms and conditions for the
supply of services to domestic customers, and generally protects the interests of all custom-
ers. It is authorized to publish information about the performance of operators.
  While Regulatory Service Bureaus are supposed to ensure the development of safe and
efficient WSS and electricity sectors, they are not specifically charged with pursuing
full cost recovery.15 Thus far, tariff reform seems to have aimed primarily at discourag-
ing excessive water consumption and secondarily to improving the financial viability of
the distribution companies.16 Bulk water tariffs paid by the distribution companies are
controlled by the RSB and are adjusted annually with the objective of controlling cus-
­
tomer tariffs. The difference between revenues generated by bulk water tariffs (paid
by the distribution companies) and the producers’ guaranteed revenues (as specified in
their contracts) is made up by significant government subsidies to the producers. In
January 2016, the residential tariff paid by national households (even for consumption
in  excess of the generous basic allowance) was less than 20 percent of the full cost
   providing water. Tariffs paid by expatriates were about 57 percent of full cost for the
of ­
basic allowance and 100 percent of full cost for consumption in excess of the basic
allowance.17

     United Kingdom
     In 1989, faced with the need to raise about £28 billion (US$50 billion) over a ten-year period
     to upgrade WSS assets and comply with new European Community standards for drinking
     water and effluents, the U.K. government decided to privatize WSS in England and Wales.
     At that time, there were 10 public water authorities that provided WSS to customers in the
     two countries. In addition, there were numerous private “water-only” companies that pro-
     vided water to about one-third of the residents. Shares in the 10 water authorities were sold
     through a public offering to create 10 publicly traded private WSS companies. All the compa-
     nies, whether they provide water and sewerage services or water only, are responsible for
     financing and executing investments and operating and maintaining services in their con-
     tractually assigned territories (Triche and Skilling 1996, 2–3).
       Before the privatization, water resources management and water pollution control had
     been the responsibility of the public water authorities. This meant that the water authorities
     were regulating themselves—and, as a result, environmental enforcement had been lax.
     At the time of privatization, these functions were transferred to a new entity, the National
     Rivers Authority, and a separate independent economic regulator of WSS services, the Water
     Services Regulation Authority, known by its acronym, OFWAT, was created.
       OFWAT licenses or “appoints” WSS and water-only companies by means of a license that
     specifies each company’s ownership of assets, geographic service areas, timing of tariff
     reviews, initial tariffs, accounting methods, levels of service, and other critical rights and
     obligations. For each company, OFWAT sets a price cap, or maximum tariff, that the com-
     pany may charge its customers. Under this approach, if the utility exceeds efficiency assump-
     tions incorporated into the calculation of the price cap, it is able to retain the additional
     profits as a reward until the next tariff review. Tariff reviews are conducted every five years
     and the U.K. regulator often relies on a form of “yardstick competition” whereby it compares
     the performance of a private utility operating in one area with the performance of others,
     setting benchmarks and expectations, as part of the tariff-setting process. This structure has
     incentivized the privatized utilities to improve service delivery over time.
       Scottish authorities declined to go along with the privatization of the water authorities but
     later merged Scotland’s three water authorities into a new public company, Scottish Water.
                                                                                          ­ illing,
     A 2005 law allows private companies to compete to provide retail services (metering, b
     and customer service) while wholesale services (defined as providing water and removing
     wastewater) remain a public monopoly. In 2005, an economic regulator of the water and
     sewerage industry, the Water Industry Commission for Scotland (WICS), was created. Its role
     is similar to that of OFWAT.18


     United States
     Each of the 50 states of the United States has created a public utility (or public service)
     ­
     commission (PUC) to regulate utilities. PUCs typically regulate the tariffs and market struc-
     ture of electricity, natural gas, telecommunications, cable TV, public transportation,


14   Status of Water Sector Regulation in the Middle East and North Africa
and privately owned WSS services. Only 11 percent of U.S. residents are served by private
companies, with the remainder served by government-owned (municipal or county) water
utilities—and very few of these are regulated by PUCs. Only 12 of the 50 states have laws gov-
­
erning the pricing of these services.19 The drinking water quality and wastewater effluents of
all systems are regulated by a federal agency, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA), as well as affiliated state agencies. However, the recent occurrence of lead-poisoned
water in Flint, Michigan that went unchecked and unacknowledged for months before public
pressure forced the city and the EPA to take action demonstrates the potential risks of regu-
latory negligence and the importance of local engagement and vigilance. It is noteworthy
that the Michigan Public Service Commission does not regulate any water supply services.
  Unlike the United Kingdom, which uses a “price cap” approach, tariff regulation in the
United States focuses on the “rate of return” of investors, ensuring that while the rate of
return should be adequate to attract investment, it should not be excessive. For this reason,
tariff reviews are referred to as “rate cases.” The requests of utilities (whether regulated or
not) for increases in tariffs are generally subject to public scrutiny at the local level. In the
case of regulated utilities, public hearings in which all interested parties can participate are
usually held before major decisions, such as those dealing with tariffs or mergers, are made.
However, final decisions are made by the PUC, which is charged with balancing the interests
of both consumers and utilities. The Pennsylvania PUC is presented as an example.
  The Pennsylvania PUC regulates the rates and service of investor-owned water and
­
wastewater companies, as well as municipal systems that serve customers outside their
boundaries. It has the authority to control market entry and exit; approve mergers and acqui-
sitions; establish just and reasonable rates (tariffs); maintain safe, adequate, and reasonable
service; examine transactions between utilities and their affiliates; register securities; inspect
records and facilities; impose civil penalties; and charge utilities for regulatory costs.20
It  responds to consumer complaints, provides utility-related information to consumers,
monitors utility compliance with PUC regulations, and evaluates utility performance. Five
commissioners, who are appointed by the governor, subject to confirmation by the State
Senate, serve five-year staggered terms. In general, tariffs reflect the full cost of service and
ensure the long-term financial viability of the utilities. However, utilities (and customers)
may benefit from low tax rates, public financing at below-market rates, and occasional fed-
eral or state grants—for example, for improvements in wastewater treatment and disposal.
  The PUC does not regulate the tariffs, service quality (other than water quality), and cus-
tomer relations aspects of municipal WSS services that operate only within municipal
boundaries and small community systems.


Why Regulation of WSS Is Relevant to the Middle East and North Africa
Two trends are affecting the water sector in the countries of the Middle East and North
Africa, creating gaps between supply and demand. On the supply side, these countries are
experiencing the highest levels of water scarcity and variability in the world. Both these


Status of Water Sector Regulation in the Middle East and North Africa                          15
     problems are likely to increase with climate change. On the demand side, as economic
     activity, population, and urbanization increase, demand for water is growing rapidly and
     ­
     some areas remain unserved or receive inadequate service. Low tariffs worsen these prob-
     lems because they do not provide incentives to conserve water and undermine the ability of
     service providers to maintain, improve, and expand services. To meet the challenge, it is
     critical to use water resources efficiently, improve the efficiency and effectiveness of water
     and sanitation services, and set tariffs that reflect the cost of providing services. Effective
     tariff regulation would provide incentives for efficiency improvements and improve the
     financial viability and sustainability of services. In addition, the increasing dependence on
     nonconventional water sources such as desalinization points to the need for effective regu-
     lation of technical standards, private sector participation, and water quality standards.
       At the same time, the region has experienced major socio-political change in recent years.
     Governments are wary of introducing reforms that may be negatively perceived by the pop-
     ulation and be politically unpalatable. Nevertheless, countries of the region recognize their
     unique and critical situation regarding water, and stakeholders recognize that a new
     approach to managing water resources and services is required. Experience has shown that
     the introduction of transparent and independent regulatory frameworks based on techni-
     cal and financial criteria, along with well-designed public relations and educational cam-
     paigns can help to make reforms such as higher tariffs palatable. Several governments have
     approached the World Bank’s Global Water Practice requesting help to examine options for
     improving the institutional frameworks that govern the sector and new service delivery
     models—in addition to financing new ways of augmenting supply (such as desalination).
     The World Bank, for its part, is revising its regional strategy to put water at the very top
     of the priorities.
       The countries in the Middle East and North Africa need appropriate support to design
     and implement economic regulation of WSS. The right type of support, if introduced in a
     measured manner taking into account the socio-political climate, could be catalytic: help-
     ing to improve efficiency, thereby moderating pressure on water resources and improving
     long-term financial viability and affordability. Strengthening regulation is also about
     increasing transparency, accountability, and voice—all of which have been important
     tenets of the demands for change on the ground in the region over the past four years.
     Finally, improving water sector regulation is a prerequisite for developing public-private
     partnerships (PPPs) and nonsovereign financing.
       Although the Middle East and North Africa is a middle-income region, most countries in
     the Middle East and North Africa do not have the experience with regulatory reform that
     has taken place in other middle-income regions such as Latin America and Eastern
     Europe. Finally, despite the fact that the countries in the Middle East and North Africa
     share some common challenges, it is a highly diverse region, including fragile states,
     countries that are in the midst of conflict, and countries that are ready to develop more
     complex regulatory institutions and expand or introduce PPPs. The needs and challenges

This Study’s Objectives and Methodology
Objectives
The development of effective regulatory frameworks is increasingly salient to govern-
ments in the Middle East and North Africa as they address the challenges that confront
their water and sanitation services. This study aims to collect information through a reg-
ulatory lens and present it in a format and typology that is consistent with World Bank
practice so that it can serve as part of the foundation for WSS sector reviews and
operations. It is not the objective of this study to analyze or critique the performance of
­
WSS or the effectiveness of regulation in each case or to make recommendations. Thus,
the approach is positive rather than normative.
  This report is part of a wider World Bank initiative to provide government officials and
other stakeholders in the Middle East and North Africa—including civil society, service
providers, potential financiers, and development practitioners—with the resources to bet-
ter understand current conditions and consider approaches to regulating WSS, taking into
account the benefits that could result and challenges that might be encountered. This desk
study is a first step intended to provide some basic information on selected countries that
will serve as a foundation for determining where further study is required to fill in gaps and
where support in the area of regulatory reform might be best concentrated. It takes a look
at the status of regulatory institutions and practices in five countries and economies—the
Arab Republic of West Bank and Gaza, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Iraq—which were cho-
sen to include different historic and legal frameworks and fragile/conflict states, as well as
more stable ones. On the basis of the information collected, some areas of further study are
suggested for each country.

Methodology
The consultant and World Bank staff attempted to collect information in each country on the
topics listed below.

•	 Statistics on population, economic growth, availability of water resources, access to ser-
  vices, per capita water consumption, and WSS infrastructure.

•	 Relevant aspects of the political economy and the impacts of migration.

•	 Key challenges that confront the country with regard to both WSS and WRM.

•	 Legal framework for WSS and WRM, including references in the Constitution (or other
  foundational instruments), laws, and official policy statements.

•	 Policy objectives and targets for WSS (including access, efficiency, financial viability, mar-
  ket structure, and promotion of PPPs).


Status of Water Sector Regulation in the Middle East and North Africa                         17
     •	 Policies regarding WRM (water rights, rules governing abstraction, protection of water
        quality, development objectives).

     •	 Institutional structure for WSS (identification of ministries, agencies and regulatory
        bodies with responsibilities for WSS; description of the existing market structure for
        ­
        WSS; identification of entities responsible for water production, transmission and distri-
        bution, and collection and treatment of wastewater; the level of autonomy of service
        providers; and the role of the private sector and community-based service providers).
        ­

     •	 Current practices and methods used to regulate WSS.

     •	 Whether and how customers are consulted and protected.

     •	 Institutional structure for WRM (identification of ministries, agencies, and regulatory
        bodies with responsibilities for WRM).

     •	 Participation in international WRM bodies and agreements.

       Information was collected in the first half of 2016 primarily through desk reviews of exist-
     ing World Bank reports, other literature, and official websites. In addition, supplementary
     information was collected through interviews and phone calls with a few key official actors
     in Morocco, Iraq, and Palestine. Considerable effort was made to find reliable information.
     However, gaps remain because not all information could be found for every case within the
     available resources and methods used. In some cases, contradictory data were found in dif-
     ferent sources. When that occurred, the authors relied on data reported by the World Bank
     or from official web sites, rather than from third parties. More formal consultation and coun-
     try visits will be required to confirm data, collect missing information, evaluate the status of
     services and regulatory frameworks, and formulate recommendations.
       The next five chapters present summaries of the status of WSS regulation in each country
     context. A final chapter summarizes the suggestions for further study.



     Notes
     	 1.	 In a market where there are many service providers, competition generally ensures that goods and services that meet
         customers’ needs are available at reasonable prices. In contrast, piped WSS services are considered natural monopolies:
         because of the high cost of the infrastructure, WSS enjoy significant economies of scale; and the more customers that
         service providers have, the lower the cost of infrastructure for each customer. In addition, the public space and access
         required for networks make multiple networks impractical. For these reasons, it is generally desirable to have only one
         network in any given locality. As a result, there is no competition in the market.

     	 2.	 The objectives listed here reflect the six key functions of WSS regulation and their various components identified in a 2006
         discussion paper, “Explanatory Notes on Key Topics in the Regulation of Water and Sanitation Services,” prepared for the
         World Bank Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Board by Eric Groom, Jonathan Halpern, and David Ehrhardt.

     	3.	 Market structure refers to the vertical integration or disaggregation of production, transportation, network management,
         and other functions, as well as the degree of horizontal aggregation of services in different locations or the aggregation of
         different types of public services, such as water supply, sanitation, and energy, under the management of a single
         operator.

     	4.	Competition for the market exists when service providers must compete for the right to provide service in a particular
         location. Comparative competition refers to the comparison of the performance of several service providers that provide
         similar services in different locations under similar circumstances.

    regulatory framework without a formal regulatory body per se. This is also the case for many municipal services in the

    years.

            West Bank and Gaza faces enormous challenges related to water and sanitation access and
            services. Resource and implementation issues are exacerbated by the political challenges and
            ­
            related constraints facing the Palestinian people. Yet despite or maybe because of these chal-
            lenges, the Palestinian government has embarked upon what some may view as the most ambi-
            tious program of regulatory and institutional reform for the water sector in the Middle East and
            North Africa region. However, the reforms are at an early stage, and it may take up to 15 years
            putting the new structure in place. A key challenge is the delay in the transfer of regulatory func-
            tions from the PWA to the WSRC which have left a governance gap as a result. Nonetheless,
            the series of staged reforms are attempting to provide more accountable service delivery in a
            sustainable manner.


            Introduction to the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector and
            the Country Context
            The Palestinian water supply and sanitation (WSS) sector is confronted with a number of
            political, technical, economic, financial, and institutional challenges that jeopardize sus-
            tainability of service delivery. The sector is characterized by the continuous political turmoil
            experienced in the territories, resulting in a general environment of conflict, insecurity, and
            instability. Political challenges and interventions in the form of blockades, severe restric-
            tions to freedom of movement, and lack of sovereign control over water resources and infra-
            structure have all significantly hindered development of the WSS sector, which faces
            interrelated challenges in terms of access and quality of WSS service delivery, availability of
            water resources because of increased demand pressures as well as high levels of water con-
            tamination, and lack of access to financing.
              Access to water resources for Palestinians is severely restricted. Palestinians have access
            to 11 percent of total water endowments. This has ultimately led to inadequate and unreli-
            able quality of WSS services, particularly in Area C1 of West Bank, where over 100,000 of the
            approximately 300,000 Palestinians do not have access to tap water.2 Moreover, an esti-
            mated 96 percent of water resources are unfit for use by Gaza’s 1.88 million inhabitants due
            to saline water intrusions and untreated sewage infiltrations; salinity and nitrate concentra-
            tion are significantly higher than the World Health Organization standards, and thus the
            water resources available are practically undrinkable.3

       Access to sanitation and wastewater treatment also faces challenges. The percentage of
     households that enjoy direct access to network sewerage systems is 53.9 percent
         percent in West Bank, compared to 73 percent in Gaza). Wastewater treatment is very
     (35 ­
     limited (48 million cubic meters [MCM] in Gaza and 9.6 MCM in West Bank) and limited
     reuse for irrigation (1700 dunums in Gaza). Low levels of access to sanitation have further
     exacerbated already sizeable challenges related to water quality and availability.
     About 30,000 cubic meters (m3) of raw sewage is dumped daily into open pools, resulting
     in contamination of the aquifer (World Bank 2016). According to a United Nations report
     published in August 2012, “The aquifer could become unusable as early as 2016, with the
            irreversible by 2020.”4 Rapid urbanization and an increasing population are
     damage ­
     expected to complicate these challenges as increased water demand and pollution further
     deteriorate the quality of already scarce water resources. Table 2.1 provides an overview
     of the basic sector data on water supply and sanitation.

22   Status of Water Sector Regulation in the Middle East and North Africa
  The widespread nature of these challenges requires well planned and concerted efforts
for  sustainable resolution. Unfortunately, actions are often based on ad hoc emergency.
Efforts to lead more strategic forms of planning are inhibited by a political environment char-
acterized by continuous uncertainty. As a result, infrastructure development is delayed.
Furthermore, the sector faces financial challenges, including significant WSS infrastructure
             ­nefficiencies. According to the Water Sector Strategic Plan for 2012–22, an esti-

                                                                                sector (PWA
mated total of US$7 billion worth of investments is required to improve the WSS ­
2013). Because of these challenges, the government has embarked upon an ambitious set of
                                                                     ­nstitutional structure
reforms. The WSS sector is currently in transition toward a reformed i
introduced by the 2014 Water Law. The move is characterized by a number of policies to
improve sector performance, including aggregation of service providers, introduction of
an  independent regulator, and enforcement of full cost recovery tariffs to enhance sector
financial sustainability.


Structure and Organization of the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector
Currently, the water sector is centralized in terms of strategy development, policy
­making, and identification and development of bulk water projects. However, in terms of
service delivery, the sector is significantly decentralized to the point of fragmentation
(PWA, UFM, and GWP 2015, 14). From 1995 until reforms were introduced in 2014, signif-
icant roles and  responsibilities were implemented by a single public entity, the
Palestinian Water Authority (PWA). The PWA’s responsibilities included policy making,
investment planning, regulation, and project implementation and execution. Bulk water
supply has been handled by several actors. The West Bank Water Department (WBWD)
operates some wells owned by the PWA and receives bulk water from the Israeli
                                             number of service providers. In addition,
Water Company (Mekerot) and provides it to a ­
numerous municipalities and private and agricultural operators operate their own
springs and wells.
  Three regional WSS utilities operate in West Bank and Gaza: the Coastal Municipalities
Water Utility (CMWU), which serves about 200,000 inhabitants in Gaza; the Water Supply
and Sanitation Authority (WSSA), which serves about 12,399 customers in Bethlehem and
neighboring towns; and the Jerusalem Water Utility (JWU), which serves 59,195 customers. In
addition, 226 small water service providers operate at the local level within West Bank
and Gaza (World Bank 2015, 8–9).5 These include municipal water and wastewater depart-
ments and joint water service councils. Currently, 11 joint water service councils serve about
39,733 customers.
  Due to the large number of service providers relative to the total customer base, economies
of scale are unexploited. Water service providers are commercially weak, with poor service
quality, mostly intermittent supply, and high levels of nonrevenue water (reported as in the
range of 30 percent to 40 percent by the Arab Countries Water Utilities Association, 2014).
Revenues are insufficient for proper operation and maintenance and capital investments.

     Service providers are overstaffed, yet have inadequately skilled staff. The sector reforms of
     2014 aim to aggregate the many water service providers at the local level and to consolidate
                                                                                providers in the
     and centralize the water sector. Annex 2.1 lists the major current service ­
     Palestinian territories.
       Reforms in the form of a new Water Law were led by the PWA in 2014 to address the
     various existing sector challenges. The reforms seek to achieve water security and
     implement integrated water resources management by building institutional
     c apacity  and enhancing sustainability; accelerating infrastructure development
     ­
     based on Palestinian water security needs and updated sector development strate-

     The 2014 Water Law enforces a reformed institutional framework that separates roles
     and responsibilities accordingly.
       Palestinian Water Authority (PWA). The PWA was first established by Law No. 2 of 19966
     and is responsible for the overall policy making for the water and wastewater sector.
     The PWA drafts sector laws and regulations submits them to the Cabinet of Ministers for
     approval. As the 2014 Water Law is implemented, the PWA will be transformed into the
     sole institution responsible for overall policy making in the sector. In addition to its policy
     role, the PWA is responsible for managing water resources in an integrated and sustain-
     able manner, including the issuance of licenses for water extraction, overall sector strate-
     gic development and investment planning.7
       Water Sector Regulatory Council (WSRC). The 2014 reforms established the WSRC.
     It  is  an  independent legal entity that reports directly to the Cabinet of Ministers and
     is responsible for overall monitoring and regulation of all matters related to the opera-
     tion of water and sanitation service providers. The WSRC is still developing its ­institutional
     arrangements and completing staffing. It is managed by its own Board of Directors.
       National Water Company (NWC). Within the restructured institutional framework,
     the NWC will be established to assume responsibility for extraction of water and trans-
     mission of bulk water supply to the JWSCs, RWUs, and other local authorities and associ-
     ations. The NWC will also be responsible for the extraction of water. Figures 2.1 and
     2.2  show the NWC as the new bulk water company, rather than West Bank Water
     Department (WBWD), which is now functioning with a  limited mandate. In keep-
     ing  with  the Water Sector Strategic Development Plan of 2017–22, it is expected that
     the  NWC will be established and fully functional and will eventually merge or replace
     the WBWD.
       Regional Water Utilities (RWUs). In a bid to improve overall sector efficiency, the PWA
     has adopted aggregation policies to optimize benefits from economies of scale. The
     reform seeks to establish RWUs in the larger municipalities. The PWA will begin to imple-
     ment its aggregation policy by expanding the three existing RWUs to include small ser-
     vice providers that are nearby. Additional utilities will be established at the big

Note: The figure does not show the Israeli system connected to the Palestinian system as indicated under Article 40 of the 1993 Oslo Agreement. Article 40 describe the
water resources management in West Bank, where a Joint Water Committee (JWC) should be established to manage and monitor the water resources for the interim period
of five years from the date of signing the agreement. However, the JWC has not function effectively since 2013. The Israeli Water Company (Mekerot) supplies about
65 million cubic meters of water per year to the Palestinians through the West Bank Water Department (which is currently functioning as the main bulk water supplier in
West Bank for the Palestinian communities). Level 1: Government Level: Apply legislation, policies, and strategies and monitoring of service delivery; Level 2: Manage water
resources and responsible for bulk water distribution. The West Bank Water Department is now doing this job, but would be reformed in the near future, according the
water law, to the national Water Company; Level 3: Retail water supply for domestic and other uses.

                                             Eventually, the RWUs would be responsible for all retail WSS services under the reformed

Water service delivery

Water Law                                    The Water Law was enacted in 2014 with the following provisions:a

                                             •	 Separates and clarifies institutional roles and responsibilities, including policy and regulatory functions, which were
                                               previously carried out by the PWA. This is with the expectation of improving sector coordination mechanisms.b

                                             •	 Establishes the Water Sector Regulatory Council independent from the PWA.

                                             •	 Provides directives to transform the West Bank Water Department into the National Water Company that will be
                                               owned by the Palestinian authorities.

                                             •	 Mandates the PWA for establishment of Regional Water Utilities and Water User Associations.

Local Government Law                         The Local Government Law requires the municipalities to provide water and wastewater services.

Other relevant laws                          Other supporting laws include:c

                                             •	 Environment Law No.7 of 1997

                                             •	 Local Authorities Law No. 1 of 1997

                                             •	 Internal Regulation of the PWA, Decree No.66/1997

                                             •	 Agriculture Law No. 2 of 2003

                                             •	 Environmental Assessment Policy, approved 23 April 2000.

Water Sector Strategic Development           The WSSDP for 2012–22 was developed by the PWA and issued in 2013. The strategy aims to:d
Plan (WSSDP)                                 •	 Enhance sector coordination, reinforcing the Palestinian Authority’s approach to sustainable water resources
                                               management and ensure that all arms of government work together in the pursuit of shared water resources
                                               management goals.

                                             •	 Clarify institutional roles and responsibilities through the establishment of a framework that will promote the
                                               financial sustainability of WSS services and improve the management, rehabilitation, and maintenance of water
                                               systems.

Sanitation service delivery

Sanitation                                   Prior to the sector reforms in 2014, according to Bylaw No. 3 of 2002 and previous Water Law issued in 2002, the
                                             PWA was responsible for regulation of the Palestinian wastewater services, including collection, treatment, sludge
                                             handling, and reuse. This is no longer applicable under the new Water Law, which transfers regulatory responsibility
                                             to the WSRC.

Draft laws and policies

Draft Bylaw for Operator Licensing           A draft water and sanitation facilities and operators’ license bylaw has been submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers for
                                             approval.

Policy for Capacity Development              A new policy document entitled “Capacity Development Policy and Strategy (2017–77) of the Water Sector“ was
                                             recently completed.

     Regulation of Water Supply and Sanitation Services
     Enactment of the 2014 Water Law led to the establishment of an independent regulator,
     the  Water Sector Regulatory Council (WSRC), responsible for regulating service qual-
     ity  and  monitoring performance of water service providers. It is responsible for the
     following:


     Licensing
     Licensing is to be administered by the WSRC for service providers and by the PWA for the
     water resources. However, in order to complete the transition process and clarify the
     licensing procedures, a draft water licensing bylaw has been drafted and submitted to the
     ­
     Cabinet of Ministers for approval. The draft bylaw is referred to as the “Water and Sanitation
     Facilities and Operators’ License Bylaw.”


     Standard Setting
     The PWA and the WSRC are both responsible for setting operational, administrative, techni-
     cal, and financial standards. Generally, the PWA is responsible for setting the right policies,
     laws, and regulations that create the suitable enabling environment for utilities to operate and
     perform in a sustainable manner. The WSRC is responsible for setting service delivery stan-
     dards, as well as the operational, technical, financial, and administrative performance of the
     service providers.
       Main objectives include improving financial viability by reducing costs (for example,
     by improving technical efficiency and reducing water losses), and providing service provid-
     ers with the tools necessary to monitor their performance and report back to the WSRC. The
     reduction of illegal connections is an additional technical challenge that is crucial to address
     to ensure sustainability of utilities.


     Tariff Setting
     Tariff-setting responsibilities are to be split between the PWA and the WSRC (Gerlach 2010).8
     The PWA is responsible for setting the tariff policy, and the WSRC is responsible for review-
     ing and approving tariffs. Prior to the 2014 reforms, the Ministry of Local Government
     (MoLG) was mandated to review and approve the proposed tariff structure, since municipal-
     ities are required to submit their budgets to the MoLG for approval. Under the new Water
                                                                                     ­ ntervening
     Law, the MoLG will continue to review municipal budgets in general, but without i
     in tariff setting.
       The financing policy adopted within the sector is the water-pays-for-water principle,
     where operation and maintenance (O&M) as well as capital costs (capex) are totally
     financed by the water tariff (full cost recovery), rather than through taxes or trans-
     fers,  in  order to guarantee that the water operators have a sound and stable funding
     mechanism at all times.9 According to Article 3 of the Water Tariff Regulation for the

Year 2013, the tariff policy objectives prioritize the following goals for both water and
wastewater services:

•	 Ensuring cost recovery through revenues that cover O&M, capex, and interest on loans;

•	 Ensuring social equality by guaranteeing that low-income consumers’ basic needs for
   water and wastewater will be met; and

•	 Ensuring economic efficiency by setting prices for the higher consumption groups to
   ­
   promote water conservation.

  However, implementation to meet these stated objectives is to take place in a gradual,
phased manner. Tariffs should, at a minimum, cover O&M costs and gradually cover depre-
ciation and interest on loans and investments.10 (It is not clear to what extent the govern-
ment will subsidize services to fully fund operations until tariffs reach full cost recovery).
  Table 2.3 presents the tariffs implemented by the Jerusalem Water Utility in the cities of
Ramallah and Al Bireh as of December 2015.11 The average annual water bill per household
in West Bank and Gaza (consuming an average of 6 m3 of water per month) was US$101.11 as
of 2010, according to the IBNET (International Benchmarking Network for Water and
Sanitation Utilities) Blue Book (Danilenko and others 2014, 137).
  There is a clear disparity in the prices of water between West Bank and Gaza.12 Disparities
also exist between the governorates of West Bank itself. It is difficult to make meaningful
comparisons because the different areas use different billing cycles and data are limited.
  A number of factors pose major challenges for service providers to achieve full cost recov-
ery. The sector suffers from significantly high levels of non-revenue water. Cost recovery in
the wastewater sector is also a challenge because most cities that have no wastewater treat-
ment have not implemented the tariff for sewerage. The only  city that has applied the
­sewerage tariff is Al-bireh. Its tariff is US$0.50/m3, which is less than the O&M cost by US$0.47.13


Next Steps
The main focus is currently on the establishment of the reformed institutional frame-
work, especially establishing the National Water Company (NWC) and Regional Water
Utilities (RWUs) and further strengthening the capacity of existing institutions, includ-
ing the Water Sector Regulatory Council (WSRC). The WSRC has now started issuing




Status of Water Sector Regulation in the Middle East and North Africa                             29
     monitoring reports on the performance of the service providers. At the same time, the
             ­ eveloping a set of indicators that is compatible with the World Bank’s
     WSRC is d
                                service levels. It is also developing its own database and
     IBNET  platform to monitor ­
     management information system to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of data
     collection, processing, and  reporting. Furthermore and very important, the WSRC is
     planning to develop an incentive system for rewarding good performance.
       Two roadmaps are under study to figure out the way forward in the establishment of the
     NWC and the RWUs. The NWC is expected to be established and operational by 2019, while
     the RWUs need a longer process, which may take several years, because many small service
     providers at the municipal and local level must be amalgamated.
       In addition to completing the sector transformation of water sector service providers,
     the government is considering a wide range of actions to encourage performance
     ­improvements, including:14

     •	 Sector coordination and citizen engagement. Citizen engagement is a crucial element to
       improve overall sector performance. It includes a wide range of issues from raising aware-
       ness of water efficiency, sanitation, and hygiene practices to managing customer relations
       and improving service quality. Other governments in the region have made significant
       progress with regard to citizen engagement. For example, in the United Arab Emirates, the
       National Environment Education and Awareness Strategy (NEAS) 2015–11 consists of a set
       of policy objectives to increase environmental awareness, including on water usage.15

     •	 Human resources and staffing. An important element of performance improvement is staff-
       ing. The new retail and bulk companies will consider the issue of overstaffing and hire
       staff with appropriate technical skills.

     •	 Private sector participation (PSP). Greater capital investment in the sector is needed to main-
       tain and replace aging infrastructure. Increased private sector participation can help meet
       this need. While delegation to private management is a one way to address the need for
       investments (as in Morocco, with delegated management in Rabat, Casablanca, Tanger, and
       Tetouan), PSP can also address issues concerning capacity building. In both Oman16 and
       Jordan,17 private company managers were embedded for certain periods of time into the com-
       panies with the principle of training staff and/or “ring fencing” the company. The multi-donor
       Public Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) has provided a grant to the Palestinian
       authorities to help assess the options and viability of PPP in the Palestinian context.

       The government is fully embracing water sector regulatory reform in West Bank and Gaza
     and progress is underway, however not without its challenges. Putting the new structure in
     place may take up to 15 years, given that the wide range of service providers must contend
     with political, socioeconomic, and cultural factors that could jeopardize the reform from
     achieving its objectives. A key challenge is the delay in the transfer of regulatory functions
     from the PWA to the WSRC which have left a governance gap as a result. Although the MoLG
     is not mandated, nor has the capacity to supervise activities of the LGU service providers, it


30   Status of Water Sector Regulation in the Middle East and North Africa
                                       carries out a somewhat minimal level of supervision. However, there is currently no func-
                                       tional regulatory authority responsible for tariff approval, and licensing of service providers.
                                         Furthermore, a challenging element of the reforms is to secure accountability relation-
                                       ships that diminish the gap between de jure and de facto sector organizations during the
                                       transition period that is expected to be a prolonged period. The Water Law only reflects the
                                       de jure institutional arrangement of the restructured sector of Regional Water Utilities.
                                       Without a Water Law that specifically addresses the institutional arrangement under the
                                       transition period, much of the service provision responsibilities will remain with the LGUs
                                       or JWSCs for an extended period. Therefore, creating adequate arrangements during the
                                       transition period for regulation bulk water planning and investment planning and financing
                                       will be necessary (Ghosheh 2017, 70,76). However, because the reforms are supported by the
                                       political and top management levels of different stakeholders, they are moving forward
                                       steadily, accompanied by participation from different levels and stakeholders and influ-
                                       enced by knowledge transfer from different national and international experiences.

                                           three areas. Area A is controlled administratively and security-wise by the Palestinian Authority (PA). Area B is controlled
                                           administratively by the PA and security-wise by Israel. Area C is controlled administratively and security-wise by Israel.
                                           It appears that the 93.3 percent figure for access to improved water in table 2.1 does not include Area C.

                                                          Abstract
            Egypt is one of the few countries in the Middle East and North Africa that has established a
            specific water sector regulator dedicated to monitoring service provision. However, institu-
            tional challenges remain, including some overlapping responsibilities and the need to clar-
            ify and strengthen the role of the regulator. Since 2015, the government has made positive
            efforts to set up the necessary institutional arrangements that would improve overall sector
            performance, including the establishment of a dedicated management team within the
            Ministry of Housing, Utilities and Urban Communities (MHUUC), as well as efforts at tariff
            reforms designed to enhance financial sustainability. Moreover, a new Water Law provid-
            ing clearer mandates and strengthening the regulator and the regulatory framework has
            reportedly been reviewed by a Council of Ministers and will be reviewed by Parliament.
            A capacity-building program for the regulator is under way. Therefore, the status of regu-
                                                                                    ­ hapter—at the very
            lation in Egypt may diverge from some of the accounts described in this c
            least, de jure—in the coming year.


            Introduction to the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector and
            the Country Context
            Egypt has one of the fastest growing populations in the world. Between 2000 and 2014,
            Egypt’s average population growth rate was 1.92 percent, compared to the world average
            of 1.24 percent.1 Around one-quarter of Egyptians lived under the poverty line in 2012–13
            (CAPMAS 2014a), 2 with large regional disparities. Poverty in Egypt is a rural phenome-
            non. While an estimated 57 percent of its total population reside in rural villages,3 more
            than 67 percent of the poor live in rural areas (CAPMAS 2013).
              Water resources in Egypt are under pressure, fueled by a rapidly growing population and
            increasing activity in the industrial and agricultural sectors spurred by surges in public
            investment. Meanwhile, water resources are under threat because of climate change and
            development in upstream countries. The main source of water in Egypt is surface water
            from the River Nile. In addition, Egypt relies on groundwater resources, and to a lesser
            extent desalination and wastewater reuse. Water generated from nonconventional
            resources such as seawater desalination constitutes a negligible percentage of 0.76 percent
            of the total aggregate water supply and is used entirely for Red Sea resorts (UNEP, CEDARE,
            and MoSEA 2014).
              Water consumption increased 15.6 percent between 2002 and 2010, from 66.6 billion
            m3 to 77 billion m3. The agricultural sector accounted for 86 percent of total water
            ­
            consumption in 2010, with domestic and industrial sectors accounting for 11 percent and
            3 percent of total consumption, respectively (FAO, 2010). Yet according to a 2014 study


            Status of Water Sector Regulation in the Middle East and North Africa                     35
     on “Water Resources and Rationing its Use in Egypt” by the Central Agency for Public
     Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS), Egypt is below the water poverty threshold, with
     an average use of 663 m3 per capita. By 2025, CAPMAS predicts that the share will fall
     below 582 m3.
       Significant progress has been made to improve access to water supply and sanitation (WSS)
     across Egypt (table 3.1). Access to piped sources of drinking water increased greatly between
     1990 and 2012,4 with 100 percent and 93 percent of urban and rural households enjoying
     access to piped water through household connections, respectively (WHO and UNICEF
     2014). However, among rural poor households, children are 8.7 times more likely to drink
     from unsafe sources of water than children who live in urban households.5 In 2015, improved
     sanitation facilities were available to 95 percent of Egypt’s population.6 However, in terms of

piped access to sanitation,7 while 84 percent of urban households have access to sewers,
only 26 percent of rural households do (World Bank 2010).
  Egypt also faces challenges regarding the quality, efficiency, and sustainability of WSS ser-
vice delivery. Efforts in this regard have focused on increasing the number of metered con-
nections and reducing levels of non-revenue water. High staffing ratios coupled with low bill
collection rates and low tariffs remain issues (World Bank 2010). Furthermore, the continu-
ity and quality of water supply are a challenge. An estimated 30 percent of households in
Egypt experienced interrupted supply in 2008, 37 percent of which were households in rural
upper Egypt.8 Although drinking water quality standards are reported to have been met in
the overwhelming majority of cases (World Bank 2010), quality is affected by ageing net-
works, deterioration of water reservoirs, and leakages in groundwater and sewer systems,
among other factors.9


Structure and Organization of the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector
Egypt’s WSS institutional framework is currently centralized.10 Key functions concerning
WSS infrastructure and service delivery such as policy making, regulation, planning, and
investment are carried out by national-level institutions. Decision-making is centralized
within the Ministry of Housing, Utilities and Urban Communities (MHUUC). Responsibility
for works planning and implementation of infrastructure investments across Egypt is under
the National Organization for Potable Water and Sanitary Drainage (NOPWASD) and the
Cairo Alexandria Potable Water Organization (CAPWO), which operate under the supervi-
sion of MHUUC. The operation and management of assets, including the billing and collec-
tion arrangements, is performed by the Holding Company for Water and Wastewater (HCWW)
through its local subsidiaries, the Water and Sanitation Companies (WSCs). The HCWW is a
public sector company and provides its 25 WSCs with administrative, technical, and finan-
cial support to deliver WSS services. The HCWW is currently responsible for the develop-
ment of master plans implemented by the WSCs, as well as for monitoring their performance.
The Egypt Water and Wastewater Regulatory Agency (EWRA) also operates under MHUUC
and is mandated to regulate quality of WSS service delivery, monitor WSS tariffs, and under-
takes consumer protection responsibilities.
  In 2015, the MHUUC established the Program Management Unit (PMU) by Ministerial
Decree No. 154 of 2015. The PMU is a service delivery unit housed within MHUUC man-
dated to oversee implementation of all investments under the WSS sector and to ensure
that universal access to sustainable WSS services is achieved. The PMU is also responsible
for formulating WSS sector policies and strategies. The long-term vision of the sector
appears to be to eventually decentralize service delivery and transfer full responsibility for
planning and implementation of WSS investments to the WSCs at the local level and to
develop fully autonomous utilities that are accountable to citizens for their mandated
­
service delivery responsibilities. To this end, MHUUC intends to put in place a suitable
policy and institutional framework that will incentivize WSCs to take responsibility for the

                                           planning and implementation of capital investments as well as to manage the assets cre-
                                           ated, leading to better service delivery at the local level. As part of this policy intention,
                                           the responsibility for implementation of some small-scale water projects, as well as proj-
                                           ects funded by other donors, has been transferred to the WSCs. Table 3.2 describes the
                                           roles of the various key stakeholders in the WSS sector. Figure 3.1 illustrates the structure
                                           and relationships.
                                             Public WSS services are formally provided within the government institutional frame-
                                           work outlined above. The informal private sector addresses some of the market demand
                                           for WSS services unaccounted for by the state, which includes demand for WSS services
                                           from informal settlements. According to a survey conducted by the Center for
                                           Development Services published in 2009, 18 percent of households in slum areas stated
                                           that their water supply is through informal or illegal connections to public sewer net-
                                           works (UNICEF 2009).

                                            Because access to sanitation services is limited in rural areas, the informal private ­sector is large

                                          and active in the sanitation market. However, it is unregulated. Many v
                                          improve the sanitation situation themselves through the informal private sector, which con-
                                          structs septic tanks, installs informal sewerage networks that are privately operated, and offers
                                          maintenance services. However, while the private sector collects the wastewater, it does not pro-
                                          vide safe disposal. Where groundwater-lowering systems have been installed, households have
                                          connected their wastewater to the system. There are many examples of spontaneous collective
                                          action through community development agencies or other structures, which have resulted in

                                    is limited to competition for concession and management contracts. The MHUUC’s Water and
                                    Wastewater Sector Strategy document (2010) promotes the implementation of public-private
                                    partnerships (PPPs) as an alternative source of financing investments in the WSS sector. Currently,
                                    there are only two cases of successful large-scale, formal PPP projects in Egypt: Abu Rawash
                                    Wastewater Treatment Plant and the New Cairo Wastewater Treatment Plant.

                                    for WSS service delivery and regulation in Egypt. It should be noted that a seminal new
                                    Water Law has been drafted to strengthen the role of the regulator and clarify institutional
                                    mandates. The draft is under review and may be enacted in 2017, superseding or enhancing

                                         Decree No. 124 of 2006, issued by the Minister of Housing, established a subcommittee tasked
                                         to draft a Water Sector Law that would provide EWRA with the necessary authority to regu-
                                         late the sector. MHUUC later agreed that the Water Sector Law should be developed within an
                                         overall WSS sector policy and legal framework. As mentioned, the new Water Sector Law is in
                                         draft form, to be reviewed by Parliament, and expected to be issued as early as 2017.
                                            EWRA’s organizational structure is illustrated in figure 3.2. By 2009, EWRA’s workforce
                                         totaled 60 employees.13 EWRA staff were provided training on a number of topics, including
                                         technical training to perform water and wastewater treatment plant assessments, and were
                                         also provided training on financial planning, cost accounting, tariff analysis, and water and
                                         wastewater technical aspects (USAID 2009). A capacity building assessment is being planned,
                                         with further staffing requirements to be identified.
                                            Management Information Systems (MIS) have been developed to allow EWRA to carry out
                                         performance monitoring, benchmarking, and utility certification. Benchmarking studies
                                         incorporating performance indicators and existing utility variables and data were developed
                                         and establish reasonable standards for utility performance. In addition, five-year financial
                                         planning, performance indicators, and cost accounting systems have been established at the
                                         WSC level that would provide EWRA with the information it needs to perform its regulatory
                                         role effectively (USAID, 2009.
                                            EWRA was provided technical support to develop a financial planning and tariff analysis
                                         model for the WSCs to use as part of the EWRA tariff application process. These plans
                                         provided insight into tariff needs because they highlighted the gap between costs and

                                         revenues in each WSC. Training was provided to support EWRA in developing tariff rate
                                         studies and in reviewing and evaluating utility tariff applications (EWRA 2009).

                                            determine revenue requirements for WSCs and set tariffs; issue licenses for WSCs; resolve dis-
                                            putes between customers and service providers; or set service standards for utilities, despite
                                            having established the Annual Information Returns (AIR) system (USAID 2013). Although the
                                            decree mentions that “all projects operating in the field of WSS shall be committed to submit-
                                            ting to [EWRA] all requested reports, data, statistics and information relevant to its activities,”
                                            it is not clear that this always takes place in practice, and whether there is a formal coordination
                                            mechanism between EWRA and other sector institutions that might allow for such information
                                            sharing. These discrepancies apparently will be rectified through the new draft Water Law soon
                                            to be reviewed by Parliament. The list that follows depicts the current status of regulation:

                                            •	 Enforcement of regulatory legislation. EWRA is legally responsible for ensuring all activities
                                               related to purification, desalination, conveyance, distribution, and selling of potable water,
                                               and the collection, treatment, and safe disposal of domestic and industrial wastewater; that


                                            Status of Water Sector Regulation in the Middle East and North Africa                                               43
       either public or state-awarded concessions are implemented in accordance with the relevant
       laws; and that water and wastewater units established by donor-funded and private projects
       are all implemented within the context of compliance with the applicable law and regulations
       of the government, especially regarding quality control and environmental regulations. In
       practice, these responsibilities are also mandated to, and carried out by, other sector institu-
       tions, including the HCWW, MHUUC, MoH, MWRI, MoEA, and MoF, as described in table 3.2.
       Within this context, EWRA’s activities have been confined to information and data collection
       on sector activities related to potable water and wastewater that is used to produce an Annual
       Information Report (AIR) and is presented to the MHUUC. The AIR includes recommendations
       from EWRA to enhance enforcement of sector legislation and overall sector performance.

     •	 Investment planning. As stipulated in Decree No. 136, EWRA should review plans for
       ­
       potable water consumption purification, desalination, conveyance, and distribution, and
       plans for collecting, treating, and safely disposing of domestic and industrial wastewater
       on a regular basis, including investment plans to ensure their availability in line with the
       state policies. PMU now assumes complete responsibility for overall investment planning
       for the sector. Before PMU was established, most investment planning responsibilities
       were carried out by NOPWASD (before the establishment of the HCWW in 2004), HCWW,
       and the MHUUC. For example, the national and governorate rural sanitation master plans
       were developed by the WSCs with support from the HCWW and consultants(USAID, 2009);

     •	 Technical standards and assistance. EWRA is mandated to provide technical assistance to
       governmental projects or PPPs within the WSS sector, in accordance with the law, includ-
       ing water and wastewater units established by donor-funded and private projects; and
       preparing studies on technical, economic, and financial standards to be determined.
       Multiple institutions within the sector provide technical assistance. Overall technical sup-
       port to the WSCs, including preparation of feasibility studies, has been carried out mainly
       by the HCWW, with expertise from consulting firms. In addition, the PPP unit housed
       within the MoF is responsible for providing technical and advisory support to line minis-
       tries for all PPP projects carried out in Egypt. This support includes the development of
       PPP proposals, which must be approved by the MoF. The PPP unit also supervises the
       tendering process and manages the transaction. The establishment of technical, eco-
       nomic, and financial standards of WSS service delivery has traditionally been led by the
       MHUUC, in coordination with the relevant ministries and authorities (USAID, 2009).

                                                                                      follow up
     •	 Financial monitoring. According to Decree No. 136, EWRA has responsibility to ­
       about and verify costs of inputs of purifying, desalinating, conveying, distributing, and sell-
       ing potable water and collecting, treating, and safely disposing of domestic or industrial
       wastewater and compare them to prices paid by consumers (tariff schedules). Legally, the
       WSCs are mandated to set their own tariffs and achieve full financial autonomy. In practice,
       the HCWW has often carried out financial planning and monitoring of the WSCs and provided
       support to each WSC in developing its five-year financial plan. The HCWW consolidates the
       individual WSC five-year financial plans into one national plan. In addition, the HCWW and


44   Status of Water Sector Regulation in the Middle East and North Africa
  WSCs have financial models and systems in place to monitor financial operations of the
  WSCs. The HCWW carries out assessments of the required revenues and tariff scenarios and
  demonstrate the case for tariff increases and subsidies from the MoF. The WSCs generate
  periodic reports on key financial management indicators, including budgeting, cash flow,
  income, and balance statements. The HCWW develops the annual financial statements of all
  WSCs in accordance with Public Business Sector Law No. 203 of 1991 (USAID, 2009).

•	 Tariff review and setting. EWRA is responsible for studying tariff applications to ensure
  financial and economic balance and develop consumption classes for the approval of the
  Cabinet of Ministers. Accordingly, EWRA has prepared a detailed tariff study and proposal
  for consideration of the Cabinet that would allow for full cost recovery of O&M expenses
  within the first three years of implementation and O&M plus depreciation costs within
  five years of implementation. The HCWW currently also plays a de facto role in reviewing
  tariffs by reviewing the total costs of WSS service provision vis a vis the existing tariff lev-
  els and submits requests to the Cabinet to increase tariffs to a level appropriate that would
  enable WSCs to recover O&M costs (USAID, 2009).

•	 Licensing. Currently, EWRA is not mandated to license WSCs. This authority is expected to
  be mandated to EWRA upon issuance of the new Water Law under review. A licensing
  system has been developed with donor support, along with the necessary administrative,
  technical, financial, environmental, and consumer protection regulations. Pilot WSCs
  were selected to test the process, which was completed in 2013 (USAID 2013).

•	 Private sector participation (PSP) and approval of contracts. Decree No. 136 mandates
  EWRA to review and approve contracts under the sector. Currently, in practice this is typ-
  ically carried out by the implementing institutions: HCWW and NOPWASD and the
  MHUUC. In the case of PPPs, contracts are approved by the MoF. A study of Cairo Alexandria
  Potable Water Organization, and WSCs in Sharkeya, and Kafr El Sheikh found that a num-
  ber of WSC functions were outsourced to the private sector, including equipment mainte-
  nance, security, and software development. With support from the U.S. Agency for
  International Development (USAID), HCWW developed a database of 177 local companies
                                                                   qualification, bidding, and
  interested in providing services to the WSCs. In addition to pre-​
  contracting documentation, methods for prioritizing capital investments were developed
  to allow the HCWW to provide contracting support to the WSCs (USAID 2009).

•	 Performance monitoring. EWRA is mandated to monitor the sector’s technical, financial,
  and economic performance and efficiency. Further, the HCWW currently plays a signifi-
  cant role in monitoring performance of the WSCs using the Monitoring, Analysis and
  Reporting System (MARS), which is available to all WSCs. Performance data submitted by
  the WSCs to the HCWW through the MARS are assessed on a quarterly basis by the
  HCWW’s Economic Analysis Department, which covers 65 performance indicators on
  WSS service delivery (annex 3.1). This information is presented to the HCWW Chairman,
  who communicates areas of performance improvements to be made to each respective
  WSC (USAID 2009);

     •	 Information dissemination. EWRA is mandated to publish and disseminate information,
                                                                                    ­ onsumers
       reports, and recommendations that support the projects described and provide c
       with knowledge of their rights and obligations, and generally raise awareness of EWRA’s role.

     •	 Consumer protection. EWRA is mandated to investıgate customer complaints to ensure
       the protection of their interests.

       Funding of EWRA. In accordance with Presidential Decree No. 136 of 2004, EWRA is funded
     through the following sources:

     •	 Annual allocations from the State General Budget

     •	 Service payments from state and private projects in the water and wastewater sectors

     •	 Grants, donations, and contributions in line with the objectives of EWRA

     •	 Interest and/or profits gained from EWRA’s invested funds

     •	 Any other revenues, in accordance with the law.

       EWRA’s Board of Directors. The Board of Directors of EWRA is formed under the chairman-
     ship of the Minister of Housing, and is comprised of the following (OECD 2010):

     •	 EWRA Executive Director

     •	 NOPWASD Chairman

     •	 Members nominated by the Minister of Housing representing the water and wastewater
       sectors, special expertise,and consumersRepresentatives of the Ministries of Finance,
       Health, and Environment.

       The Board of Director’s functions are to:

     •	 Develop EWRA’s organizational structure to ensure the achievement of its objectives
       and execute its responsibilities

     •	 Ensure that governmental projects working in the WSS sector comply with required tech-
       nical performance standards, and inform relevant project implementation entities about
       these standards before they commence work

     •	 Approve the technical, commercial, and economic performance standards to enhance
       sector performance and ensure safety and protection of consumer interests

     •	 Investigate complaints presented by consumers, assess the responses to consumer com-
       plaints, and adopt required measures

     •	 Approve bylaws relevant to EWRA’s financial, technical, and administrative affairsDeter-
       mine fees in return for services that EWRA provides to the sector.


     Tariff Setting
     Egypt water and wastewater tariffs are among the lowest in the world, at US$ 0.08/m3, and
     cover only 25 percent of the cost of water supply service and 10 percent of the costs of pro-
     viding sewerage service (HCWW 2014). Wastewater tariffs are charged as a fixed percentage


46   Status of Water Sector Regulation in the Middle East and North Africa
of the water bill and remain very low at (35 percent in most governorates). Cost inefficiencies
in the WSS sector (in terms of fiscal transfers to cover operating inefficiencies, below-cost
tariffs, and excessive infrastructure and financing costs) amount to an estimated US$ 1.25
billion per year—the equivalent of 1.25 percent of Egypt’s GDP (World Bank 2010).
Consequentially, per capita water consumption is quite high, increasing pressure to build
more systems to meet the high demand (World Bank 2010).
  The Water and Wastewater Sector Development Policy of 2010 recognizes the need for the
WSCs to achieve financial independence by improving investment and operational efficiency,
as well as by increasing tariffs and reducing subsidies (World Bank 2015b). Under the current
tariff structure, prices increase by two piasters every two months (World Bank 2015b). WSCs
are failing to cover their O&M costs, and bills, including those for electricity, are partially
unpaid (World Bank 2015b). Hence, O&M costs are heavily subsidized by the central
government. The government is currently subsidizing the operations of the sector by LE750
­
million per year (US$84.5 million) (2014). Reducing this subsidy by improving cost control
and  ultimately by increasing the tariff is a high priority for the government (World Bank
                     ­ onsumers pay tariffs that are about 20 percent of the delivery costs
2015b). Water supply c
(including treatment and delivery costs) (Ministry of Finance 2005). Until recently (before
the HCWW was established), governors had the authority to set water prices up to a ceiling of
LE0.23 per cubic meter. Although this ceiling is below actual production costs by a factor of
                 governors used this authorization. The O&M subsidies to the ­
3 to 4, not many ­                                                           subsector are
                                                                            million), or 2.0–2.5
estimated at LE3 billion to LE4 billion per year (US$ 340 million to US$450 ­
percent of total public recurrent expenditures (World Bank 2015).
  The authority to adjust or revise tariffs lies with the Cabinet of Ministers, not EWRA
(World Bank 2015). EWRA, as well as the HCWW which submits tariff requests to the Cabinet of
Ministers, have made several attempts to introduce higher tariffs. Some progress has been
made in raising the tariffs of industrial and large-scale users and in making small gradual
increases in the water and sanitation tariffs. A tariff study and proposal being put forth by EWRA
would allow WSCs to recover O&M costs within the first three years of implementation, and
then balance depreciation of their infrastructure with revenue within five years. In fact, an
increase had been made in early 2016, but was soon eroded by the increase in energy prices.
EWRA would  review this  tariff structure in the first three years of implementation, and
then every five years thereafter. There would also be a pro-poor element to the tariff structure
that  would subsidize the first two consumption blocks (using 0–20 m3 of water per month)
(World Bank 2015).
  There is growing consensus that the following principles should be incorporated in the
future tariff structures (World Bank 2015):

•	 Cost recovery. Tariffs should generate revenues that would allow to fully cover operation
  and maintenance (O&M) costs, and eventually a portion of capital costs.

•	 Economic efficiency. Tariffs should send correct signals to customers so that water is allo-
  cated optimally, minimizing waste and inefficiency.

                                             •	 Fairness, equity, and affordability. Tariffs should result in water and sewer bills that are
                                                 proportionate to the costs imposed on the utility.

                                             •	 Simplicity. Tariffs should be transparent and relatively simple so that customers can easily
                                                 understand how their water bill will change based on water consumption.

                                             Consumer Protection and Citizen Engagement
                                             There are a number of channels for receiving complaints related to WSS services. One
                                             of the formal grievance channels managed by the HCWW is the “125” hotline. In prac-
                                             tice, most complaints are still being communicated through other informal channels,
                                                       verbally to laboratory staff, maintenance service staff, security, commercial
                                             including ­
                                             personnel, or media. There is no strict documentation and record for the complaints
                                             received through these informal channels (World Bank 2015). There are also “Customers
                                                                                                              (districts) in all the
                                             Service Centers,” which are located on the level of all branches ­
                                             Governorates. The Centers receive different types of complaints, but their core ­operation
                                             is more ­oriented to issues related to billing and connecting new customers (subscription)
                                             (World Bank 2015). WSCs send reports to the Public Awareness and Customers Services
                                             Department at the HCWW, which is responsible for monitoring checks on a daily basis,
                                             and documenting the number of grievances received, the actions taken to handle them,
                                             and progress in resolving the complaints. They also send samples of the recorded calls
                                             to the Public Awareness and Customers Services Department at the HCWW (World
                                             Bank 2015). The HCWW produces regular reports on the types of complaints received
                                             and this report is used to inform decision makers. Several institutions are responsible
                                                 addressing grievances in the WSS sector at the national, governorate, and district
                                             for ­
                                             levels. Table 3.4 provides a brief description of the main responsibilities of each

Performance Monitoring
One of the first initiatives undertaken by HCWW to monitor and evaluate the performance
of the WSCs was the development of the Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting System
(MARS) program, through which it monitors the performance of its WSCs through select
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The MARS tool allows for the periodical transfer of data
from the WSCs to the HCWW, which includes performance indicators, water and wastewa-
ter quality sampling, technical monitoring, and financial monitoring data (annex 3.1).
MARS enables the HCWW to monitor and benchmark performance of the WSCs, identify
areas of improvement, understand progress toward sector objectives including cost recov-
ery, and reward initiative or take remedial action (USAID 2009).
  In parallel to the MARS, the Annual Information Return (AIR) system was first intro-
duced in 2009 (USAID 2012). EWRA collects information on WSC performance from the
HCWW and develops the Annual Information Return and produces a report for the MHUUC,
which includes recommendations for improving sector performance. Table 3.5 lists the
performance criteria of the WSCs reported by EWRA, which include financial, commercial,
service, quality, and technical indicators (ACWUA 2013, 49–51):

Status of Water Sector Regulation in the Middle East and North Africa                                             49
                                         Next Steps
                                         Although there is much to be done to further develop Egypt’s WSS regulatory framework,
                                         EWRA has taken a proactive approach, with significant support from the donor community,
                                         to develop its technical capacity. One pending issue is the enactment of the Water Law,
                                         which would provide additional de jure support to EWRA for carrying out its role. At the
                                         time of writing, Parliament is expected to finalize the Water Law imminently. It would estab-
                                         lish a firmer legal basis for concession agreements, clarify regulatory responsibilities, and
                                         provide sanctions for noncompliance. Some of the responsibilities EWRA might assume
                                         include:

                                         •	 Regulation of all activities related to drinking water and wastewater services

                                         •	 Licensing of WSCs

                                         •	 Auditing all sector activities/projects

                                         •	 Following up on water and wastewater projects in order to achieve the highest level of
                                            performance; ensure service sustainability without compromising quality and efficiency;
                                            and assure the provision of services to customers in a satisfactory and affordable
                                            manner.

                                                          Abstract
            Jordan is one of the world’s most water-scarce countries. Options for increasing water
            resources are limited and highly political. Further complicating matters, Jordan is host to a
            very large population of displaced persons. The Jordanian government recognizes the impor-
            tance of sustainable water use, is taking steps to increase efficiency and awareness of this vital
            resource, and is working with partners and varied stakeholders, including the private sector,
            to increase the options available.


            Introduction to the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector and
            the Country Context
            Jordan is an upper-middle-income country with a population of 6.6 million,1 not including
            an estimated 1.3 million refugees (mainly Syrian) who have entered the country since 2011.2
            One of the world’s most water-scarce countries, Jordan has faced a steep increase in water
            demand in recent years because of rapid population growth. The influx of refugees alone
            has led to an increase in demand by 21 percent.3 Groundwater contributes approximately
            61 percent to total water supply (World Bank 2016),4 but the aquifers are being depleted.
            This depletion has been exacerbated by the lack of enforcement of regulations on private
            sector drilling of wells, and the near absence of controls on licensed abstraction rates. As
            water tables drop, pumping costs and salinity levels increase.5 According to the National
            Water Strategy 2016–55 document, since the Disi-Amman Conveyor became operational in
            summer 2013, the continuity of supply in the capital city of Amman has improved. Aqaba
            has continuous water supply from the Disi aquifer. However, there are still water shortages
            in the northern Governorates because of the influx of refugees.
              In addition to securing adequate raw water, other main challenges the government and
            service providers face (ACWUA 2013, 73–82) are to:

            •	 Improve the financial viability of services by fostering efficiency and increasing cost
              recovery, while taking into account the political sensitivity of water

            •	 Encourage more efficient use of water through public education and awareness cam-
              paigns, as well as appropriate pricing.

              More than half of water resources in Jordan is used for irrigation. The high cost of finding and
            providing new nontraditional water sources and the long distances between water sources and
            consumption centers contribute to high capital and operational costs.6 Water has traditionally
            been perceived as a public good and water services (including irrigation) are highly subsidized.
              Capital expenditures are funded primarily by build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects
            (government concessions); the government and donors (as capital contributions and grants);
            ­

     and, to a lesser extent, by national and foreign loans (as debt). Capital costs are not recov-
     ered through end user tariffs. In 2014, revenues for WSS services covered only 70 percent of
     operations and maintenance (O&M) costs. Inadequate revenues from ­
     ­                                                                services have contrib-
     uted to the country’s fiscal deficit (World Bank 2016, 8). Revenues for irrigation services
     also do not recover all O&M costs and require significant annual subsidies (van den Berg and
     others 2016, Executive Summary, ix–xii). Recognition that these deficits could not be main-
     tained contributed to the decisions to increase WSS volumetric tariffs in 2014 and fixed
     charges in 2016. Further tariff increases and current and future efforts to improve efficiency
     are expected to contribute to gradual improvements in cost recovery (World Bank 2016,
     25, 42). Efforts to reduce the financial burden of irrigation services are expected to focus on
     improving energy efficiency and wastewater reuse (World Bank 2016, 28–29).

                                         development, provision of services, pricing, and monitoring.
                                             The Water Authority of Jordan (WAJ) (created by Law No. 18 in 1988, which predates
                                         the establishment of MWI) is responsible for ensuring bulk water supply (except in areas
                                         served by the Jordan Valley Authority, JVA) and for developing and operating WSS
                                         services throughout Jordan. Bulk water is supplied in part through WAJ’s own abstrac-

       Amman, and certain parts of Balqa, Zarqa and Madaba governorates. It has an estimated
       550,000 customers.

     •	 Aqaba Water Company (AWC) serves Aqaba governorate. Unlike the other water compa-
       nies, AWC is not a fully owned subsidiary of WAJ. WAJ has a substantial ownership stake
       (85 percent), but the remaining minority share (15 percent) is owned by the Aqaba Special
       Economic Zone (ASEZA).

     •	 Yarmouk Water Company (YWC) is fully owned by the WAJ and serves four northern
       governorates (Irbid, Mafraq, Ajloun, and Jerash). YWC was created in January 2011.
       A  management team from the French transnational company, Veolia, was embedded
       from September 2011 to December 2012 to carry out change management, develop solid
       corporate practices, and achieve the ring-fencing of YWC from WAJ.7

       WAJ’s governorate-level administrations operate WSS services in areas not served by
     the three utilities (in Al-Karak, Maan, and Al-Tafila governorates, and parts of Balqa
     governorate).
       The Jordan Valley Authority (JVA) (created by Law No. 30 of 2001) is responsible for the
     development and protection of water resources, the management of dams, and the provi-
     sion of irrigation services in the Jordan Rift Valley.
       The Program Management Unit (PMU) of MWI is charged with auditing and monitoring
     the performance of the corporatized utilities and developing and promoting private sector
     partnerships. Its mission is “to obtain efficiencies in investment in infrastructure and to
     improve the management of water and sanitation services.” It is intended to resemble a
     regulator, but currently lacks the capacity and de facto authority to carry out regulatory
     functions.
       The Water Sector Audit Unit (WSAU) within PMU was created in 2008 to audit and monitor
     private sector activities, report to MWI, and recommend remedial action when necessary.
     At inception, it was believed WSAU might evolve into a full-fledged regulatory body,8 but
     this has not occurred, and it seems to have limited authority.
       Joint Technical Affairs Committees, comprised of representatives of MWI and other con-
     cerned ministries and institutions, advise the Minister of MWI on a variety of issues, includ-
     ing investment projects, land use, and water resources development. There are more than 15
     permanent committees. In addition, temporary committees are formed as needed.9
       JVA has organized Water Users Associations (WUAs) in the Jordan Valley to encourage com-
     munity and private sector participation in managing public resources and to provide ser-
     vices for customers. As of 2015, 19 WUAs had been established and 16 had signed agreements
     with JVA under which the WUAs assume specific tasks and receive fees paid by JVA. JVA and
     MWI are monitoring the performance and sustainability of the initiative.10
       Important infrastructure projects that require significant funding have been financed by
     build-operate-transfer projects (BOTs), as well as other forms of private sector participation.

Several private investments in water production and transmission and wastewater treat-
ment have contributed to improving water security. These include the the Disi Water
Conveyance Project (box 4.1), the As Samara Wastewater Treatment Plant (box 4.2), and the
Red Sea to Dead Sea Conveyor, all of which are supervised by MWI (with support from
JVA and WAJ).




      Box 4.1.   DISI-Amman Conveyor


      The Disi-Amman Conveyor is a multinational build-operate-transfer (BOT) project to
      build and operate a 325 km-long pipeline to bring water from a nonrenewable aquifer
      located under the Disi region, near the Saudi border (Wadi Rum) to Amman, Aqaba
      and recently from Amman onward to Zarqa. It will carry 100 million m3 per year for
      a total of 25 years. Construction was mainly carried out by the Disi Water Company
      (DIWACO), which is owned by GAMA Energy Water International B.V. (50 percent
      by GAMA Holding, a Turkish Company; and 50 percent by a subsidiary of General
      Electric). Disi-Amman Conveyor is operated by Disi Amman Operation & Maintenance
      (DAOM), a subsidiary of Suez Environnement (a French company). The project became
      operational in 2013 and commercial as of 2014.




      Box 4.2.   As Samra Wastewater Treatment Plant Expansion


      In 2012, the Jordanian government, led by the Ministry of Water and Irrigation (MWI),
      initiated an expansion (Phase II) of the As Samra wastewater treatment plant. The pro­
      ject is funded by international donors such as The Millennium Challenge Corporation;
      the MWI; and private lenders, including a local syndicate led by The Arab Bank. Equity
      is provided by international corporations acting as sponsors. The two project companies
      are Samra Wastewater Treatment Plant Company Ltd. (SPC) and Samra Plant Operation
      and Maintenance Co. Ltd. (O&M), which are partnerships of Morganti, Suez Environne-
      ment, and its subsidiary, Degrémont. The innovative financing package, which was
      designed to mitigate risks, has received international prizes. It is the first in the Middle
      East to incorporate private, host government, and donor financing.

      Phase I was completed in 2008 under a 25-year build-operate-transfer (BOT) con-
      tract signed in 2003 It has a capacity of a 267,000 m3/day. Phase II, also to be built
      and operated under a 25-year BOT contract, has a total project cost of US$267.7 mil-
      lion. The expansion works are expected to last for three years, followed by 22 years
      of operations (until 2037).
                                                                             box continues next page

           The As Samra expansion project (Phase II) will increase the plant’s water line capacity
           by 40 percent to 367,000 m3/day, and increase sludge line capacity by 80 percent.
           Once Phase II is complete, it is estimated that 75 percent of wastewater treated in
           Jordan will be treated in the As Samra plant. The reusable treated water produced in
           the plant will be used for irrigation and will represent about 10 percent of the water
           supply available in the country. Considering that about 65 percent of water resources
           in Jordan is used for irrigation, the re-use of treated water frees up fresh water for
           more valuable uses and is critical for balancing water supply and demand.

     Legal, Policy, and Regulatory Framework
     The Jordanian water sector has historically been highly centralized and nationally inte-
     grated. The government is now moving toward disaggregation and devolution of responsi-
     bilities through the creation of ring-fenced service providers and the engagement of the
     private sector in key projects.
       Cost recovery is currently inadequate and tariffs for residential customers are extremely
     low. Subsidies are not highly targeted. However, the National Water Strategy endorses the
     objective of financial viability through full cost recovery of O&M as well as capital costs in
     the long term. Among the Strategy’s stated objectives are to reduce and target public subsi-
     dies and “to protect the interests of consumers while providing a good quality service and
     paying attention to the poor.”11
       The National Water Strategy emphasizes increased use of nonconventional water sources
     such as treated wastewater and desalinated seawater to bridge the shortfall in supply.
     Projects such as the As Samara Wastewater Treatment Expansion and the proposed Red Sea
     to Dead Sea Conveyor are important components of this strategy.12
       A new Water Law is being drafted to reflect the objectives set out in the strategy docu-
     ments. The new water law will define the structure and functions of the institutions govern-
     ing and managing the water sector and clarify the responsibilities of the different ministries
     involved in the water sector. It will also clarify legal issues related to water.13
       Key water sector laws and policy documents are summarized in table 4.2, and in some
     cases elaborated in more detail in the next section on regulation.

Water sector

Law No. 54 of 1992                  Creates the Ministry of Water and Irrigation (MWI) and makes it responsible for all water issues, including formulating
(executive order)                   strategy, policy and decision making, pricing, planning, and resources monitoring.

Bylaw No. 14 of 2014                Gives MWI full responsibility for water and public sewerage and all related projects in Jordan.

Law No. 18 of 1988                  Created the Water Authority of Jordan (WAJ), which predates the MWI, and makes it responsible for bulk water supply to
                                    municipal and industrial users (except in areas served by the Jordan Valley Authority), and the development and operation
                                    of water supply and wastewater systems.

Law No. 30 of 2001                  Created the Jordan Valley Authority (JVA) and made it responsible for the development and conservation of water resources
                                    in the Jordan Rift Valley, including functions such as the provision of irrigation services, the management of dams, the
                                    development of wastewater reuse, soil conservation, protecting and saving the Dead Sea, and the management and
                                    protection of land in the Araba valley for agricultural, tourist, and industrial purposes.a

Strategy documents

National Water Strategy             A new strategy was required because the population projection for 2022 had already been reached due to the influx of
2016–55 (2015)f (sometimes          refugees. The strategy calls for institutional reform and endorses independent regulation of the sector; a focus on new
referred to as “Vision 2025”)       water source options (including harvesting rainwater and brackish and seawater desalination) while sustaining existing levels
                                    of supply; reducing the drain on public funds through tariffs that should eventually recover all costs; further corporatization
                                    of operators; improvements in governance and management; and clear boundaries between bulk and retail water services.g
                                    It includes key performance indicators for water security.

Jordan’s Water Strategy             Though superseded by the 2015 Strategy, it was an important document that called for institutional reform and endorsed
2008–22–Water for                   independent regulation of the sector (which are reiterated in the 2015 strategy).

     Regulation of Water Supply and Sanitation Services
     Drinking water quality and effluent quality. Regulation of drinking water quality and waste-
     water effluents is and will remain the remit of the Ministry of Health (MoH) and Ministry
     of Environment (MoE), respectively. The Ministry of Health monitors the quality of water
     provided by all types of service providers, including private water tankers. It also issues
     (and can revoke) the licenses of private water tankers.14 The consultants were unable to
     determine how frequently the two ministries sample or require operators to sample the
     water or effluents.
       Licensing of WSS service providers. Currently WAJ issues permits/mandates for utilities
     (subject to MWI approval). These are not necessarily time bound, and for this reason they
     are not licenses per se. It is not known whether the proposed new Water Law, which is being
     drafted, would delegate authority to issue licenses to a regulatory body.
       Groundwater abstraction. Permits for groundwater abstraction are issued by the MWI,
     which is developing a more comprehensive regime to improve control and mitigate the
     depletion of aquifers.


     Tariff Setting and Reviews
     WAJ and JVA recommend water tariff changes as well as capital investment projects to the
     Council of Ministers (Cabinet) for approval. In the case of tariffs, changes are subject to
     the approval of the Parliament.15 In addition, the King (Royal Court) may veto tariff changes
     and, as recounted later in this chapter, has done so. The National Strategy (Vision 2025)
     confirms current tariff-setting practices: “WAJ and JVA recommend water service cost
     changes and capital projects, but the Cabinet has ultimate regulatory authority, especially
     for tariffs.”16 The National Water Strategy endorsed the objective of financial viability through
     full cost recovery of O&M as well as capital costs in the long term.
       In 2014, volumetric tariffs for all categories of customers and usage were increased. In
     late 2015, the fixed rates across most customer categories were increased. However, a recent
     attempt of the Miyahuna Company to bring tariffs in line with rising costs of production
     was unexpectedly vetoed. While verbal approval for the revised tariff structure had been
     secured from the Cabinet, it was vetoed by the Royal Court.17
       Cost recovery is currently inadequate and tariffs for residential customers are extremely
     low. Subsidies are not targeted to the truly needy low-income households. Rather, all resi-
     dential customers are highly subsidized. Among stated objectives of the Strategy are to
     reduce and target public subsidies and “to protect the interests of consumers while provid-
     ing a good quality service and paying attention to the poor.”18
       Currently, the low volumetric tariff for the first block is applied to all residential consump-
     tion, regardless of income: all residential customers pay JD 0.12 per m3 (US$0.17/m3) for the
     first 18 m3 per quarter. This rate is highly subsidized. In contrast, nonresidential (commercial
     and industrial) customers of the three water utilities pay a water tariff of JD 1.3 per m3
     (US$1.83 per m3), which is 11 times the residential water tariff. However, it is worth noting


62   Status of Water Sector Regulation in the Middle East and North Africa
that when the fixed charge is included, the cost of 18 m3 rises to JD 0.36/m3 (US$0.51) for
residential customers. The cost of 18 m3 rises to JD 1.73/m3 (US$2.44 m3) for no-residential
customers when the fixed charge is included–a figure that is nearly five times the cost for
residential customers.
  The nonresidential sewerage tariff is more than 20 times higher than the first block of
sewerage tariffs paid by residential customers. Only when residential consumption exceeds
90 m3 per quarter does the residential tariff exceed the nonresidential tariff.
  Tables 4.3 and 4.4 show the tariff schedules for residential and nonresidential customers.19
As shown in the tables, the water bill consists of three parts: a fixed charge to cover the
administrative costs; volumetric water consumption tariffs; and volumetric wastewater
tariffs (for those who have a sewerage connection).
  Connection fees for residential customers are also lower than those for nonresidential
customers. The minimum residential connection fee is JD 245 (US$345.56) and the mini-
mum for nonresidential connections is JD 325 (US$458.39). The incurred amount depends

Note: The tariff for each block applies to all customers regardless of total consumption. Thus, a customer of one of the
companies who consumes 20 m3 would pay JD 0.118/m3 for the first eighteen m3 and JD 0.145/m3 for the nineteenth and
twentieth m3. m3 = cubic meters.
a. Fixed charges are cumulative. A customer who consumes 20 m3 would pay JD 4.4 + JD 3.85 = JD 8.25.
b. Minimum charges are in parentheses.
c. The minimum consumption is 18 m3/quarter. Thus the minimum quarterly charge for water consumption is JD 2.13 and the
minimum quarterly charge for wastewater is JD 0.69. The fixed charge of JD 4.4 is added.

Status of Water Sector Regulation in the Middle East and North Africa                                                                 63
     on the area of the property, the type of use, and the length of the wastewater network. No
     analysis of the affordability of the connection charge was found.
       The prices, for residential users in Jordan—especially for the first block—are somewhat
     lower than other countries in the Middle East and North Africa region. When the fixed
     charges are taken into account, rates are more comparable. A recent study found that the
     combined average water and sewerage bills of a household in Jordan are less than 0.5 percent
     of household monthly expenditures.20 However, this does not reflect expenditures due to
     intermittent supply and other factors, such as for bottled water from vendors, as well as
     emptying septic tanks.21


     Consumer Protection
     A customer’s first point of contact is with the utilities. If the problem is not resolved, the
     customer may contact WAJ and finally MWI. Consultants were unable to obtain more infor-
     mation on how well the process works.


     Performance Monitoring and Promotion of PPP/PSP
     The Performance Management Unit (PMU) within MWI is charged with developing public-­
     private partnerships (PPPs) and promoting private sector participation (PSP) in water ser-
     vices and management. It also monitors the implementation of donor-funded projects and
     ensures compliance with covenants. 22 The WSAU within the PMU monitors and audits the
     performance of only the three corporatized utilities. Its duties include data collection, per-
     formance evaluation, periodic inspections, and investment project feasibility reviews.


     Next Steps
     The National Water Strategy states a number of objectives aimed at rationalizing the sec-
     tor, improving performance, and promoting water security. Steps envisioned include the
     following.

     •	 A new Water Law and regulatory framework. The Vision 2025 strategy document men-
       tions the need for the development of the legislation/regulatory framework governing
       the water sector. The National Water Strategy states that “there is a growing need for a
       more consolidated, harmonized and coordinated water management organization, backed
       by a strong legal/regulatory framework.”23

     •	 The National Water Strategy states that “MWI will work to complete the separation and
       corporatization of all water and wastewater utilities and build their capacities to manage
       the change to continuous supply.”24

     •	 The Strategy (Vision 2025) endorses improved efficiency in both technical and commer-
       cial operations as an essential component of a plan to achieve financial viability over time.
       Technical improvements in energy efficiency, reduction of physical water losses, and sys-
       tem optimization are proposed. Commercial improvements through the elimination of


64   Status of Water Sector Regulation in the Middle East and North Africa
   unauthorized connections, more effective billing and revenue collection, and the out-
   sourcing of billing to third parties are mentioned. The Strategy states that the government
   plans to adopt, a Structural Benchmark–Action Plan to Reduce Water Sector [fiscal] Losses,
   which states its intention to achieve recovery of O&M costs by 2021 through improve-
   ments in efficiency and tariff increases.25

•	 The National Water Strategy emphasizes the potential role of the private sector and a
   greater role for water users associations (WUAs).

•	 Also mentioned, the National Water Strategy states that subsidies should be appropriately
   targeted. MWI is currently investigating the issue of whether and how to target subsidies
   to low-income households.

                                                          Abstract
            Morocco is experiencing high population growth and urbanization, like many other countries
            in the Middle East and North Africa. Water resources are becoming increasingly scarce. In
            addition, most of the country’s water resources are utilized by the agriculture sector (over 80
            percent). As a result, the provision of water supply services is becoming a significant challenge.
            To meet this challenge, Morocco has utilized a variety of institutional and contractual arrange-
            ments to deliver water and sanitation services to its people, involving national, regional,
            municipal, and private sector entities. The regulatory approach adopted to date is largely the
            French model of regulation by contract. Further studies of the Moroccan water sector might
            analyze how the different institutional and service delivery models compare, and the most
            appropriate regulatory arrangements to support improved access and service delivery in each
            respective case.


            Introduction to the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector and the
            Country Context
            Morocco is an upper-middle-income country with a population of 33.9 million.1 It is located
            in northwest Africa, between the Sahara desert and the Atlas mountains, with coastlines on
            both the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Given the topography, there are significantly more
            water resources available in the northern parts of the country than the southern. Morocco’s
            annual population growth rate of 3 percent2 is much higher than the global average annual
            growth rate of 1.2 percent.3 Over time, the urban population has increased and surpassed the
            rural population, and, at 20.25 million, currently accounts for 59.7 percent of the population
            (see table 5.1).4
              In recent years, Morocco has been faced with a set of challenges in the management of its
            water resources. In particular, a 2013 study by the Arab Countries Water Utilities Association
            (ACWUA) states that the per capita endowment of water resources is expected to fall from
            the current 730 m3 per capita per year to 520 m3 per capita per year by 2020.5 Water demand
            is expected to increase from 13.7 Billion cubic meters (BCM) currently to 16.2 BCM by 2030
            (ACWUA 2013). Therefore, the government is focusing on responding to the growing demand
            for drinking water, while providing agriculture with enough water to meet the population’s
            nutritional needs and encourage export agriculture (ACWUA 2013, 3–21).

     Structure and Organization of the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector
     The institutional framework of Morocco’s WSS sector is shown in figure 5.1.
       As is often the case in the water sector, several ministries are involved in the management
     of the sector. The principle line ministry is the Ministry of Energy, Mines, Water, and
     Environment (MEMEE). Within this very large ministry, most of the responsibilities related
     to the water sector have been delegated to the Ministry of Water.
       The Interministerial Price Committee (CIP) housed under the Ministry of General Affairs
     and Governance plays an important role in tariff setting. Four ministries are represented in
     CIP: the Ministry of General Affairs and Governance (MAGG); the Ministry of Energy, Mines,
     Water, and Environment (MEMEE); the Ministry of the Interior (MoI); and the Ministry of
     Finance (MoF).
       CIP plays an overall quasi-regulatory role. Service delivery is organized largely along the
     lines of the French contractual model. Contracts are the basis of the relationship between
     the government and service providers, whether private or public. (The regulatory arrange-
     ments within this model are explained further in the fourth section.)
       The Ministry of the Interior plays a role in monitoring and supervision of the sector.
     One of the MoI’s departments (Direction des Regies et Services Concedes —DRSC) handles
     the day-to-day monitoring and supervision of the Autonomous Agencies (Régies Autonomes),

                                          as well as the renegotiation of the private concessions. To date, this monitoring and super-
                                          vision has been fairly light, perhaps in part because of relatively limited capacity. The DEA,
                                          also within MoI, is intended to monitor service provision in small local collectives that
                                          have been delegated to the National Office of Electricity and Drinking Water Supply/L’Office
                                          National de l’Electricité et de l’Eau Potable (ONEE). But again, the supervision/monitoring
                                          function to date has been fairly light.

                                          sector include the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Health. It is important to note
                                          that the Ministry of Agriculture, through its Irrigation Directorate, oversees about 86 percent
                                          of the water in Morocco.
                                            For production and distribution (including bulk-water wholesaler) of water, the principal
                                          state institution is ONEE. The main strategic goals of ONEE are to:6

                                          •	 Assure, implement, and plan the provision of potable water in urban areas

                                          •	 Increase the general availability of water in rural areas7

                                          •	 Improve sanitation access and service delivery.8

       ONEE also plays a major function in planning of developing the projections for the sector,
     and working with the Ministry of Water Resources, which actually mobilizes the resource.

     Institutional Service Provision Models
     The current institutional arrangements for services include four service delivery models:

     1.	 Delegation to ONEE (services in about 600 small and medium-sized cities) (30 percent
       of the population)

     2.	Autonomous Agencies (Régies Autonomes) in 12 large cities, whereby the government
       has  a contractual agreement with ONEE and 12 Regional Collectives (33 percent of the
       population)

     3.	Delegation to private sector operators in four large cities through concession-like arrange-
       ments (37 percent of the population)

     4.	Direct management by a municipality of its own services (less than 1 percent).9

       More than 80 percent of bulk water is provided by ONEE as owner and operator. The remain-
     der is supplied by municipal distributors.
       In the Middle East and North Africa, Morocco is considered relatively experienced with
     public-private partnerships (PPPs). In the water sector, this is most visible through the dele-
     gated management (gestion déleguée) of services. The delegation of service to a private
     company was first introduced through a contract for multiple public services (electricity,
     water, and wastewater) in the Casablanca region in 1997.10,11 There are currently delegated
     management contracts with international companies for water services in four major cities:
     Lydec (owned by Suez) in Casablanca; Redal (owned by Veolia) in Rabat; Amendis Tanger
     (owned by Veolia); and Amendis Tetouan (owned by Veolia). The bids for delegated manage-
     ment are negotiated and operators are assigned exclusive right to provide service in speci-
     fied region. Thus, once they have secured the rights to manage the distribution services in a
     certain market, there is no effective competition in the market. Morocco is exploring further
     advances in this domain, through both changes in the legal and institutional framework and
     with regard to increased financial sustainability (including the recovery of capital costs).


     Legal, Policy, and Regulatory Framework
     Organization of the water sector in Morocco to date is based on Law 10-95 of 20 September
     1995.9 However, a new water sector law has just been approved by Parliament and is awaiting
     final ratification and publication. The proposed law aims to address some of the most cur-
     rent and critical environmental and water challenges of Morocco. This law is likely to set the
     basis for many of the activities, investments, and regulations in the sector going forward
     (see table 5.2).
       Currently, the prevalent arrangement is the contractual model. This model is used for the
     four private management companies (Casablanca, Rabat, Tangier, and Tetouan). The contrac-
     tual model is also used between government entities, and specifically between CIP and ONEE.

                                           An example of a contractual model between government agencies is the Contract-Program
                                           (Contrat-Programme) between ONEE and the government (represented by CIP), which is
                                           overseen by the MAGG. The Contract-Program indicates policy objectives. The Preamble9 of
                                           the Contract-Program 2014–77 states that one of the 2020 targets of the National Sanitation
                                           Program (PNA) is to decrease wastewater pollution by 60 percent. Another target is to increase
                                           urban sanitation connection levels to 80 percent.
                                             The main laws that set the institutional framework of the sector are summarized in
                                           table 5.2.

                                         on water governance and administration, and affirms the Superior Council on Water and Climate as a key consultative
                                         institution in charge of oversight of the water sector. The Council is presided over by the head of the government. Half
                                         its members are government representatives while the other half are from regional councils, hydraulic basin councils,

                                               Regulation of Water Supply and Sanitation Services
                                               At present, there is no independent regulator. The French contractual model (with its built-in
                                               regulatory system) prevails (see Chapter 1 for more explanation of the different regulatory
                                               models). However, the need for a regulatory agency for the electricity sector is mentioned in
                                               the Contract-Program. The need for a regulatory agency is also described in detail in the report
                                               of the Court of Accounts, which calls for an “independent body” for regulatory purposes.
                                                  The recent merger of ONE and ONEP may imply an inclination to adopt a multisector
                                               model. Delegated management contracts sometimes include multiple distribution services
                                               (water and electricity, as in the example of Lydec in Casablanca).12 Of the twelve Régies
                                               Autonomes, seven provide multiple services (water, electricity, and sanitation). It remains
                                               to be seen, however whether a regulatory agency or agencies would be created by the new
                                               laws, and if so whether the multisector or single sector model will be chosen.
                                                  Currently, due to the decentralized structure of the water sector, some regulatory func-
                                               tions rest with two bodies. The Ministry of General Affairs and Governance (MAGG), which
                                               hosts the Interministerial Committee on Prices (CIP), plays a leading role in governance and
                                               inspections. CIP is the closest formal body to a price regulator. It approves tariff revisions
                                               and negotiates programs and contracts.

                                               Tariff Setting and Reviews
                                               The four institutional service models have slightly different tariff-setting arrangements.
                                                  Delegation to ONEE (around 600 small and medium cities). In the rural and smaller urban
                                               areas, municipalities often delegate water distribution services to ONEE. Like the Régies,


72                                             Status of Water Sector Regulation in the Middle East and North Africa
ONEE is also subject to CIP for price review and to the Ministry of Interior for technical mat-
ters. It may petition for a change of tariff to CIP. ONEE has a formal 2014-2017 Contract-
Program with the government (through CIP).
  Autonomous Agencies (Régies Autonomes) in 12 large cities/regions. As with municipalities,
the Régies are also subject to tariff review by CIP and technical oversight by the Ministry of
Interior. The tariffs of the Régies are negotiated and then fixed by the government, based on
CIP’s advice. The Régies may petition for a change of tariff to CIP. The cost of investments
and efficiency levels are key to CIP’s consideration.
  Delegation to the private sector (four concessions in big cities). The tariffs of the private com-
panies (delegated management) are negotiated with the delegating authority (first with
municipalities, and then with the government). While the prices of services provided under
delegated management tend to be higher than the average, they are not always higher than
those charged by ONEE or the Régies. The private operators have been deemed successful in
increasing managerial capabilities and spearheading progress in the water sector, as well as
increasing service quality, water security, and attention to environmental considerations.
  Direct management. If a municipality chooses to manage tariffs directly, CIP oversees
prices and the Ministry of the Interior oversees technical matters. CIP advises with regards
to differential tariffs in different regions. In water-scarce regions, water can be twice as
expensive. The current practice is to regulate the price according to the contract.
  For all four models, the government (CIP) applies the concept of economic and financial
equilibrium by calculating an average tariff as the revenue requirement divided by the total
volume sold. Actual tariffs are set for each tranche of consumption and type of user (based
on economic and social considerations). The relative flexibility of tariffs, which was intro-
duced by the initiation of the delegated management contracts, has enabled the delegated
management companies to fund maintenance and replacement of existing infrastructure.
  However, the current tariff system does not generate sufficient revenues to cover the
investment needed to improve distribution services. In addition, the revenues for sanitation
services are low and scheduled reviews have not been made to date. Another important
problem is that tariff increases requested by Boards of Directors of Régies have not been
applied, while investments have nonetheless continued.
  Examples of Tariffs in Major Cities. Cross-subsidization from the electricity sector to the
water and sanitation services is an ongoing feature of tariffs in Morocco.13 In most major cit-
ies, there are five tariff blocks for domestic consumers, based on monthly m3 consumption14
T1=0–6 m3; T2=6–12 m3; T3=12–20 m3; T4=20–35 m3; T5=more than 35 m3. Figure 5.2 depicts
the tariff structure for Casablanca, a system that is currently being managed by a private
company, Lydec,15 while figure 5.3 presents the tariff structure for Rabat, whose system is
currently delegated to another private company, Redal.16

Licensing
Article 39 of Law 78-00 gives municipal councils the responsibility to manage water and
sanitation. Municipalities may provide services themselves, may delegate, or form Régies.

                                             Rural Water Supply
                                             Increasing rural water availability is an important objective for the Moroccan government.
                                             This is especially significant considering that 40.3 percent or the population (around 13.65
                                             million people)20 live in rural areas. In 2015, only 65 percent21 of rural population had

access  to  improved water supply, and only 66 percent22 of the rural population had
improved sanitation in 2011.
  ONEE manages water supply and waste water in rural areas, and has the strategic objective
of increasing general access to water in rural areas from the levels of 94 percent in 2013 to
96.5 percent in 2017.23 CIP and the Ministry of Interior each play a role with regard to water
supply in rural areas: CIP by virtue of its role setting tariffs, and the MOI in terms of the over-
sight and the power to enforce technical standards for Regies and rural areas. The Ministry
of Agriculture also has a large stake in the availability of water in rural areas.

Consumer Protection and Citizen Engagement
ONEE plans to improve customer service by extending the mandate of its electricity
Customer Relation Center to also accommodate water services customers.24 One of the
motiviating factors for unifying ONE and ONEP was the introduction of synergies through
consolidation of call-centers, telecommunication services, and information technology (IT)
systems, which are expected to provide customers with improved services.25


Next Steps
Morocco is at an important juncture, attempting to reconcile the dilemma of increasingly
scarce water resources in several parts of the country with increasing demands. The govern-
ment is exploring many options for how to best meet these challenges, such as desalination
schemes. Integrated urban water management (IUWM) is being considered to help bring the
many disparate stakeholders together to explore options that are most efficient, holistic, and
sustainable. Since the passage of the new constitution in 2011, the government has been
devolving more autonomy to the regions. There has been some discussion of regional mul-
tisector utilities.
  In terms of other sector priorities, the government is focused on the need to significantly
improve access to sanitation services and wastewater management, especially in rural areas.26
  Contract-Program 2014–77 and the Court of Accounts report discuss the possibility of a
regulatory body or bodies, but it is unclear whether such a regulator or regulators will be
created, how its or their role would be defined, and if created whether a multiservice model
or single sector model would be chosen. The decision to create some sort of regulatory
agency would be a political one that would be taken by the government and approved by the
high councils. A new law for the water sector has recently passed in Parliament, and a pub-
lic-private participation law passed in 2014. The next steps involve the publication and
application of the new water sector law.

            Iraq faces significant challenges in water and sanitation services delivery, and gains have not
            necessarily been commensurate with the substantial spending in the sector. This may be under-
            standable given the violent conflict and regime-change experienced over the past decades. More
            recently, various institutional reforms have been attempted: for example, with regard to decen-
            tralizing service delivery. However, reforms have been slow to take hold. Economic regulation
            per se is scarce and institutions are fledgling. The preparation of this report revealed the dearth
            of data, information, and analysis. The World Bank’s recent Public Expenditure Review has
            contributed to the knowledge base, as has a recent study by the Japan International Cooperation
            Agency (JICA 2015), but more needs to be done to gain a better understanding of how the sector
            functions institutionally and what can be improved.


            Introduction to the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector and
            the Country Context
            Despite rapid increases in spending in the sector between 2007 and 2012 (an increase of
                percent) (World Bank 2015), Iraq’s water supply and sanitation (WSS) sector suffers from a
            356 ­
            number of challenges that have hampered sector performance. Managerial challenges relate to
            the lack of performance standards and management autonomy, civil service laws that protect
            poor staff performance, low administrative skills, and weak accountability mechanisms.
            Technical and financial challenges include a low-skilled labor force and weak enforcement of
            tariff and connection policies. Institutional and policy challenges include inconsistencies in
            institutional roles and responsibilities, lack of strategic direction, and lack of formal coordination
            mechanisms, which may in part be attributable to the absence of a comprehensive Water Law.
              It is important to analyze these realities within the current context. Iraq’s WSS sector has
            suffered serious setbacks due to a series of political events that have taken place since the
            1991 Gulf War, which have inevitably had a widespread impact on the country. Despite the
            political challenges the Iraqi government faces, progress has been made during the past
            10 years, leading to improvements in access to WSS services. Table 6.1 provides some data
            on the general country/sector context.
              Yet the sector continues to face second-generation challenges in terms of quality of service
            delivery, including intermittent water supply services, low water pressure, and significant net-
            work losses due to aged infrastructure. The public water network provides less than two hours
            a day of access to about 25 percent of the customers connected. The  Knowledge Network
            Survey of 2011 has demonstrated the general dissatisfaction of Iraqi citizens, with 59 percent of
            households describing the sanitation services on offer as bad or very bad. This percentage
            increases in rural areas and reaches 85 percent dissatisfaction, particularly in central and

     a. Some disparities in available data sets may exist. Although the percentage of population with access to improved water
     supply is 78.7 percent, the Iraq Public Expenditure Review of the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector cites access to piped
     water services at 87 percent of the total Iraqi population in 2012.
     b. Although the percentage of total population with access to improved services is 64 percent, according to the Iraq Public
     Expenditure Review of the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector, only 28 percent of the total Iraqi population had access to
     sewerage networks in 2012.




     southern regions of Iraq. In addition, 83 percent of wastewater is not subject to sufficient treat-
     ment (JICA 2015). WSS operations are constrained by energy shortages, including intermittent
     power and fuel supplies, as well as shortages of chemical supplies. The sector is marked by
     weak bill collection rates, low tariffs, and a significant number of illegal connections, which
     jeopardize financial sustainability. For example, water sales in the Mayoralty of Baghdad (MOB)
     in 2010 stood at around 195.7 million cubic meters, at a value of ID47.9 billion (US$0.04 billion).
     Only 13 percent of that total value was actually collected; the remaining 87 percent was left in
     arrears. These challenges are common across all WSS service providers in the sector.
       In addition to the managerial, technical, financial, and institutional challenges, the sector ­suffers
     from other external factors as a consequence of the political turmoil in the region. This includes

                                        extensive damage to infrastructure, as well as population displacement at a large scale.
                                        Furthermore, violations of housing planning zoning laws, such as the illegal splitting of houses
                                        and illegal construction, place additional pressures on services and increase challenges to achiev-
                                        ing financial sustainability. A review of the sector’s legal and policy frameworks highlighted that
                                        overall sector performance has been suboptimal because of inconsistencies in the institutional
                                        and policy framework, including the lack of clear mandates and strategic direction. The absence of
                                        a comprehensive water law further inhibits implementation of formal coordination mechanisms
                                        among relevant stakeholders in a manner that can ensure delivery of sustainable WSS services.

                                        Structure and Organization of the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector
                                        WSS service delivery is heavily centralized across 11 ministries and governmental organi-
                                        zations. However, coordination mechanisms are not well developed within this central-
                                        ized system. Figure 6.1 depicts the different ministries involved in the sector (UNICEF and

       The ministries responsible for WSS service delivery operate and interact in an adhoc and
     informal manner in the absence of an official water law that allows for the establishment
     for  formal coordination mechanisms. The roles and responsibilities of select key institu-
     tions that play a significant role in WSS service delivery are outlined next.
       Council of Ministers. The Iraqi Constitution empowers the Council of Ministers to propose
     and oversee implementation of plans and policies within the public sector. However, these
     authorities are also mandated to the municipality councils and the governorate councils,
     which have the right to establish, manage, and develop water projects (World Bank 2015).
       The Ministry of Construction, Housing, Municipalities and Public Works (MMPW prior to
     merger, MCHMPW post merger). The MCHMPW is the lead ministry responsible for overall
     monitoring and oversight of the sector. Law No. 27 of 1999 established the General Commission
     of Water and Sewerage, which consists of two authorities for water and sewerage within the
     Ministry of Municipalities and Public Works. This Commission is responsible for support-
     ing the MCHMPW in planning investments, conducting the relevant studies including feasi-
     bility  studies, preparing annual long-term and short-term plans, and overseeing their
     ­
     implementation. The Ministry was also mandated to carry out monitoring of water quality
     and treated wastewater, set and enforce technical standards, and set tariffs. The MCHMPW is
     responsible for ensuring that WSS services are provided across 15 provinces throughout Iraq,
     in addition to other municipal services, including solid waste management, urban develop-
     ment, municipal road works, and public land management services.
       It is important to note, however, that the service area of the current MCHMPW excludes
     the Mayoralty of Baghdad and the Kurdistan Regional Governorate. Further, with the pass-
     ing of Governorate Law 21 in 2008, which essentially decentralizes responsibilities for WSS
     service delivery to the local authorities, it is not entirely clear how much supervision of local
     governorates the Ministry will undertake.
       The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Planning. Responsibilities for policymaking and
     investment planning lie with the central government through the Ministry of Finance and the
     Ministry of Planning. Local authorities submit requests for new investments to the MCHMPW
     based on feasibility studies that have been conducted. The MCHMPW is then responsible for
     prioritizing the need for investments, which is based on deprivation levels. These levels are
     determined based on a ratio of actual supply to an assumed 380 lpc/d demand. The proposal for
     investments is then submitted to the Ministries of Finance and Planning for review and approval.
     The final investment plan is determined by the Ministries of Finance and Planning based on their
     own set of selection criteria. Decisions on spending and investments in the sector are undertaken
     jointly between the Ministries of Finance and Planning.
       Following the passing of Governorate Law 21, both ministries now undertake and manage
     fiscal transfers from the central government to the local authorities. Article 102 of the Iraqi
     Constitution calls for the establishment of an independent authority mandated to monitor
     the distribution of federal and foreign aid funds between the different governorates, in order
     to ensure that funds are distributed in a transparent, efficient, and equitable manner.

                                             However, at the time of writing this report, the Ministry of Planning has indicated that this
                                             authority is yet to be established.
                                                  The Ministry of Planning (MoP). In addition to the roles and responsibilities described, the
                                             MoP is also responsible for developing research, studies, and plans that achieve the goals of
                                             the WSS sector. In addition, the MoP contributes statistical data and information necessary to
                                             establish a national sector database. These responsibilities are undertaken by the Ministry’s
                                             statistical body, the Central Organization for Statistics and Information Technology (COSIT),
                                             which in turn supports the MCHMPW in making its decisions regarding investment planning.
                                                  The Ministry of Water Resources. The Ministry of Water Resources is the sole entity respon-
                                             sible for water resource management in Iraq, as mandated by the Ministry of Water Resources
                                             Law of 2008. Its responsibilities include the efficient allocation management, and develop-
                                             ment of additional water resources as well as safeguarding water quality. The Ministry is also
                                             responsible for protection of Iraq’s best interests in shared water resources with neighboring
                                             countries. The Ministry carries out many of its functions through the National Center for
                                             Water Resources Management, which exercises control through the operation of a compli-

                                                  The Ministry of Environment and Health. The Ministry of Environment and Health (MoEH)
                                             is responsible for the oversight of policy, planning, regulation, and enforcement of every-

                                             heritage. The MoEH formulates national strategies for environmental protection, as well as

                                           charge of the protection of the environment. Of special concern to WSS is that the law also
                                           prohibits the discharge of any industrial, agricultural, domestic, or any polluting materials,
                                           such as oil, animal waste, or pollutants into rivers, ground, and underground water resources.
                                             The General Directorates of Water and Sewerage. The Governorate Law 21 of 2008 essentially
                                           decentralizes responsibility for service delivery and day-to-day operations across the 15 gover-
                                           norates in Iraq through the General Directorates. The General Directorates are public entities
                                           owned by the central government. The Governorates’ law allows the local authorities to col-
                                           lects revenues. The General Directorates of Water and Sewerage combined are comprised of
                                           152 departments. Each department reports directly to a General Director who reports directly
                                           to the MCHMPW, demonstrating the centralized nature of the system. Managers run day-to-
                                           day operations at the local level with directions from the Director General at the Governorate
                                           level. Figure 6.3 illustrates the typical organizational structure of the general directorates.

                                           their geographic areas. However, actual control of service delivery is limited (World Bank
                                           2015). The Mayoralty of Baghdad is established by Law 16 of 1995 and is mandated to carry
                                           out the investment planning responsibilities for water and wastewater projects in Baghdad.
                                           The law calls for a new organizational municipality, which includes dedicated departments
                                           for water, wastewater, quality monitoring, and capacity building.

legislations as authorized by the decentralization law. The Provincial Council provides sup-
port to the governor on awarding tenders and also plays an oversight and supervisory role in
ensuring that projects are completed on time and in line with the budget. The provincial
government controls a budgetary stream separate from that of the MCHMPW (JICA 2015).
  Table 6.2 provides a summary of the roles and responsibilities of the different ministries
that play a role in the WSS sector.

Legal, Policy, and Regulatory Framework
Iraq’s legal and policy framework is comprised of many different laws and decrees that are
not always consistent with one another. Although the Iraqi Constitution includes laws that
govern the establishment of water sector institutions, it does not include a more compre-
hensive Water Law that clearly indicates the objectives and responsibilities of the water
sector (World Bank 2015). Despite the absence of a water law, other legal instruments are
established to govern the sector.
  Increased access to WSS service delivery is endorsed by the Strategy for Water and Land
Resources in Iraq (SWLRI) and the National Development Plan of 2010–44. Prepared by the
Ministry of Water Resources, the SWLRI outlines the objectives of the WSS sector and covers
the period up until 2035. Main objectives include improving the access and quality of water
supply services. In terms of allocation of water resources, municipal water supply is given
highest priority. Previous and current government plans aim to achieve 100 percent access to
improved water supply in urban areas by the end of 2018, but progress toward this target has
been hindered by significant budget constraints, with many projects either on hold or suffering
delays. The strategy (SWLRI) also establishes Strategic Evaluation Criteria to screen and priori-
tize investment projects. Projects that address the challenges of water security and improve-
ment of land productivity receive priority for investment, thus demonstrating the adoption of
an integrated approach to water resources management. The National Development Plan


Status of Water Sector Regulation in the Middle East and North Africa                                           85
                                    includes a recommendation to establish a National Water Council that would assume responsi-
                                    bilities for management of water resources at national and transboundary levels, thus formal-
                                    izing coordination mechanisms between relevant stakeholders in the WSS sector.
                                       In addition to placing a priority on improved access and quality of WSS services, the Iraqi
                                    government endorses pro-poor pricing policies by subsidizing costs in order to ensure that
                                    WSS services are available and affordable to all. The National Development Plan emphasizes
                                    that the state policy in providing potable water service is concerned not only with quality
                                    and quantity, but also with affordability for all—even if requiring subsidies and low tariffs.
                                       The government is moving toward decentralizing WSS service delivery through the
                                    enactment of Governorate Law No. 21 of 2008, which establishes the legal framework to pro-
                                    mote the transfer of WSS service delivery from the central government to local authorities.
                                    Despite establishment of a legal framework that promotes decentralization of public service
                                    delivery, the central government continues to undertake much of the management respon-
                                    sibilities of the sector because of the lack of clarity of the relationship between the national
                                    and subnational levels of government.
                                       Some of the key laws that govern the sector are described in table 6.3.

 Title of strategy/policy   Summary
General

Iraqi Constitution          Iraq’s Constitution contains several articles relevant to the WSS sector:

                            •	 Article 30 states that “the state guarantees social and health security.”

                            •	 Article 33 guarantees citizens the right to live in a safe and protected environment.

                            •	 Article 110 empowers the federal and regional governments to draw laws to protect the environment and to formulate
                              strategies and regulations for the equitable distribution of internal water resources.

National Development Plan   The main mission of the National Development Plan of 2013–77 is to guarantee access to potable water for all. The Plan sets
of 2013–77a                 five goals for nationwide development of Iraq’s water sector:

                            1.	 Goal 1: Increase Water Coverage and Reduction of Waste. Increase access to piped water supply from 82 percent in 2011 to
                              98 percent in 2017.

                            2.	Goal 2: Reduce Disparities between Urban and Rural Areas. Reduce the number of residents without access to safe
                              drinking water to 2 percent in urban areas and 15 percent in rural areas.

                            3.	Goal 3: Provide High-Quality Water at a rate of 350 liters per capita per day.

                            4.	Goal 4: Promote PSP [private sector participation] in the Water Sector through BOTs [build-operate-transfer projects],
                              Technical Assistance and Operations

                            5.	Goal 5: Rationalization of Water Use. The goals for the sanitation sector are to improve access to sewerage networks to 95
                              percent for Baghdad and 53percent for other governorates for 2017; and to improve the waste disposal situation of rivers.

Environmental protection

Water Protection Bylaw of   The bylaw defines water as a public resource, which includes all rivers, springs, lakes, and surface and ground water. The law
2001                        prohibits the discharge of any industrial, agricultural, or domestic waste into any water resources. In addition, the law obligates
                            all public or private entities to treat their wastewater, conforming to the set standards in line with World Health Organization
                            (WHO) guidelines. Permission should be obtained from the Environment Department for discharging into a water resource.
                            Regarding enforcement, the law does not clarify if the Environment Department itself will carry out enforcement powers.

 Title of strategy/policy          Summary
Law No. 27 of 2009                 This law prescribes the following provisions:

                                   •	 Establishment of an environmental protection council/office to enforce environmental conservation at the national level;

                                   •	 The law regulates the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) system for projects. The EIA report should include
                                     the following:

                                     •	    Predictions of negative/positive environmental and social impacts

                                     •	    Mitigation methods to reduce negative impacts in order to meet the laws and regulations of the national and local
                                           government

                                     •	    Possibility of adopting alternative technologies to reduce negative environmental impacts and improve energy
                                           efficiency

                                     •	    Consideration of adopting a circular economy approach to water use adopting the 3R’s: reduce, re-use, and recycle.

                                   •	 Preparation of environmental conservation management plan for air quality, soil biodiversity, and hazardous
                                     waste reatment.

Water quality

Water Quality Conservation         This law prescribes regulations regarding water discharge to public waters. Article 7 prohibits the discharge of untreated
Law of Rivers and Public           wastewater to public water sources. Articles 8 and 9 prescribe the conservation mechanisms of pollution of public waters
Waters Law No. 25/1967a            by discharge of wastewater. Article 10 prohibits the illegal dumping of solid and liquid waste in public waters. The law also
                                   prescribes the national water quality standards, as well as effluent quality standards.

Law of Water Conservation          This federal law prescribes the regulations for general water utilization, including environmental water resource
Practices No. 2 of 2001a           conservation. The law also provides regulations for water resource development. The central government recognizes water
                                   as a fundamental resource for social and economic development. The law prohibits the discharge of wastewater in to public
                                   waters and also encourages the recycling of wastewater for reuse. Article 5 prescribes that (NPEC) has authority to regulate
                                   effluent water quality of public waters, sewerage systems, and rainfall.

Drinking Water Quality             This law proscribes drinking water quality standards.
Standards Law No. 417 of
1974a

Decentralization of service delivery

Law No. 165 for                    Article 50 of this law authorizes the Municipality Council to establish, develop, and manage water projects, whether on its
Administration of                  own or jointly with other municipalities. Furthermore, the law gives municipalities the exclusive right to sell fresh and raw
Municipalities                     water within their geographic areas. No other entity is authorized to implement projects with the objective of selling water,
                                   unless by virtue of a special law.

Governorate Law 21 of 2008         This law essentially places responsibilities for WSS service delivery at the governorate level and holds the general
                                   directorates responsible for the day to day operations of WSS services. The law also recognizes the Governorate Council
                                   as the highest legislative body within the governorate and empowers the council to issue local laws in line with the
                                   constitution and federal laws.

                                              Regulation of Water Supply and Sanitation Services
                                              The Iraqi WSS sector is self-regulated; the ministries responsible for service delivery regu-
                                              late themselves. Regulatory responsibilities lie with civil servants within the respective
                                              ministries and are not undertaken independently from their executive and operational
                                              responsibilities – therefore there is no form of independent, or arm’s-length, regulation.

       Key regulatory responsibilities, including performance monitoring, enhancement of com-
     petition among service providers, and demand management, are hindered by the absence of
     authorization for implementation of these responsibilities.


     Tariff Setting
     Tariff-setting responsibilities are mandated to the MCHMPW. In practice, tariffs are set in
     cooperation with the directors of the water and sewerage departments in each governorate,
     which are submitted for approval by the Minister. In the absence of willingness and
     ability-to-pay surveys, the ability to pay is generally gauged indirectly from the employment
     conditions (or unemployment) and other indicators of the living standards, which vary con-
     siderably between the different governorates.
       Currently, the MCHMPW does not have a cost-recovery policy in place for tariff setting,
     and consumption per capita is extremely high—well beyond levels seen elsewhere in the
     region. Thus water tariffs are very low and a major part of total water revenues remains
     uncollected. The Leadership for Results pilot undertaken by the World Bank reports that the
     cost of water production in Baghdad is estimated at 155 Iraqi Dinars (ID) (US$ 0.13) per cubic
     meter however, water users pay merely a fraction of these costs. More than half of house-
     holds do not pay for their water and wastewater services (56 percent in 2012, according to the
     IHSES). As a consequence, water sector institutions depend heavily on government funding
     through subsidies, although fees charged by the water and sewerage directorates are low.
     This level of subsidization has significantly hindered sector performance; utilities are char-
     acterized by infrequent or limited billing and collection efficiencies (World Bank 2015).
       The water tariffs are adopted nationwide, including in the Mayorality of Baghdad. The rates
     are set by the minister upon a recommendation of a joint committee representing the gover-
     norates and the ministry. For industrial use, the charge is 90 Iraqi dinars per cubic meter, in
     addition to a flat rate charge and the nominal consumption volume, depending on the area of
     the building and category of business. Governments and institutional users are charged
     60 Iraqi dinars per cubic meter. The wastewater tariff is double the water tariff. Both tariff
     charges are combined, although most consumers do not pay because they complain about
     poor service delivery. Although this situation significantly impairs the financial sustainability
     of the sector, the Water Directorate does not enforce strict penalties on consumers.
       Tariff revenues are collected and calculated by the Water and Sewerage Directorates.
     The calculated billing information is sent to the branch office of the Ministry of Finance.

     There is a lack of official grievance redress mechanisms. Conflicts between ministries are
     generally resolved in an amicable manner between the ministries concerned. The ability of
     the relevant ministries to cooperate in a concerted manner to resolve grievances has been
     demonstrated in a number of cases, including when river salinity levels were elevated due to

Next Steps
As outlined in the National Development Plan of 2013–77, the Government of Iraq will
endeavor to achieve improved access and sustainability of WSS services by encouraging pri-
vate sector participation, promoting wastewater reuse, and implementing strategies to
address water security challenges. To boost the chances of success of these planned inter-
ventions, it is imperative to address key elements of WSS regulation, including mechanisms
to foster competition and monitor sector performance. The Iraqi government will also need
to address the issue of financial sustainability by improving tariff-setting and revenue collec-
tion mechanisms. Otherwise, the government’s strategies and investment plans run the risk
of remaining unimplemented because of the lack of financing. Due to the overlapping nature
of institutions, policies, and regulation, all would have to be addressed in an integrated man-
ner to achieve sustainable outcomes.
  In addition—the Iraqi government will also need to develop and implement plans to mod-
ernize governance of the sector in order to improve efficiencies. This need was identified in
the Public Expenditure Review (PER) of the Water Sector of the Republic of Iraq conducted
by the World Bank in consultation with the government in 2015. The recommended modern-
ization process focuses on decentralization, autonomy, and accountability of service providers.
In addition, the PER states that institutional changes are necessary in order to ensure the
roles and responsibilities of sector institutions are well defined. Institutionalizing official
sector coordination mechanisms between different agencies at different levels of govern-
ment is recommended (World Bank 2015).

       The Public Expenditure Review proposes several interventions to improve overall sector
     efficiency:

     •	 Improve government capacity by enhancing sector planning and streamlining procure-
        ment and disbursement procedures

     •	 Establish reporting mechanisms to facilitate improvements in performance monitoring in
        order to achieve sector outcomes, including access, quality, and sustainability of service
        delivery

     •	 Gradually move toward decentralizing service delivery in order to give service providers
        more autonomy in their operations, ensure that service providers are fully involved in
        investment and O&M decisions, and provide incentives to service providers to generate
        more of their basic O&M budget independent of the central government

     •	 Clarify institutional roles and responsibilities—particularly more effective and transparent
        regulation of tariffs, including empowerment to collect tariff revenues, while ensuring
        that services remain affordable (World Bank 2015).

                                                          Abstract
            This chapter outlines some potential topics for further study that have been identified in the
            course of preparing this report. These range from sector-specific issues such as tariff modelling
            to issues more specific to particular country contexts, including policy-making processes and
            data validity. In light of the diverse contexts within which water supply and sanitation (WSS)
            services are regulated across the Middle East and North Africa, the topics outlined in this
            chapter may be relevant to some of the countries, but not necessarily to all of them.
            ­


            Availability and Accuracy of Data and Information
            This study was based primarily on desk research of publicly available information. Sources
            included government websites, service provider websites, reports from international orga-
            nizations, project documents, and other secondary sources. Challenges related to the avail-
            ability, reliability, and consistency of information and definitional issues were common
            across all the countries studied, although to varying extents. For some countries, little if any
            primary data were available. For example, water and wastewater tariff schedules were avail-
            able on service provider websites for two countries, but had to be sought in secondary
            sources for others. Sector and utility performance indicators were difficult to obtain.
            Although, in some cases the national government appears to have a relatively robust moni-
            toring and evaluation (M&E) mechanism in place to monitor WSS sector performance and
            progress, it is not common for this information to be publicly available. Moreover, for under-
            standable reasons, the lack or unreliability of data is related to the difficult circumstances
            and refugee crisis affecting some of the cases analyzed: they may report very high rates of
            access to improved water supply and sanitation, but these data may not include informal
            settlements or refugees, and circumstances are constantly evolving.
              Summary performance indicators may be meaningless without more in-depth study of
            conditions on the ground through field surveys of, for example, the number of hours/days
            water is available, household storage facilities, the environmental impact of on-site and
            informal sanitation systems, the condition of assets, and the volume of water being extracted
            by private boreholes.
              One of the most immediate needs is thus to identify specific gaps and verify existing infor-
            mation on access and other performance indicators, tariffs, sources of revenue, subsidies
            (whether hidden or explicit), and the condition of assets. In addition, the mechanisms for
            collecting, reporting, verifying, and processing information may need to be evaluated and
            refined and consistent definitions may need to be applied.

     Evaluation of Process of Reform and the Applicability of
     Regulatory Approaches
     Several countries have developed strategies for improving sector performance with regard
     to water availability, access to service, the quality and financial viability of services, water
     resources management, and environmental protection. It would be useful to assess progress
     toward the achievement of sector objectives and to analyze how well these plans are
     being  implemented, as well as the challenges encountered and how they have been, or
     might be, overcome.
       It is worth exploring the constraints governments in the region have encountered in trying
     to introduce effective regulatory frameworks. In some cases, this study found ambiguity or
     vagueness in regulatory rules and processes and/or significant gaps between de jure regula-
     tory frameworks and de facto implementation. An analysis of the constraints or weaknesses
     in the enabling environment that impede clarity and successful implementation could be
     useful. It may be necessary to address constraints in the enabling environment before design-
     ing regulatory frameworks. However, given the difficult conditions that exist in several coun-
     tries in the region, it may not be feasible to eliminate some constraints. Rather, strategies for
     accommodating them in a transparent manner may be the most practical solution.
       Finally, the regulatory fit or appropriateness of alternative regulatory approaches (for
     example, regulation by contract versus regulation by regulatory agency) to the context needs
     to be examined, so that frameworks can be designed or refined to provide optimal results
     within the legal, physical, and cultural environment and the reality on the ground.



     Tariff and Efficiency Studies and Financial Projections
     More detailed information on how water supply and sanitation (WSS) services are funded—
     whether through tariffs, taxes, fiscal transfers, or hidden subsidies—is needed before strategies
     for improving financial sustainability of the services can be formulated. More specifically, tariff
     levels and tariff structures contribute to poor cost recovery in several (if not all) the cases
     studied. Tariff studies and studies to identify opportunities for reducing costs through effi-
     ciency improvements should be undertaken. Such studies could:

     •	 Develop realistic expectations for cost savings from operational and commercial
       improvements

     •	 Determine the revenue required to cover operations and maintenance (O&M) costs as well as
       capital expenditures, taking into account gradual introduction of efficiency improvements

     •	 Determine the need for budgetary transfers (the difference between the revenue require-
       ment and expected tariff revenues), taking into account projected improvements in com-
       mercial performance

     •	 Propose options for gradually revising tariffs and tariff structure to reduce budgetary
       transfers and eliminate subsidies for those who do not need them.


92   Status of Water Sector Regulation in the Middle East and North Africa
  If carried out in a collaborative manner, these studies will enable service providers and
governments alike to gain a deeper understanding of the beneficial role of regulation in pro-
moting sector financial sustainability and service improvements.


Surveys of Willingness to Pay, Service Needs, and Customer Satisfaction
On the demand side, there does not seem to be much information on customer satisfaction,
percent of income spent on WSS, and willingness to pay, especially by income quintiles and
geographic location. Such information would serve as a basis for planning service improve-
ments, improving cost recovery, and designing more targeted subsidies.


Stakeholder Consultation
The authors found little information on stakeholder consultation, particularly at the decen-
tralized level, during the preparation of sector strategies and investment plans. It is not
known whether local authorities and existing and potential customers have been brought
into the process. In this regard, it is worth further investigating whether all stakeholders
have taken ownership of sector strategies and reforms—and, if not, explore how the process
could be more inclusive.


Private Sector Participation
Several of the cases analyzed have engaged the formal private sector (national, interna-
tional, or both) to invest in and operate large-scale projects. Some of these arrangements
are quite innovative. Independent evaluations could be undertaken of progress and
results, how well contracts are monitored, and whether they are cost-effective, sustain-
able, and replicable. Strategies may be needed for considering such contracts in design-
ing broader regulatory frameworks for all service providers to ensure complementarity
and consistency.
  Very little information was reported on informal private sector or community-based ser-
vice provision and the extent to which these providers are making, or could make, a positive
contribution to services. It would be useful to investigate their contributions and the chal-
lenges they face, as well as any problems their activities create, and identify ways to
strengthen, formalize, and regulate them—or integrate them into formal service providers
(for example, through buy-outs or contracts).


The Role and Effectiveness of Integrated Water Resources
Management Approaches
It would be interesting to carry out a comparative study of integrated water resources
management (IWRM) within the Middle East and North Africa region to identify the com-
­
mon features and differences. This would entail further exploration of issues such as multi-
purpose hydropower in water-stressed areas, the water, energy-food nexus, and the adoption


Status of Water Sector Regulation in the Middle East and North Africa                     93
     of cross-sectoral approaches to achieve sector policies and strategies. Moreover, the comple-
     mentarity between IWRM and economic regulation of WSS services needs to be distin-
     guished and clarified.
       Inadequate emphasis is often placed on the role of IWRM in the management of disasters
     such as extreme weather, floods, earthquakes, and droughts. This issue is particularly perti-
     nent to the Middle East and North Africa region, where the risk of extreme weather events is
     relatively high. Further investigations of the existence of national plans (or lack thereof) to
     mitigate the risks of natural disasters, such as extreme water scarcity, and the development
     or refining of such plans would be useful.
