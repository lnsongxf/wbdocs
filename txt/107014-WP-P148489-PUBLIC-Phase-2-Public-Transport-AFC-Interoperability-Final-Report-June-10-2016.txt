Introduction
Background

1.       In the second half of 2013, the World Bank secured grant funding from the Korea Green Growth
Partnership for analytical support and technical assistance related to sustainable urban transport systems in
select cities in Eastern Poland. Established in 2011, the Korea Green Growth Partnership strengthens
cooperation between the Government of Korea and the World Bank Group to help countries achieve sustainable
and inclusive development by developing and sharing practical knowledge around innovative green growth
solutions. The objective of the first phase of this technical assistance involved assessing the urban transport
sector in the selected cities—Białystok, Lublin, Olsztyn, and Rzeszów—with a primary focus on public
transportation and the aim of identifying areas for improvement. One of the outputs of the first phase of work,
the report, Urban Mobility in Eastern Poland, The Way Forward, provided a set of recommendations related to
the legal and institutional framework for urban transport in Poland; summarizes the assessment of urban
mobility for Białystok, Lublin, Olsztyn, and Rzeszów; and assesses the framework for inter-municipal
coordination in Poland.

2.       Polish cities have followed international practice in introducing smartcard ticketing that offers
convenience to the passenger and savings to the operator through reduced fraud, shorter dwell times at stops,
and less cash handling. Smartcards also offer more flexibility in setting and varying fares. However, one of the
main benefits of smartcard ticketing internationally is in relation to integrating fares and ticketing across
operators and modes. This potential benefit has not been realized in Poland and little effort has been made to
establish a common platform for ticketing, even within metropolitan areas. Integrated ticketing would
encourage more multi-modal trips through integration of fares and greater convenience to passengers. In many
countries it has been an important step in facilitating better integration of information provision and
scheduling.

3.       For a cross-network or multi-modal journey or one crossing multiple scheme borders, there are
options open to transport operators— to offer the customer the simplicity of holding just one single ticket for
the entire journey or to offer separate tickets within a single secure Smart Ticketing Wallet. A Single Through
Ticket offer obliges transport operators to develop a common ticketing scheme or interface between different
ticketing schemes enabling both to work interchangeably. Issuing multiple tickets avoids much of the
complexity, data handling, settlement, and clearing for the transport operator but brings inconveniences for
the customer. Smartcard ticketing allows the inconvenience of this issue of multiple tickets to be mitigated by
loading them all into a single smartcard or smart ticketing wallet.

4.       Interoperability of tickets needed for cross-scheme journeys can either be a single shared ticket where
the data elements, ticket specifications and smartcard keys are shared between all parties and settlement is
made through a common third party, or a Smart Ticketing Waller is used to hold all the individual tickets
needed for the journey in a manner that appears seamless to the end user. Each of these approaches requires
the definition of specifications. A key issue in all of this is that urban and national transport decision makers
support the development of specifications to ensure mutual compatibility of all schemes. The use of
international and open standards can facilitate interoperability and compatibility between devices produced
by different ticketing suppliers.

5.     Introducing integrated public transport ticketing can have both demand and revenue implications. An
important concern regarding the introduction of integrated ticketing is the potentially negative impact on

                                                                                                               1
revenue. The literature suggests that the final impact depends on the combination of fare levels for different
ticket types and on user distribution according to rates of use. For example, in a study reviewing the
introduction of an integrated ticket offer in the Madrid metropolitan region, the analysis suggested that the
new ticketing succeeded in reversing the declining patronage trend, in line with similar results in German and
Swiss cities and in London.1 However, in the case of Madrid the high market penetration rate of low-cost travel
cards had a negative effect on company revenues. This Report focuses on the alternative AFC options for
introducing an integrating public transport offer in Poland, but does not delve into issues concerning revenue,
whilst recognizing that there could be trade-offs between increased public transport patronage and revenues
arising from low cost integrating ticketing.


Common Technical Platform for Tickets

6.       A commitment to integrated ticketing in Poland would require the Government of Poland to set a
common technical platform that transport providers would be obliged to subscribe to for all new ticketing
schemes. Such a national standard would not restrict transport providers to purchase from a single supplier,
but would require all suppliers to the Polish market to meet the same standard. International suppliers of
ticketing equipment and systems might oppose such restrictions and would argue that modifications to their
proprietary technology would increase the cost to the operators, but they have accepted such policies in other
countries and the net cost to transport in these countries has not increased as a result of common standards.

7.       Integration of new ticketing systems with legacy schemes adds complexity to integrated ticketing and
it may be argued that such integration in Poland may not be practical considering that ticketing schemes on
municipal transport in Polish cities were introduced only recently and in some cases are still under
implementation. It is true that the cost of integrating new schemes with the range of proprietary technologies
now in place could be very high, but this should not discourage the Government of Poland from implementing
a national standard. Rail services and most commuter and regional bus services in the four cities studied do
not have smartcard ticketing, but are likely to upgrade their ticketing systems at some point in the near future.
A national policy that would require all new PSO services for buses and any new rail-ticketing system to adopt
the national standard would give critical mass to such a standard. Moreover, the expected life of all ITS systems
is shortening as new systems offer better functionality at lower prices. Some European transport authorities
are adopting Account-Based Ticketing (ABT) in partnership with financial institutions and mobile phone
operators. ABT systems require less technical sophistication on readers and smartcards with fare processing
taking place remotely or cloud-based. It would be appropriate for the Government of Poland to adopt a common
ticketing standard now before cities embrace a next generation of technology in an uncoordinated way.

8.       In traditional smartcard-based fare payment systems, the transit value resides in a contactless chip
inside the transit card, and transactions are managed and tracked on the card. With account-based payment
or ticketing, the transit value resides in a transit account and is accessed via a digital signature read from a
transit card by the fare payment system. Adoption of an account-based system also enables open payment and
lets consumers directly use their bank-issued contactless cards to pay for trips. In this way consumers will pay
for transit services just like they pay for any other retail purchase, using their contactless credit or debit cards
as they board buses or pass through metro turnstiles, eliminating the extra step of buying a transit fare card or
token. For transit agencies who do not want to issue their own fare cards, moving to open payment reduces the
need to procure, encode, distribute, and support literally millions of magnetic tickets or contactless smartcards.

9.       One of the significant outcomes of implementing a smart ticketing system is that there are
opportunities to introduce new fare products that never previously were possible, for example Pay-As-You-Go
(PAYG), which is impossible with paper tickets, or fare capping which is impossible with magnetic strip tickets.
If an organization is just looking to transfer existing ticketing products to a new media it will be a very costly
exercise that will provide limited benefits. There are different types of solutions that best meet the
requirements of different types of journey, for example, smartcards in urban heavily used transport networks
where throughput and speed of transaction is important, bar codes on inter urban railways where ease in
purchasing a ticket is important. Any developed standard will need to incorporate all of these requirements
and be looking towards changes in technology, particularly in the field of mobile technologies and tokenization.

10.      There are two ways to approach the development of a standard: spend significant time any money
developing one from scratch, or as was the case in the Netherlands, and as is currently being done in Colombia,
take a working system specification and convert that into a national standard, with suitable accreditation and
certification processes in place. An alternative approach is to re-consider the need to sell tickets altogether and
look to develop an account based system that utilizes the payments technology that is currently being
developed by other parties and building a fare structure around those. One assumption with the development
of a standard is that the requirements for the system are fully understood—this would require looking at what
the requirements for an interoperable system should be, before attempting standardization.

11.      The Ministry of Infrastructure and Development has expressed interest in the World Bank support on
developing integrated ticketing schemes and developing standards that would facilitate fare integration, within
and across such schemes, including unification of technical standards. There are many ways to do this.
Countries in the EU have devised alternative approaches to avoid the uncoordinated and non-interoperable
ticket schemes to develop. In the case of the UK, the Integrated Transport Smartcard Organisation (ITSO) was
formed in 1999 to address integration and interoperability issues between operators, and at the EU level, the
Smart Ticketing Alliance is working with national transport smartcard organizations and standard making
bodies in order to develop specifications to support transport smartcard interoperability.

12.      These European Countries have realized that there is no one standard that will address all of the needs
of public transport operators everywhere due to the differing approaches to public transport, and the
expectations from any fare collection system. For this reason, there is a recognition that multiple standards will
exist, and each country is free to adapt or implement such a standard as it sees fit for its transport system.

13.      New technologies for public transport smart ticketing systems are gaining importance. When abroad
the user travel experience should be as easy as for local travelers. The vision is one of seamless travel and
seamless ticketing. Today ticketing applications can be routinely loaded on smartcards or mobile telephones.
Similar issues of technical and contractual interoperability arise. Current electronic ticketing schemes rely on
media and ticket contracts designed for geographically limited fare systems. Future developments will not
replace integrated ticketing systems, but will open up their boundaries and make them interoperable with each
other and with other customer applications.

14.     Across Europe there has been a significant amount of activity in the development of national standards,
and a focus on interoperability of ticketing systems. The developments in Europe (especially in Germany,
France, United Kingdom and the Netherlands) have pushed European standardization. Three standards have
been published so far: on data elements (EN 1545), on a framework for interoperable ticketing (EN 15320),
and on the fare management system architecture (ISO 24014-1)2.

Scope of this Report

15.      The need for more sustainable and integrative processes as a way of dealing with the complexity of
urban mobility has been widely recognized. Within the EU there has been an enhanced focus on urban mobility
solutions where local authorities move away from past ‘silo approaches’ and develop approaches that ca n
stimulate a shift towards cleaner and more sustainable transport modes, in line with the EU’s 2013 Urban
Mobility Package.3 As populations move to the periphery or to neighboring municipalities, it becomes critical
that the organization of urban transport services is coordinated within functional areas based on travel-to-
work patterns and not be limited to a city’s administrative area. 4 Interoperability of automated fare collection
systems becomes an important means to support efforts of integration of the public transport offer across local
administrations and public transport modes.

16.     This Report focuses on options for introducing public transport automatic fare collection
interoperability in Poland, building on the experience of other countries and taking into account recent changes
in technology. It presents an overview of the current situation in Poland, international approaches to AFC, AFC
standards development in Europe, interoperability across regions, before presenting examples of AFC
interoperability in the Netherlands, UK, and Korea, as well as an example of a smartphone integrated mobility
platform in Vienna, before presenting a roadmap of how to introduce public transport AFC standards. It
concludes with recommendations.

Current Situation in Poland

Background

17.     In the second half of 2015 the World Bank conducted a detailed survey of public transport authorities
in Poland in order to understand the existing ticketing off and usage of Automatic Fare Collection (AFC). 5 The
survey covered the 28 largest urban transport systems in Poland – all transport systems around core cities
with over 100,000 inhabitants. All authorities answered the survey, although not all questions to the survey
were answered in all cased. This chapter summarizes the key finds of the survey.


Types of Tickets

18.       The majority of ticket sales in Poland are 30-day and single tickets. Usually 30-day tickets cover the
entire city—rarely only selected lines—and are non-transferable; surcharges for suburban zones are typical.
Single tickets can allow transfer within a given period of time (20-, 30- or 60-minutes), or do not allow transfer
– although the latter situation becomes rarer. Long-term tickets (mostly 30- and 90-days) constitute usually
between 35 to 40 percent of sales, but are used by the majority of travelers. Their share of total sales depends
mostly on the city size – in bigger cities, the share is higher. Most cities care about attractive prices of long-term
tickets, in order to increase customer loyalty. Long-term tickets are mostly sold in a selected network of
newsagents, own customer care centers, and ticketing machines. Medium term tickets (mostly 24-hours)
constitute usually about 5 percent of sales, but the share varies strongly, depending on pricing and distributions
strategies. They are usually sold in a wide network of news agents, ticketing machines and in smaller cities,
also by bus drivers.

19.      Single tickets constitute over 50-60 percent of sales volume and are distributed in a wide network of
newsagents. Popularity of ticketing machines varies, between cities, although increasing number of cities aim
to introduce ticketing machines on board of every vehicle and on main stops. Most cities aim to reduce ticket
sales by drivers and use it as emergency-solution only, in order to speed-up boarding. In some cases, surcharges
apply or limited range is offered. Polish customers are used to re-purchasing long-term tickets every month;
long-term contracts with automatic charging are not used. Ticket validation at entry of a public transport
vehicle during each trip is generally not accepted by passengers, as evidenced by the fact that transport
authorities have usually tried to introduce it, unsuccessfully.

20.      In all cases ticket sales over internet and mobile apps is insignificant, below 1 percent. Internet sales
is rarely available and has poor user experience. For example, in Warsaw only long-term internet tickets are
available and they require having a smartcard and ‘activation’ in a narrow network of activation terminals after
every charging. Mobile apps are usually available, often more than one in a city, offered by partner companies,
but they also have not achieved popularity among customers, mostly because of high availability of other
distribution channels and no customer benefits—for example, no capping or best pricing.




5AFC in the public transport context includes tickets, but also the whole area of journey logging, revenue allocation and
subsidy claim, on the basis of accounting for every leg of a journey by making and storing transaction records
                                                                                                                            5
21.      A relatively high share of passengers—including elderly people, children under 4 years old, blood
donors, among others—are allowed to travel for free. Detailed regulation varies between cities, but usually
only a personal ID is required. All tickets, as well as eligibility to free travel, are checked in random by plain-
clothes inspectors, only in smaller cities ticket inspection during boarding may be used. Some cities with
unemployment problems tried to re-introduce conductors on major routes, but without success. Passengers
are allowed to board with every door, in order to speed-up buses.


Technology

22.     The survey confirmed the high popularity of smartcard ticketing in Poland. Out of 28 authorities
surveyed, at least 23 had smartcard solutions. Those authorities cover 94 percent of the population of
researched cities (Figure 1). Mifare standards are widespread in most of the cities—they cover over 70 percent
of population and a little below 70 percent of the total number of public transport authorities; Mifare classic
covers 41 percent of population and 36 percent of authorities (Box 1). In two authorities, covering 24 percent
of the surveyed inhabitants, Java Open is used. Those are Poznań and Silesia, the latter is an industrial
conurbation in Southern Poland, grouping a number of cities. Both systems were rolled-out in 2015 and had
poor publicity, because of delayed implementation and/or low reliability in the initial phase. In Poznań Java
Open system replaced and older Mifare system and in Silesia – is a first smartcard solution.

23.      Different parts of a smartcard system may be owned by different entities, often based on long-term
contracts with public transport authorities, which initially made the systems affordable, but now makes
upgrade and exchange difficult, especially when contracts expire at different moments. For example, in
Warsaw, Mifare Classic system (introduced in 2001) validators and on-board ticketing machines are owned or
leased by vehicle operators—three municipal companies and a number of private firms. Ticketing machines on
stops, as well as vendor terminals at newsagents’, and post offices are usually provided by external companies,
specialized in ticket distribution, based on long-term contracts and commission from sales. In newer system,
the share of publicly owned hardware is higher, through EU co-financed purchases. The hardware and services
may be provided by multinational firms, but also a strong domestic market of domestic providers has
developed.

 MIFARE® Initially a proprietary contactless card security protocol (Crypto-1) based on ISO14443 type
 A, developed by Mikron AG in Graz, Austria in the 1990’s. The brand and IP is now owned by NXP and is
 incorporated into various smartcard chips and reader ICs. Several card and chip suppliers have licenses
 from NXP to include Mifare® in other chips. The initial chip product line is now known as Mifare® Classic
 and is becoming obsolete because of the weakness of the security protocol. The current chip ranges offer
 a variety of chip capabilities and security protocols.

 Java is a programming language loosely based on C++ and designed primarily for dynamic and
 changeable hardware. In reduced form, applications written in Java may be run in smartcards. The
 specification is owned by Sun Microsystems, but others participate in its development.

 Java Card: A derivative of original Java, for use in the restricted environment of the smartcard

 2D Barcode: A digital data string represented as shown below:




 Otherwise known as a QR code.

 Contactless Card: A smartcard with no visible module contact area, but which transfers data using RF
 technology. Such cards are generally used for transport and ID applications. Data is transferred by
 modulation of the RF field. See Proximity card (ISO/IEC 14443) and Vicinity card (ISO/IEC 15693); there
 is also a Close-coupled card standard (ISO/IEC 10536), but no evidence of its use.

 Proximity card is a contactless smartcard that can be read without inserting it into a reader device.
 Proximity cards are part of the contactless card technologies. Held near an electronic reader for a
 moment they enable the identification of an encoded number. Proximity cards typically have a read range
 up to 50 cm, in comparison with contactless smartcard which have a range of 2 to 10 cm.

24.      Smartcards are mostly used for long-term tickets. Depending on the city, single and medium-term
tickets may be available on smartcards, but are mostly sold on paper, as casual users do not want to acquire a
smartcard. In Warsaw, they are sold on single-use magnetic cards and in Wrocław – 2D barcodes are used.
Nevertheless, in most cases public transport vehicles are equipped with a high number of smartcard validators;
often there is one validator for every door. In urban transport, single and medium term paper tickets are usually
printed by the authority and sold to the vendors (not produced by the vendor during purchase), which reduces
hardware costs and increases the distribution network.

25.     Railway operators mostly use on paper ticketing, with an increasing share of internet and smartphone
app sales (2D barcodes of different standards), especially in case of intercity services. Long-term tickets are
also usually paper ones—only in case of Koleje Mazowieckie, the rail company operating around Warsaw—they
may be coded on a smartcard. This system is interoperable with Warsaw Public Transport; Warsaw Public
Transport and Koleje Mazowieckie tickets may be coded on one card. Railway tickets are checked during the
                                                                                                               7
trip, and in some cases, train staff is equipped in smartcard validating terminals (this refers to Koleje
Mazowieckie as well as some integrated offers – for example in the region of Gdańsk). Future plans of railway
operators are usually based on standards, determined by the existing validating terminals. Passengers on
regional bus operators mostly use paper single tickets purchased from drivers, using electronic cash registers,
required by law for fiscal reasons. Season tickets may be paper or smartcard.

26.      The newest development is a ticketing system in Świebodzice, where at the beginning of 2016 a group
of Polish firms, introduced a system allowing to purchase a ticket, by a proximity bank card – a passenger does
not need a paper ticket nor a transport specific smartcard. This system co-exists with classic paper systems.
This means that the operator does not need to issue transport specific cards, the passenger is free to pay for
the journey with his bank card


Summing Up

27.       As is the case in several European countries, multiple proprietary AFC solutions have been
implemented in Polish cities in recent years. There is no overall direction as to what these systems will provide,
and there is limited levels of interoperability across the rail network, which makes travelling across the country
difficult. There appear to be limited distribution channels for ticket sales, which mainly focus on stations.
Except for long distance trains, there is very limited internet sales capability, or uptake evident. Given large
recent investments in smartcard technology, existing public transport operators may be wary of adapting to a
new interoperable smartcard standard.

28.      There is the potential to build on the new systems, such as those implemented in Świebodzice, and
develop an interoperable standardized system for Poland that builds on the benefits of smart media for
passengers and operators alike. With the development of new technologies, as will be discussed later in this
Report, there is the potential for Poland to be at the forefront of developing standards for the next generation
of smart ticketing systems that will be implemented.

International Approaches to Automatic Fare Collection
Introduction

29.     Public transport ticketing has come a long way over the last 30 years. The major technology back then
was paper based but there has been a gradual change as new technologies, ranging from magnetic stripe tickets
to smartcards, have been developed and successfully implemented in many major cities worldwide.
Historically, transport operators have only considered smartcard systems to pay for transport, so called closed
schemes. The resulting system was built, in the majority of cases, to a proprietary specification by a single
supplier. These schemes required a considerable capital investment for the infrastructure, as well as on-going
operational costs.

30.     Customer expectations have changed significantly in recent years, especially with the advent of the
internet and online retail. There is a general expectation that all transactions can be undertaken in a fast
customer friendly way. Standing in a queue for a ticket machine does not fit this model. The introduction of
smartcards has meant that customers no longer need to queue at the ticket office window to renew their
monthly or annual season ticket. This can be done online and the new ticket delivered the next time the card is
passed over a reader. Auto-top-up is also available in many schemes to registered users who can get their pre-
paid balance automatically topped up when it falls to a pre-defined threshold. All the payment is dealt with in
the back office. This chapter looks at worldwide approaches to AFC in public transport.


Ticketing Technologies

31.     Based on a review of international experience, it can be concluded that no unified, standardized
solutions have emerged with regard to existing AFC systems in major cities covering the totality of the
operation of the system. Instead, there is competition between alternative models that include national
standards, (e.g. ITSO, Calypso, OV-chipkaart in the Netherlands) and proprietary systems. (e.g. Oyster in
London, Octopus in Hong Kong). The travel media that passengers use in public transport can vary significantly,
and also some locations accept multiple technologies —in the case of London Transport for London (TfL)
magnetic stripe, smartcard (Oyster), EMV bank cards and mobile EMV (for example Apple Pay). 6 Travel media
are always devised and developed in accordance with the business and security demands and IT capabilities of
the time. The different fare media do not need to be considered in isolation, as there is no one technology that
can address all the needs of users of urban and inter-urban transport. The technologies complement each other,
and several examples exist of cities or regions successfully implementing multiple technologies across multiple
modes of transport.




6EMV chip technology is becoming the global standard for credit card and debit card payments. Named after its original
developers (Europay, MasterCard® and Visa®), this technology features payment instruments (cards, mobile phones, etc.)
with embedded microprocessor chips that store and protect cardholder data. This standard may also be referred to as chip
and PIN or chip and signature. Payment data is more secure on a chip-enabled payment card than on a magnetic stripe card,
as the former supports dynamic authentication, while the latter does not.

 Box 2: ITSO, ENV, Apple Pay

 ITSO Ltd (ITSO) is a UK non-profit distribution technical, standardization and interoperability membership
 organisation with objectives to: (a) maintain and develop the ITSO specification for transport smartcards; (b)
 operate and manage an interoperable smart media environment; and (c) facilitate and support development of
 interoperable smart ticketing schemes that comply with the ITSO specification.
 ITSO was established as a result of discussions between various UK passenger transport authorities concerning
 the lack of standards for interoperable smartcard ticketing. These discussions grew to include other authorities,
 transport operators and government. ITSO membership covers the breadth of the transport sector including
 transport operators (bus, tram and train operating companies), suppliers to the industry, local authorities and
 public transport executives. Supported by the Department for Transport, ITSO has links with major transport
 industry organizations and established smartcard schemes in the UK and overseas.
 ITSO started out as the Integrated Transport Smartcard Organisation but this has been dropped and is now just
 'ITSO'. That is because the specification covers other forms of ticketing besides smartcards and transport. The
 Department for Transport introduced in 2008 the English National Concessionary Travel Scheme for all people
 of retirement age and eligible disabled persons (according to the Transport Acts 1985 and 2000) using buses,
 which uses ITSO smartcards. Transport Scotland and the Welsh Government have implemented ITSO in their
 concessionary travel schemes. Transport authorities and operators are now rolling out commercial uses for ITSO-
 based smartcards throughout the country.
 The ITSO specification is a technical platform on which interoperable smart ticketing schemes can be built. It
 defines the key technical items and interfaces that are required to deliver interoperability between both,
 components of a ticketing system – smart media (smartcards), points of service and back offices – and separate
 ticketing systems. ITSO smartcard specifications covers card, point of service and back office systems.
 EMV. Originally a joint working group set up in December 1993 by Europay International, MasterCard
 International and Visa International, to develop a common set of technical specifications for the use of IC
 cards by the payment industry. Responsibility for the specification has now passed to a management
 company, EMVCo LLC (www.emvco.com ), so that EMV is now used to refer to the group of specifications
 produced by that company.
 EMVCo members worked jointly over the last few years to develop specifications that define a set of
 requirements to ensure worldwide interoperability and acceptance of secure payment transactions using
 integrated circuit cards. It accomplishes this by managing and evolving the EMV® Specifications and related
 testing processes. Today there are EMV Specifications based on contact chip, contactless chip, common
 payment application (CPA), card personalization, and tokenization. There are also EMV documents and
 materials regarding mobile payments.
 Apple Pay is a mobile payment and digital wallet service by Apple that lets users make payments using
 the iPhone 6, 6 Plus, and Apple Watch-compatible devices (iPhone 5 and later models), iPad Air 2, iPad
 Pro and iPad Mini 3 and later. Apple Pay does not require Apple Pay-specific contactless payment terminals,
 and can work with existing contactless terminals. Transport for London accepts Apple Pay.

32.
33.      Table 1 indicates the strengths and weaknesses of the available technologies. The criteria identified in
the table are generic and can be applied to any ticketing scheme across the globe. What this shows is that
technologies such as smartcards, mobile phones and identity tokens provide the best potential for
interoperable smart ticketing systems. Indeed, these technologies have been successfully implemented in cities
such as London, Amsterdam, Washington DC, and Boston. As can also be seen from the table, there are a large
number of technologies that are being used for automatic fare collection, which means that Public Transport
Operators (PTOs) have difficult decisions to make as to which technologies to support in the medium to long
term.


                                                                                                                     11
Future Developments

34.      Many major cities have invested significant sums in bespoke smartcard based ticketing systems that
have delivered major benefits to both operators and the travelling public. Some of these schemes, such as
Oyster for Transport for London (TfL) in London, are beginning to look at the next generation of open payment
systems to build on current successes and look at how new technologies can be used to support them in this
transition. A significant trend is the move away from issuing tickets to the use of more advanced forms of
payment, including contactless bank cards and Apple Pay, in London amongst others, and the use of identity
tokens, such as government issued PIV cards in Washington DC, to show that a passenger has a right to travel. 7
This has meant that we are seeing a movement away from bespoke ticketing systems to the adoption of retail
solutions to meet transport requirements (Figure 3).

       Source: World Bank.


35.      AFC should not be seen as a simple replacement for traditional paper or magnetic ticketing. The
introduction of AFC systems is also an opportunity to rethink the current fare policy and to offer additional or
alternative fare possibilities to customers. This is because there is a clear link between fare collection
technology and fare policy. The technology that has been in place for several years has been developed to
implement the existing fare policies and products. As technology has developed it has allowed different fare
policies to be implemented that were not previously possible due to the limitations of the technology, for
example daily fare capping in London on Oyster cards. Public transport is notoriously slow to instigate change.

7 A PIV card is a United States federal smartcard that contains the necessary data for the cardholder to be granted access to
federal facilities and information systems and assure appropriate levels of security for all applicable federal applications.
12
As a consequence, there is a tendency to continue with existing fare policies and implement new technology,
the result being a far more expensive way of providing fare collection than previously.

36.      Business models. Smart ticketing is a global business and is, for the first time, being driven by standards.
This allows off-the-shelf technology to be adopted with only limited local tailoring to reflect specific fare
structures and cross-modal opportunities. By using open national standards for smart ticketing, payment
systems, and communications infrastructure, public transport operators can access supply chains that are
responsive, cheaper and address industry best practice. However, the use of new technology now allows for
post-payment of travel, if passengers have a valid token, such as a contactless bank issued credit or debit card,
and the journey is recreated from the taps in and out of the network. Payment is then calculated according to
several variables including, time of day, zones crossed, applicable discounts, e.g. capping, and mode of
transport.

37.      Distribution channels. New fare collection systems must allow passengers to plan and book their travel
through a wide range of sales and distribution channels and move away from a station centric approach. This
goal requires a new system that can accommodate the speed, power and flexibility necessary to handle multiple
distribution channels for ticket sales. There is a significant move away from traditional retailing at stations to
more user centric approaches as shown in Figure 4.

38.     Organizational and legal issues. There is a need for leadership in this area, which could come from national
governments or operator supported groups, to provide confidence that when new AFC systems are introduced
there will be a degree of interoperability to enable passengers to travel across several modes across a wide
area. Legislation would be necessary to give any such proposals a strong foundation and ensure a level of
compatibility between AFC systems.

39.     Integration with travel information and traffic management. By creating a linkage between Travel
Information, Journey Planning, Payment and Smart Ticketing, including a liaison with compatible mobile phone
and contactless bankcard schemes, new AFC systems can ensure the passenger experience consistently meets
the highest expectations. It can also break down barriers to usage of public transport systems and assist in
obtaining a modal shift by making access to public transport easier.

40.     Development of smart ticketing standards. A common feature that has enabled the uptake of new
technologies is the development of standards that can be directly applied to the transport sector, or require
adaption for solutions to be implemented. The latter is particularly true for payment systems that have been
adapted to meet the requirements of transport, which requires a high throughput of passengers at peak times,
and cannot perform on-line authorization at the point of entry. Also, the underpinning mobile and
communications technologies are all based on internationally standardized solutions.

41.      Data privacy. Protection of customers’ privacy is enshrined in the EU Data Protection Act, which AFC
systems need to comply with. Additionally, where payment cards are used there are requirements to tokenize
the card details, in compliance with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS) requirements to
minimize the potential for fraud. 8 All of these issues are key to the successful implementation of a smart
ticketing scheme, as any loss of trust in the system by users would damage passenger acceptance.


Summing Up

42.     As more and more cities adopt the use of these disruptive technologies, there will be a need to
standardize the approach used, so that passengers have the same user experience across the country. There
are two avenues, which are not mutually exclusive, for Poland —take part in the development of smartcard
standards, either building on existing specifications, or through developing new standards and to focus on
interoperability across modes and local administrations through development of new technologies, such as
EMV cards or Apply Pay.

43.       As technology evolves in this sector there will be a need to have a standard approach, or passengers
will be less likely to use it if the experience is different in different locations. For example, cell phones work in
the same way all over the world, so the user experience is the same. Apple Pay is the same in the UK and the US
and China. As a consequence, users know what they have to do each time they want to use the service

44.       The current trend is towards making payment of transport fares simpler, and allow the passenger to
choose which payment product or device he wishes to use to identify himself to the network, to indicate that
he is eligible to travel on that network. This simplifies the front-end systems significantly and moves a lot of
the decision making as to which fare is best, from the passenger and into the back office.

45.     New technologies have a cost (production and distribution) and a robust strategy for managing the
cost and deployment is a critical issue within some existing systems. It is also important to bear in mind that
there will be a substantial customer base for the smart-ticketing end product, and their needs must be
considered during the process otherwise take up rates and acceptance of the scheme may be low. After sales
issues and data security are also important attributes to consider, as this ensures the customer will feel
confident when using the smart ticketing.

46.      In many cases it is true to say that schemes continue to remain beholden to past decisions, where fare
collection technology imposed significant limitations. This drove the need for zonal-based structures to support
fares integration with multi-ride and periodical fare products, to operate in ‘open’ fare collection environments.
These fare structure and fare product concepts are often subject to widespread public and political acceptance
and support. New paradigms offered by Near Field Communication (NFC) and bank-issued smartcards opens

up new horizons.9 Through the integration of fare collection systems and mobile. This means that there is a link
between location, payment and information which can be combined to improve the travelers experience and
provide the operator with more information about what type of service passengers want.

47.      This poses challenges public transport authorities and policymakers to rethink how to best deliver
customer service and offer different value propositions off the back of these new technologies. Based on the
past, this would tend to suggest that an ongoing evolution rather than a revolution will occur from a policy
perspective. A further implication may well be an extremely pragmatic approach to business case development
associated with next generation fare collection systems.

European AFC Standards Development
Introduction

48.       There are many reasons why standardization of systems is beneficial. The reasons outlined by the
European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI) 10 are: (a) safety and reliability; users perceive
standardized products and services as more dependable, this in turn raises user confidence, increasing the
take-up of new technologies; (b) support of government policies and legislation; frequently referenced by
regulators and legislators for protecting user and business interests, and to support government policies.
Standards play a central role in the European Union’s policy for a single market; (c) interoperability or the
ability of devices to work together relies on products and services complying with standards; and (d) business
benefits – provide a solid foundation upon which to develop new technologies and to enhance existing
practices. Standards open up market access, provide economies of scale, encourage innovation, and increase
awareness of technical developments and initiatives. This chapter provides an overview of AFC standards
development in Europe.


Standards

49.     When considering AFC systems, it is necessary first to consider what the system comprises, in order
to understand what can be standardized. Figure 5 illustrates the scope of a generic AFC system. As can be seen,
there are a wide range of technologies that comprise an AFC. Much of the back office systems are generic IT
systems that comply with industry wide standards. The front office and fare media equipment can comprise
equipment such as mobile phones, contactless payment cards, and smartcards that comply with international
standards. Standards for card devices fall in to two camps, proprietary or open.

50.     Proprietary standards. Proprietary products such as Oyster in London and Octopus in Hong Kong have
been developed for the urban transit environment out of a requirement to provide fast throughput at peak
times and an all in one media, meeting the needs of multi-mode transport operators. These proprietary
standards can be simple and cheap to develop as they only work within the remit of a single transit operator
and do not have to conform to any other interoperable standards.

51.      Open Standards. Open standards such as ITSO, VDV and Calypso and the EMVCo payments specifications
are designed for interoperability across national or global acceptance. They are each primarily designed for a
target environment, so ITSO is a transit specification and EMV is a payments specification, but both can be used
to cross the boundary between transit and payments. These standards, while not as flexible as the bespoke
closed standard, do offer the transit operator to leverage some benefits that come with these standards such
as interoperability with other schemes, low or no issuance costs, and improved security.

Transport Standards Development

52.     The UK, Germany, France and the Netherlands have led the way in Europe in the development of
national standards for smart ticketing. Figure 6 below summarizes the scope and usage of these systems. At
the European level, the Interoperable Fare Management (IFM) project has been looking to bring all of these
national standards together. The aim of the project is to ensure cross-border interoperability of transport
Smartcards across Europe. One of the key objectives is to develop a road map towards a EU-wide concept
where: (a) customers use their local transport smartcards outside their home network; (b) transport
authorities have the tool-set to build new systems using standardized specifications; (c) deliver the associated
Security Environment; and (d) charter a way through privacy issues.

53.      Financial Service Providers (FSPs) have increased their role in the smart-ticketing market in recent
years and have established positive working relationships with many scheme providers this period. The
realization of contactless EMV payments in smart-ticketing pilot schemes shows that these working
relationships are successful and have demonstrated that EMV technologies are now feasible for public
transport ticketing.

54.      Europe has adopted the International Standard ISO EN 24014-1:2015 as the global model to define the
systems and processes required to manage the distribution and use of fare products in an interoperable public
transport environment.11 The standard provides the basis for the development of multi-operator/multi-service
interoperable public surface (including subways) transport fare management (IFM) systems on a national and
international level. ISO 24014-1:2015 is applicable to bodies in public transport and related services which
agree that their systems need to interoperate. While ISO 24014-1:2015 does not imply that existing
interoperable fare management systems need to be changed, it applies so far as it is practically possible to
extensions of these. At the system level, it is the aim of the EU-IFM to build on this standard developing a model
that defines the generic components and interfaces as well as generic low level processes. The approach
adopted and the proposed strategy appear to be the most cohesive available, considering media interoperation,
organizational roles, privacy, trust and security, together with the back office systems that will allow schemes
to network and interoperate.

55.     ISO is helping to bring the worlds of transit and payments together with a Technical Report paper on
the use of transit data area or TDA. 12 TDA is an innovation by the payments industry to introduce a space on
payment cards that can be written to by transit operators. Bank issued cards may also have an extended
payment application that permits the public transport industry to store data within the payment application in
what are called TDAs. By definition, the available data storage space will be quite limited. It thus allows the

for fare media. Available at: http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=55067
 ISO TR14806 is a technical report that defines the state of the art in respect of using bank-issue payment applications/cards for
transport ticketing. The report provides a set of use cases and requirements for payment applications, most of which can be met by
the current offerings from MasterCard and Visa.


18
storage of limited information only and will not be able to host national, interoperable fare management
application standards. The TDA will only be approx. 140 bytes, so will hold just enough information to indicate
that the user has performed a transaction to enable an inspector to see, but not to carry a ticket product, which
was never its intended use. The ISO Technical Report describes the ways that bank issued payment cards can
be used by the public transport industry to serve customer needs, independent of specific payment card scheme
specifications.

56.      As AFC systems have opened up with the introduction of new payment technologies and mobile
phones, there are significant opportunities to develop new approaches to fare collection. Some of this can be
seen in London where TfL is accepting contactless payment cards and in Washington DC where the new system
will accept PIV identity cards on the Metro. These approaches signal a shift from the 1990s technology. Some
trends that are becoming apparent in the industry that will influence the way in which AFC is delivered in the
coming years are:

       Development of national standards, particularly in Germany, UK, and France;
       Introduction of new form factors, particularly mobile, which is opening up a wide range of
        opportunities;
       A realization that multiple standards will exist, due to the complex nature of public transport in
        different countries across the EU;
       The development of further standards will not add any further value, or identify any further
        functionality and will cost a great deal; and
       It cannot be said that one standard is better than another, as each system has been developed
        according to a particular vision, and the best solution developed to implement that vision.


Summing Up

57.       Existing AFC schemes have already installed some components that conform to international norms,
and have adopted operating models that comply with best practice. However, these are generally insufficient
to support interoperability between schemes or across national or international boundaries. This conformity
across schemes could form a general basis for the development of a European organization model that is
capable of incorporating the existing national organizations that can fit, for example, the ISO EN 24014-1
standard. Leading IFM organizations have built a shared vision to (a) create an EU-IFM network to provide
direction, coordination, networking of best practices and implementation planning of pan- European IFM
initiatives; (b) promote further European standards for transport smartcards including security and
certification equipment; and (c) develop a multi-application solution to interoperable ticketing that can be
implemented in stages.

58.      Ultimately, the leading IFM organizations expect a common smart media application to be the best way
of ensuring interoperability. However, the use of multi-application media provides a first step toward this goal,
allowing customers to hold their transport applications and means of payment on one single convenient media.
Local schemes may then implement the common application at their own pace with reasonable modification
costs and minimum disruption to their operation.

Interoperability across Regions
Introduction

59.      Standardization of AFC systems and components does not guarantee that a system will be able to
operate across a region or country. In order for that to happen there must be interoperability of systems. The
Transport Research Board (TRB) in the US has defined interoperability as the ability of different agencies to
coordinate and share information so that passengers can travel in a seamless fashion. The Transport Card
Forum in the UK defines interoperability as the “ The ability of systems to provide services to, and accept
services from, other systems, and to use the services so exchanged to enable them to operate effectively
together. When used in relation to ticketing systems in public transport, interoperability means the provision
for the passenger of a seamless journey using the same smartcard and/or terminals, on all contractually
participating operators’ routes. Fare payment interoperability is only one factor that affects seamless travel.

Elements of Fare Payment Interoperability

60.      Fare payment interoperability does not necessarily require the use of a smartcard. Figure 7 illustrates
the high-level components to achieving interoperability. This can occur with a manual or automated system. A
manual system relies on human interaction such as visual inspection, and business rules are agreed between
participants so passengers can travel across different operators and/or modes. An automated system relies on
technology—usually using fare media such as a contactless smartcard to validate interoperability. The
information and data flows required to achieve smartcard interoperability also applies to other media such as
magnetic stripe tickets or radio frequency identification (RFID) tags.

61.      A clear set of business rules are necessary to outline how each of the participants needs to work
together. At a minimum, the rules must provide the technology requirements that include systems and fare
media and transaction processing that defines the data to be transferred for processing and when (how often)
that occurs. These rules may also define other business-related aspects such as branding (how the product is
to be identified in the market), customer service processes and procedures, sharing of expenses and payment
for services; items controlled by participants; dispute resolution; and legal framework.

62.      The next step is to define the technical information required to achieve interoperability. The business
rules define the information to be exchanged by the interoperable smartcard system. At a minimum, the card-
to-reader data format and the data format for transferring the transaction records to a central clearinghouse
need to be defined. The minimum requirements for implementing an interoperable smartcard system can be
accomplished by using one of the following approaches:

        Procuring the technology from a single supplier, similar to TfL in London, with the Oyster scheme from
         Cubic  


20
        Developing an interface specification that defines the requirements with which each participant’s
         supplier has to comply, similar to what is done in the financial services or telecommunications
         industries and with ITSO (UK), VdV (Germany), Calypso (France) and the OV-chipkaart (Netherlands)

Evolution of Interoperability with Open Payment Systems  

63.      Now that financial institutions are implementing contactless payment products throughout Europe, a
baseline architecture may be used to begin developing an interoperability strategy for public transport with
open payment systems. There is a strong take up of such products in Poland with over 80 percent of the
population users making contactless payments. As a consequence, the following scenarios for interoperability
begin to emerge:
 
     Acceptance of contactless bank cards on buses and at fare gates;
     Two or more public transport operators arrange to accept each other’s closed stored -value payment
         products,; and
     Acceptance of multiple-payment-enabled devices.

To determine the interoperability requirements with an open payment system, the characteristics of the
existing transit payment architecture need to be identified.


Acceptance of Contactless Bank Cards  

64.     As contactless credit cards proliferate, public transport operators become increasingly attractive
customers for financial institutions. The most likely relationship that will emerge between financial institutions
and public transport operators is similar to a merchant in the retail space. Under this type of relationship, PTOs

                                                                                                               21
accept a bankcard for transit fare payment and pay a transaction processing fee to the financial institutions.
The key issue is that the bankcard data structure is not designed for conducting fare calculations. Therefore,
two baseline system architecture configurations emerge for using a bankcard to pay a fare: (a) transit and
credit card applications both reside on the same chip or (b) the credit card application only resides on a
contactless chip.

65.       Though technically feasible to combine transport and payment applications on a single card, the
institutional barriers still make this configuration economically infeasible. However, using a contactless credit
card product for fare payment is technically feasible in a cost-effective manner if some of the institutional
constraints can be modified. This has been proven to work in Salt Lake City, Utah and across the TfL network
in London. In conjunction with the major card schemes, Visa, MasterCard and American Express, TfL developed
a set of rules for the use of contactless payment cards in public transport fare collection. These are summarized
in Table 3.

                          Table 3: Transport Requirements for Contactless Payment Cards




         Source: World Bank.


Multiple Closed Stored-Value Payment Products

66.      Closed stored-value products are becoming an increasingly attractive means to create loyal customer
relationships. In the retail environment, coffee shops, such as Starbucks issue closed-account-based stored-
value cards. Sports venues are also beginning to recognize the benefits of a contactless stored-value payment
media. Two parts are required to create interoperability between disparate closed stored-value systems:

        The need to read participants’ cards or payment media and
        Agreement on how settlement will occur.  

67.       This type of arrangement is referred to as a trust model, as it requires participants to trust the integrity
of the transaction data. An example of where this has been implemented is between TfL and the train operating
companies (TOCs) who feed the London terminals. The TOCs have agreed to accept TfL’s Oyster card in several
stations close to London. These TOCs need to purchase Cubic’s Tri -Reader and integrate them with their own
gates. This is not dissimilar to the regional interoperability approach where it is necessary to purchase
equipment from one supplier. However, the TOCs do not issue the Oyster Card, they just collect transactions
and feed them to TfL. They then receive an invoice at the end of the month for a lump sum, there is no detailed
breakdown of transactions, the TOC has to trust that TfL has collected the correct journey information.




22
Multiple Payment-Enabled Devices

68.      There are two configurations of payment-enabled devices: (a) transit-enabled contactless chips
embedded into devices; and (b) devices with transit application (software) that communicates with the reader
in a non-ISO-14443-compliant mode (e.g., Bluetooth, 802.11, or infra-red). 13 The most common payment-
enabled device is a key fob with the same contactless chip as a smartcard (e.g., the ExxonMobil Speedpass
device). Contactless smartcard chips have also been embedded in mobile phone covers or even into a
designated slot in the mobile phone. The primary difference between a contactless smartcard and a key fob or
mobile phone cover is the form. Therefore, when a transit-enabled contactless chip is embedded in, for
example, a mobile phone cover, interoperability is the same as for transit-issued contactless smartcards, as
long as the same contactless chips are used.

69.      In recent years, there has been development of Near Field Communications (NFC) with mobile phones
able to emulate payment cards. A prime example of this is Apple Pay, which uses a tokenized form of a payment
card stored on an iPhone, which can make contactless payments through the NFC interface. This migration
towards a mobile platform is a long-term trend that will become more prevalent in coming years. At the
moment, Apple Pay is the first with major traction. The idea is that people will be able to leave their wallets at
home and just take their phones, so it becomes more convenient and secure for users.


Implications for Poland

70.      In Poland some areas have expanded their systems to include neighboring cities, and this is a good
example of interoperability based on a single supplier as described above. However, there is no coordinated
plan for a nation wide interoperable smart ticketing system. It could be argued that this lack of a plan is limiting
usage of public transport, as buying a ticket to travel becomes a barrier to usage. With the high penetration of
contactless payment cards in Poland, over 80 percent, there must be a strong case for bank issued payment
cards to be part of any national interoperable AFC scheme. There is still work to be done in this area,
particularly in relation to long distance rail journeys, but the problems are not insurmountable. There is the
potential for Poland to take a lead in this area, with the support of the leading card schemes, Visa, MasterCard
and Amex, to demonstrate how this can be implemented, and create the basis of a standard for the use of bank
cards in this scenario, similar to what TfL achieved with regards to urban transport and bank issued payment
cards.

International Case Studies

Introduction

71.     This chapter focuses on examples of standardization and interoperability of AFC systems for public
transport. The first two case studies are from the European Union--the first is the OV-chipkaart of the
Netherlands, the second is the evolution of public transport ticketing in London, while the third surveys Korea’s
experience. It also presents an innovative pilot multi-modal booking and payment system mobile app
developed in Vienna, which provides an individual mobility payment system that integrates across all modes,
without the need for smartcard interoperability. There are interesting lessons to learn from all approaches
taken by both countries.


Netherlands – OV Chipkaart

72.     The OV-chipkaart (Openbaar Vervoer Chipkaart) is a contactless smartcard system used for all public
transport in the Netherlands. First introduced in the Rotterdam metro in April 2005, it has subsequently been
rolled out to other areas and travel modes. It fully replaced the national paper based ticket system
strippenkaart for buses, trams and metros in 2011 and the paper ticket system for rail travel in July 2014. The
OV-chipkaart works in two ways: either as a stored-value card which is used to travel on pre-loaded credit or
as a means of storing so-called travel products such as single or return rail tickets, day passes, seasonal tickets
and discount plans.

73.      This product was developed by Trans Link Systems (TLS), which was an entity established in 2002 by
Connexxion, GVB (Amsterdam), HTM (Den Haag), NS-R (Dutch Railway Company) and RET (Rotterdam).
Together these five companies provide 80 percent of public transport services in the Netherlands and
cooperate with all other public transport organizations. Trans Link Systems (TLS) works in partnership with
the carriers involved to ensure the OV-chipkaart is made available to the people using public transport in
the Netherlands. The OV-chipkaart can be used on the bus, metro, tram and train. A tender process was started
in 2002 to select a supplier that can build the central system and this was awarded to the East-West e-Ticketing
B.V. consortium in 2003. 14 The solution that East-West has designed is based on the existing “Octopus”
smartcard system for public transport used in Hong Kong. Connexxion is the largest public transport bus
company in the Netherlands, operating in the west, middle, east and far northern part of the country since 1999.
TLS is now owned by the four largest operators: GVB, RET, HTM, and NS-R. Connexxion withdrew for reasons
related to its French parent, Transdev, which is a subsidiary of France’s state - owned Caisse des Dépôts, and
which acquired Connexxion in 2007.

74.    TLS has developed a nationwide smartcard system for transport, covering various products – t-purse
and passes, and allowing different price mechanisms and concession areas—this is the Dutch term for bus

and Octopus Cards Ltd (both companies established in Hong Kong).

franchise—and all modes. Cards are either personalized or anonymous; there are also limited use tickets for
incidental users, with a typical life of two days, in Amsterdam (using a lower cost Mifare Ultralight ticket).
Several million cards have been issued to date, and 60,000 “front end devices” (validators, rail, metro gate
readers, and vending machines) have been deployed. Across the country, few cities are not now using the
scheme; Rotterdam and Amsterdam have gone fully smart, and Rotterdam has phased out legacy means of
payment. 15The cards only have a public transport journey functionality – they do not currently handle taxis,
parking, or parking, but cover bike rentals in railway stations.


75.      TLS has the role of card issuer and central processor. Cards are procured by individual operators and
issued to customers, but transactions are processed by TLS’s central processing facility. Operators benefit from
having their own brands on the card. The scheme is known as OV-chipkaart, and the interoperability is achieved
through a three part set of definitions: 1) technical specification; 2) rules and regulations; and 3) registrar
documentation containing the global parameters.

76.       Implementation delays were due to stakeholder management, especially related to NS-R changing its
mind on how it wanted to see smartcards used. Originally, the rest of the network wanted to have a touch
in/touch out system, but NS-R did not, and wanted to allow travel as long as there is a valid product on the card.
However, in 2007 NS-R decided to accept Touch In/Touch Out and changed the operating model. Another
reason for delay was that system integration capability was insufficient within the operators, and TLS had to
source this from the East-West consortium. Also, TLS decided on a procurement model where the selected
implementer also wrote the specification (unlike ITSO which has been defined by Government). This has made
it difficult for other suppliers to enter the market quickly as they have not had the skills and facilities to deliver
the integrator defined solution.  

77.      For non-rail journeys, typically 89 eurocents are deducted at the start and a kilometer-based price
calculated on exit (like Oyster on underground). The concern in the UK about rail fares being of a potentially
high transaction value is not as applicable; the maximum Dutch rail fare is currently Euro 26.30 (single trip,
2nd class). As a result, the collection risk is lower and NS-R is willing to take a risk by deducting only Euro 20
at the start of a journey, because 50 percent of travel either starts or ends in a closed station.

78.      TLS prefers to see all tickets operate with Touch In/Touch Out be either t-purse with auto reload linked
to a payment account or season tickets. It would also like to see a “National Action List” – an internet site where
tickets can be purchased on-line then “picked up” electronically at a device located at a place of the passenger ’s
choice (similar to Oyster)16. This is expected to speed up journey times. Buying on the internet is considered to
be more secure than in public where payment card PINs can be observed. Internet kiosks are located in
convenient places. These payment channels related efficiencies are expected to reduce staff costs. The
Netherlands has already moved away from manned ticket offices to electronic ticket vending machines.

79.     National regulations require that there be one national ticketing system in the country. Public
transport authorities require operators to accept the use of OV-chipkaart and the scheme has been developed
with much seeking of input from interested parties. Its strength is derived from the power of the participating
operators and their collective dominance of transport ticketing. Within cities such as Amsterdam and
Rotterdam, operators are subsidiaries of the transport authorities, such as RET and GVB. They are not
independent commercial entities and have no discretion on whether to accept OV- chipkaart or not.



15 All areas have nowadays, but some paper tickets (created by local bus operators) continue to exist on top of OV-chipkaart
acceptance.
16 This works for top-up, though not yet for specific seasonal passes from the operators themselves.


                                                                                                                         25
80.     Connexxion, one of the major bus operators, is fully committed to OV-chipkaart, despite there being
many challenges and considerable effort for it. It likes the performance level of smart ticketing, reduced
transaction times, and there have been numerous design considerations over type and placement of validators
on board bus. There are no financial incentives to take part; to date Connexxion has been a net contributor. The
notion of providing an incentive to operators to adopt OV-chipkaart was not considered during the project, but
there are still discussions about who should pay for what element of the service.

81.      From an operator perspective the key benefits are time savings when compared to paper tickets, and
fraud reduction, in conjunction with a closed network. Fraud reduction is the next most important expected
benefit, especially for smartcards in conjunction with a closed network. A third benefit is related to getting
better data on transport usage is a key driver, which supports optimizing lines, routes and frequencies.

82.      National interoperability is key; this is multi-layer, the front end is offline and transactions are sent to
a central processor for each operator, then data is forwarded to the single TLS clearing and settlement system.
TLS has been established to secure this national interoperability; it is a private company, funded by its
shareholders. It is still losing money, but this is getting better and breakeven is being approached.17

83.     The Dutch specification is open; there is no lack of vendors given the country size; there are currently
20 vendors. The specification is owned and edited by TLS, and is freely available upon registration. It, or
something with a very similar technology specification, is currently implemented in Toronto, Oslo, and
Denmark. TLS likes the idea of a common European specification, but does not see it as a high priority since not
many travelers use public transport internationally.


The Evolution of Ticketing in the UK – Inside and Outside London

84.     Launched in 2003, the Oyster card scheme is a form of electronic ticketing used on public transport in
Greater London. It is promoted by Transport for London (TfL) and is valid on travel modes across London
including London     Underground,      London    Buses,    the Docklands      Light   Railway (DLR), London
Overground, trams, some river boat services, and most National Rail services within the London fare zones.
Usage of Oyster cards in the train system took several years to negotiate (2006-2009) but was introduced in
January 2010 on all nine London train operating companies (TOCs). This has resulted in increased TOC
revenues of 6 percent in London (GBP 100 million per annum).

85.      An Oyster card is a stored-value contactless smartcard that can hold single tickets, period tickets and
travel permits, which must be added to the card before travel. Passengers touch it on an electronic reader when
entering and leaving the transport system in order to validate it or deduct funds. Cards may be topped-up
by recurring payment authority, by online purchase, at credit card terminals or by cash, the last two methods
at stations or ticket offices. The card is designed to reduce the number of transactions at ticket offices and the
number of paper tickets. Usage is encouraged by offering substantially cheaper fares than with cash though the
acceptance of cash is being phased out. On London buses, cash is no longer accepted.




17TLS likes the fact that ITSO supports multiple media types – this is helpful given the security concerns over Mifare Classic
cards. However, they feel that the ITSO requirements for all readers to read all media is costly. The ITSO clearing and
settlement process (not being provided centrally) is also perceived to be onerous, with ‘on us/not on us ’17 transactions
being a big task. TfL’s Oyster on the other hand is regarded as quite similar to the Dutch system—multi tickets (changing
products during a journey, e.g. part on t-purse, part on a fixed product) is not supported by ITSO, but required in the
Netherlands.


26
86.      The Oyster card increased capacity at gates by allowing 40 customers to pass per minute compared to
15-20 for mag-stripe credit card sized tickets (CCST). PAYG and capping were subsequently introduced and a
price differential with cash fares was used to drive the adoption of Oyster. Now 87 percent of TfL’s services use
Oyster (12.7 m taps per day). Since 1998 it has reduced the cost of revenue collection by one third. Key benefits
of Oyster benefits include the following:

       •    Interoperable ticketing across all public transport in London;
       •    Removing the need for ticket purchase before journeys resulting in significant reductions in ticket
            office use;
       •    Easier for customers to self-serve, purchasing choices simplified;
       •    Increased throughput at gate-lines;
       •    Reduction of ticket fraud.

Future Ticketing Programme

87.       As part of TfL's Future Ticketing Programme (FTP) the Oyster card platform is due to be replaced by a
contactless payment card system, the first stage of which was completed by June 2015. A study in 2006
identified the alternatives that might become available to TfL, of which Contactless Payment Cards (CPCs or
cEMV) and mobile phones enabled with near field communication technology were the most promising. The
cost of revenue collection shone a light on the cost of ticket selling, a process that can be radically changed with
the acceptance of a payment product issued by the wider payments industry. The introduction of CPCs was
seen as a significant opportunity to find new ways for customers to pay for their travel without the need to get
a ticket from TfL first. This enables TfL to reduce ticketing costs while also improving the customer experience
(compared to Oyster) because information is held in an intelligent back office system rather than on the card
itself. The development of FTP was driven by the desire to reduce the cost of ticket sales which could not be
reduced further using Oyster. This has been achieved by using CPC which are issued by banks and not by TfL
and by moving intelligence from cards and readers to a more flexible and responsive back office. The program
is in five phases:

           CPC on buses launched in December 2012 using a retail payment model for the flat fare charge;
           Extending CPC acceptance to the rest of the Oyster reader estate (as well as new places such as
            riverboats) and also introducing weekly capping. This required the design of a transit payment model
            in conjunction with payment schemes to allow CPC transactions to take place where the cost was not
            known until the end of the journey;
           A new card platform for Oyster which uses the FTP back office for all ticketing products; and
           The decommissioning of the legacy Oyster system.

88.      The UK Department for Transportation (DfT) has paid GBP 66 million to have the Oyster readers also
accept ITSO customer media 18 . The program currently has delivered the capability to allow National Rail
singles, returns and season tickets—as well as English National Concessionary Travel Scheme (ENCTS)
concessions on buses—but has struggled due to the immaturity of ITSO. The first phase is live:

       •    TOCs can accept their own products at their own gated stations.
       •    Tube and Overground readers have been upgraded to accept Travelcard seasons if a TOC issues them
            on ITSO.
       •    ITSO cards can be accepted at un-gated stations and on buses.

18   Customer media refers to the media which holds the ITSO product, i.e. the smartcard.
                                                                                                                 27
TfL is working with several TOCs, including Southern, to enable ITSO compliant smartcards to be used by their
customers when travelling into London from outlying areas.

89.       The technology split which has evolved between London and the rest of the UK needs to be fixed. TfL
currently has TravelCard and Through-London agreements with the TOCs, based on CCST. These might need
to be renegotiated to work with smart tickets. Once FTP Phase 4 is completed, TfL would like to be able to offer
their back office to all UK operators who are interested in making use of it. TfL is also considering integrating
their back office with cycle hire in London and even accepting Tesco Clubcard points in exchange for travel
value. If ITSO and South East Flexible Ticketing (SEFT) are a success, then TfL will continue to accept ITSO
product entities for cross and through-London travel. The TOCs are not motivated to agree SLAs between each
other and the franchises are not motivating them to work together. We would likely have to wait until 2021
before the last of the TOC franchises are renewed and mandate ITSO.

90.      If ITSO and SEFT are not a success, there seem to be complimentary solutions that could co-exist side
by side:

     •   PAYG: Whatever the TfL solution is that replaces the current Oyster system for TfL-issued tokens and
         pre-paid accounts in the back office. This could apply to London rail like Oyster currently does.
     •   Tap & Go: CPC solution based on FTP Phase 2, but for rail outside of London. This will aim to offer a
         price match guarantee (pay the lowest price that was available that day for the journey made). How
         this works will depend upon the results of the Chiltern trial.
     •   Ticket in the Cloud: A token is associated with an advance purchase rail ticket. There is no fulfilment of
         the ticket to the customer. The reader authenticates the token and uses the token ID to access the ticket
         stored in the cloud. The token could be the CPC card used to purchase the ticket or it could be a barcode
         on a mobile device (though London gates do not accept barcodes and have no plans to).



Transit Model 2

91.       TfL is considering with Visa and Barclaycard whether a new transit mode is possible that is more
appropriate to rail. It is based on the ‘hotel model’ where a card is pre-authorised for a certain amount in order
to limit the risk of not being paid at the end of the spend. It is thought that a CPC card could be held for two
seconds at a rail reader which would cause the reader to perform an online authentication of the card and to
pre-authorize an amount (e.g. GBP 50) and the payment schemes might be prepared to accept the risk of not
receiving payment for the full costs of the actual rail travel after the journey has taken place.



Ticketing Technology Outside of London

92.      Outside of London there is less interoperability of ticketing across all modes of operation due to the
fragmented approach adopted by the major operators and lack of leadership in the deregulated environment.
It should be noted that outside of London there is little interoperability of e-ticket and m-ticket schemes making
journeys between operating regions problematic and ensuring that CCST magnetic stripe tickets remain
dominant.




28
93.      ITSO-compliant smart ticketing has been adopted by all five main bus operating companies in Britain
(Arriva, First, Go-Ahead, National Express and Stagecoach) and is used for concessionary smart ticketing on
around 14,000 buses outside London. ITSO has already been adopted by six train companies – East Midlands,
Abellio ScotRail, London Midland, Merseyrail, Southern Railway, and South West Trains and will be adopted in
all new rail franchises. Large parts of the UK are moving towards commercial ITSO-compliant schemes. In many
cases local authorities and passenger transport executives are taking the lead and working with transport
operators in their regions. For instance:



    •   NESTI (North East Smart Ticketing Initiative) in the North East covering 12 local authority areas
        including Nexus Tyne & Wear (so far partly covered by the Pop card).
    •   The NoWcard in Cumbria and Lancashire.
    •   Yorcard is looking to cover the region of Yorkshire and Humber, including Sheffield, York and Leeds.
    •   South West Smart Applications Limited (SWSAL), a smart ticketing project involving 15 local
        authorities and 17 transport operators in the South West of England.
    •   Merseyside, Greater Manchester and the West Midlands all have existing or planned ITSO-compliant
        smart ticketing systems.
    •   The whole of Cheshire is covered by the first ITSO-compliant commercial travelcard on its buses.
    •   In Scotland, buses have been equipped nationally to take ITSO smartcards for its concessionary travel
        scheme. An ITSO scheme is also being operated by Abellio ScotRail. (seasons only) Strathclyde
        Partnership for Transport (centred in Glasgow) has introduced ITSO-smart ticketing on the Subway.

South East Flexible Ticketing (SEFT)

94.      The South East Flexible Ticketing (SEFT) program’s objective is to deliver ‘smart’ ticketing
infrastructure and products to the rail network surrounding London. The program will complement the
existing Oyster infrastructure deployed in London by TfL. The DfT and TfL are currently implementing the ITSO
on Prestige (IoP) program which will upgrade all existing London Oyster readers to support ITSO media and
products. Four years since inception, SEFT seems to have stalled. Rail Settlement Plan (RSP) provides and
manages, on behalf of TOCs, a number of shared services, ranging from the provision of ticket stock to the
allocation of industry revenue. RSP and the TOCs are working together to provide the infrastructure (both at
station equipment and back office based systems) required to operate an ITSO compliant smart ticketing
solution at various stations operated by TOCs, all initially based in the South East of England with the potential
to be expanded beyond this region.

CPC Outside of London

95.      Outside of London several transport operators are investigating the use of CPC. Notable trials have
been undertaken by Stagecoach who used CPC as a cash replacement on buses in the North West. Transport for
Greater Manchester (TfGM) have appointed ATOS to provide a system (similar to TfL’s FTP but different since
there are no back office standards) for the Manchester Tram network that will accept ITSO and CPC. This is
currently being rolled out and ATOS is licensing to TfGM so that they retain the intellectual property rights and
can sell to other operators. The other major transport operating groups are looking at what is happening in
London before deciding if they will follow suit and roll out CPC across their bus networks. Some are in
negotiation with TfL about using the FTP back office. In the rail sector there is a well documented pilot being
proposed by Chiltern with TfL which will demonstrate if the model being used by TfL will be extendable to the
rail network beyond the London area and the GBP 6 fare risk limit. Currently there appear to be no other
operators who are looking at implementing CPC in the rail network.

                                                                                                               29
Smart in the North

96.      In October 2013, DfT announced plans for a UK-wide future fares and ticketing strategy, central to
which is the implementation of a nation-wide smart ticketing standard, with ITSO technology as the basis.19 As
part of this, the Smart in the North (STN) program will support DfT's commitment to ticketing transformation
in the rail industry, and maintaining interoperability of rail tickets and products on smart media. STN offers
the opportunity to create a new interoperable ticketing solution across the North of England that builds on the
existing ITSO infrastructure, with new products and simplified fares structures, which will make ticket pricing
more transparent, and allow transport passengers to make better-informed decisions about the most cost
effective way to travel.

97.      Currently, there are complex fare structures in place across the North that are confusing for passengers
and make it difficult to make an informed decision as to the most cost effective means to travel. There is no
single ticketing scheme in the North that compares with the Oyster card in London, which is accepted across
multiple modes in all geographic areas of the region. There is no single source of information on fares,
timetables or methods for purchasing journeys in the North; this is an additional barrier to passengers wishing
to make simple and informed decisions about journeys. Without a single authority responsible for all transport
modes, as in London, the need for local authorities, operators and regional authorities to work together in
partnership is critical to the success of STN.

98.     In a document outlining the Northern Powerhouse (HM Gov., Transport for the North, March 2015)
the DfT outline their proposed approach to address the identified problems. This approach includes:



     •   Simplify rail fares across the North, reducing the number of regulated fares baskets;
     •   Draw up proposals for a fares structure for an integrated Northern Travel Area;
     •   Identify existing smart schemes across the North that need to be modified to meet the common
         objective;
     •   Align the different tickets and approaches in the different cities across the region;
     •   Trial contactless cards on transport schemes;
     •   Engage with public and private operators to agree ways of introducing new technology; and
     •   Develop proposals for simple and unified approach to journey planning, provision of customer
         information and retail strategies to make it easier for customers to make their journeys

Barcode Technology

99.       Barcodes have been successfully implemented on the public transport network, both in rail and buses.
Numerous bus operators, both large and small are providing mobile apps that can sell bus tickets and deliver
them to a mobile device in the form of a bar code and visual ticket that can be used for visual and machine
inspection. Several of these mobile apps have integrated new payment methods such as PayPal and Pingit to
make the buying process more convenient for users. In the rail sector, TrainLine Ltd, a UK online rail ticket
retailer, has been involved in providing bar code tickets for several of the TOCs, in addition Chiltern Rail has
been an innovator in this field and has integrated bar code readers into its gate lines. There are problems that
have been encountered with bar codes that are being addressed by the industry which include:



19Department for Transport (2015), The northern powerhouse: one agenda, one economy, one north – a report on the
northern transport strategy. Available at:
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/northern-transport-strategy

30
       •   No central database of bar code tickets to check against to determine if ticket has been used or not.
           This is important from a revenue-control point of view as refunds can be claimed if there is no record
           of the ticket being used. However, this is currently being rectified;
       •   Speed of transaction can be slow as the bar code needs to be presented to the reader at the correct
           angle to be read.

100.     Within the last 12 months the rail industry finalized the development of a set of requirements to allow
interoperable bar code tickets to be sold and used across multiple operators, and in so doing addresses the
major issue above, of the need for a central database of tickets. Plans were announced earlier in 2016 for the
rollout of this system on the UK rail network.

Overall British Landscape

101.     As can be seen from the description above, the landscape in the UK is complex, with the ITSO standard
mainly focusing outside London, in a deregulated multi-operator competitive environment, and Oyster and CPC
the dominant approach in London, which is a regulated single operator environment. As a consequence, there
is no overall national strategy for interoperable ticketing in the UK. Various cities have implemented ITSO based
solutions, but not all of these are interoperable. Plans are underway to integrate these systems. There are plans
to extend Oyster further outside London on the rail network, and as such this means that ITSO usage will
decline. However, this would guarantee interoperability with the TfL network as the equipment has to be
provided by the same supplier.


Korean Approach

102.     Korea’s first smartcard ticketing system was introduced in Seoul in 1996 with the initial objective of
ensuring transparent management of transport operators, allowing passengers to pay fares electronically, and
address the problem of delays caused by manual fare payment. However, the system had a number of problems
such as increasing costs due to technology monopoly by operators, lack of interoperability with other systems,
and operators’ refusal to disclose relevant technological information. Due to these problems, the city
government faced difficulties in operating and maintaining the system as well as utilizing smartcard
transaction data needed for developing transport policies.

103.     In 2004, a new smartcard, named T-money, was introduced as part of public transport reform initiated
in Seoul. The Ministry of Knowledge Economy supported the development of AFC (AFC) standard software
solution (see Figure 1 for the illustration of standardization). Over time the transport related functionalities
were also integrated into practically all credit cards issued in Korea. By 2009, smartcard usage has reached 96
percent in Seoul, while average usage in other cities of about 80 percent. A policy to ensure the compatible use
of smartcard tickets among all public transport modes throughout the country was adopted. Smartcard
ticketing services began to gradually cover taxi services in 2007, and by 2011, the rate of taxi passengers using
smartcards rose to 40 percent.

104.    T-money is managed by Korea Smart Card Co., Ltd, a joint venture between Seoul Metropolitan
Government and LG Group. It is one of the world’s largest settlement company, wi th more than 230 bus
operators, 17,000 buses, 110,000 taxies, and 35 million data transition per day for US$14 million plus fare
settlement per day.20

105.     To make T-money work, the Korean government has put a significant effort to develop a national
standard for automatic fare collection. This approach is based on existing international standards, while
adapting them for the Korean national market and creating a national capability in AFC to develop an
international market. It took them 1 year to develop technical specifications and 1 year to develop solution
including smartcard, terminal, center systems and etc., and 6 months to build and operate the testing model.
The standards referred to during their standardization listed in Table 4. This approach is not uncommon, and
in fact has been adopted I the Netherlands, where the Hong Kong system was adapted to meet the Dutch
banking requirements, and in Colombia, where the LG solution for Bogota has been adapted to meet the
requirements for Colombia so it can become a national standard. This experience of creating an organization
to oversee the development of a national vision for AFC in Korea and producing a standard has offered lessons
that Poland can learn from.

106.     With strong government backing there are plans to sell the specification and skills overseas, and a
recent success has been achieved in Malaysia. In Europe this might be more difficult to achieve as there are
several standards in existence from Germany, France, the UK and The Netherlands, which make the selection
process more difficult, while there are no competing standards in South East Asia.

107.     Meanwhile, the Korean standard is card based, as the vast majority of installed systems are based on
smartcards. In the coming years there will be a significant shift to mobile based solutions, and so the standards
will need to be adapted for mobile platforms. Korea has a strong track record in implementing mobile solutions
and so this evolution should not pose too many problems to future upgrading.

Vienna Project SMILE- Smartphone Integrated Mobility Platform

108.     SMILE—Smart Mobility Info and Ticketing System Leading the Way for Effective E-Mobility Services—
was a pilot multi-modal booking and payment system linking individual e-mobility services with public
transport that ran from March 1st 2012 and ended on May 31st, 2015.23 This smartphone-based platform was
developed with public transport as a backbone.24 It integrates diverse mobility offerings into multiple unified
travel options taking into account unique customer needs. SMILE provides intelligent customer information,
and enables electronic booking and payment. It is open to third-parties and is expected to develop into a nation-
wide platform for Austria in the medium term, given the success of the pilot.

109.     The SMILE concept was to offer a wide range of transportation information, booking, payment, usage,
and billing functionality. A standardized interface (SMILE Connector) enables all mobility partners to link their
technical systems via specific adaptors to provide all their data, including the ticketing. The mobility platform
integrates various means of transport and combines them with routing information and user data to provide
individual mobility offers. Within the application server of the mobility platform all data was consolidated.
According to the specific user request the data will be selected and combined to provide the most suitable
options for the requested trip (including the actual price). Additionally the users then had the chance to choose
an option to book the entire trip – even with several mobility providers – without changing between different
apps. The clearing with the payment provider was processed in the background. 25

23 SMILE was a research project funded by the Climate and Energy Fund of the Austrian Federal Government and is carried
out as a part of the third call of the “Austrian Electric Mobility Flagship Projects” program. The Project costs Euro 6.7 million
with another Euro 2.9 million on promotion.
24 It integrates multiple mobility providers throughout Austria such as ÖBB (Austrian Railways), Wiener Linien (Public

Transport Vienna), Taxi 31300 (Taxi Service), Car2Go (free-floating carsharing), Emil and Emorail (e-carsharing), Citybike
(bikesharing), Tanke (Charging network for eCars).

110.      From a transport user perspective, after opening the Smile App, users are informed about available
means of transport around the current location or at any other chosen point in the map. Via tapping the icons
further information can be accessed, such as departure times of public transport at a stop, available rental bikes,
condition of a car-sharing vehicle or the available charging points in park houses. The mobility platform offers
different individual options and combinations for trips. These can be sorted by mean of transport, time, price
and CO2 emissions. With a filter certain means of transport can be filtered individually. Figure 11 shows prices
for different travel options.

necessary tickets bought from the providers. The secure, cash-free payment process runs completely in the
background. After the payment is authorized the tickets will be directly shown within the Smile App. The app
was developed and tested for Android 4.1 or higher29. Smile separates the use of mobility offers from prompt
payment which reduces experienced barriers of using intermodal or multimodal mobility offers. Central
accounting does not only help the customer to get an overview of mobility activities but also helps companies
gathering tickets for business trips. Furthermore it enables the usage of the entire range of public
transportation. The transaction structure is further illustrated below.


Key Lessons for Poland

112.      The Dutch example is relevant for Poland in a scenario where (a) multiple operators exist with their own
desire to differentiate their services; (b) an existing set of paper tickets and non-interoperable smartcard
tickets issued by operators; and (c) a desire to make smart ticketing interoperable on a national basis. Whether
a national interoperable smart ticketing system for all forms of public transport is the approach that Poland
wants to take is something that needs to be discussed and agreed with the various stakeholders. The
Netherlands differs from Poland in the following key respects:   the ticket supplier market is more mature and
there are fewer operators involved. The latter is particularly important, as the more operators there are, the
more complex the negotiations to agree on a common interoperable specification. Were such an approach to
be considered the right way forward, there are many lessons to be learned from the Netherland’s experience,
but the key lessons include the following:

          Central body. There needs to be a central body willing to own and drive the specification and oversee
           the implementation of the ticketing solution including leveraging economies of scale, for example in
           back office; to achieve interoperability in Poland a central body is needed to take the lead in the
           specification;  

          Interoperable specification. The specification needs to focus on the desired ticketing products and the
           enablement of efficient customer payments and fare collection not just re-producing the existing paper
           system. Delivering  efficiencies in ticketing for both operators and the central body is important —
           there needs to be a clear specification for the ticketing products that would be paid for by an
           interoperable payment account. An open specification that is freely available is preferable. It is not
           advisable to allow the supplier of the system to overly influence the specification of the system;  

          Operators. It is necessary to have strong operator support and adoption for the system, particularly on
           operational issues to ensure a common user experience across all modes;  Placing integration risks on
           the operators should be minimized;  

          Procurement. Procurement and implementation can take a long time, over 5 years. It is necessary to
           keep all stakeholders on board over this period. Where there is strong regulation and technical control,
           the project can proceed at a quicker pace.

113.     The British approach holds a number of lessons for Poland and may be closer to the situation in Poland,
where there is a fragmented public transport operator market for non-rail transport. The lessons that Poland can
learn from the UK are: (a) identifying a clear vision for interoperable ticketing. ITSO has a remit to deliver this;
(b) create an environment that is collaborative and encourages all operators to work together; currently in the


29   http://smile-einfachmobil.at/index_en.html
36
UK deregulation does not encourage co-operation and makes the possibility of an interoperable smartcard
solution unlikely; (c) incorporate technology changes into the specification to enable systems to evolve. The
ITSO specification is reliant on technology developed in the 1990s. Work has been ongoing to extend the
specification to incorporate HCE/NFC, but ITSO is still wedded to ticket sales, so a common PAYG solution is a
long way off, 30 and set up a central certification process. ITSO acts as a central authority to approve all
equipment connected to the ITSO system. This ensures interoperability.

114.      The Korean smartcard standard was a result of central government involvement, the creation of an
organization to oversee a national vision for AFC, and the key role of the metropolitan government of Seoul.
This is a much more centralized approach than that of the Netherlands or London, and may be less relevant for
Poland.

115.     In contrast, Vienna’s pilot of integrated mobility platforms using a smartphone app may be an
important option for Poland to consider, given the high penetration rate of mobile telephony, and the fact that
it does away with the need for an interoperable smartcard standard, as required by the London or Dutch
approach. This is much quicker to implement than introducing a national smartcard standard, and would make
multi-modal transport crossing local municipalities possible, an important objective to make public transport
more attractive vis-à-vis passenger cars. The World Bank believes that though this is a less well-known
example, it one worth studying and considering by Polish stakeholders, and could position Poland at the
vanguard of urban mobility solutions.




on an Near Field Communication (NFC)-enabled device without relying on access to a secure element. NFC is a set
of communication protocols that enable two electronic devices, one of which is usually a portable device such as a
smartphone, to establish communication by bringing them within 4 cm (2 in) of each other.



                                                                                                               37
Conclusion

116.       Examples from other EU member states have been included in this Report to illustrate past experience
that Poland can learn from. The introduction of an interoperable AFC system is more than a simple IT project,
it is a large scale change project that will impact significantly across all aspects of a PTOs operations. Once this
is understood, it is possible to develop a clear a vision as to what the system must deliver and with the
agreement of all stakeholders, an implementation plan can be put in place.

117.     Positive experiences of implementing smart-ticketing included:
    •    Higher than expected uptake rates, and a more modern, efficient public transport system, leading to
         improved business cases;
     •   Reduction in the level of fraud through direct fare evasion or misuse of the wrong ticket, leading to
         improved business cases and efficiencies;
     •   A chance to reassess existing fare structures, and more efficient management of concessionary fare
         schemes;
     •   Faster ticketing processes for the passenger, who favor the new technologies and find smart-ticketing
         easy to comprehend and use, particularly for those schemes which adopted auto-reload functionality
         (where the user’s balance automatically tops-up when the credit level drops below a pre- specified
         limit);
     •   Seamless travel across modes (urban public transport and rail) and across regions and within or
         between functional urban areas; and
     •   Reduced cost of AFC system through economies of scale.

118.     There are a number of challenges of implementing smart-ticketing interoperability including:

        Dealing with a vast network of PT operators, stakeholders, technology suppliers, funding bodies,
         legislative procedures etc., just to get the smart-ticketing scheme off the ground
        The timeframes required to deliver complex, technological products, particularly when third- party
         suppliers were involved and technological delays pushed back full implementation 
        The financial investment and human resources required from the outset, plus identifying suitable
         funding sources to provide enough capital and ongoing revenue to make the scheme a success 
        Dealing with expectations of the traveler when schemes became part of their everyday life, or when
         other schemes in a region offered different services not available to them
        Integration of a scheme across different modes or multiple PT operators, particularly where transport
         services are not under direct government control
        Initial marketing of smart-ticketing to establish its identity with the passengers, including those who
         would not be regular or familiar users of the system (especially tourists) 
        The publicized security breach of the Mifare encryption meant that schemes using cards of this type
         had to mitigate against any possible security concerns in their own systems



38
119.     To overcome potential barriers, a smart-ticketing scheme requires a strong network of stakeholders,
all with common goals or aspirations to deliver an integrated product from the outset of the project. Good
management is essential in keeping all partners round the discussion table, but quite often a large amount of
time and resource is needed in order to resolve significant disagreements or other issues between partners .

120.     Technology advances in recent years mean that there is a move from delivering automatic fare
collection via card based form factors through bespoke transport solutions towards a more retail based focus
on payments. This is particularly evident in urban environments, whereas in longer distance rail travel there is
a move to use mobile devices with 2D barcode technology, similar to the airline industry.

121.     These new technologies are moving the focus away from buying tickets, to paying for a service. Instead
of a passenger carrying a ticket on a standardized smartcard, as with ITSO or the OV-chipkaart, it is now
possible just to pay for the journey using a bank issued payment card which is used to identify the passenger
to the system, so called Account Based Ticketing (ABT).

122.     The standards as currently developed in places like the UK and the Netherlands need to evolve to cover
this approach, and indeed there are projects underway in both the UK and the Netherlands to investigate the
use of ABT. However, there is still a lot Poland can learn from countries such as the UK and the Netherlands in
their approach to implementing national schemes and the setting up of organizations to create a vision for
national interoperable ticketing, which is currently lacking in Poland. This does not mean that Poland needs to
copy the approach taken by either of these countries, as their solutions were developed at a different point in
time in terms of the existing technologies available.

123.     The scope of these existing standards covered a wide spectrum. There was a need to define the data
formats for the tickets and also the communications between each layer of the system amongst other things.
Migration to mobile platforms has been evident in the finance sector, and through pilots on public transport
over the last 10 years has changed this approach. Now an AFC system can be built up from existing standards
from new technologies such as mobile devices and bank issued payment cards, the data requirements for the
ticketing products can be extracted from current AFC specifications.

124.    Development of interoperable solutions based on the existing systems may be difficult. The most
frequent obstacles in this case include:
         binding contracts with suppliers of systems that make taking actions impossible until the end of
            validity period of the “old” contract,
         high new software development costs,
            limitations of the electronic card as the carrier of tickets,
            lack of knowledge on modern solutions applied in other cities and countries; difficult access to
             consultants and professional papers,
            obstacles of organizational or political nature.
`
Migration Paths to Ticketing Interoperability

125.     Mobile ticket applications. Mobile ticket applications seems to be the simplest path of migration to
ticketing interoperability in Poland, in particular in the situation when public transport organizers issue their
own electronic cards based on different electronic systems. Mobile ticket advantages: (a) redundancy of the
sales network (like in case of the p-tickets) and loading (like in case of the e tickets); ease and speed of creating
new common tickets as well as promotional tickets. Transmission of the m-ticket to mobile devices does not


                                                                                                                  39
require reconciliation of the electronic card map; and (c) ticket in the paper format – possibility of printing the
ticket by the passenger.


126.     The conditions for implementation of such a solution include the following: (a) assuring identification
of the mobile ticket by controlling devices of all the entities participating in the integration. This means the
necessity of equipping each controller device with the QR code scanner and NFC reader; 31 (b) processing data
concerning the identified tickets in all the systems that are to be interoperable, e.g. the urban system and the
railway system; (c) check-in or check-in & check-out required in case of all trips, in particular in case of
changing the mode of transport, e.g. change from the regional railway to the urban bus. Control devices should
be equipped with QR code scanners and NCF readers. If the control devices are positioned outside the public
transport vehicle (e.g. on railway platforms) then it will be necessary to assure data transmission from those
controllers to the control devices in vehicles (the conductors’ team or ticket controllers in urban public
transport).


127.    The market in Poland in which local companies with established position and relatively high turnovers
allowing development as well as new companies entering the market are present is supportive to building such
solutions.
128.      Fare collection based on bank issued proximity pay cards. Building the central transit transaction
system represents a more difficult path. Such a system has recently been initiated in London by Transport for
London. Works are in progress on the system in Budapest and many cities worldwide would like to follow the
same path. The proliferation of proximity pay cards issued by banks as the method of payment for tickets and
at the same time the carrier of the periodic ticket will decrease system operational costs and risks significantly.
At least two companies operate in Poland that have suggested they are ready to develop such systems.


129.        The following recommendations are proposed:

           Establish a technical working group to develop a vision for AFC in Poland. Such an organization should work
            with public transport organizers, operators, and industry to agree on a national vision or roadmap
            for the future with regard to interoperability.

           Support EMV and Smartphone Apps developments for public transport and determine what is achievable over the
            medium-term years. With the development of mobile and financial services technologies happening so
            rapidly, there is a need to ensure that the basic infrastructure is in place to benefit from this evolution.
            By WiFi enabling all stations, or ensuring 4G services are available across the country, the
            opportunities from mobile technologies can be more easily realized, and operational costs could be
            reduced. This is likely to be implementable much more quickly than a national interoperable AFC
            standard.

           Work with major payment card issuers to develop specifications for the use of payment cards using EMV
            based standards on the Polish rail network. Look at developing specifications for mobile devices, as
            well as card based form factors, and potentially incentivize the use of EMV cards in public transport.

           Work with PTAs and PTOs to agree the vision nationally . The organization identified in 1 above, will have to
            work with all stakeholders in Poland to clearly articulate the vision for interoperable Automatic Fare
            Collection and outline what interoperability is required from systems in Poland


31   QR is the square, black and white matrix symbols which are 2 D barcodes that a mobile device can read.
40
       Do not develop own standard, look to existing standards. Current standards cover AFC technologies that have
        been developed since 1997. New systems make use of mobile and finance sector technologies. Poland
        should look to build on existing standards, but incorporate new technologies to capitalize on the
        benefits the new technologies will bring.

There is the potential to build on the new systems, such as those implemented in Świebodzice, and develop an
interoperable standardized system for Poland that builds on the benefits of smart media for passengers and
operators alike. With the development of new technologies there is the potential for Poland to be at the
forefront of developing standards for the next generation of smart ticketing systems that will be implemented.



       Develop migration plan to get to desired final system. There are numerous legacy systems in existence that
        will be fast approaching their end-of-life. A plan would need to be in place to enable these systems to
        be included in any future specification development and migration to a new system.

       Undertake a public transport fare review to maximize benefits from the new system, taking into account benefits for
        passengers. It is often said in this industry that there is little value in taking the existing fare products
        and placing them on a new fare media. If this happens then it becomes very expensive, as the operator
        is not gaining the full benefit of the new technology. For example, in London PAYG has replaced all
        single tickets on the bus, and a significant number of travel cards, because the new technology enabled
        the service to be offered. The fare review would maximize the benefits from introducing a new system,
        both from the perspective of the passengers, and from public transport operators, as it could create
        enhanced opportunities for revenue generation.

Annex 1: Introducing Public Transport AFC Standards
Introduction

In order to implement a standardized, interoperable AFC system in Poland there needs to be a clear vision as
to what the system will achieve. A vision defines an organization’s business and purpose, and communica tes
the desired future state of the organization. The vision provides focus for all the stakeholders on why we are
doing what we are doing and keeps everyone on track toward the future state. The stakeholders could include
all levels of government, public transport authorities (PTAs), public transport operators (urban and rail),
equipment vendors, passengers, payment providers, communications providers, as well as bodies such as the
Chamber of Urban Transport. The vision emerges from three sources: experience, knowledge, and inspiration,
as detailed below:

    1.   Experience
          Organizational – areas where the organization wants to improve, or can see opportunities to
              reduce costs, or increase customer service
          Staff – staff understand the operations of fare collection systems best and are in a position to
              provide input to areas where improvements are necessary
          Global – experience from other schemes where new technologies or processes have been
              introduced that can be replicated
    2.   Knowledge
          Market, business, and trends – as AFC moves away from being transport specific as technologies
              in other sectors are becoming applicable there is a need to keep abreast of technology trends and
              assess their application to the AFC market. The transport business is also changing significantly
              and there is a challenge to deliver with fewer resources, so managing their use efficiently is
              paramount. There are trends appearing in the mobile and payments markets that are transitioning
              into transport, with NFC and contactless payments being most obvious. However, there is
              increasing use of apps for journey planning and delivery of 2-D barcode tickets in public transport,
              similar to the airline sector. These trends will have significant impact on public transport in the
              longer term. PTOs need to embrace some of these changes as it can reduce barriers to using public
              transport if payment for services is easier.
          Resources and skills – AFC projects are major change projects for any organization. They can
              bring together several industries, mobile, payments, transport, IT, finance in order to deliver
              systems. Having access to resources to help co-ordinate these organizations to enable each party
              to understand what is required, and the needs and limitations of other sectors.
    3.   Inspiration—pulling current facts into the future. AFC systems are not cheap, so there is a need to
         understand the long term, 5-10 year, changes to technology that may impact on the AFC system. The
         vision should take these into account.

There are six key attributes that can contribute to the long term success of a vision:

        Realistic—can all stakeholders see the “end zone”?
        Simple—can the vision be easily understood and remembered?
        Sustainable—does it have a shelf life?
        Straightforward / doable—does it have credibility?
        Organisationally linked—does it fit with the organisation’s mission and vision umbrellas?
         Compelling—does it cause all stakeholders to feel good about the future?

Using the above process, it should be possible to develop a clear vision for AFC in Poland. The figure below
shows the output when the process was applied to TfL as they developed their vision for Oyster over 14 years
ago.

Specification Development

Several countries and cities have gone about this in different ways. Some have developed a specification and
then implemented it, as in the UK, German, and Korea. Alternatively, a system can be implemented which then
becomes the standard, as was the case in the Netherlands, and is being implemented in Colombia. Each
approach has its strengths and weaknesses. However, there is no approach that suits all situations, so each
country should determine what suits its vision and approach the best.

Regardless of the approach adopted there needs to be a level of interoperability incorporated in the
specification to allow the benefits of cross region or countrywide coverage to be implemented as determined
by the relevant authority. For example, in Germany and the UK there are stringent testing and certification
processes necessary for each vendor who wants to sell equipment into the national AFC markets. These tests
are undertaken with respect to a published specification produced by Verband Deutscher Verkehrsunternehmen
(VDV; Association of German Transport Companies) and ITSO respectively.

In the Netherlands the approach is the same in that equipment is certified against a specification that was
developed by the initial contractor, Thales. However, in the early stages it was noticed that when third party
vendors attempted to build equipment based on the published specification it was found that they would not
work in the field. This was because the published specification did not reflect the system in situ. This has since
been resolved and the specification reflects exactly what has been implemented and so PTOs can be confident
that equipment built against the specification will work as required.

An important question to ask is what specification should Poland use or should it develop its own specification.
The answer to this is it depends. At first reading that might not seem a very helpful answer, so further
explanation is necessary. Looking at the results from a SWOT analysis below will clarify this.
                            Figure 14: New National Standard versus Existing Standard

The way public transport is provided in each country, region or city varies across Europe and the world. There
are some countries where transport is controlled by central, regional and city governments. There are also
different approaches to the regulation of PTOs, with private, public and franchising models all existing, in some
cases, within the same country leading to regulated and deregulated environments.

Alongside this political environment there will be, as in Poland, multiple schemes that already exist which are
incompatible. This rainbow of political and technical environments means that picking any one standard that
can address all of the local issues or fully meet the defined vision will be, arguably impossible. However, each
of the major standards has identified a range of functionality that is necessary for interoperability of AFC
systems which can be said to be generic to all schemes. It would seem sensible to incorporate this functionality,
but look to add additional, local functionality as necessary to meet national requirements and political
environment.

The idea that Poland can develop its own specification should not be considered on grounds of cost, as it will
be expensive, estimates are that the ITSO standard in the UK has cost several tens of millions pounds sterling
over the last 15 years and there is no national interoperable system in place yet. There is also the need for a
test and certification process that needs to be administered and delivered. Individual vendors will have to
design completely new devices to meet the new standard, with only a limited market, unless other countries
can be encouraged to adopt the Polish standard. Given that VDV has only recently managed to provide a system
to Luxemburg, and ITSO has not managed to encourage any external countries to adopt its specification, means
Poland is also likely to struggle. Calypso has been the most successful, as it was initiated via a European funded
project comprising multiple cities from several EU countries, who adopted the system. 32 But the Calypso
specification only relates to the card reader interface and not the complete system as the ITSO and VdV
specifications do. For this reason, it is important that the vision is developed and is accepted by all stakeholders,
then the appropriate specification can be developed.

With the trend towards account based ticketing there is a significant simplification of the requirements for
contactless readers, as a token is presented that identifies the user as having travel rights. The details are
worked out in the back office. In this case there is only a need for the system to recognize different ID tokens,
which can range from proprietary cards such as Oyster, CPC or bank payment cards, or PIV cards as used in
Washington DC. In this case standardization of data for AFC systems becomes unnecessary as only the token
data is transferred.

32Calypso is an international electronic ticketing standard for microprocessor contactless smartcards, originally designed
by a group of European transit operators from Belgium, Germany, France, Italy and Portugal. It ensures multi-sources of
compatible products, and allows for interoperability between several transport operators in the same area.
Additionally, with improvements in the 3G/4G mobile network it is possible to locate passengers better and so
mobile devices can be used to locate passengers, making passengers need to physically check in and out
through a gate unnecessary. With the rollout of 5G in the next 5-10 years this becomes more of a reality. What
this means is as technology advances the need for specific AFC standardization decreases to some extent.
However, a debate rages within the industry over the difference between ticketing and payment systems. This
Report is not the place to discuss the details of this, but as identification technologies start to take hold there
becomes less need for physical ticketing with everything being held in the back office, and the future
standardization landscape changes significantly.



Gap Analysis of Current and Existing Systems

As stated earlier in the Report, there are numerous systems in existence in Poland which are proprietary and
have no interoperability. In order to unify these systems, it will be necessary to review their functionality.
Where there is a decision, as in the Dutch and Colombian situations, to build upon an existing specification, it
will be necessary to analyze the specification to remove any proprietary aspects so third parties can build
equipment that meets the specification. More importantly, for reasons stated earlier, it is necessary to
determine that the specification reflects the reality of the installed equipment. For the approach where a new
specification is being developed there will be a need to analyze how the current installed system deviates from
this specification. The output from either of these streams should be the same in that there will be a key list of
issues that need to be addressed and system changes necessary to meet the new requirements.


Migration Plan

Based on the output of the gap analysis a migration plan can be drawn that highlights the key issues that need
to be overcome in order to migrate the existing schemes to the new vision for AFC in Poland. As part of the
migration plan there will be a rollout plan. Experience has shown that there are multiple ways to roll out AFC
systems, but what is common with all of them is the clear need for leadership. In particular resolution of issues
that cause delay will tax the leadership of AFC rollouts. There are four different models that can be considered
when rolling out an AFC system, based on different institutions taking the lead. These are:

        Public Transport Authorities led. In Sweden the PTAs are working to implement an e-ticketing system,
         however, each PTA has its own system currently in operation and is claiming that the standard should
         be based on their system. This has led to deadlock for the last 8 years and will need legislation at a
         national level to break the deadlock.

        Public Transport Operator led. In the Netherland e-ticketing was started by the PTOs, but with the Dutch
         Passenger Transport Act of 2000 introducing PTAs the latter have had a significant influence in the
         development of e-ticketing.33 This approach is to the advantage of the PTOs who developed the system
         to meet their needs. In situations like this it is usually the largest PTO who determines the
         requirements for the system. If there is no buy in from all parties then progress will be slow, as was
         the experience in Austria.




33The act introduced PTAs for the first time which altered the organization of public transport in the Netherlands and
influenced the development of the e-ticketing solution.
       Regional government led. German approach, with all large transport related decisions made by the Länder
        (regional states) who adopted a regional implementation strategy of a specification agreed by the
        association of PTOs, the VdV. Public funding was not made available to cities that wanted to adopt non-
        standard e-ticketing systems. Economies of scale also enabled the cost of implementation to be
        reduced as procurement was centralized, so smaller cities benefited from the larger volumes
        purchased.

       National government. In the UK the Department for Transport (DfT) has been taking the lead for the last
        15 years in the development of the ITSO specification. Outside of London the deregulated PTOs were
        encouraged to implement ITSO, but they could not make a positive business case and so to date
        progress has been slow. However, the major bus operators have implemented ITSO, thanks to financial
        support from the DfT, and the rail network is currently mandated to implement ITSO through the new
        Franchise Agreements that are currently out for tender. The expectation is that by 2025 the entire UK
        rail network will be ITSO enabled, 25 years after the specification was developed.

It is clear from the models and examples described above that regardless of who leads there is a need for the
national government to break the deadlock in some cases to make sure that implementation occurs. In Poland
it is not clear who could lead the implementation of an AFC system. For it to succeed this needs to be clear from
the outset.



Organizational Issues

As the interoperability model shows, the first step toward creating an interoperable smartcard payment system
is to identify the institutional requirements of the participants. Fare payment interoperability, regardless of
technology used (e.g., smartcard, paper-based, or magnetic stripe) requires significant planning and
cooperation among the participating agencies. In the public transport sector, PTAs have traditionally operated
autonomously. Each agency’s organizational cultures, policies, procedures, and fare -collection equipment are
different. Transit agencies considering implementing an interoperable smartcard fare payment system must
address numerous institutional and technological issues that may create barriers to implementation. The
institutional issues can be categorized as follows:

       Management and Organizational Issues—Organizational cultures of the participating agencies and their
        effects on management decision-making processes; 
       Financial Management Issues—The need to ensure that each participant does not lose revenue through
        participation; 
       Equipment Design Issues—Ensuring equipment interoperability as an aspect of system design; and 
       Public Transport Industry Issues—Dealing with the behavior of traditional system suppliers. 

Management and Organizational Issues

One of the most significant challenges to interoperable smartcard fare payment systems implementation is how
the existing organizational cultures affect the participating organizations. Creating an interoperable fare
payment system requires participating organizations to work together. Organizations that may have had limited
or no previous interaction must work closely with one another for program direction and control. Key management
and organizational issues that need to be addressed on the road to interoperability include:  

       Establishing a governing body or project sponsor;
        Identifying and mitigating operational differences; 
        Establishing a framework for program funding; 
        Creating a rollout schedule; and 
        Developing a contracting strategy. 
         
Establishing a governing body or project sponsor. One of the primary challenges of implementing an interoperable
fare payment system in a multi-operator environment is encouraging organizations to work together for the
overall good of the region and passengers. One of the first steps in implementing any regional fare payment
system is to establish a governance structure, which will identify the institutional oversight structure and
define the following:  

        Items under regional control;
        Documentation of the governing structure; and 
        Participant representation. 

The governing body oversees the common elements of the interoperable fare payment system, which may
include third-party services. Table 4 lists the different types of governing bodies. Participation in a governing
body may require an organization to cede complete control over the common elements of the interoperable
system. Even agencies that have an excellent working relationship may find adapting to a common governing
body challenging.

The planning and implementation of a smartcard-based interoperable fare payment project is a long and often
difficult process. Once the governing body is established, a project sponsor needs to emerge to direct the effort
and provide leadership for the participants. It is critical that the full commitment and support of the member
agencies are obtained and that a clear management structure is in place before starting planning and design.

Identifying and mitigating operational differences. Another challenge PTOs face during the implementation of an
interoperable fare payment system is the differences in the way the participating PTOs conduct business. For
example, many of the largest organizations have extensive internal capabilities, including technical and
operational resources to support most, if not all of their design, operational, and maintenance needs. The trend
to consider outsourcing to fulfill these same needs is increasing. Organizations that have extensive in-house
resources tend to prioritize more control over their operations; thus, those organizations tend to avoid
outsourcing. The different organizational operations philosophies of the agencies must be examined, and
compromises must be reached. There are two primary dimensions for implementing the system-related service
functions of an interoperable system: (a) centralized, where one entity performs all the functions; and (b)
decentralized, where each participating entity is responsible for performing its own functions according to
established business rules. The project sponsor must decide between a centralized or decentralized approach
and must also decide whether the services are delivered using in-house or outsourced resources. The
operational philosophies of the participating organizations will determine the approach used for performing
card-system-related functions.  

Establishing a framework for program funding. Interoperable fare payment systems require a substantial capital
investment for equipment and systems. Funding for a project of this magnitude will likely come from multiple
sources because of multiple organizations’ participation. The challenge with multi-jurisdictional funding is to
arrive at an equitable formula that each of the participating agencies can endorse. Project funding requirements
need to be determined early in the project life cycle to provide adequate time to meet the requirements for
securing the funding. Member agencies also need to evaluate the benefits derived from the capital investment.
The cost-benefit analysis helps to identify expensive features that do not create value. However, regional
systems need to be sufficiently flexible to scale as the participating agencies needs change and grow more
sophisticated.

Development of the business case is critical in defining the funding strategy. The business case identifies the
estimated capital and operating costs for the project and possible future expansion of the system. At a
minimum, the business case consists of the following parts:

       Estimated capital cost of the system;  
       Existing operating costs;  
       Operating and maintenance costs after system implementation;  
       Schedule for implementation;  
       Risk factors;  
       Initial operational cost (start of revenue service); and  
       Regional/management/lead agency oversight, administration, and management.  

Identifying specific funding sources for the interoperable fare payment project starts when the preparation of
a business case is completed. The completion of the business case provides the basis for determining the
relationship of capital investment balanced against long-term operating costs. Once the specific sources of
funding have been identified, funding agreements between the participating organizations need to be created.
The inter-agency funding agreement establishes the level of capital investment and operating funding for which
each participating organization is responsible. A commonly used strategy for allocating costs is to have each
PTO responsible for the deployment of its respective interoperable system components and to share operating
costs based on use of the shared system components.  

Creating a rollout schedule. An overall project rollout schedule must be developed that details milestones for
design, equipment production, testing, and implementation of the interoperable fare payment system across
the participants. The rollout schedule is a critical component of operating cost. Because transaction processing
and shared service, such as operating a call center, is a transaction-based business, the higher the volume, the
lower the cost per transaction or call, respectively. The guiding principles to consider when developing the
rollout schedule include:
       Realistic milestones reflective of actual experience,  
       Ability to fit within contractors’ capabilities,  
       Ability to be supported by the participating agencies,  
       Customer reaction and acceptance to change, and  
       Schedule changes in response to changing customer needs.  


System rollout can follow one of two approaches:

       Phased. Different PTOs and functionalities are brought online at different times. This approach is the
        most common because the disruption caused by passengers having to learn a new behavior is isolated
        to a specific area and thus is less resource-intensive to manage. This approach was adopted in the
        Netherlands where a single rail line near Rotterdam was implemented first and then other modes and
        areas brought online  

       Full rollout. All PTOs and equipment are brought online at the same time. This approach requires
        extensive testing and careful preparation to successfully launch. In addition, significant resources are
        required to manage the first days of operation. There are limited examples of this approach, due to its
        high risk.

The phased approach is typically adopted when procurement is split among multiple supplier contracts. Risks
associated with a phased approach include the possibility for passenger confusion when the system works for
limited PTOs or has limited capabilities. Additionally, a phased approach needs to consider PTOs that share
existing fare products such as a period pass. The rollout of these PTOs will need to occur simultaneously to
avoid affecting passengers who use the common fare product. Although it is more passenger friendly, a full
system rollout is more likely to disrupt operation for the PTOs. Project resources must be spread over a wider
range and are less able to focus on those areas that may experience issues such as high degrees of confusion
and lack of patron education. Additionally, unlike a phased approach, a full rollout does not afford the benefit
of lessons learned from the earlier implementations.

Other issues that will affect the scheduling of the interoperable project include the (a) availability of staffing
resources; (b) availability of financial resources; (c) PTO operations; and (d) passenger education and
orientation.  

Developing a contracting strategy. Participating PTOs need to determine and agree on how the equipment and
services will be procured. The main contracting challenge is deciding whether to procure the equipment and
services under a single contract or through multiple contracts. Each approach has challenges that must be
overcome, and the selection of the approach will depend on factors such as an organizations appetite for
integration risk, the availability of technical and project management resources, and the level of equipment and
services to be procured. The most common contracting strategies are single procurement and contract,
multiple procurements and contracts, and contract type selection.

Financial management issues. Financial integrity is the highest priority for any agency participating in an
interoperable fare payment system. This section discusses the key financial management decisions and issues
that must be addressed, including (a) transaction clearing and settlement; (b) funds pool management; and (c)
financial exposure risk associated with advanced features. In a fare payment program where multiple
operators are selling fare value accepted by more than one operator, transaction clearing and settlement allows
each organization to be reimbursed for the services provided, regardless of where the fare product is
purchased. Again, the challenge is obtaining agreement from all participating organizations on an approach to
transaction clearing and settlement.

130.    The funds pool is created as a result of revenue collected (card loads) but not yet used in the system.
The funds pool may be in a central account managed on behalf of the participants or it may be a “virtual” funds
pool where each organization holds its own share of the total amount. Examples of how the money within the
funds pool can be used are:
     Periodic movement of funds between member organizations to compensate for fare payments,
        purchases, or loads by one participant’s cardholders on another participant’s system; 
     Periodic payment of transit services used by cardholders; and 
     Coverage of charge-backs for transactions that should not have been posted. 

Revenue is generated by investing the funds pool float —interest earned on unallocated funds—contained
within the funds pool.

Industry impact. One of the primary challenges posed by existing equipment designs is to find a way to procure
interoperable equipment from multiple vendors in a competitive manner. The goal is to build a fare payment
system that conforms to open standards or specifications, uses existing infrastructure, offers flexibility to scale,
and adds functionality as needs develop. Thus, open standards and specifications will enable the participating
agencies to add equipment and functionality competitively and use the open platform to establish new
opportunities for partnerships with non- transit applications. A secondary challenge for the member agencies
is to determine the degree to which legacy systems are either upgraded and integrated into the new
interoperable fare payment system or replaced with new equipment. The cost to replace may be less than the
cost of upgrading and integrating legacy systems. The age of legacy systems and their incumbent technology
are key factors in the cost of upgrades. Each organizations’ legacy equipment will need to be reviewed to
determine whether it can be upgraded to the new technology and industry standards of the interoperable
system.
