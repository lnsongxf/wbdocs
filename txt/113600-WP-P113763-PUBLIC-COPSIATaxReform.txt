Executive Summary

Colombia is the 7th most unequal country in the world, with a Gini coefficient similar to
that of Haiti, South Africa, and Angola.1 Within the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC)
region—traditionally the most unequal in the world—Colombia ranks third.2 Furthermore, while
most countries in the region experienced a decrease in inequality over the past two decades,
Colombia’s inequality levels remained largely unchanged.

Colombia has had little success in decreasing inequality through fiscal policy. While many
LAC countries have passed progressive fiscal reforms and implemented conditional cash transfer
programs, Colombia has lagged behind. Fiscal policy, in particular, remains an underutilized
inequality-reducing tool in Colombia. To illustrate, consider that Brazil and Colombia have
similar Gini index levels for market income (pre-tax income from wages and capital), yet when
we take into account taxation and direct transfers, Colombia’s Gini coefficient is 0.028 higher
than Brazil’s.

In December 2012, the Government of Colombia (GoC) passed a set of tax reforms
designed to improve the impact of fiscal policy on inequality and poverty reduction. Among
the key reforms is a new income tax system known as IMAN, which is intended to shift the
income tax burden by increasing the tax levied on the top 0.6 percent of the population while
providing partial tax relief to the rest of the population. The IMAN was conceived as a fiscal
mechanism to significantly improve the distribution of wealth within the country. Similarly, the
CREE corporate tax on capital-intensive industries was introduced with the parallel goals of
improving wealth distribution and encouraging job growth. Another key component of the 2012
tax reform is the simplification and streamlining of the VAT system. In particular, by creating
more exemptions and decreasing the administrative costs associated with the tax —in addition to
introducing a luxury tax component—the objective is to make the VAT less regressive.

With the 2012 tax reform, the GoC sought to improve the impact of fiscal policy without
decreasing government revenues. More specifically, the GoC’s goal was to keep the tax reform
revenue neutral while lowering the income tax rate of 99.4 percent of the population. The
rationale was that by increasing the income tax rate on the top 0.6 percent of the population as
well as increasing corporate taxes and introducing a luxury tax, the net reduction in fiscal
revenues resulting from the broader decrease in income tax rates would be minimized.
Additionally, reducing the administrative costs of the VAT implementation would further boost
net revenues.

inequality, government revenues, and the labor market was conducted by the World Bank.
This report summarizes the results of the PSIA and explains the three analyses used to determine
the impact of the tax reform. The first analysis integrates data from administrative tax records
with household statistics from the Gran Encuesta Integrada de Hogares (GEIH) conducted by
the Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadística (DANE) to correct for the problem of
underrepresentation of high-income households that is typical of household surveys. The second
analysis, which is based on consumption data from the Encuesta de Calidad de Vida (ENCV)
also conducted by DANE, follows the LATAX micro-simulation technique and focuses on the
effect of taxes on income distribution and on government revenues on the assumption that
individuals’ purchasing habits remain the same. The third analysis uses a general equilibrium
model of the labor market to estimate the impact of the tax reforms on the labor market and, in
particular, on informality.

The first analysis shows that the effects of Colombia’s income tax reform serve the
intended purpose of reducing income inequality. Results based on the constructed full income
distribution, which uses administrative tax records and household survey data, indicate that the
Gini coefficient decreases from 0.586 to 0.579. Considering that the average yearly reduction of
the Gini coefficient in Latin America over the last 10 years was 0.51 percentage points, the
estimated reduction in Colombia’s Gini coefficient is not trivial. These results also demonstrate
the importance of using the full income distribution to calculate true inequality in a country.

At the national level, changes to the VAT code are expected to have only a modest impact
on inequality and tax revenues, and practically no impact in terms of their incidence.
Assuming no tax evasion, the approved changes to the VAT code are expected to be marginally
regressive. However, if we assume some tax evasion, the approved changes to the VAT code are
expected to be progressive in rural areas and marginally regressive in urban areas, with an
overall progressive effect at the national level.

Finally, the analysis of the impact of the 2012 tax reform on the labor market shows that
achieving the goal of job creation is likely. The decrease in other labor taxes will contribute to
the main objective of job creation and the overall level of employment is anticipated to rise as a
result of the tax reform.

1      Introduction


In 2013, the World Bank granted a $600 million Development Policy Loan (DPL) to the
Republic of Colombia. This operation aims to enhance Colombia’s fiscal capacity and promote
shared prosperity by focusing on six strategic policy areas: (1) devising a more equitable tax
policy and administration; (2) promoting inter-regional equity and broadening local revenue
sources; (3) implementing a more equitable social spending system; (4) fostering gender
equality; (5) providing open access to national financial management and information systems;
and (6) monitoring poverty and other social indicators. The evaluation of Colombia’s 2012 fiscal
reform (the present PSIA) was stipulated in the DPL agreement between the World Bank and the
GoC. This report summarizes the findings of the analysis and provides an assessment of the
distributive impact of Colombia’s 2012 tax reform.

Aligned with the World Bank’s Colombia CPS FY12–16 (Report No. 60620-CO, discussed
by the Board of Executive Directors on July 21, 2011), the DPL is specifically focused on
inclusive growth and enhanced productivity (strategic theme #3) and seeks to advance
toward the stated long-term goal of “improved public sector management and equity and
efficiency of economic policies.” The objective of the DPL is to support the GoC in improving
fiscal, territorial, and gender equity through specific actions in targeted policy areas while
enhancing access to information and accountability in public spending. This is consistent with
the three pillars of the GoC’s National Development Plan: (1) sustainable growth and
competitiveness, (2) equality of opportunities for social prosperity, and (3) consolidation of
peace.

This report is intended for use by policy analysts interested in fiscal policy and, in
particular, tax reforms. The report relies on three different methodologies to study the potential
impacts of the recent tax reforms in Colombia, allowing for an evaluation of the robustness of
the results as well as an examination of the variation in results due to methodological and
measurement issues. The potential impacts considered in the analyses include the reforms’
effects on income inequality, poverty, employment, and revenue collection.

The first analysis integrates data from tax records with household survey data, ensuring
that those segments of society that may not be captured in household surveys are included
in the assessment. This is particularly important given that the right end of the income
distribution, or the wealthiest segment of society, is not accurately represented in household
surveys. Thus, capturing this segment of the population allows for a more complete analysis of
the effects of Colombia’s 2012 tax reform on government revenues and inequality.

The second analysis examines the likely behavioral impacts of the tax reform. Using
LATAX micro-simulations, the methodology applied in this analysis allows us to examine the

                                                1
distributive impact of the recent tax reforms. Moreover, the micro-simulation also allows for an
assessment of the reforms’ potential effects on government revenues.

The third analysis focuses on the impact of the 2012 tax reform on the labor market. While
the changes in Colombia’s taxation system will have a direct bearing on government revenues
and the distribution of wealth, it is important to note that the 2012 tax reform could also have
substantial spillover effects on the labor market. By modeling the preferences of workers
utilizing a general equilibrium framework, this analysis seeks to capture some of the likely
spillover effects.

The present PSIA report is organized into five sections. Following the introduction, section 2
provides an overview of the political economy environment that ultimately led to Colombia’s
2012 tax reform. Section 3 describes the methodologies applied in the analysis of the tax
reform’s distributive impact. Section 4 presents the main findings, and the final section
concludes with a summary analysis and brief assessment of possible areas for further research.




2         Colombia’s Political Economy Context


Colombia’s strong economic performance and resilience to global shocks in recent years
can be attributed to a favorable external environment combined with sound policy
management. Relatively low trade openness and limited inclusion in global financial markets
insulated Colombia from the recent international economic crisis. At the same time, the
country’s strong macroeconomic framework, coupled with a robust financial sector and
appropriate regulatory responses, created an additional cushion against external shocks and
paved the way for economic expansion. Benefiting from high commodity prices, the economy
recovered from the 2008–09 global economic crisis after only two quarters, much faster than the
regional average of six quarters.3

Although growth slowed from 6.6 percent in 2011 to 4.0 percent in 2012, it remained
relatively strong—above the regional average of 3.6 percent and close to the global
emerging markets rate of 5.5 percent.4 The 2012 economic deceleration was the combined
result of weak external demand (lower commodity prices), unforeseen supply shocks (disruptions
in coal production), slow execution of public investment, and a drop in manufacturing and retail
sales.

The Central Bank has maintained a loose monetary policy in response to lower-than-
potential GDP. Since August 2012, the interest rate has been reduced by 200 basis points,
reaching 3.25 percent in April 2013. This process followed a period of tightened monetary policy
during which the interest rate was gradually raised (by 225 basis points since early 2011) to
reduce the risk of overheating. Inflation reached the lower bound of the target band (2 percent) in
May 2013, increasing slightly to 2.2 percent the following month.

In 2012, Colombia exhibited a strong fiscal performance, due in part to the increased tax
revenues generated by recent (pre-2012) tax reforms and favorable oil prices. The combined
public sector deficit dropped from −2 percent in 2011 to 0.3 percent in 2012, while the primary
balance increased from 0.8 to 2.9 percent of GDP in the same period. This, in turn, contributed to
a decline in the public debt ratio from 36.0 to 32.7 percent of GDP.5 The main driver was a
strong increase in the central Government’s tax-to-GDP ratio, which rose by one percentage
point, reaching 14.5 percent in 2012.6

The boom in imports and exports that took place at the end of 2011 widened the current
account deficit, but the balance of payments, backed by net FDI inflows, remained strong
as of the end of 2012. The strong demand for investment-related imports and large profit
repatriation by foreign firms was more than offset by net foreign direct investment (FDI)
inflows, keeping the current external account slightly above 2011 levels. Gross FDI flows—most
of which originated in the oil and mining sector—increased by more than 10 percent in 2012, to
US$15 billion (4 percent of GDP), and will probably sustain Colombia’s 0.8 percent share of
global FDI.

The Colombian peso’s appreciation cycle seems to have halted, with nominal values
currently approaching early 2012 levels. While in recent years the Colombian peso (the
nominal as well as the real effective rate) has grown gradually stronger in response to significant
capital inflows (primarily FDI) and increases in government spending, amidst high volatility the
peso depreciated to an average of 1,907 Colombian pesos (COP) per US dollar by June 2013—
about the same as in early 2012. The nominal depreciation has been partially driven by lower
interest rates and continued currency purchases by the Central Bank. At the same time, the
flexible exchange rate has exhibited substantial volatility, acting as a shock absorber in times of
global economic crises and uncertainty.

In sum, Colombia’s economic performance remains robust amid an uncertain external
environment. Given the softer external demand, sound policies have supported positive
outcomes. Fiscal consolidation reduced the sovereign risk premium, strengthened the economy’s
resilience to external shocks, and enhanced the countercyclical power of fiscal and monetary
policy. Colombia currently has one of the lowest Emerging Market Bond Index (EMBI) spreads

in the region. The country also exhibits solid liquidity management, as evidenced by rapid
reserve accumulation, and has tapped international markets for external financing at favorable
terms.

2.1     Poverty and Inequality in Colombia

During the last decade, economic growth in Colombia has been accompanied by a decline
in poverty. Between 2002 and 2012, moderate poverty fell from 49.4 to 32.7 percent, while
extreme poverty declined from 17.6 to 10.4 percent. Even so, given the country’s economic
performance, the rate of poverty reduction in Colombia between 2003 and 2011 was relatively
moderate—it was lower than that achieved by regional peers like Brazil, Costa Rica, and
Mexico, yet higher than that of other LAC countries such as the Dominican Republic, Panama,
Paraguay, and Peru. The relatively high level of poverty accompanied by relatively high per
capita income7 is partly explained by Colombia’s unequal distribution of income.

Between 2005 and 2010, the primary driver of poverty reduction in Colombia was
economic growth, with a relatively lower contribution from government redistribution. By
contrast, in the LAC region as a whole, over the same period falling inequality was responsible
for about 40 percent of poverty reduction, on average.8 For Colombia, this trend only surfaced
after the reduction in inequality that took place between 2010 and 2012.

Colombia’s less well-off population has benefited more from growth than the average
person. From 2010 to 2011, real income per capita of the bottom 40 percent —the World Bank’s
indicator of shared prosperity—grew at 8.1 percent, while the mean growth rate of per capita
income for the population as a whole was 3.3 percent. Moreover, from 2003 to 2011 the annual
income growth rate of the bottom 40 percent of Colombia’s population was 5.1 percent, higher
than the LAC regional average of 4.8 percent.

Relative to its LAC peers, Colombia is also performing well in terms of convergence to the
global top performers in Amartya Sen’s welfare index, a measure of a society’s overall
welfare. This indicator of convergence, also known as the Shared Prosperity Convergence Index
(SPCI),9 shows that in the past year, while LAC as a region has performed below par, Colombia
converged at a much faster rate (a 7.3 percent improvement on the index compared to LAC’s
average of 4.3 percent).10 Colombia’s faster pace of convergence can be attributed to higher rates
of economic growth and a recent reduction in income inequality.

Similar to the LAC experience, poverty reduction in Colombia was driven primarily by

  Sen’s welfare index is calculated as the product of GDP per capita and the difference between 1 and the country’s
Gini coefficient. The Shared Prosperity Convergence Index (SPCI) is a country’s gap with respect to the top ten
performers in Sen’s welfare index in the year 2000.

increases in labor income and a greater participation of household members in the labor
market. The increase in labor income explains approximately 50 percent of changes in poverty,
with females’ higher earnings responsible for 30 (28) percent and males’ higher earnings for 51
(51) percent of the decline in moderate (extreme) poverty, whereas the share of occupied
household members explains about 32 and 28 percent of the variation in moderate and extreme
poverty, respectively.11 In other words, nearly 80 percent of the poverty decrease is due to
changes in labor market income and participation.

The expansion of well-targeted public transfers was effective in terms of reducing poverty
in Colombia. The change in moderate and extreme poverty was −28 and −19 percent,
respectively, more so than the associated change experienced in LAC, which was −23 and −13
percent, respectively.12 These patterns suggest that the expansion of safety nets that took place
over the past decade was both well targeted and effective in terms of reducing poverty, and in
particular extreme poverty.

Despite robust economic growth and decreasing poverty rates, Colombia remains the 7th
most unequal country in the world, with a rate of inequality similar to that of Haiti, South
Africa, and Angola, and 2nd when compared to regional and upper-middle income
countries. Over the course of the 1990s and 2000s, Colombia did not experience the same level
of inequality reduction as its LAC neighbors, falling significantly short. Such high levels of
inequality can hinder economic growth and poverty reduction (growth elasticity of poverty). To
illustrate, consider that despite strong growth during the past decade, the share of total income
belonging to the lowest decile in Colombia continues to be around 1 percent of total income,
while well over 40 percent of total income is controlled by the top decile. The persistently high
level of income inequality observed in Colombia is linked to pronounced labor income
inequality. The latter is explained by high intra- and inter-generational mobility and the fact that
the poor suffer a disproportionally negative impact from the prevailing labor market constraints
and arrangements.

To address the country’s high inequality levels, the GoC announced a new national
development plan called Prosperidad para Todos.13 This plan calls not just for sustainable
economic growth, but for growth conducive to positive distributional and social effects
throughout Colombian society. This objective falls in line with the World Bank’s twin goals of
achieving economic growth among the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution, or shared
prosperity, and the eradication of absolute poverty by the year 2030.

One of the principal objectives of Prosperidad para Todos is to make fiscal policy more
progressive—Colombia’s fiscal policy compares unfavorably to that of other LAC

countries in terms of its impact on wealth redistribution. Prior to the 2012 tax reform, fiscal
policy was a largely untapped tool in Colombia for attaining a more equitable income
distribution. For instance, Brazil, which had approximately the same level of inequality as
Colombia (measured by the Gini index) before taxes and transfers in 2010, registered much
lower inequality in the same year based on final income (Figure 1). In an effort to address the
issue, the GoC passed a set of laws in December 2012 aimed at making the country’s tax code
more progressive and pro-poor.

which unlike the other income definitions in CEQ are based on a non-cash transfer.



Using the Commitment to Equity (CEQ) framework, Lustig et al. find that Colombia’s
2012 tax reform will result in a marginal decline in income inequality.14 In particular, their
analysis shows that the tax reforms will lead to a decrease in the nation’s Gini coefficient from
0.574 to 0.567. However, this result likely underestimates the impact of the tax reforms on

inequality reduction given its reliance on household survey data, which does not fully capture the
high end of the income distribution.15

Although better economic conditions and demographics have increased labor market
participation by more than half a million people, Colombia’s unemployment rate—10.4
percent in 2012—is still one of the highest in the region.16 With such a high unemployment
rate, the Colombian labor markets continue to be characterized by pervasive labor informality.
Depending on the definition used, 50 to 60 percent of the labor force is engaged in informal
employment.17 For the extremely poor, income-generating opportunities are very limited, and the
unemployment rate of this segment of the population is close to 35 percent. When the extremely
poor are able to work, their jobs tend to be in the low-productivity informal sector and they face
a low probability of moving into better jobs.18 High minimum wages and labor costs,
misperceptions about social security benefits, skill mismatches between labor supply and
demand, and weak labor intermediation systems help explain these poor labor market outcomes
in Colombia.19

2.2     Value Added Tax and the New Alternative Income Tax

Colombia’s December 2012 tax reform focused on changing the distributional impact of
both direct and indirect taxes. This reform introduced four key changes in Colombia’s tax
code: (1) a modification of the income tax; (2) the creation of a new corporate tax; (3) the
simplification of the value added tax (VAT); and (4) the introduction of a luxury tax. These four
changes seek to enhance the progressive nature of the government’s current fiscal policy, with
the aim of rendering the distribution of wealth in Colombia more equitable while maintaining the
same level of government revenues.

The new alternative income tax, Impuesto Mínimo Alternativo Nacional (IMAN), increases
income tax rates for the top 0.6 percent of earners while simultaneously lowering the rate
for the remaining 99.4 percent of the population. Prior to the 2012 tax reform, the population
was divided into four different tax brackets based on income level (see Table 1). For instance,
individuals with annual incomes above 1,090 and below 1,700 UVT (Unidad de Valor
Tributario) paid the surplus between the rent and 1,090 UVT.20 The IMAN creates more tax
brackets to make the direct tax system more progressive (see Annex 1). Additionally, the tax
reform reduces payroll taxes to alleviate the tax burden on the labor sector and provide

   The wealthier segments of the population are often underrepresented in household surveys due to underreporting,
missing responses, or sampling reasons; hence, this analysis does not accurately capture the increase in income taxes
for the top 0.6 percent of the income distribution (IMAN). See also Santa María et al. 2009.

Some differences existed between the proposed and the approved tax reform, especially
with regard to the treatment of high incomes. In Colombia, there are 4.6 million income tax
payers, of which 1.1 million file their taxes through a tax declaration while the others do it
through tax withholdings. According to the Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales
(DIAN), prior to the reform, the people at the high end of the income distribution paid an
effective tax rate of about 5 percent. The IMAN proposal considered a gradual tax rate from 0
percent for annual incomes below 1,200 UVT to 15 percent for incomes above 12,217 UVT.
However, the approved tax reform set the tax rate from 0 percent for annual incomes under 1,548
UVT up to 27 percent for incomes higher than 13,643 UVT. Further details about the gradual tax
rates can be found in Annex 1.

The IMAN uses a revised definition of “employee” in order to allow the self-employed to
present a declaration. Prior to the reform, only wage-earners were considered employees
(through their employment contract). In addition to professionals with employment contracts, the
tax reform (Law 1607, 2012) makes eligible those whose labor income accounts for at least 80
percent of their total income.

In order to expand the redistributive effects of Colombia’s tax reform, the VAT was
restructured and a luxury tax was introduced. The reform streamlined the VAT with the aim
of decreasing the administrative and compliance costs associated with this tax. The VAT
restructuring and the new luxury tax were designed to boost the redistributive impact of
Colombia’s tax policies while simultaneously substituting for government revenue lost through
changes in the income tax structure. Prior to the reform, there were seven VAT tax rates: 0

                                                             8
percent, 1.6 percent, 10 percent, 16 percent, 20 percent, 25 percent, and 35 percent. In order to
simplify this complex system, the government proposed to use three rates instead of seven,
eliminating the tax rates of 1.6 percent, 10 percent, and all those above 20 percent, while creating
a new tax rate of 5 percent. The luxury tax was created to complement the VAT tax of 16 percent
for the goods previously taxed at 20, 25, and 35 percent. Table 2 summarizes the status quo as
well as the proposed and approved tax reform for the VAT tax rate and the IMAN. As indicated
in the table, both the proposed and approved IMAN reform focused on increasing the tax rate for
high incomes while also lowering the threshold for low incomes. In terms of the VAT, the
differences are not significant except for those applied to prepaid medicine.

A new corporate tax (Impuesto sobre la Renta para la Equidad, CREE) was also introduced
with the goal of shifting the income tax burden from labor to capital. The reform earmarked
the revenues from this tax to finance programs at the National Training Institute (Servicio
Nacional de Aprendizaje, SENA), the National Welfare Institute (Instituto Colombiano de
Bienestar Familiar, ICBF), and the health system. The CREE was also designed to shift the
burden of financing these so-called parafiscales from companies in labor-intensive industries to
those in highly profitable and capital-intensive industries (such as oil and gas).

As noted earlier, a stipulation on the DPL awarded to the GoC was that a Poverty and
Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) of the 2012 tax reform should be conducted by the World
Bank. The main purpose of this report is to summarize the main findings of the PSIA. The
following sections describe the methodologies utilized and the results of the analysis.

3       Analysis of the Distributional Impact of Colombia’s Tax Reform


The findings of this impact assessment are based on three different analyses. Each analysis
follows a different methodology. The first analysis is concerned with understanding the overall
impact of the reform on the distribution of income. This analysis is based on a constructed
income distribution that combines administrative tax records with the GEIH. The second analysis
estimates the impact of the changes to the VAT code on the distribution of consumption and on
government revenues; this analysis is based on the LATAX micro-simulation technique and uses
consumption data from the ENCV household survey. Finally, the third analysis uses a general
equilibrium model to estimate the impact of the 2012 Colombian tax reform on the labor market.
This section discusses the assumptions and limitations of each analysis.

3.1     Analysis of the New Alternative Income Tax based on a Constructed Income
        Distribution

This subsection aims to shed light on the overall impact of the tax reform on fiscal revenues
and the distribution of income; unlike studies using the CEQ methodology, this analysis
rests on a constructed income distribution that combines administrative tax records with
the GEIH. The main purpose of constructing an income distribution based on these two sources
of data is to capture the high-income segment of society, which, due to underreporting, missing
responses, or sampling issues, is often underrepresented in household surveys.21 In contrast to
household surveys, administrative tax records, which are available only above a certain income
threshold, more accurately capture the high-income segment of the society.22

The constructed income distribution used in this analysis is based on data from the 2011
GEIH combined with 2010 administrative tax records from the DIAN. It is important to note
that this data merge results in double counting, as certain individuals may appear both in the
survey and in the administrative records. To correct for this overlap, individuals with total
incomes greater than 3,300 UVT23 are dropped from the GEIH sample to create a single income
distribution (see Figure 2).24 The Gini coefficient and the GoC’s tax revenue are then calculated
using both the truncated distributions of the administrative record and the GEIH.


21
   Based on an analysis of Latin American data, Székely and Hilgert (1999) suggest that household surveys are not
representative of the richest in society, and therefore, the Gini coefficient can be severely under-estimated.
22
   There is an extensive literature explaining the underreporting problem and why tax records might help solve it
(see, e.g., Atkinson and Piketty 2007). Alternatively, one may analyze income inequality using the Pareto
interpolation technique (see, e.g., Hlasny and Verme 2013). However, the Pareto technique works well only when
underreporting is not important (Cowell and Victoria-Feser 2000).
23
   According to Colombian law, all individuals with a total income higher than 3,300 UVT should present a
declaration. As noted earlier, the value of 1 UVT in 2010 was 24,555 COP.
24
   The choice of this threshold is non-trivial and it is discussed in Diaz Bazan 2014; in particular, because tax
records represent the entire population that submits a declaration, the income tax threshold is used to cut off the

Source: Based on GEIH (raw) 2011 and data from income tax declarations, DIAN 2010. Estimations correspond to all individuals who report
having labor income.


However, it should be noted that the inequality analysis based on the constructed income
distribution is also subject to limitations and assumptions. In terms of limitations, the Gini
coefficient is only calculated for individuals who report having labor income. According to
Colombian law, only the employees for whom the contribution of labor income represents at
least 80 percent of their total income are eligible for the alternative income tax,25 and only these
individuals are considered in the analysis. This means that, unlike the official Gini coefficient,
the one calculated using the constructed income distribution is based on labor income rather than
total income.26 Finally, since the analysis is not based on tax declarations, it implicitly assumes
no tax evasion.

3.2                     Analysis of the Impact of the Value Added Tax on the Distribution of Consumption

The second analysis summarized in this report examines the distributional impact of the
changes in the VAT code. The analysis uses the micro-simulation model LATAX, originally
developed by experts at the Institute of Fiscal Studies in the United Kingdom to analyze tax and
benefit reforms in Mexico.27, 28 The LATAX methodology identifies changes in tax revenue and
the distributional impact of tax reforms, assuming that households do not modify their behavior
as a consequence of these changes. In addition, it allows for a simulation of behavioral responses
among households along some specific dimensions. To assess the distributional impact of the

household survey distribution and thus prevent double counting.

26
   Moreover, the analysis is based on the GEIH rather than on MESEP data, which is typically used for measuring
poverty and inequality.
27
   The expanded LATAX model has already been implemented in two Latin American countries —Mexico and El
Salvador—to assess their respective tax reforms in 2010 and 2011.
28
   Abramovsky et al. 2011a.

                                                                 12
Colombian tax reform, the analysis uses the household information on net income and household
expenditures from the 2011 National Quality of Life Survey. LATAX simulates the status quo
and estimates the impact of both the proposed tax reform and the approved tax reform.

  Box 1: Adjusting for Missing Income and Expenditure under IMAN and LATAX Simulations

Household surveys are not representative of the top percentiles of overall income distribution. This low
representation is associated with two major problems: no response and underreporting of income or
consumption. The first problem corresponds to not reporting any type of income. If the non-response rate
is constant over time, changes in inequality would not be greatly affected (Gasparini et al. 2000).
However, because these rates are fluctuating in time, not considering this fact may bias the results.
Statistics institutes have succeeded in reducing the non-response rate in household surveys through
multivariate regressions according with demographic and socioeconomic characteristics.

The second problem of household surveys is underreporting of income. This phenomenon can
significantly alter inequality measures. If the underreporting is different across economic strata, differs by
source of income, and changes over time, this can lead to problems when estimating the concentration of
income. Sometimes specialists seek to attenuate this problem by obtaining a factor for each source of
income from national accounts. However, this practice is not considered an adequate solution by some
experts because the individuals underreporting income are usually from the higher income centiles
(Székely and Hilgert 1999). Due to the fact that tax records are a good complement for household
surveys, we construct an income distribution for Colombia by combining both household surveys (for
individuals earning less than 3,300 UVT) and administrative tax records (for individuals earning 3,300
UVT or more).

A final concern arises when there is underreporting for consumption. To address this issue, the
distributional analysis of the VAT is performed using fixed factors for each income source and broad
expenditure category to match National Accounts. It is important to note that the national accounts
provide information on only 12 categories of spending, rather than the 60 (30 formal and 30 informal)
included in LATAX. This means that one must amalgamate the LATAX spending categories into larger
categories for which National Accounts data is available, and multiply by factors calculated for these
larger categories (for details on how these factors are chosen, see Annex 2). Additionally, all scenarios are
calculated using the unadjusted National Accounts, with the objective of demonstrating that the use of
factors lead only to a change in the magnitude but not in the tendency of the results.

The LATAX simulation makes specific assumptions about individual and household
purchase behavior. The model assumes that neither changes in prices caused by the IMAN tax
reform nor changes in wages caused by changes in income tax impact households’ and
individuals’ purchase behavior. Furthermore, the original model assumes that individuals
purchase products through formal channels, thus paying the VAT for all of their purchases. In
terms of limitations, the LATAX simulations are based on household survey data which, as
already noted, underestimates the consumption of high income households.




                                                     13
All simulations assume that the VAT tax rate is zero percent for exempt goods. Consistent
with earlier applications of the LATAX methodology, each scenario simulated in LATAX
assumes a zero percent tax rate for exempted goods in the baseline.29 Some experts argue in
favor of including the effective tax rates (based on taxable intermediate inputs) as a way to adjust
the nominal tax rate (0 percent).30 Because the effective tax rate is not considered in the analysis,
the tax collection can be underestimated, while distributional results can be overestimated (in the
same proportion as the effective tax rate).

For the case of unprocessed foods, the analysis considers an upper (no tax evasion) and a
pseudo-lower (some tax evasion) bound on incidence. One commonly used approach to
measure tax evasion is the “tax gap” methodology, which estimates the difference between the
true tax liability for a given tax year and the amount that is paid on time; this is done by
comparing two sources of income information: tax return data and the National Accounts.31
However, given that VAT data is not readily accessible, in order to account for tax evasion the
current analysis distinguishes between purchases from the formal and informal markets by taking
into account the place of purchase.32 In particular, the data allow for estimates in two different
scenarios: (1) a no-tax-evasion scenario (corresponding to an upper bound on incidence), which
assumes that all households purchase unprocessed foods in the formal market and thus pay taxes;
and (2) a tax-evasion scenario (corresponding to a pseudo-lower bound on incidence), which
assumes that households purchase unprocessed foods in either the formal market, in which case
they pay taxes, or in the informal market, in which case they evade taxes.33

The study accounts for missing expenditure and income values. In general, household
surveys underreport income and/or consumption relative to information gathered by the National
Accounts. In order to match National Accounts data with household survey data, each income
source and expenditure category is multiplied by fixed factors.34 As a robustness check, all
scenarios are also calculated using unadjusted data.

3.3     Analysis of the Impact of the Income Tax for Equity on the Labor Market

The third analysis summarized in this report evaluates the impact of the 2012 Colombia tax
reform on the labor market. In particular, this analysis focuses on the potential effects of the

29
   Abramovsky et al. 2011b (p. 21) state the following: “We do not model the VAT embodied in the price of exempt
goods (which are goods on which VAT is not levied, but for which the VAT paid on inputs cannot be reclaimed), in
effect treating such goods as zero-rated.”
30
   The effective tax rate is calculated using the Input-Output matrix.
31
   Cruz 2009.
32
   For instance, a good is assumed to be purchased in the formal market when it is purchased in a supermarket or
small store and in the informal market when it is purchased from peddlers or informal stores.
33
   For the case of vegetables, the ENCV asks urban households about their place of purchase. Therefore, under the
pseudo-lower bound scenario, it is assumed that households in rural areas are part of the informal market.
34
   This is done following the LATAX manual, which recommends adjusting income and consumption by the
National Accounts data. For more details about this factor please see the Annex 2.

reform that relates to changes in the source of financing for training (SENA), in-kind transfers
(ICBF), and employers’ contributions to health care35 on wages, total employment, and the
creation of new formal jobs. Two scenarios—A and B—are considered. Under Scenario A, the
corporate income tax rate is kept at its statutory value of 33 percent, while under Scenario B the
corporate tax rate is set at 34 percent, in line with the 1 percent increase of the CREE element of
the 2012 Colombia tax reform. The analysis is based on the employment figures from the GEIH
household survey from the second quarter of 2012 and employs a version of the dynamic general
equilibrium model of Antón and Leal (2013)36 (see Box 2) calibrated to Colombian data.

The general equilibrium model is subject to several constraints and assumptions. First, both
Scenarios A and B assume a decrease of 13.5 percentage points (pp) in labor taxes, which
includes the change in financing from labor to corporate income for SENA (a 2 pp decrease
related to the change in the source of financing for training), ICBF (a 3 pp decrease related to in-
kind transfers), and employers’ contributions to the healthcare system (8.5 pp decrease). To
compensate the formal workers for the fall in contributory social insurance (CSI) service
transfers, the model also assumes a non-wage based, lump-sum transfer equivalent to 9 percent
of their benchmark wage rate.37 Second, workers are only considered formal if they contribute to
the pension and contributory health system. And finally, the model excludes government
employees.




35
   These are payroll taxes related to the contributions made by employers to the Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje
(SENA), the Instituto Colombiano de Bienestar Familiar (ICBF), and the Cajas de Compensación Familiar (CCF).
36
   Antón and Leal 2013.
37
   This 9 percent includes 2 percent from SENA and 7 percent from employers’ contributions to health care. Note
that in-kind transfers (ICBF) are not included in the lump-sum CSI service transfers.

                                                       15
                        Box 2: Effects of the Fiscal Reform on Labor Markets

The methodology is based on a dynamic general equilibrium model with occupational choice proposed by
Antón and Leal (2013). The framework extends the occupational choice problem of Lucas (1978) to two
sectors (capturing the fact that before the 2012 fiscal reform, several goods were exempt from the value
added tax) and three different taxes (value added tax [VAT], contributory social insurance [CSI] services
tax, and corporate income tax [CIT]) in a tax evasion framework.

The model assumes a representative multi-member family that maximizes lifetime utility. Family
members are endowed with “managerial abilities,” and they may optimally choose to be an employee, an
own-account worker, or a full-time entrepreneur (employer). If an employee, the individual is classified
as formal if s/he has access to CSI, otherwise s/he is classified as informal.

On the production side, firms require capital, labor, and managerial ability to produce goods in a perfectly
competitive environment. Each firm is run by a full-time entrepreneur. Goods may also be produced by
own-account workers using a similar production technology. Firms have an incentive to evade taxes,
facing an endogenous probability of being detected by the fiscal authority in doing so. This probability is
proportional to the firm’s size, so that small-scale firms have a lower probability of being detected. If
detected, firms must pay all taxes evaded plus a fine. The model also assumes that the fiscal authority
cannot impose taxes on own-account workers since it is difficult and costly to monitor the economic
activities of the self-employed.

A firm may choose to evade CSI taxes for all or some of its workers. If a firm does not cover CSI taxes
for a worker, that worker is labeled as informal; otherwise, the worker is labeled as formal. Given the
incentive structure, large firms will hire mostly formal workers, since the probability of CSI tax evasion
detection is higher for these workers. Small firms hire relatively more informal workers. This assumption
is consistent with empirical findings using Mexican data, as discussed by Antón, Hernández, and Levy
(2012). Own-account workers optimally choose not to pay CSI taxes and are thus classified as informal
workers. As a result, the possibility of evading CSI taxes gives place to the coexistence of formal and
informal employees in equilibrium.

Labor demand functions for formal and informal workers can be obtained from the firm’s optimization
problem. These functions are affected by the tax structure in place, so that a change in any tax rate may
affect the demand for labor. Labor supply is endogenously provided by own-account workers and by
family members who choose to become employees, with the household simultaneously choosing the
fraction of employees that provide services as formal and informal workers. Overall, the model
endogenously yields labor supply and demand functions for both formal and informal workers and
computes the equilibrium wage rate in each market. This structure is suitable for the estimation of the
effects of changes in the tax structure on both formal and informal workers as well as on average wages.

The model was calibrated to match key features of the Colombian data collected prior to the fiscal reform
approved in December 2012. In general, either 2011 or 2012 was used as the reference year. To perform
the calibration, the parameters in the model were either fixed at the values observed before the 2012 tax
reform (as in the case of the corporate income tax or employment figures), obtained from the relevant
literature, or set to match key moments in Colombian data (see Antón 2014).

4.1       New Alternative Income Tax (IMAN)

Compared to alternative methodologies, the first analysis of the PSIA, which is based on
the constructed full income distribution, finds the largest redistributive impact of the 2012
Colombia tax reform. When using the full income distribution, the Gini coefficient decreases
from 0.586 to 0.579. This 0.7 percentage point decrease is significant and larger than that
obtained using household surveys alone (registering a 0.4 percentage point decrease) (see Table
3). Considering that the average yearly reduction of the Gini coefficient in Latin American
countries over the last 10 years was 0.51 percentage points, the estimated impact of the reform is
not trivial.38 These results demonstrate the importance of using the full income distribution to
calculate true inequality in a country.

The analysis based on the constructed income distribution also reveals that the
introduction of the alternative income tax, IMAN, leads to a slight decrease in government
revenues of approximately 0.1 billion COP (see Table 4).39 However, it is important to note
that this analysis only accounts for changes in the income tax (IMAN) and does not include the
introduction of the corporate (CREE) and luxury taxes or the changes in the VAT structure.

4.2       VAT Analysis

The second analysis, based on the LATAX methodology, shows a modest impact of the
VAT reform on inequality and tax revenues. Because this analysis only considers changes to
the VAT code, consumption (vis-à-vis income) seems to be the more appropriate choice to
determine the proportional impact of cash gains/losses.40 The analysis shows that the 2012
Colombia tax reform yields a modest reduction in the consumption Gini coefficient, from
0.50986 to 0.50895 (see Table 5). The result is in line with those obtained using the IMAN
analysis.41 With regard to tax revenues, the corresponding simulation yields an increase in tax
revenues from COP 15.7 billion to 16.2 billion (see Table 6).

VAT Analysis by Item

This subsection presents the main findings from the analysis of the distributional impact of the
changes to the VAT on different types of goods using the baseline assumptions specified in
Section 3.2

40
   In order to conduct this analysis, it is first necessary to identify appropriate variables to measure living standard
conditions in Colombia. An equivalence scale of 100/80/50 is used to assign households to particular positions in the
consumption distribution. For instance, a household composed for a single adult with an expenditure of $100, a
household composed of two adults with an expenditure of $180 (100+80), and a household consisting of two adults
and a child with an expenditure of $230 (100+80+50) all have an equivalent level of well-being.
41
   The analyses of the impact of the IMAN and of the VAT tax reform show similar results. Two important points to
highlight are: (1) analyses 1 and 2 are undertaken independently of one another; while the first uses income as a
measure of living standard conditions, the second uses consumption; and (2) the analysis of the IMAN uses the
GEIH as its main input, whereas the analysis of the VAT uses the ENCV.

Changes in Processed Food

When it comes to processed food (cold meat, bread, and fish), both the proposed and the
approved changes to the VAT are expected to have a generally progressive distributional
impact at the national level.42 The results show that, at the national level, the average cash
gains (as a percentage of total expenditures) under both the proposed and the approved changes
to the VAT decrease as one moves up the consumption distribution, indicating progressivity in
relative terms (see Figure 3).43 While the gains are lower in rural areas, the tax incidence is
progressive, with the first decile of the expenditure distribution clearly benefiting most from the
reform. The results for urban areas follow an inverted U-shape pattern, with cash gains
decreasing at either end of the expenditure distribution relative to the middle deciles; overall,
however, the proposed reform is progressive, whereas the approved reform is marginally
regressive. Focusing on the bottom 40 percent of the expenditure distribution, while at the
national level this group shows average cash gains of 0.50 under the proposed reform, the same
group shows average cash gains of 0.39 percent under the approved reform. Additionally, people
living in urban areas are shown to gain more than those living in rural areas in every decile of the
expenditure distribution. Overall, the expected impact of the proposed changes is similar to that
of the approved changes, though the magnitude of impact is slightly lower in the latter case.

total expenditures, relative to 0.15 percent for households in the highest expenditure decile. At
the national level, the total annual expenditure on unprocessed food of the poorest forty percent
of the population is expected to decline, on average, by 0.80 percent.45

proportion of consumption in vegetables is approximately 8 percent of the total consumption.

marginally regressive (Figure 6). For
national and urban areas in particular, the
average cash losses (as a percentage of
total expenditures) increase as one moves
up the consumption distribution until the
5th decile and are somewhat lower for the
remaining      deciles.    For     example,

Prepaid Medicine

A key component of the General System of Social Security in Health (SGSSS)46 in
Colombia is the Mandatory Health Plan (POS).47 In particular, the GoC requires companies to
enroll their employees in a POS; as part of this process, employees choose the medical company
they want to join using intermediaries called Health Promotion Entities (EPS),48 which are
responsible for guaranteeing health coverage to workers. The EPS do not provide medical care
themselves; rather, they hire Lending Institutions of Health (clinics, hospitals, diagnostic centers,
etc.) which are directly responsible for the patients’ care. However, families may also pay for
supplementary health insurance called “prepaid medicine” in order to obtain a higher quality of
coverage. The following analysis is based on the distributional effects of the tax reform on the
supplementary health insurance or prepaid medicine.

The proposed and approved changes to the VAT related to prepaid medicine are expected
to affect mainly those in the top 30 percent of the consumption distribution and to have no
effect on the rural population (see Figure 7). For rural and poor households, the changes to the
VAT are shown to have no effect, reflecting the fact that the extra coverage is purchased mainly
by high-consumption households. It is important to note that the approved reduction of the VAT
tax rate, from 10 to 5 percent, implicitly reduces the price of supplemental medical care, with the
likely result that poorer households would have greater access to coverage even if they had not
purchased it in the past.

the expenditures on clubs and hotels are concentrated in the highest two expenditure deciles,
with little or no expenditures found in the lower eight deciles. This reflects the fact that leisure

services are unessential expenditure items (luxury goods) and, as such, tend to be more common
among high-consumption households. Thus, because the approved change to the VAT increases
the tax on these non-essential services, it is shown to be progressive in the sense that higher
consumption households are expected to bear most of the related tax burden, while poor
households are expected to remain largely unaffected.

Combined Impact of All Changes to the VAT

At the national level, changes to the VAT code are expected to have only a modest impact
on inequality and tax revenues, and practically no impact in terms of their incidence.
Assuming no tax evasion (Figure 10), the approved changes to the VAT code are expected to be
marginally regressive. At the national level, under the approved reforms, the bottom three deciles
are expected to bear the largest burden of the reform and incur the largest consumption losses.
While the incidence in rural areas shows a clearly regressive pattern, with rural households at the
bottom decile incurring the largest losses, the incidence in urban areas follows a U-shape pattern,
with cash losses decreasing at either end of the expenditure distribution relative to the middle
deciles. Assuming some tax evasion scenario, however, the approved changes to the VAT code
are expected to be overall progressive at the national level, progressive in rural areas, and
marginally regressive in urban areas (Figure 11). In terms of the proposed reform, results show a
regressive pattern (Figure 10), while under the some-tax-evasion scenario the results show a
progressive effect (Figure 11).

 With regard to the absolute incidence49 of the VAT reform, the analysis reveals it to be
progressive, as shown in Figure 12. In particular, the high consumption households (10th
decile) bear a larger share of the cash losses relative to the poorer households as a result of the
proposed reform; the proposed reform is also shown to be more progressive than the approved
reform, the impact of the latter being 39 percent smaller than that of the former.

proportion of all taxes collected (or reduced) by the government, and the term “relative incidence” when discussing
the tax paid/saved as a proportion of expenditure (for more on the latter, see Annex 7).

Additional VAT Tax Reform Scenarios

 This subsection analyzes the effect of extreme VAT reform scenarios on the bottom 40
percent of the consumption distribution. The analysis simulates two scenarios: a uniform VAT
rate of 16 percent and an exemption from the VAT rate for unprocessed food while remaining
goods are taxed at 16 percent.

At the national level, the first simulation of a uniform VAT rate of 16 percent across all
goods is essentially regressive, with cash losses representing a greater share of expenditures
among poorer households. With a loss equivalent to 7.45 percent of total expenditures, on
average, the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution lose proportionally more than the top
of the distribution. By comparison, the richest decile loses only 3.19 percent of total expenditure
under this scenario (see Figure 13, left side).

Exempting unprocessed food while keeping VAT rates uniform mitigates the distributional
impact, producing smaller cash losses as a percent of expenditure for poorer households.
The results reveal the relative importance of unprocessed food for poorer households. In
particular, focusing on urban area households reveals that the poorest decile loses the least
(proportionate to total expenditure) regardless of the scenario, while the middle of the
consumption distribution bears most of the tax burden.50




50
  At the national level, the first decile is comprised mainly of people living in rural areas, whereas for the rest of the
distribution it is comprised primarily of urban dwellers (see Figure 13, right side).

The results from this exercise show that: (1) a uniform subsidy yields relatively greater gains
(losses) to the bottom 10 percent of the population (90 percent) but helps in some sense to
mitigate the impact on the poorest bottom 40 percent, because the reform impacts their
expenditures more; and, on the other hand, (2) targeted transfers show a more progressive
targeting to the bottom 40 percent of households and cash losses to higher income households
(Figure 14).



4.3       Effects of the Tax Reform on Informality and Employment—Results

The results of the general equilibrium simulations show that the tax reform increases
salaried employment and total employment. Under Scenario A, salaried formal employment
increases more (3.7 percent) than under Scenario B (3.4 percent), which assumes an increase in
corporate tax in addition to the assumptions of Scenario A. Own-account employment decreases
more under Scenario A than under Scenario B, resulting in a larger increase in total employment
under Scenario B (0.5 percent) than under Scenario A (0.3 percent) (see Table 7).53 Under both
scenarios, the demand for salaried workers increases because the reform makes salaried labor
relatively less expensive (and own-account relatively labor more expensive).




51
   The bottom 40 percent of the population eligible for the subsidy is identified using the national distribution of
households.

   This scenario assumes perfect targeting.

Notes: (a) Informal salaried plus own-account workers; (b) Salaried plus own-account workers. Reform scenario A assumes a fall of 22.4 percent
in labor taxes (equivalent to a decrease of 10.5 percentage points) and a lump-sum transfer to formal workers equivalent to 9 percent of their
benchmark wage rate. Reform scenario B assumes scenario A plus an increase in the corporate income tax rate from 33 to 34 percent.



Formal salaried employment increases by over 3 percent under both scenarios. While the
total effect is greater under Scenario B, individual effects are muted: raising the corporate tax
partially offsets the increased demand in labor that results from decreasing the labor tax, while
also partially offsetting the decrease in own-account employment, as some employers may
choose to become own-account workers to avoid the corporate tax. Regardless, increased total
and formal employment as a result of decreased labor taxes with and without an increase in
corporate taxes indicates that this reform is unambiguously expected to enhance equity.

The model also predicts an increase in wages as a consequence of the reduction of the
payroll tax. Formal wage earners, own account workers and employers see a rise in after-tax
average earnings as a result of the tax reform under both scenarios (see Table 7). While own-
account earnings change the least, they still rise by over 2.6 percent under both scenarios. With
the exception of after-tax earnings of employers, earnings under Scenario B rise less than they do
under Scenario A, as some of the increase in corporate tax is passed on to employees. The reason
employers’ earnings increase more under Scenario B than they do under Scenario A can be
partially explained by the decrease in the number of total employers under Scenario B as
employers become own-account workers. The increase in wages across workers indicates the
positive social impact of the tax reform, as rising incomes will contribute to poverty reduction
and the creation of more and better-paying jobs will help reduce income inequality.



                                                                     27
Overall, the 2012 tax reform is expected to foster job creation. The decrease in other labor
taxes will contribute to the main objective of job creation; the overall level of employment is
anticipated to rise as a result of the tax reform. However, as a higher corporate tax increases
incentives for working in the informal market, the share of informal employment may also rise.

5      Conclusion
Three main components of the 2012 Colombian tax reform stand out. They include: (1) a
new Alternative Minimum Tax (IMAN) for personal income tax payers; (2) a new corporate tax
(CREE) to offset a decrease in payroll taxes; and (3) a streamlined VAT system, reducing the
number of tax rates from seven to three while also creating a new luxury tax. Additionally, the
government introduced changes in the federal tax on gasoline and diesel fuel, the effects of
which were not analyzed in this report.

Colombia’s reform on income tax serves the intended purpose of reducing income
inequality. Using the constructed full income distribution, the Gini coefficient decreases from
0.586 to 0.579—a decrease of 0.7 percentage points compared to the 0.4 percentage point
decrease observed when relying solely on household surveys. Considering that the average
yearly reduction of the Gini coefficient in the LAC region over the last 10 years was 0.51
percentage points, Colombia’s estimated reduction in the Gini coefficient is not trivial. These
results also demonstrate the importance of using the full income distribution to calculate the true
inequality in a country.

At the national level, changes to the VAT code are expected to have only a modest impact
on inequality and tax revenues, and practically no impact in terms of their incidence.
Assuming no tax evasion, the approved changes to the VAT code are expected to be marginally
regressive. However, assuming some tax evasion, the approved changes to the VAT code are
expected to be overall progressive at the national level, progressive in rural areas, and marginally
regressive in urban areas.

Overall, the 2012 tax reform is expected to foster job creation. The decrease in other labor
taxes will contribute to the main objective of job creation; the overall level of employment is
anticipated to rise as a result of the tax reform. However, as a higher corporate tax increases
incentives for working in the informal market, the share of informal employment may also rise.

Some caveats regarding the analysis presented in this report should be noted. First, the VAT
analysis excludes food groups for which disaggregated goods expenditure is not available—this
is so because in order to evaluate the impact of the changes to the VAT code, it is necessary to
separately track the effect of the changes on each good. As a result, the findings corresponding to
the overall impact of the reform are based only on a subset of goods rather than on the full array
of goods affected by the reform. Second, the micro-simulations fail to capture the full effect of


                                                28
the tax reform: in particular, they do not include tax collections from firm production channels,
and they only capture one sector of the economy.
