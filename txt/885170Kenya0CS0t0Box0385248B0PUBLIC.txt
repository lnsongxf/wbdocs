II. Methodology
In April-June 2012, 600 stakeholders of the World Bank in Kenya were invited to provide their
opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country survey.
Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President, Prime Minister;
the office of a Minister; the office of a Parliamentarian; employees of a ministry, ministerial
department, or implementation agency; consultants/contractors working on World Bank-
supported projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of a
project; local government officials or staff; bilateral agencies; multilateral agencies; private
sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; NGOs; community-
based organizations (CBOs); the media; independent government institutions; trade unions; faith-
based groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; and the judiciary branch. A total of 373
stakeholders participated in the country survey (62%).

Respondents received questionnaires via post or email and returned them accordingly.
Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Kenya, their overall attitudes toward the
Bank; the World Bank’s effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge; working with the
World Bank; the Bank’s future role in Kenya, and the Bank’s communication and information
sharing in Kenya.

A. General Issues facing Kenya: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Kenya is headed
   in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important development
   priorities, and which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and generating
   economic growth in Kenya.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in Kenya, Bank staff preparedness, the extent
   to which the Bank should seek to influence the global development agenda, their agreement
   with various statements regarding the Bank’s work, and the extent to which the Bank is an
   effective development partner. Respondents were also asked to indicate the sectoral areas on
   which it would be most productive for the Bank to focus its resources, the Bank’s greatest
   values and greatest weaknesses in its work, the most and least effective instruments in
   helping to reduce poverty in Kenya, with which groups the Bank should collaborate more,
   and to what reasons respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts.
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps achieve development results in Kenya, the extent to which the Bank
   meets Kenya’s need for knowledge services and financial instruments, and the Bank’s level
   of effectiveness across thirty-five development areas, such as poverty reduction, economic
   growth, governance, an others.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge: Respondents were asked to indicate how frequently they
   consult Bank knowledge/research, the areas on which the Bank should focus its research
   efforts, and to rate the effectiveness and quality of the Bank’s knowledge/research, including
   how significant of a contribution it makes to development results, its technical quality, the
   Bank’s effectiveness at providing linkage to non-Bank expertise, and the extent to which
   Kenya received value for money from the Bank’s fee-for-service products.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank’s
   “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable, the Bank imposing reasonable conditions
   on its lending, disbursing funds promptly, increasing Kenya’s institutional capacity, and
   providing effective implementation support.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in Kenya: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the Bank should play in Kenya’s development in the near future and to
   indicate what the Bank should do to make itself of greater value in Kenya.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate where they
   get information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, and their usage and evaluation of the Bank’s websites.
   Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s Access to Information policy,
   past information requests from the Bank, and their level of agreement that they use more data
   from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy. Respondents were also
   asked their level of agreement that they know how to find information from the Bank and
   that the Bank is responsive to information requests.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in Kenya, and their geographic location.
When possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey were
compared to responses from the 413 respondents (83% response rate) who completed the country
survey in FY 2005. Notations and/or charts are included when these comparisons were possible.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
        For further analyses, the small number of respondents from the office of Minister were combined
         with respondents from the office of the President and the office of Prime Minister;
         consultants/contractors working on Bank-supported projects were combined with respondents
         from PMUs; respondents from bilateral agencies were combined with those from multilateral
         agencies; respondents from the financial sector/private banks were combined with those from
         private sector organizations; and the few respondents from the office of Parliamentarian and the
         judiciary branch were included in the “Other” category. Note that respondents from NGOs,
         community based organizations, private foundations, and faith-based groups were combined
         under the “CSO” category. There were no respondents from trade unions.

          Respondents from PMUs/consultants on Bank supported projects and respondents
           from bilateral/multilateral agencies indicated the highest levels of familiarity whereas
           respondents from the media and the office of the President/Prime Minister/Minister

       There were significant stakeholder differences in their ratings of the Bank’s effectiveness
        across three of these thirty-five areas. For the most part, respondents from local
        government, CSOs, and PMUs/consultants on Bank supported projects had the highest
        ratings across these areas whereas respondents from academia/research institutes/think
        tanks, the media, and the private sector tended to have significantly lower ratings for the
        Bank’s effectiveness across these areas. Those areas with significant stakeholder group
        differences were:
             “Information and communications technology”;
             “Crime and violence”; and
             “Disaster management”.

       There were significant differences between geographic locations across six of these
        thirty-five areas. In all six instances, respondents from Nairobi had significantly higher
        ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness across these areas than respondents from other
        locations. Those areas with significant differences were:
                “Information and communications technology”;
                “Crime and violence”;
                “Law and justice”;

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness

To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Kenya, bivariate correlational
analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty-five specific areas of
effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results increase.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Kenya. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
                Monitoring and evaluation;
                Job creation/employment;
                Governance; and
                Regulatory framework.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in Kenya, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
             Regional integration;
             Urban development; and
             Economic growth.

VIII. How the World Bank Operates
The World Bank’s Work in Kenya

        Respondents in this year’s country survey had significantly higher levels of agreement
         regarding all of the compatible aspects of the World Bank’s work in Kenya compared to
         respondents from the FY ’05 country survey.
        There were significant stakeholder group differences in their levels of agreement that the
         Bank currently plays a relevant role in development in Kenya, that its programs and
         strategies are realistic, that the Bank treats clients and stakeholders with respect, and that
         its work is aligned with respondents’ development priorities. Respondents from
         bilateral/multilateral agencies, PMUs/consultants/contractors on Bank supported projects,
         and employees of ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies tended to
         have the highest levels of agreement with these statements, whereas respondents from the
         media, academia/research institutes/think tanks, and local government tended to have
         significantly lower levels of agreement.

VIII. How the World Bank Operates (continued)
Overall Perceptions
         Respondents in this year’s country survey had significantly higher levels of agreement
          that working with the Bank increases Kenya’s institutional capacity and that the Bank
          imposes reasonable conditions on its lending compared to respondents from the FY ’05
          country survey.
         There were significant stakeholder group differences in their levels of agreement across
          two of these aspects of how the Bank operates: “The World Bank's teams and visits are
          well coordinated” and “The World Bank provides effective implementation support”.
          Employees of ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies and
          respondents from PMUs/consultants/contractors on Bank supported projects tended to
          have the highest levels of agreement with these statements whereas respondents from the
          office of the President/Prime Minister/Minister tended to have significantly lower levels
          of agreement.

VIII. How the World Bank Operates (continued)
The World Bank as an Effective Development Partner
       There were significant stakeholder group differences in their ratings across three of these
        aspects of the Bank being an effective development partner: straightforwardness and
        honesty, openness, and staff accessibility. Respondents from PMUs/consultants/
        contractors on Bank supported projects tended to have the highest ratings for these three
        aspects whereas respondents from private sector organizations/financial sector/private
        banks and academia/research institutes/think tanks tended to have significantly lower
        ratings.
       There were significant differences between two geographic locations. Respondents from
        Nairobi gave significantly higher ratings for collaboration with groups outside of the
        Government and for staff accessibility than respondent from other geographic areas.

The World Bank is interested in gauging the views of clients and partners who are either involved in
development in KENYA or who observe activities related to social and economic development. The following
survey is meant to give the World Bank’s team that works in KENYA, greater insight into how the Bank’s work is
perceived. This is one tool the World Bank uses to assess the views of its critical stakeholders. With this
understanding, the World Bank hopes to develop more effective strategies, outreach and programs that support
development in KENYA. The World Bank commissioned an independent firm to oversee the logistics of this
effort in KENYA. This ensures anonymity and confidentiality. We hope you’ll be candid. To complete the survey,
please circle/check the response that most accurately reflects your opinion. If you prefer not to answer a
question, please leave it blank.
