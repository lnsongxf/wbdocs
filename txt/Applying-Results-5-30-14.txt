    The Water Partnership Program (WPP) is a multi-donor trust fund established in 2009 supported by the governments of
the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Denmark and Austria. The WPP enables the World Bank to bring innovation and leverage
investment in water, to drive change in global policy dialogue and to strengthen the results of its projects. The WPP works at the
nexus of water with food, energy, environment, and human development needs to help countries achieve climate-resilient and
inclusive green growth. www.worldbank.org/water/wpp
    GPOBA is a global partnership program administered by the World Bank. GPOBA was established in 2003 to develop
output-based aid (OBA) approaches across a variety of sectors—among them infrastructure, health, and education. To date,
GPOBA has signed 38 grant agreements for OBA subsidy funding for a total of US$155 million. GPOBA projects have disbursed
over US$105 million based on independently verified outputs, directly benefitting approximately 7 million people. The program’s
current donors are the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DFID), the International Finance Corpora-
tion (IFC), the Directorate-General for International Cooperation of the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs (DGIS), the Australian
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida). www.

Background

Over the last several years, the development practice and discourse has emphasized the need to link
development financing and assistance to results. This change reflects incentives internal to donor
agencies, such as tighter aid budgets and increasingly pressing accountability to domestic constitu-
encies. At the same time, the increasing emphasis on tying development funding to results stems from
disappointment in the results achieved by decades of development assistance, which based disburse-
ment mostly on “inputs,” and the subsequent discussions about the effectiveness of international aid
that began taking shape in the late 1990s. In particular, various High Level Forums on Aid Effectiveness
over the last decade (notably Paris in 2005, Accra in 2008, and Busan in 2011)1 brought about a critical
rethinking of aid goals and modalities that concentrated on criteria like country ownership, account-
ability, and management for results.
     In this context, increasing attention has been given to results-based forms of assistance and
funding that seek to provide greater incentives for achieving development outcomes and outputs.
Results based financing (RBF) mechanisms can serve as alternatives to traditional official develop-
ment assistance (ODA)—grants, loans, and guarantees—which is typically disbursed in advance of
delivery.
     There is no universally accepted definition of RBF. This commonly used label has been defined
in different ways according to its objectives, the agencies involved, the level of the incentive(s), or the
form of funding itself. Notably, the UK Department for International Development (DfID) identifies as
result-based aid (RBA) any such approach whereby funds from bilateral or multilateral development
agencies are used to incentivize developing country governments (See Pearson (2011)).
     By contrast, this document adopts a very broad definition of RBF (see glossary, Appendix A)
and it relies on the “principal-agent” model often used in economics to describe the features of the

   The Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, adopted by ministers and high-ranking representatives from 60 partner
countries and more than 50 multilateral and bilateral development institutions, reaffirmed the shared determination to
implement the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the commitment to meet them through donors’ harmoni-
zation and recipients’ ownership. Donors and partners agreed to be measured as to whether they really have achieved
the set goals. The midterm review that took place in Accra (September 2008) registered important progress but also
highlighted the necessity of greater flexibility on the part of the donors to adapt to recipients’ structures and the lack of
ownership and capacity in a number of partner countries. More recently, at the Busan Forum in the Republic of Korea,
global development leaders reviewed progress in improving the impact and value for money and recognized the grow-
ing importance of new development stakeholders such as new emerging donors, civil society, and the private sector.

                                         Analytical Framework


A    pplications of RBF in the water sector should be assessed with regard to their suitability to a
     specific project. The analysis should address the following questions:


1.	 How can the objective(s) and results be defined and measured?
2.	 What are the preconditions for a feasible RBF scheme?
3.	 Is RBF attractive in comparison to more conventional approaches and solutions that do not use
   RBF?


    These questions are a key component of the analytical framework of this document (Figure 2).
The discussion that follows answers the questions to provide guidance in exploring potential applica-
tions of RBF. In real life, the reasoning sequence may differ from the one followed here. Many of the
analytical aspects presented could be considered simultaneously and iteratively.



Establishing Objectives-Results-Indicators

The most promising features of the RBF approach aim to tie the disbursement of funds to the achieve-
ment of results. This brings the identification of such results front and center. The possible ambiguity
of RBF—as discussed in O’Brien & Kanbur (2013, p. 4)—is that almost anything can be regarded as a
“result” (even an input). Thus there must be a clear agreement on where the desired results fall in a chain
of causality from inputs to outputs to outcomes. Figure 3 shows a simplified graphic representation of the
claim of RBF approaches in general.

                     and outcomes).3 Second, it is essential to have           expected result. For instance, if the objective of an

    Box 1.  Transferring Risk to the Agent: An Example of Watershed Protection
    If a national government needs to increase the area of protected watershed, given an existing census of
    selected watersheds to be protected, a donor could reach an agreement with the country to disburse a
    certain amount for each percentage point increase of protected area, starting from the initial value at
    the time of the census: a so-called cash-on-delivery (COD) aid agreement.a Of course, the data should
    be reliable; so should the mechanisms to determine whether conditions have been met to consider that
    a new area is protected, so the result can be easily verified and the indicator calculated to define the
    amount to be paid.

         If the national government is directly responsible for protecting the watershed, a COD-type of
    agreement should suffice, and the national government would define how to achieve the expected
    results. If there are multiple reasons for protecting the watershed, and multiple levels of governments
    have responsibilities, the national government could sign various kinds of agreements with the state/
    provincial governments to carry out the projects. These agreements could use different RBF instruments
    (as well as traditional ones), depending on the circumstances.

        If watershed protection helps regulate flows in rivers that traverse cities, reducing flood damage
    by lowering the peak flow, cities could pay to protect the catchment, instead of implementing other
    flood protection/prevention measures. A Payment for Environmental Services (PES) agreement could
    be used, for instance (see Appendix A). Conversely, if the protection project requires state/provincial
    governments to implement infrastructure works, an output-based disbursement (OBD) agreement could
    be the way to go. Finally, protecting a forest could also be linked to carbon finance provided that certain
    conditions are met.

                       Box 2.  Types of Risk Related to RBF and Ways to Reduce Those Risks
                       Performance risk: This risk must be borne by the agent for the scheme to be considered results-based
                       financing. To reduce this risk, it is vital that the delivery of the expected results remain under the agent’s
                       control, as much as possible. The results should fall under the agent’s area of expertise or should be the
                       main aspect of its trade or business. Results should be defined very clearly, as well as the way progress
                       in attaining those results will be monitored and verified. Obstacles to performance should be reduced,
                       neutralized, or eliminated. For instance, the agent should have access to all materials, information, or
                       other elements required in a timely manner.

                            Payment risk: This risk can be minimized by ensuring the agent that there will be no delays or
                       withholding of payments once the results have been delivered and verified. Selecting a trustworthy
                       fiduciary agent and clearly defined and actionable disbursement procedures can help create confidence
                       that delivery of results will translate in prompt disbursements reducing the financial burden for the agent.

                           Demand risk: In some cases, the agent could take on the project and find out that there is less
                       demand than expected for the service or product the agent committed to deliver. If the project requires
                       high startup or fixed costs, and recovery of those costs depends on the quantity of product or service
                       provided that is taken up by the public, demand risk could be significant. To reduce this risk, the principal
                       can guarantee a minimum quantity to be purchased (it can also guarantee a price), ensuring a minimum
                       revenue stream for the agent. However, this is a risk that now will be borne by the principal. Another
                       way to minimize this risk, independently of who will bear it, is to conduct thorough demand studies, to
                       understand the size of the market targeted by the project.

                            Cost variation risk: In RBF projects, cost variations may pose a significant risk because the
                       remuneration is set at the onset of the project (sometimes an auction can be held to set a unit payment
                       while at other times this is fixed from the design stage); the agent is allowed to procure materials on
                       services needed to deliver the results that will trigger those payments. This is a key feature of most
                       RBF instruments, as it allows the agent to use its expertise to secure the lowest cost it can and make
                       the most out of the project (conversely, a risk affecting the principal is the one of overpaying for the
                       results). In projects that use traditional financing instruments, the procurement process is monitored
                       by the financing institution; cost variations can be detected before closing the contracts and dealt with
                       accordingly. In RBF, if there is a reasonable anticipation that, due to circumstance beyond the agent’s
                       control, costs may vary in ways that can affect the project financial equilibrium at risk. A way to adjust
                       the remuneration accordingly could be stated in the legal documents. The principal should consider the
                       impact that any remuneration increase could have in the quantity of results to be delivered by the agent
                       or the total cost of the project, if quantities are to be kept unchanged.

                            Other risks: These include collection risk (beneficiaries are not able or willing to pay their portion
                       of the agreed price); political risk (currency transfer restrictions, expropriation and breach of contract,
                       war and civil disturbance); and regulatory risk (for instance, if the principal is unwilling or unable to adjust
                       tariffs in line with increasing cost of service delivery). These risks should be dealt with in a similar fashion
                       as in traditionally financed projects.

                       Box 3.  Creating Incentives to Financial Institutions to Participate in Small-Scale Irrigation
                       Through much of Africa, the incentives for financial institutions to support irrigation and for farmers to
                       invest in it are lacking. The provision of financial services for smaller-scale investments in irrigation is
                       discouraged by gaps in transport and communications infrastructure, and uncertain legal frameworks,
                       and in land and property registries. Contract enforcement and legal arrangements to facilitate leasing are
                       often not in place.

                            Often the only available financial institutions to support small-scale irrigation finance are commodity-
                       based credit providers, such as exporters, input suppliers, and marketing cooperatives. Increasing
                       the variety of financial products and services offered and extending their outreach to a wider array of
                       rural clients would be highly beneficial. Providing a combination of financing and insurance can reduce
                       production risk. Well-designed insurance products can substitute for traditional collateral. Leasing is
                       often a good alternative to lending for rural finance institutions and a good alternative to borrowing for
                       farmers, and for farmers, this is a way to gain access to equipment for small-scale irrigation, and having
                       the equipment itself serve as collateral.

                           Lessons from the “Lighting Africa” Experience

                            The Lighting Africa program (see http://www.lightingafrica.org/ ) supports the development and
                       distribution of safe, clean, affordable off-grid lighting to Africans not yet connected to a grid. The purpose
                       of the program is to catalyze and accelerate the development of markets for affordable, modern off-grid
                       lighting solutions. Some of the lessons learned from the program could be adopted to support investment
                       in small-scale irrigation technology, potentially involving RBF schemes.

                            A big challenge in mobilizing financing and investments for off-grid lighting has been the lack of
                       knowledge about the industry and the perceived high risk of investments. The program’s effort in defining
                       shared and verified quality standard for the lighting devices accepted under the program helped reassure
                       financial institutions about the technology and demand for the devices.

                            Access to finance was identified by distributors as one of the biggest challenge to scaling up the solar
                       lighting market, constraining their ability to carry adequate stocks and extend credit to retailers. As a
                       result, Lighting Africa offers risk mitigation instruments to commercial financial institutions in order for
                       them to provide long-term growth capital, short-term working capital, and trade finance to manufacturers
                       and distributors.

                           At the consumer level, many rural consumers are deterred from buying off-grid lighting products
                       because the upfront costs are high. Lighting Africa is providing training and creating awareness for
                       microfinance institutions on the opportunities for consumer lending. In addition, the quality benchmarks
                       and warranties provided by manufacturers of products that have passed Lighting Africa quality standards
                       have provided a level of security for microfinance institutions to provide consumer loans.

                           Possible RBF Solutions for Small-Scale Irrigation

                            International donors could encourage local banks to offer credit to farmers, backing them up with
                       interest rate subsidies and/or a (partial) guarantee that could be linked to the number of small farmers
                       supported, and made conditional on independent verification. Credit could be extended for proven
                       technologies, and require some form of collateral and investment by the beneficiaries. Banks could
                       engage the national agricultural institute to certify the technology proposed.

 Box 4.  RBF vs. “Traditional” Solutions as Applied to Irrigation
 Morocco’s drip irrigation policy illustrates the importance of understanding all the contextual conditions
 when designing an effective policy, particularly one using RBF (see FAO (2012) and Kuper et al. (2009) for
 more details on such policy).

      In this case, the traditional infrastructure subsidy solution presented two main issues. First, drip
 irrigation is ideal for certain types of crops, but they are not typically grown by poor /small farmers in the
 country. Second, international experience shows that development of drip irrigation can lead to greater
 water consumption if water abstraction is not controlled. Drip irrigation tends to produce higher crop
 yields than flood irrigation. These greater yields require greater crop water evapotranspiration (ET) to
 sustain those higher yields. In Morocco, groundwater is abstracted by private farmers, with almost no
 control by river basin agencies (RBAs) — despite the water law, which states that all water users must
 register their wells and apply for an abstraction authorization. Hence, groundwater abstraction is
 currently much higher than the renewable volume in most aquifers.

      Assuming that a potentially appropriate RBF solution has been identified, the next step is to check
 the existence of the relevant enabling conditions. In this particular example it would be relevant to assess
 how much the country owns the goal of water conservation, or how much capacity the agricultural
 governance institution in charge has to oversee/verify the RBF conditions, and the extent to which the
 microfinance sector is developed in the country.

                       Box 5.  Evaluation Studies of GPOBA
                       While establishing a convincing counterfactual to evaluate the effectiveness of output-based aid (OBA)
                       remains a big challenge, GPOBA has conducted some studies to collect evidence on how OBA subsidies
                       used in various pilot projects have incentivized the supply of basic infrastructure service for low-income
                       users. A recent impact evaluation focused on the solar home systems (SHS) program in Bangladesh,
                       which includes result-based subsidies to microfinance-based suppliers of Solar Home Systems in rural
                       areas. The evaluation analyzed the demand for SHS in off-grid poor rural areas. Through a simulation
                       model, the study looked at various options to scale up this program to estimate how different subsidy
                       levels (combined with different conditions on the government loan that is currently supporting the
                       microfinance partners) would change the demand for solar systems in rural villages. The exercise shows
                       what a delicate equilibrium (of household subsidy, government loans to accelerate supply, and strict
                       verification of quality standards) has allowed microfinance agents to basically create a brand new SHS
                       market— while ensuring that the financial burden on poor rural customers remained acceptable (Hamad
                       et al. 2013).

                             Another lesson yielded through a GPOBA evaluation study is that, given the increased risk for the
                       agent (due to initial financial commitment), it is critical to center the project design on solid evidence and
                       tested assumptions that can be collected via feasibility studies and ex ante evaluation. More specifically,
                       a baseline household survey among slum dwellers in Mumbai, India investigated the willingness to pay
                       (WTP) assumptions behind adopting OBA subsidies to tackle issues of affordability surrounding the
                       connections, from informal to regular electricity connections. The survey highlighted how the targeted
                       slum households had critical concerns about the electricity consumption fee (or the monthly bill resulting
                       from regularization). Furthermore, some issues of slum governance greatly affected the families’ decision
                       to enroll in the regularization program. In a similar case, correctly assessing the beneficiaries’ real WTP
                       is a crucial determinant of their decision to enroll in the program. This, in turn, will significantly affect the
                       agent’s revenue expectations when engaging in the RBF intervention (Mimmi 2012).

Real-life Case Studies

Experience with RBF in the water sector is limited in terms of the tools that have been adopted, and for
the most part, has been confined to water supply projects. Most of the RBF projects in the water sector
use the output-based aid (OBA) approach for water supply. However, some wider water resources
management projects, as well as some sanitation projects, have used output-based disbursement
(OBD). The cases that follow describe some of these experiences and help illustrate in more detail the
concepts discussed in Chapter 2.


Case 1. Tackling Water Scarcity in São Paulo (OBD Approach)
Project Name and Time Frame: São Paulo Water Recovery Project (REAGUA), Brazil (P106703),
(2008–2015)


Problems/Issues: i) general water shortage in the São Paulo region, ii) poor/inadequate level of
water network infrastructure, resulting in considerable water losses, iii) limited financial and technical
capacity within water utilities, and iv) limited attractiveness of some types of interventions to address
water scarcity.


Background: The state of São Paulo is one of the world’s most urbanized areas and emblematic of
the urban challenges facing Brazil. Despite relatively high coverage rates, the state faces problems of
water scarcity and pollution due to the low availability of water, high level of demand, and lack of proper
wastewater collection and treatment. The objective of the project is to increase the availability of clean
water in the critical watersheds in the state of São Paulo, but more investment was judged insufficient
without improving the efficiency and sustainability of the water supply and sanitation (WSS) systems.
Although concentrating on the WSS service, the project serves three objectives: making more water
available for WSS services; improving the environmental conditions in the critical watersheds; and
reducing the stress on the water resources of those watersheds.


Object of the RBF Incentive: The recipients of the RBF incentives are water service providers located
within the selected five critical watersheds of São Paulo (in terms of water scarcity). Only three types
of WSS service providers are eligible for financing: public companies, municipal-owned and state-
owned companies. In order to avoid cross-subsidization and facilitate regulation and accountability,

  Highlights of the Case Study
  This project addressed an access constraint related to supply-side financial disincentives in a context
  of lack of infrastructure (especially sanitation) for vulnerable urban populations. The one-time subsidy
  is justified by the additional costs due to extending access to water and sanitation services to marginal
  urban areas. Targeting allowed the adequate levels of subsidies to be identified. This level of subsidy
  took into consideration customers’ ability to pay.

      The experience in Meknès revealed that the public sector can also bear the performance risk,
  and that a public utility can successfully adopt the OBA methodology to ensure the provision of basic
  services to neglected segments of the population.

      Organization of awareness and information campaigns was crucial to guaranteeing the
  populations’ buy-in in the social program. Post-completion evaluations stressed the importance for
  operators to be present throughout the implementation of works and to ensure the involvement of the
  potential beneficiary households in the social program.

      The operators’ role (extending service provision to the poor) required the active involvement of the
  local authorities (specifically to address land titling issues in the informal settlements).

       Monitoring and evaluation are key to achieving a rigorous framework to measure, report, and
  revise the project, and especially to ensure successful replication of the pilot.

      Notably, the role of the IVA went beyond the scope and the responsibilities originally defined in
  the operating manual, as the IVA helped build the operators’ technical capacity and enhance their
  organizational structures through a set of recommendations that were immediately followed by the
  three utilities.

                        Highlights of the Case Study and PES Approach
                        The case is one of internalizing externalities: land users usually do not receive any compensation for
                        environmental services (such as planting trees which help regulate water flows in a watershed and reduce
                        the risk of catastrophic flooding or landslides). As a result, they usually ignore environmental services in
                        making their land use decisions. In a PES scheme, land users can be compensated for the environmental
                        services they generate. Those who benefit from environmental services pay for their provision: that is,
                        the user pays. However, to sustain benefits, the financial stream needs to be continuous.

                            Although the PES approach is intuitively appealing, putting it into practice is far from simple. The
                        key challenge is in understanding the scientific aspects of the environmental service at hand (whether
                        biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration, hydrological protection, etc.) and assigning them an
                        economic value that is appropriate to incentivize the suppliers.

The Constraint of Risk Transfer in Flood Prevention
The possibilities for a results-based approach to flood prevention are mainly restricted by the extent
to which an agent will be able and willing to accept additional risks. Ultimately, the relevant risks are
not very manageable, particularly the risk of the occurrence of a flood event. However, one option is to
incentivize the implementation of measures that can reduce the impact of such an event.

   Examples include developing and implementing Emergency Preparedness Plans or Asset
Management Plans, as illustrated in the case study. Other innovative ideas could be to incentivize:
      ●●   governments to set and enforce policy/permits promoting construction according to flood
           resilient standards and that could include flood prevention facilities such as temporary water
           storage,
      ●●   the prevention of blocking of drainage canals (for example, pay NGOs or the waste manage-
           ment service provider to prevent dumping of waste in drainage canals),
      ●●   dredging to keep drainage canals open up to certain standards during certain times that are
           more prone to flooding,
      ●●   governments to implement measures to flood-proof key/vital infrastructure such as hospitals,
      ●●   governments or NGOs to set up and test early warning systems (the performance criteria
           could be the percentage of people reached out of the total population during testing),
      ●●   governments to plan and establish exit roads with sufficient capacity.

        Main Findings and Conclusions


Using RBF to Address Certain Categories of Problems

When considering the water sector as a whole, the spectrum of possible issues to be resolved is enor-
mous, but categorizing the main recurring issues can help narrow the selection of which RBF tools
may be most suitable for each specific context and situation. The discussion that follows considers
recurrent issues encountered in water-related development projects and suggests RBF approaches
that could (in principle) be implemented effectively.
    Table 6 presents a set of market failures and challenges and certain RBF tools that could be used
to address them. The final selection and structuring of the program or project should be refined
through further questioning various aspects of the specific situation, such as the ones discussed in
the analytical framework presented in Chapter 2.


Behavioral Issues
When the intervention is at the household or individual level, the intended beneficiaries must adopt
a specific behavior or change a habit. Some examples could be starting to wash hands, modifying
garbage disposal practices (to prevent obstruction of drainage canals and creeks), or adopting new
irrigation equipment.
    Often, if people receive adequate information (and training, if necessary), they become conscious
of the benefits of changing their behavior and may do so without requiring any incentive. However, a
very common challenge is to sustain behavioral changes over time, especially when beneficiaries do
not immediately appreciate the benefits of the new behavior, or when this demands more effort than
they are accustomed to (Box 6).
    However, because of the risks of rent-seeking or aid-dependency, it is preferable to limit the length
of time over which the behavior-related incentive is offered. Ideally, this should be limited to a period of
time that is enough to ensure that an educational message can be understood and retained and that
the beneficiaries perceive the benefits of the new behavior and have fully adopted it. The optimal dura-
tion of the incentive will be determined depending on the tradeoff between its cost and the number of
repetitions (of the incentive) necessary to make the new behavior attractive to the beneficiaries.
    This type of behavior-based incentive is typically found in CCTs; however, it not necessarily
directed to the beneficiaries of a program or the entities in charge of mobilizing their behavior change
(through such means as information, communication and education (ICE) campaigns, training, or
promotion). For instance, in the irrigation reform case-study in the North China districts discussed

 Box 6:  Changing Habits in the Area of Waste Management
 Residents of low-income areas in a city may be used to disposing of solid waste in creeks or drainage
 canals; this practice can produce flooding because the garbage obstructs the flow in the drainage
 system. It may also cause environmental damage and can have health implications on the population.
 Such behavior is likely due to a combination of a lack of education and a lack of alternatives because
 of poor infrastructure. To tackle this issue, a cash payment could be justified, conditional on residents
 disposing of solid waste in a specific designated area.

      The agent working with the community to induce the behavioral change could be paid, periodically,
 after verification that the new practice is being followed by the population. These payments could be
 made using the number of households adopting and maintaining the new behavior, defining a certain
 threshold beyond which an agreed amount is paid, or by checking the condition of the creek or canal and
 paying if it is free of garbage.

      However, the scheme could use one or two payments depending on the adoption of the new behavior
 or technology. A first payment could be made when the equipment (if needed) to start with the new
 behavior is acquired or installed (it is preferable to pay upon installation). A second payment could be
 made once that hardware is being used in a consistent manner.

     More information on RBF in solid waste management can be found in: World Bank (Forthcoming).

 Box 7: Inducing New Behavior in Hygiene
 To promote and maintain more hygienic practices among low-income households, while improving
 sanitation conditions, a payment could be made to those households that purchase and install the
 required hardware (concrete slab, rings, or similar elements) to set up their own latrine with hand washing
 facilities (if not already available), once it is verified that the facilities are working properly.

     This payment could be considered a rebate or subsidy that covers the gap between what customers
 can afford to pay and the cost of the hardware once installed. The households may borrow the amount to
 cover the gap from microcredit institutions, family members, or other schemes, and pay it back once they
 receive the RBF payment. This way of structuring a scheme is typical of OBA projects, where a subsidy
 covers the gap to facilitate access to a service.

     A portion of the rebate or subsidy could be withheld until the IVA verifies that the facilities are used
 and household members are washing their hands after doing so. A portion of an OBA subsidy is used to
 induce and fix a desired behavior.

 Box 8:  RBF for Flood Prevention
 A local government governs a town or city traversed by a river downstream from a forested area. If the
 owners of the land upstream of the town choose to develop that forested land, the vegetation cover
 would disappear and the land would become more impervious, reducing the concentration time in the
 catchment and increasing the peak flow through the city. This would put the city at higher risk of flood
 damage and significant capital investments would be required to prevent those damages.

      An agreement could be reached where the local government would use part of the revenues that
 otherwise would be used to build the flood protection infrastructure to pay landowners upstream from
 the city that agree not to develop the land or to develop it preserving, to the extent agreed, its beneficial
 effect on the river flow during rainfall. Depending on the information available, the transaction could
 consider payments related to the level of preservation of the vegetation cover, relative permeability of the
 land, the run-off coefficient, or a combination of these or other parameters.

      The local government could combine the implementation of certain infrastructure works with an
 agreement along the lines described above. An optimization study could be used to define the extent of
 the benefits of such a scheme. One objective could be to maximize the relation between the reduction of
 potential flood damage and the charge to be imposed on the population to implement the plan. Furthermore,
 the analysis could include additional revenues from changes in the allowed land uses as a consequence of
 the implementation of the plan, such as increased opportunities for recreation or ecotourism.

                       Box 9:  Overcoming Supply Constraints in the Provision of Sanitation Infrastructure
                       Due to the low probability of full cost recovery, private investment is not attractive for sanitation
                       infrastructure. Private suppliers are constrained to serving communities/households that have the
                       ability to pay for the full cost of those services. Nonetheless, there are untapped opportunities for
                       creative public–private partnerships (PPPs) that hinge on resource recovery from human waste. Murray
                       et al. (2011) illustrates an example of a community-based biogas recovery and (co)-compost production
                       project. In this model, a private entrepreneur builds a biogas plant for receiving faecal sludge (FS)
                       from multiple community/public toilets. This model enables the sustainable maintenance and timely
                       extraction of FS from toilet blocks. A “reverse tipping fee” is financed through revenues from sales of
                       the gas. Based on local market demand for natural gas products, end uses could include bagging the
                       fuel in transportable biogas pillows for use as a cooking fuel; conversion to electricity using a biogas-fed
                       generator; or purification and compression for use as a transport fuel (see figure below).

                            The initial capital investment required for biogas recovery and upgrading for sales is likely to be a
                       major barrier to entry for small- and medium-scale entrepreneurs. As the authors suggest, microfinance
                       or other lending institutions could be engaged to gain their confidence in such business ventures and to
                       use them to identify and recruit new entrepreneurs to the sector. If the biogas plant is of sufficient scale,
                       the sale of carbon credits on the international market could be another financing option.

Basic Concepts

This section explains some concepts that may apply to the financing arrangements or tools described
and analyzed throughout this document. The explanation starts with a definition from a dictionary (in
italics), and is followed by a definition that is tailored to the context of the subject under analysis.


Incentive:	   Something that motivates or encourages someone to do something.
	             An incentive is the promise of a reward (or the fear of a punishment) that encourages cer-
              tain behaviors and discourages others. Every society has institutions that provide such
              incentives to individuals in different parts of their lives, including rules for hiring workers
              and remunerating them, obeying traffic and tax laws, participating in community activi-
              ties, or fulfilling family obligations. These institutions and associated rules also create an
              environment of incentives for businesses, corporations, government officials, agencies,
              and other organizations. Development programs enter these contexts bringing their own
              complexities, and introduce new incentives that may work with or against some of the
              prevailing incentives (Savedoff, 2011).
Input:	       What is put in, taken in, or operated on by any process or system.
	             Inputs are the financial, human, and other resources mobilized to support activities
              undertaken by a project. Examples would include loan/credit funds and staff (OPCS
              Results Secretariat – World Bank, 2007).
Outcome:	     The way a thing turns out; a consequence.
	             A project outcome is the uptake, adoption, or use of project outputs by the project
              beneficiaries (OPCS Results Secretariat – World Bank, 2007).
Output:	      The amount of something produced by a person, machine, or industry; the action or pro-
              cess of producing something; the power, energy, or other results supplied by a device or
              system.
	             The supply-side deliverables, including the events, products, capital goods, or services
              that result from a development intervention (such as the construction of a school).
	             The key distinction between an output (a specific good or service) and an outcome is that
              an output typically is a change in the supply of goods and services (supply side), while an
              outcome reflects changes in the utilization of goods and services (demand side) (OPCS
              Results Secretariat – World Bank, 2007).
             58   APPLYING RESULTS-BASED FINANCING IN WATER INVESTMENTS




                       Result:	    A thing that is caused or produced by something else; a consequence or outcome.
                       	           Results are the outputs, outcomes, or impacts (intended or unintended, positive or
                                   negative) of a development intervention. The World Bank encourages results that sup-
                                   port sustainable improvements in country outcomes: that is, evident changes in people’s
                                   lives or the behaviors of targeted households, firms, or institutions (OPCS Results Secre-
                                   tariat – World Bank, 2007).
                       Subsidy:	   A sum of money granted by the state or a public body to help an industry or business keep
                                   the price of a commodity or service low; a sum of money granted to support an undertak-
                                   ing held to be in the public interest; a grant or contribution of money.
                       	           Public funding used to fill the gap between the total cost of providing a service to a user
                                   and the user fees charged for that service. The use of subsidies may be justified by policy
                                   concerns such as improving basic living conditions for the poor or reducing disease
                                   (Mumssen, Johannes, & Kumar, 2010).
                       	           The financial value of a subsidy is equal to the money that the utility loses by providing
                                   the subsidy. Specifically, it is the difference between the cost of providing the service and
                                   the payment made by the household to receive that service (Komives, Foster, Halpern, &
                                   Wodon, 2005) (pages 53 and 116).
                       	           From a demand-side (consumer) approach, which relies on household survey data—
                                   including data about consumption of water and the price paid for it—the subsidy amount
                                   is computed as the difference between what the consumer actually paid and the price
                                   that “should have been paid,” given observed consumption and a “normal” price” (Le
                                   Blanc, 2008).
                       	           From a supply-side (utility) approach, where the point of view is that of the government
                                   and the unit of observation is the utility, subsidies to consumers are calculated as the
                                   difference between transfers from the government to the utility, minus all the losses
                                   incurred by the utility due to inefficiencies. The government provides a transfer to the
                                   utility to help it cope with current expenditure requirements (either to break even or to
                                   achieve a profit). The proportion of this amount that goes to end-consumers is reduced
                                   by any loss of efficiency occurring from production, distribution, billing, or collection of
                                   payments. The problem is then to measure these losses. The latter two types of losses
                                   can be measured directly; the former two can be estimated by benchmarking (Le Blanc,
                                   2008).
                       	           A distinguishing feature of water and sanitation subsidies is whether they seek to reduce
