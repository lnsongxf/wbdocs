IFC INVESTMENTS IN HIGH QUALITY HOTELS: Promoting jobs,
business infrastructure, tax revenues, and local supply chains


March 2016
ABOUT IFC
International Finance Corporation, a member of the World Bank Group, is the largest global development institution
focused exclusively on leveraging the power of the private sector to tackle the world’s most pressing development
challenges. Working with private enterprises in more than 100 countries, IFC uses its capital, expertise, and influence
to help eliminate extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity.

ABOUT THE CASE STUDY
Tourism is a major contributor to employment, foreign exchange earnings, and tax revenues for developing countries.
Hotels and tourism generate economic activity for small- and medium-sized businesses, which supply goods and services
both during construction and operations. This study examines the developmental impact of three of IFC’s hotel
investments: the Mövenpick Ambassador Hotel in Ghana, the Azalaï Grand Hotel in Mali, and the Shangri-La group’s
Villingili hotel in Maldives.

IFC INVESTMENTS IN HOTELS


IFC invests in hotels and tourism because of the industry’s strong development
impact, particularly for low-income countries and fragile and con ict-affected
states.

IFC STRATEGY
IFC seeks to develop critical infrastructure in places where there is often a lack of international standard
hotels. These investments send a positive signal to other investors and are often among the rst private
sector investments in a transitional economy. They are an effective way to help establish a conducive
environment for investment, and to create mixed-use developments and real estate venues for international
conferences. IFC’s long-term perspective and exibility is particularly relevant for hotel investments which,
by their nature, require long-term nancing, long grace periods and exible nancial instruments. IFC
also works with hotel companies to reduce their environmental footprint through investment in energy
and water saving technologies.

AN IN DEPTH LOOK AT THREE IFC HOTEL INVESTMENTS
IFC engaged Oxford Economics and Dalberg Global Development Advisors to gather data and assess the
developmental impact of three of its hotel investments.

The Mövenpick Ambassador Hotel in Ghana is a ve-star hotel with of ce and retail space located in
Accra’s central business district. The Shangri-La group’s Villingili hotel in Maldives is a ve-star island
resort and spa and the Azalaï Grand Hotel in Mali is a four-star business hotel catering primarily to
business travelers to the capital of Bamako. Mövenpick Ambassador Hotel and Azalaï Grand Hotel
received IFC loans for rehabilitation. Shangri-La in Maldives received loans for green- eld construction.

The study included a quantitative economic impact assessment of the operational activity of each hotel
during 2014. This impact was modelled based on input data gathered via a survey questionnaire of each
hotel and an Input-Output (IO) model of each economy estimated using relevant of cial data. Using this
data, the team quanti ed the economic footprint of each hotel including direct spending, spending on
procurement of goods and services and employee consumer spending. Effects were measured in terms of
contribution to GDP, headcount employment and tax revenues.

The study also documents the ndings of the evaluation team on the broader ways through which
each hotel contributes to economic development. This analysis drew upon insights gathered during the
 eldtrips, in particular through interviews conducted with stakeholders such as hotel staff, suppliers and
other operators in the tourism industry.

   OVERALL RESULTS
      JOBS

      1.	   Hotels create and sustain a large number of jobs, particularly indirect and induced jobs through
            procurement of goods and services, and jobs supported by consumer spending of hotel and supply chain
            employees.
      2.	 Hotels create productive jobs. Across all cases, labor productivity of hotel employees was above the
          economy-wide average. Above average productivity supported above-average wages. Salaries exceed the
          minimum wage, with bonuses and compensation for overtime and other non-wage benefits. Training is
          provided and opportunities for career progression are more readily available.
      3.	 Higher class hotels create more jobs. Shangri-La created three to five times more jobs per room than the
          other two, reflecting the luxury class and all-inclusive nature of the resort.
      4.	 Hotels have a diverse workforce. Hotels tend to employ more women and youth, relative to other
          industries, contributing to a more diverse workforce.
      5.	 Hotels develop local supply chains. Local purchasing of goods and services by hotels develop supplier
          businesses. Many of the supplier firms interviewed in the case studies have grown since starting to work with
          the hotel, with a number of interviewees stating that the hotel had played an important role in supporting
          such growth.

      LOCAL ECONOMIC FOOTPRINT

      1.	   Hotels make strong contributions to GDP. Both the Grand Hotel and the Mövenpick’s contributions
            to GDP in 2014—gross profits, compensation to staff, procurement of goods and services from domestic
            firms, and consumer spending by employees—were broadly equivalent to their turnover. Shangri-La’s total
            contribution to GDP was about one-third lower than its turnover, reflecting weaker linkages to the domestic
            supply chain, due to the fact that Maldives is a small island economy with a very limited industrial base.
      2.	 Hotels promote local economic activity through guest spending. Hotels enable further expenditure
          in the local economy as guests consume goods and services outside of the hotel, which in turn supports
          an additional chain of economic activity. Industries that tend to benefit most include restaurants, retail,
          recreational and leisure services and transport services.
      3.	 Hotels contribute significant tax revenues for the government, which can help support vital social
          programs and infrastructure investment that have important development impact. The scope of
          this particular impact heavily depends on a country’s specific tax structure. Shangri-La’s contribution to tax
          revenue as a share of its overall economic impact was significantly higher than the others. This partly reflects
          that Maldives is a more highly taxed economy, with a well-defined tax and land-lease framework for resort
          tourism, compared to either Ghana or Mali. In general, hotels that operate in tourism-centric economies are
          likely to have a higher direct tax footprint, other things equal.


      BUILDING WORKFORCE SKILLS

      1.	   An international quality hotel often serves as a training center for their employees. Hotels invest in
            training their employees at all levels, on a regular basis. They are often a point of entry for unskilled workers,
            who are then trained. Investing in training supports the local economy as employees take on new positions
            or establish their own businesses. This supports obvious benefits to hotel employees in terms of their skills
            development, but also to other firms or hotels within the local economy to the extent that employees took
            on positions elsewhere.

      2.	 High end hotels have strict standards. Improved product standards demanded by high-end hotels from
          their suppliers spill over throughout the supply chain. In some cases, hotels were found to have actively
          intervened to support this process by providing direct training to its suppliers.

AZALAÏ GRAND HOTEL (GH), MALI


Long-term Partnership for Development
Mossadeck Bally is a Malian businessman who, backed with IFC financing, invested in The Grand Hotel,
a colonial-era hotel in central Bamako, privatized by the Malian government in 1994. The hotel required
extensive renovations. Total cost of the project was $2.6 million, with just under $1 million financed by
IFC. IFC made a second loan of $1.68 million in 2003 to continue improvements to the hotel. Today, the
Grand Hotel is a destination for business travelers, and Mr. Bally has built up the Azalaï Hotels Group, a
chain of seven business hotels spread across four countries in West Africa.

The Azalaï Grand Hotel’s development impact in Mali—a conflict-affected country located in the Sahel
where almost half the population lives in poverty—has been significant. Though business travelers
account for the majority of visitors, today Mali has the second largest number of World Heritage sites in
West Africa—cultural assets with potential for developing a leisure travel industry.

THE MÖVENPICK AMBASSADOR HOTEL,
GHANA


Restoring a Landmark to Former Glory
The Ambassador Hotel Accra was originally developed by the United Kingdom and presented to the government of
Ghana as a gift on the attainment of independence in 1957. Once a national heritage, the building degenerated over
the years until it was disposed of by the state. The Ambassador was given a new lease on life in 2006, when the old
establishment was demolished to give way to a modern five-star luxury hotel.

The reconstructed hotel was developed by KHI Ghana Limited, a subsidiary of Kingdom Hotels Investments (KHI),
a leading global hotel and resort investment company with operations in emerging and frontier markets across Asia,
the Middle East, North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa. KHI Ghana agreed under a 50-year concession to invest
$104 million in rebuilding the Ambassador Hotel into a five-star luxury hotel under the management of the upscale
Mövenpick brand with space for offices and retail. The 2008 global financial crisis made it difficult for KHI to secure

MALDIVES


Creating Jobs in a Nation of Atolls
Crystal-clear blue water and 26 white sand atolls make up the Republic of Maldives. Tourism has
helped the country transform from one of the poorest countries in the world thirty years ago to a
middle-income country today. Villingili is a large island with lush vegetation, palm trees and three
natural lagoons located in the southernmost part of the country. The government planned the luxury
Shangri-La’s Villingili Resort and Spa together with Shangri-La Group, a leading owner and operator of
deluxe hotels and resorts in Asia, the Middle East, North America and Europe. When the government
was unable to meet investment obligations to the project, IFC helped finance the $143 million
investment project with a $50 million loan.
