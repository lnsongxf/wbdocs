THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in the economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

Mauritius is a set of specific procedures—the
bureaucratic and legal steps that an entrepreneur
must complete to incorporate and register a new                 Legal form: Private Limited Liability Company
firm. These are identified by Doing Business through
collaboration with relevant local professionals and             Paid-in minimum capital requirement: MUR 0
the study of laws, regulations and publicly available           City: Port Louis
information on business entry in that economy.
Following is a detailed summary of those procedures,            Start-up Capital: 10 times GNI per capita
along with the associated time and cost. These
procedures are those that apply to a company
matching      the    standard     assumptions      (the
“standardized company”) used by Doing Business in
collecting the data (see the section in this chapter on
what the indicators measure).

       Register at the Registrar of Companies and Reserve a unique
       company name

       Searching for a unique company name can be conducted at the Office
       of the Registrar or online for free. Name reservation costs MUR 100 but
       is not mandatory as per the amendments brought to section 31 of the
       Companies Act 2001 through the Business Facilitation (miscellaneous
       provisions) Act 2006.

       To register, the entrepreneur then completes the company
       incorporation form and the business registration form including the
       relevant business details and submits them either online or to the
       Registrar of Companies after payment of fees has been affected either
                                                                                                   MUR 3,000 as
       online or on-site. The registration fee for private companies is MUR                      registration fees +
       3000 + MUR 200 for the certificate of incorporation + MUR 200 for the                      MUR 200 for the
   1   Summary of File. In order to promote online registration, the fee to           2 days        certificate of

       website: http://companies.govmu.org/. The entrepreneur then obtains                        Summary of File
       the Business Registration Card which includes the unique identifier
       (business registration number) and the Certificate of Incorporation.

       Upon incorporation, the Registrar of Companies updates the online
       Central Business Registration Database with the details of the registered
       companies. The Mauritius Revenue Authority, Local Authority
       (Municipality) & the Ministry of Social Security are connected to the
       Central Business Registration Database system, which is located at the
       Registrar of Companies. Therefore, once a company is incorporated, it is
       automatically registered for taxes and does not need to file a separate
       application at the Tax Office. The information of the employer is
       electronically shared with the Ministry of Social Security (MSS).

      Obtain building and land use permit

      As of October 1, 2006, a single permit, the building and land-use
      permit (BLP), has replaced both the development permit and the
      building permit. The authority for execution and enforcement of
      the Building Act and of the Town and Country Planning Act is the
      local authority of the town or district where the relevant
      establishment is to be built or the land to be developed.

      Every application for a building and land-use permit must be in
      accordance with provisions of the Building Act, the Town and
      Country Planning Act, and the Planning and Development Act of
      2004. The following documents are required in addition to the
      application:

      • Copy of the title deed or copy of the lease and planning
      clearance from the Ministry of Housing and Lands if for state
      land
      • Consent of owner and copy of the owner’s national identity
      card
      • Copy of the national identity card of the applicant
      • Three sets of plans, comprising site and location plans, layout,      21 days      MUR 65,530

      elevations, and sections
      • Public notification by way of plate display and notice in two
      daily newspapers (for development within residential zones)
      • Consent of neighbors (not required in this case because it is
      industrial). Consent is required if the distance between the new
      building and neighboring constructions is less than 1 meter for
      one-story buildings and 1.5 meters for two-story buildings.
      • PER/environmental impact assessment (EIA) license for
      scheduled undertakings: The PER is for small projects, while the
      EIA is for larger ones with a potential environmental impact.
      Neither applies to the warehouse assessed in the Doing Business
      case study.
      • All plans must be signed by the draughtsman for buildings of
      less than 250 sq. m. in floor area and must include the name and
      address. The total floor area is to be indicated on the site plan,
      while the floor area for each level is to be indicated on the
      corresponding floor plans
      • For buildings of 150 sq. m. or more in floor area, all plans are to
      be signed by a registered professional architect, including the
      architect’s name, address, VAT registration number, and
      registration number with the Professional Architects Council. The

      plans. The application form can be obtained from the Planning
      Department of any local authority, Small Enterprises and
      Handicraft Development Authority (SEHDA), the Board of
      Investment, or the Ministry of Local Government, or it can be
      downloaded from various Web sites, including the Web sites of
      the agencies mentioned above.

      In accordance with the Local Government Act 2011, applications
      for the building and land-use permit that are in accordance with
      the act and guidelines should be reviewed within 14 working
      days of the date of receipt of the application. Upon approval of
      the Executive Committee, the building and land use permit is
      issued.

      The costs associated with the application for the dual permit
      include an application fee of MUR 500, plus charges computed
      based on land area as follows:
      • MUR 10.00 per sq. m. for areas of 250 sq. m. or less
      • MUR 20.00 per sq. m. for areas ranging from 251 to 500 sq. m.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

        for the Registrar General to complete the transcription and give the
        Transcription Number (TN) to the notary.




        After the TN has been issued, the Land registry will verify and re-assess
        the transaction through internal processes. The Notary will subsequently
        pick up the registered deed and will keep the document for 40 years and
        then transmit it to the Chief Archivist, National Archives Department for
        safe keeping. If this time limit is not respected, there is a penalty of 50%

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

                                  receiver if the charge document allows it to do so, or alternatively, make an
                              application for the court to appoint a receiver over the assets of Mirage (Sections
                                 185 and 186 of the Insolvency Act). Under section 204 of the Insolvency Act,
                              BizBank, as secured creditor, will be reimbursed after payment of receiver´s fees.
                                The receiver has the power, as per section 190 of the Insolvency Act, to sell the

                               the creditors would be paid according to their rank. BizBank would be paid 5th.

                                According to our estimations, it takes 20 months to complete the receivership
                                              procedure in Port Louis. The main steps are as follows :
                              (i)        The receiver will communicate its appointment through the press 7 days
                                                  after its appointment and inform the regulators;
                                  (ii)      The directors are required to submit to the receiver the statement of
                                  accounts of Mirage 14 days after the notice by the receiver. The receiver will

years)                           (iii)      The receiver prepares its first report 2 months after its appointment.
                                                   Then, it will submit the report to the regulator;
                                (iv)      Every 6 months, the receiver will prepare a report stating the revenues
                                       and payments as well as other steps undertaken during the period;
                               (v)        The receiver will find a buyer and negotiate the sale. It must also agree
                                                     with the buyer to take over the employees;
                                       (vi)     The sale of the business as a going concern will take place.


                                   According to our estimations, the receivership procedure will cost 4,247,000

would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in

economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
