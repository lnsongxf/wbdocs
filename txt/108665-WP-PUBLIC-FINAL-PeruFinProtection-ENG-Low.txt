                            increased expenses for emergency care, for example, the purchase of food and the cost of

probability—PML (probable   based on the minimum loss that could occur with a given annual probability. The level of loss
maximum loss) curves        associated with an exceedance probability is called probable maximum loss (PML). Technically,

Introduction
Disasters associated with the effect of natural
events pose a major challenge for economic
stability and fiscal sustainability in Peru.
The country is exposed to a number of natural
hazards because of its location and its geographic,
                                                                                  01
                                                       In March 2011, a Directorate of Risk Management
                                                       (Dirección de Gestión de Riesgos, or DGR) was
                                                       established within the Ministry of Economy and
                                                       Finance (Ministerio de Economía y Finanzas, or
                                                       MEF). It is entrusted with identifying, evaluating,
social, and economic characteristics. Disasters        and monitoring financial, operational, and
associated with natural hazards have had adverse       contingent fiscal risks, whether legal, contractual,
social and fiscal consequences throughout              or derived from natural disasters, and proposing

adopting the comprehensive approach described
                                                       Under the SINAGERD Law, the MEF is responsible

management. Accordingly, an act establishing           context has given rise to the development

                                                       2	 The Government has integrated disaster risk management into
of new risks, and mobilize resources both for             all programs and policies. In addition to developing a Program

                                                          has incorporated DRM into the design, preparation, and

     As mentioned earlier, another major hazard in the
     country is flooding associated with the El Niño
     phenomenon, which has an especially severe
     effect on the production and infrastructure
     sectors. Peru is acutely vulnerable to severe
     variations in weather patterns such as those
     triggered by El Niño. The measure of this effect
     can be seen in the economic losses attributed to
     El Niño in 1982–83 (US$3,283 million) and 1997–
     98 (US$3,500 million)—losses equivalent to 11.6
     percent of annual GDP for 1983 and 6.2 percent
     of annual GDP for 1998.10 Climate change is
     expected to increase the frequency or severity
     of droughts, freezes, and frequent heavy rains
     such as those that occurred in the southern and
     central mountains in 2010.

Disaster Risk Finance helps countries improve financial resilience against natural
disasters by implementing sustainable and cost-effective financial protection policies and
operations. It supports governments, businesses, and households manage the financial
impacts of disaster and climate risks without compromising sustainable development,
fiscal stability, or wellbeing. Financial protection complements investments in risk
reduction, prevention, and building resilience. It addresses residual risk, which is either
not feasible or not cost effective to reduce or prevent.


Only by looking at the financial impact of disasters comprehensively can governments
build the financial resilience of society as a whole. This publication proposes an operational
framework to guide countries in developing and implementing such comprehensive
financial protection strategies. It also takes stock of the progress in the field to date.


The Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance Program (DRFIP) is a joint program of the World
Bank’s Finance & Markets Global Practice and the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction
and Recovery (GFDRR). DRFIP has provided advisory services on disaster risk financing
and insurance to more than 40 countries worldwide.
