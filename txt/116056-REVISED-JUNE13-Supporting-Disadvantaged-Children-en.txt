Abstract

Equalizing opportunities among children is a critical human development challenges. There is a growing concern
that children from disadvantaged families lag behind children from advantaged families because the former do
not participate in quality early childhood development opportunities, including preschool, as much as the latter.
A crucial question is thus to find efficient ways to increase kindergarten participation of children in poor com-
munities. This paper presents findings from a large scale multi-arm randomized control trial implemented in
2014-2015 across 236 poor settlements across Bulgaria with the aim to improve full-day kindergarten participa-
tion of poor children, especially Roma and Turkish. It finds that removing the costs of kindergarten reduced the
share of children aged 3-6 not registered in kindergarten by half – while also significantly increasing attendance
by about 20%. Additional financial incentives of either BGN7 or BGN20 monthly conditional on attendance had
no clear impact on registration and attendance, suggesting that financial cost is a more important barrier than
behavioral issues. Organizing community meetings to provide information about the importance of kindergar-
ten also did not impact participation in kindergarten, although it slightly improved parental perceptions of the
benefit of kindergarten and raised parental aspirations for their children – especially girls. Overall, removing
kindergarten costs was thus the most cost-effective strategy to increase kindergarten participation. However,
the effect on short-term child development – emergent literacy, numeracy, motor and socio-emotional skills –
is mixed: slightly positive for Bulgarian children, while negative for Roma and Turkish children. These results
suggest that all children may not immediately benefit from kindergarten, especially minority children who may
need additional support to successfully transition to, and benefit from, kindergarten exposure.

Introduction

Objectives
The primary objective of this impact evaluation is to provide policy relevant information on how to most cost-
effectively increase kindergarten participation in disadvantaged communities in Bulgaria.


Value added of this evaluation
Equalizing opportunities among children is a critical human development challenges. There is a growing concern
that children from disadvantaged families lag behind children from advantaged families because the former
do not participate in quality early childhood development opportunities, including preschool, as much as the
latter. International evidence underscores the critical importance of an early start to support children – poor
children especially – reach their full potential. Against this background, finding cost-effective strategies that pro-
mote greater access to quality preschool and create a supportive early learning environment for disadvantaged
children is critically important. This study aims to inform policy making with hard evidence on how most cost-
efficiently encourage participation in early education programs and its short-term effects on child development.


Country and policy context of the evaluation
The inequities start early in life: the UNDP/World Bank/EC regional Roma survey (2011) from Bulgaria,
Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, and Czech Republic found that while more than 75% of all children aged 3-6 na-
tionally are in preschool, the large majority of disadvantaged children are not. The European Commission
encourages Member States to increase preschool participation. The EC Communication on an EU
Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies (EC, 2011) issued in April 2011 and endorsed by the
European Council on 24 June 2011 calls on all Member States to “widen access to quality early childhood educa-
tion and care” (p.6), and, referring to the February 2011 communication “Early Childhood Education and Care:
Providing all our children with the best start for the world of tomorrow”, it argues for increased access to high
quality non-segregated early childhood education.

Bulgaria has similarly seen an increased emphasis on preschool. Legal amendments from September
2010 provide for 2 years of compulsory preschool education to encompass all 5 and 6-year-olds. The municipal-
ities had 2 years to ensure that they could accommodate all children. For 5 and 6-year-old children, the educa-
tional services are free of charge. However, kindergartens charge fees to cover additional non-education costs
and many ask parents to provide some in-kind supplies. Most of these costs were removed in the “free access”
intervention. At the time this study began in September 2014, participating in some form of preschool programs
was thus de jure compulsory and free of charge for the 5 and 6-year-old children.

In the context of Bulgaria, families with monthly income less than or equal to BGN 350 per family member re-
ceive a child allowance for each child aged 1 or more. For children aged 5 and 6, this allowance is conditional
on the child regularly attending a preparatory preschool group (either half-day or full day), unless this is impos-
sible due to the condition of the child’s health. In 2014, the monthly child allowance was BGN 35 per month.

Whether the above legal provisions were successful in eliminating the costs and raising preschool rates among
Roma children was not clear.

Full-day kindergartens are the preferred modality for early childhood education in Bulgaria.
Kindergartens serve 3 to 6-year-old children (but only the 5-6-year-old groups are referred to as preschool).
Children study in the morning from 8 to 12, they are provided morning and afternoon snacks and lunch, then take
a nap, and then play until 4 or 5pm. In 2014 and 2015 approx. 92% of all children enrolled in public early child

education programs attended a full day kindergarten. While the number of children enrolled in all available
types of kindergartens slightly decreased by 0.1% in 2015 over 2014, the full day kindergarten enrollments
increased by 0.6%. Most parents are given the choice between a full day kindergarten programs for ages 5 and
6 (compulsory pre-schooling) and half day free programs, which at the time were delivered only in primary
schools. Most 5 and 6-year-old children are enrolled in full day kindergarten programs, which also reflect pa-
rental choice, even if the full day program comes at a cost of kindergarten fees. It should also be noted that kin-
dergarten in cities fill up quickly and it is hard to find a place if the first kindergarten enrolment of a child takes
place when it is 5-6-year-old. Once a child is enrolled at 3 years, its place and enrollment in the kindergarten is
reserved, thus making new enrollments difficult, even for children with most pressing need. Therefore, poorer
parents who choose not to pay for kindergarten for their 3-4-year-old children stand a greater chance of not
having a choice where to enroll the child at 5-6 but the cost free half-day preschool programs delivered at basic
and primary schools.

The cost of full-day kindergartens is shared between the central government, local governments and families,
from which the municipalities collect the kindergarten fees. The central government funding covers pedagogical
and part of the running non-wage operating costs and comes from per capita based block grants transferred to
municipalities, which in turn are channeled in full to the full-day kindergartens using a formula, mostly accord-
ing to the number of children enrolled in them. The average per child governmental financing of full-day kinder-
gartens was BGN 1730 in 2015, up by 5% from the 2014 level of BGN 1655.

Local government funding covers infrastructure maintenance, as well as part of the running non-wage operating
costs (food, transportation, materials and similar items) through the kindergarten fee revenues. The full-day kin-
dergarten fees paid by families are determined by local governments within a centrally defined framework (the
Local Taxes and Fees Act) and are collected from parents/primary caregivers directly by the kindergartens. Some
municipalities set daily fees; others determine a monthly fee for full attendance that is prorated for the actual
days attended; yet others apply a combination of the two methods. In a few cases, fees differ monthly according
to the cost of the food. The average annual per child amount of full-day kindergartens fees was estimated BGN
176, down by 2% from BGN 183 in 2014, according to official data.

The population targeted in this study comprises disadvantaged, mostly ethnically-segregated
communities. There are approximately 10-12 million Roma in Europe, the vast majority of whom live in deep
poverty and are suffering from economic and social exclusion. The UNDP/World Bank/EC regional Roma sur-
vey (2011) finds that more than one third of Roma children in Eastern Europe go hungry at least once per month.
And, while more than 80% of Roma parents report wishing at least a secondary education for their sons and
daughters, less than 25% complete a secondary education. Coupled with discrimination, these factors result in
very large gaps in labor market outcomes and extremely low productivity rates compared to average rates found
in the poorest 25% of countries globally (WB, 20121). With Roma numbering up to 700,000 (based on enumera-
tor assessment), Bulgaria has one of the largest Roma populations in Europe. This study therefore pays particu-
lar attention to minority (Roma and Turkish) families as they face multiple disadvantages.


Literature Review
In October 2011, two Lancet papers reviewing the scientific literature underscore the importance
of early childhood development (ECD) interventions, especially in addressing inequalities facing
disadvantaged populations. The first review article2 underscores that inequalities in child development be-
gin prenatally and in the first years of life. These inequalities include insufficient early intake of micronutrients
(certain minerals and vitamins) and lower levels of cognitive stimulation, with large implications for the child’s
development. The evidence reviewed underscores that the most effective and cost-efficient time to prevent

inequalities is early in life before trajectories have been firmly established. The second scientific review article3
assesses the effectiveness of early child development interventions. It concludes that parenting support and pre-
school enrolment can improve early child development, “[…] with effects greater for programs of higher quality
and for the most vulnerable children.”

Heckman et al. (2013)4 similarly conclude from a review of the impact evaluation literature that high-quality
intervention programs targeting disadvantaged children generally show either beneficial or no effects from the
program on child and later life outcomes. And, differences in program quality can generally explain lack of treat-
ment effects. For example, a well-known study by Baker, Gruber and Milligan (2008)5 investigates the effects of
Quebec’s universal childcare program on parental and child outcomes. It finds a significant and large impact on
parental labor supply. However, it also finds several adverse effects of this program on children’s socio-emotion-
al skills, and point to more hostile, less consistent parenting, worse parental health, and lower-quality parental
relationships as likely explanations that weren’t sufficiently being compensated by the childcare settings. More
recently, Garcia et al. (2016) study the long-run benefits of two daycare/preschool interventions: the Carolina
Abecedarian Project and the Carolina Approach to Responsive Education. The findings show significant posi-
tive impacts overall but also highlight the importance of the quality dimension and show negative impacts of
low-quality programs on boys6.

In 2012, the World Bank, using results from a regional household survey with a specific focus on preschool, con-
cludes with four main policy measures to increase preschool enrollment and improve early learning at home for
Roma children:

(1) 
    better inform parents on the benefits of preschool for children’s later-life outcomes;

(2) p
     romote inclusive preschools by reaching out to parents and by involving them more directly in preschool
    with the help of Roma teaching assistants;

(3) remove cost barriers possibly coupled with regular attendance subsidies, and

(4) support parenting at home.

These conclusions follow from the finding that the vast majority of Roma parents wish their children to complete
secondary education, but that many also stated a desire to raise children at home in their early years when asked
why they did not enroll their children in preschool. Cost was also a consideration. Almost half of parents report-
ed being willing to reconsider enrollment if there were a Roma teaching assistant. More than half said they would
reconsider if there were no fees, or if they received food coupons.

Practical experience from several government and NGO-led initiatives also support these conclusions. An ex-
ample is Hungary’s much higher enrollment coupled with programs to remove cost barriers and even provide
explicit subsidies to enroll children based on conditional attendance. Another example is the project Every Child
in Pre-school and Kindergarten, initiated by the Romanian NGO OvidiuRo, which includes food coupons condi-
tional on attendance. As this program seemed successful based on attendance data collected, it has been imple-
mented into law in 2015.

Theory of Change

The theory of change that motivates the design of the interventions being evaluated is based on
a simple model of human capital formation. A model of human capital posits that parents invest in the
human capital of their children up to the point where the additional (marginal) expected benefits equal the ad-
ditional (marginal) costs. The expected benefits from preschool are embodied in the expected improvement in
cognitive and socio-emotional skills that will be subsequently leveraged in school to achieve better educational
outcomes and consequently in terms of higher income and quality of life. The interventions are designed to raise
the expected benefit and lower the costs of early education.

An information component of the intervention is intended to help parents better understand the
returns of preschool education and increase their perception of expected benefits. This component
also is expected to make more salient the connection between preschool activities and child development. The
information component may also work in a subtler way by increasing parental trust in the kindergarten to treat
their children well and fairly. It should decrease parental concern with the perceived relative social status gap
between them and kindergarten staff and non-Roma parents. Based on the Economics and Identity literature,
increased trust should reduce negative self-social stereotyping so that a quality education becomes part of the
“possible selves” for young Roma.

Free access to kindergarten is the most natural way to lower the monetary costs of early edu-
cation. The study will include villages or towns where a kindergarten is available so that accessibility – trans-
portation costs or opportunity cost of time for transportation for instance – won’t be a first-order issue. In our
sample, distance is reasonable, with 62% of respondents walking less than 15 minutes to kindergartens, 31%
between 15 and 30 minutes, and 7% more than 30 minutes. Distance to kindergarten is also similar for majority
and minority children in our sample. Thus, eliminating the direct financial cost of kindergarten (fees and other
financial contributions from parents to cover the purchase of supplies for the classroom) will remove the afford-
ability barrier to early education.

Finally, a conditional financial incentive increases the direct utility from having a child at kin-
dergarten since it provides an additional disposable income to the household7. Conditional cash
transfers have become popular in the past decade around the world. The conditional cash transfer is given to
the family on a regular basis (typically a month) conditional on the fact that the child enrolled in the policy
attend school a given amount of time (typically 80% or 90% of time). This policy has proved effective at in-
creasing school enrolment and attendance in many countries (mostly in Latin America). Because it works as
an incentive, the conditional cash transfer can help parents overcome all barriers listed above: the affordabili-
ty barrier, the lack of awareness about the benefits of preschool education, the reluctance due to the social gap,
and the domination of other preferences over pre-school education. However, such incentives require careful
monitoring and may be cost-ineffective. Simply providing free early education may be sufficient provided
there are no other barriers in the way, such as lack of awareness about preschool benefits and/or limited social
interaction between Roma parents and non-Roma kindergarten officials.




   The conditional financial incentives provided under this study are on top of the existing government child allowance program, the payment
7. 
   of which is conditioned on regular preschool attendance for children aged 5 and 6 and is unconditional for younger children.

Description of the Intervention

The Springboard for School Readiness intervention was jointly designed by the World Bank and the Trust for
Social Achievement (TSA). The program was financed by TSA. TSA is a foundation created and funded by the
America for Bulgaria Foundation (ABF). Established in 2008, ABF has been funding programs for economically
disadvantaged people, including Roma. TSA partnered with 23 Bulgarian NGOs and collaborated with local kin-
dergarten and municipal authorities.

All interventions were implemented in disadvantaged communities and full-day kindergartens.



Intervention Arms
The intervention had the following components:

Intervention A:	Free access to full-day kindergartens. The intervention intended to cover the full
                 cost of education to eligible households to ensure that affordability is not an obstacle.
                 The cost of education includes attendance fees as well as other formal costs: school sup-
                 plies for 3-4-year-old children and laboratory tests (stool and urine) required upon en-
                 rolment or after prolonged absences. The financial contributions to kindergartens were
                 directly paid to the kindergartens by the program partner. Since the 2010 legal provision
                 making preschool compulsory for 5 and 6-year-old children also requires an absence of
                 fees for the educational services (but not for care like food, toilet papers, etc.), the inter-
                 vention is expected to especially benefit younger children aged 3-4, at least to the extent
                 that the completely cost-free alternatives (half-day programs delivered at kindergartens
                 and primary schools) are available only for children aged 5 and 6 years.

Intervention B: 	Free access to full-day kindergartens + conditional BGN 7 incentive (approx-
                  imately Euro 3.5). This intervention offered the same as the previous one and added
                  a small financial incentive: a monthly bonus was offered to the family on the condition
                  that the child attended full-day kindergartens daily (except for absences because of ill-
                  ness). The monthly bonus was kept small (20% of the child benefit allowance) to serve
                  as a nudge more than a financial gain. If families tend to prefer that their child attend
                  kindergarten but fail at doing so because of time inconsistencies and lack of attention, a
                  small amount may be sufficient to increase kindergarten participation. Again, the impact
                  on parental behavior of this intervention is expected to be larger for 3 and 4-year-old
                  children to the extent that this financial incentive is conditioned on attendance, unlike
                  the child allowances for children aged 3 and 4 years, which is paid by the government
                  unconditionally.

Intervention C:	Free access to full-day kindergartens + conditional BGN 20 incentive (ap-
                 proximately Euro 10). This intervention offered the same as the previous one except
                 that the incentive is larger (60% of the child benefit allowance). The larger incentive
                 may be more efficient at increasing kindergarten participation than the small one in case
                 parents have strong reasons why their kid does not attend kindergarten: they do not like
                 kindergarten education, they have important opportunity costs of time going to kinder-
                 garten and back home, etc. Similarly to previous interventions, the impact of this inter-
                 vention is expected to be greater for the 3 and 4-year-old children, but considering the
                 larger amount, impacts on parental behaviors for the 5-6-years-old children cannot be
                 ruled out.

Intervention D:	Information about the benefits of education and promoting interaction be-
                 tween parents and full-day kindergarten officials. The intervention consisted
                 of 5 public community meetings with duration of 45 to 90 minutes each at the kin-
                 dergartens organized by the 23 implementing NGOs, for a total of about 6 hours over
                 10 months. The information campaign did not deal with parental skills and appropri-
                 ate home-learning environment. The intervention provides parents with information
                 about the benefits of kindergarten education to raise awareness about its importance
                 for the further education and professional life of their child, and to encourage parents
                 to feel more at ease in the kindergarten environment, with session 2 being a presen-
                 tation by the teachers and session 3 an “open house” were parents were invited to
                 class. These also promoted the interaction between parents and kindergarten officials.
                 The concept was thus a “mediation and information campaign”. All households with
                 children aged 3-5 years were invited to join the meetings through advertising by social
                 workers and posters. The design and content of the information sessions are detailed
                 in Appendix V.

	
 To ensure compliance with the program, TSA designed a detailed monitoring scheme,
 which included random spot checks of the participating NGOs and kindergartens.

	The assignment of the specific intervention(s) was done in a randomized way, described
  in detail in the methodology section below.



Intervention Implementation
The Trust for Social Achievement launched the project in August 2014. 16 of the 23 contracted NGOs were
Roma-led. TSA trained each of the NGOs and each of full-day kindergarten principals participating in the
financial interventions.

An implementation constraint in some communities was that there was not enough room to enroll all the el-
igible children that would like to enroll. This is not a constraint for the evaluation as this is something that is
part of the reality on the ground.

Figure 1 shows the allocation of financial interventions across the communities (it does not represent the
allocation of the information campaign across the communities, which was equally distributed to half of the
communities within each financial intervention). One color stands for one financial intervention: yellow for
control communities, blue for free access communities, green for free access + BGN 7 incentive communi-
ties, and red for free access + BGN 20 incentive communities. Four communities in which TSA carried out a
pilot study during 2013-2014 (and for that reason are excluded from this evaluation) are displayed as orange
stars.

Cost of the interventions
These interventions have different costs. Free access to full-day kindergarten is expected to be less expen-
sive than free access combined with financial incentives, while the information treatment is expected to be less
expensive than free access to full-day kindergarten.

Based on the accounting records of TSA during the school year 2014-2015 and the number of targeted children
in each treatment arm (see below for a description of the study design), we estimate that the per targeted child
cost of each intervention are as follows:

   Intervention A:	
                            Free access to full-day kindergartens = BGN 350 per targeted child8
   Intervention B:	
                            Free access + conditional BGN 7 incentive = BGN 412 per targeted child
   Intervention C:	
                           Free access + conditional BGN 20 incentive = BGN 528 per targeted child
   Intervention D: 	
                    Information campaign = BGN 50-100 per targeted child (depending on the number of
                     children aged 3-6 in the settlement, the cost if this intervention being largely a fixed cost)

These estimates confirm that the information campaign is the least expensive treatment – 4 to 7
times cheaper than free access to full-day kindergarten, while free access + conditional BGN 7 incentive
is 17% more expensive, and free access + conditional BGN 20 incentive 51% more expensive than just free access.
In terms of cost-efficiency, this implies that free access must be more efficient than information campaign at in-
creasing kindergarten participation to be valuable. Similarly, providing conditional financial incentive on top of
free access must be more efficient at increasing kindergarten participation than providing free access only to be
valuable. We report a detailed discussion on cost-efficiency at the end of the result section.

   The total cost of interventions A, B, C and D are respectively: BGN 516 713, 608 657, 779 558 and 287 298. The number of targeted children
8. 
   per intervention was 1475 for interventions A, B and C (25 children per settlement) and between 3000-6000 for intervention D (we do not
   observe the number of eligible children per settlement for intervention D, but feedback from the field suggests that the number of eligible
   children was greater than 25, and generally below 50).

Methodology: Evaluation Design and Implementation


Sample Population
The sample population consisted of households, regardless of ethnicity, with children aged 3-5
living in 236 impoverished, mostly ethnically segregated settlements across Bulgaria.

Settlement sampling - First, we used a list prepared by the Open Society Institute (OSI) in 2007 containing
all Bulgarian settlements with at least 10 households considered as Roma by both experts and local authorities.
Most of these settlements are clustered pockets of poverty: low education, low income, poor living conditions,
high unemployment rates, high levels of domestic violence, high teenage birthrates etc.

Second, OSI visited these settlements to further select those which would participate in the study (“Community
Listing Exercise”). The only exceptions were Sofia, Plovdiv and Varna, which were excluded because of the very
limited kindergarten spaces that were available. The following criteria were used to select the settlements:

      At least 25 kids age 2 to 5 by September 2013
      
      Distance to full-day kindergarten less than 30 min walk (unless free public transportation is provided)
      
      At least 15 new places in full-day kindergarten for the project kids
      
      Preliminary agreement of the local mayor and full-day kindergarten principal
      

This two-step selection process resulted in a list of 240 targeted settlements. From this list, TSA carried out a
pilot intervention in 4 communities during the 2013-2014 school year, leaving 236 communities as the target
population for the impact evaluation.

Children sampling - In each of these 236 communities, in April 2014, OSI randomly selected 25 children who
were aged 3-5 at the start of the September 2014 school year. These were identified using a random walk from 5
randomly chosen GPS points. In households with several kids aged 3-5, we selected the one with nearest forth-
coming birthday (in case of twins, both). In 32 communities where there were fewer than 25 eligible children, all
children were eligible. The families provided consent to participate in the study.



Random Program Assignment to Treatment and Control
A public lottery to assign the interventions was organized on June 30, 2014. The lottery was held at
the Sheraton, Sofia hotel, where the 236 communities, many of which are Roma settlements, were randomly as-
signed to the interventions. Each of the 236 mayors and the kindergartens had provided consent to participating.
The lottery was held in the presence of representatives of the Ministry of Education, the National Association of
Municipalities in Bulgaria, mayors, directors of full-day kindergartens, NGOs and others. Each community had
been assigned to either the three financial interventions “A”, “B”, “C” or the control group, with half of the above
further randomly assigned to “D” (information campaign). Using information from the Community Listing done
in April 2014, this random assignment was stratified by the implementing NGO and the number of available
spots in the full-day kindergarten.


This created the following randomly assigned groups:


Financial intervention:
      Intervention A: 59 free kindergarten communities
      
      Intervention B: 59 free kindergarten + BGN 7 communities
      

   Intervention C: 59 free kindergarten + BGN 20 communities
   

   


Information campaign:
   Intervention D: 118 information communities
   
   118 comparison communities (no information meetings)
   


Since each community was randomly assigned to one of the Financial options and one of the Information op-
tions, there are effectively 8 subgroups altogether of (236/8=) 29 or 30 communities each. Because the random
assignment to the financial options was independent of the assignment to the information option, these two
components are not correlated with each other; regardless of the type of financial intervention that was assigned
to a given community, it had a 50% chance of being assigned to either information intervention.

The combination of the financial intervention and the information intervention created the following experimen-
tal groups:

Data Collection
A baseline Community Listing survey was carried out in April 2014 to collect information on the
communities and the kindergartens. In each eligible community, the mayor was interviewed, the kinder-
garten director, and a community leader. Basic community and kindergarten information was collected.

The baseline survey was conducted by OSI in April-May 2014 and covered the 5,772 households
with eligible children across the 236 communities. This followed the “Community Listing Exercise” in
April 2014 described above. For those communities with more than 25 eligible households, the enumerators se-
lected the households through a random walk. All participating parents provided written consent. The baseline
survey captured information on demographics, education, and employment of all household members, including
information on literacy and numeracy, as well as information on child rearing/interaction practices and atti-
tudes toward parenting and education. It also included information on assets and dwelling characteristics. There
were 427 refusals.

The endline survey was conducted by OSI in April-May 2015 and covered 5,158 of the 5,772 base-
line households, equivalent to an attrition rate of less than 11%. The appendix provides details on the
follow up success separately for each of the treatment and comparison groups.




Supporting Disadvantaged Children Enter Kindergarten: Experimental Evidence from Bulgaria	                                 13
Finally, three unannounced kindergarten attendance checks were carried out by OSI during
April-May 2015 covering all eligible children. During these checks, someone from the OSI team would
make an unannounced visit to the kindergarten and verify which children were present and which children
were not.


Indicators of Interest
The impact indicators of interest fall into five categories:
1. parental perceptions of kindergarten,
2. participation to kindergarten,
3. parental involvement in educational activities,
4. household employment, and
5. child learning and development.

Regarding parental perceptions, we first use indicators of the perceived benefit of kindergarten by asking
parents how certain they are that their child will complete primary school / complete secondary school / be
bullied in primary school / will be treated with respect by teachers in primary school if (1) their child completes
kindergarten, and (2) their child does not complete kindergarten. We also use measures of aspirations by asking
parents what the appropriate age is to stop education, get married, and have children.

Regarding participation in full-day kindergarten, we use two indicators of whether the child is registered,
one using kindergarten registers and the other one using survey data. The survey also provides an indicator of
whether the child ever attended full-day kindergarten (s/he might have already dropped out), and the proportion
of attended days over the past five days (0 is assigned to children who are not registered). Finally, we imple-
mented three unannounced visits in each kindergarten to collect independent information of whether each child
in our sample was present9, and we use the proportion of visits where the child was present as an indicator of
attendance.

To measure parental involvement in educational activities, we asked parents whether they did specific
activities with their child in the past three days before the survey: reading a book or looking at a picture book /
telling a story / singing a song / playing with toys / naming, counting or drawing. We use indicators of whether
the parent answered yes for each activity separately, as well as the proportion of activities for which the parent
answered yes.

Regarding household employment, our main impact indicators are the number of individuals in the house-
hold who have an employment, household income from employment, and total household income. We also use
indicators of whether the child caregiver is working or homemaker.

Finally, measures of child development are constructed using a specific questionnaire administered to the
child at endline. This questionnaire is based on the tool developed in 2015 by Save the Children: International
Development and Early Learning Assessment (hereafter, IDELA). In 2011, Save the Children completed a com-
prehensive review of the existing child development assessments and documented several important limitations
with existing tools (targeting specific skill areas or a specific age group, reliant on parent or teacher report rather
than directly assessing children’s skills, expensive, or time-consuming). Most importantly, the majority of the
existing tools had been used primarily in high income countries, such as the United States, United Kingdom
and Australia, making them difficult to adapt and easily use across countries with diverse populations and re-
source-poor settings. Save the Children conducted in depth quantitative analysis of item functioning, internal
consistency, inter-rater reliability and construct validity. With testing and input from multiple country teams
over three years, the tool has resulted in 2015 in a 22-item assessment that balances the three key dimensions

   As attendance was strategic in the conditional voucher treatment arms, self-reported attendance might have been upwardly biased in
9. 
   these groups relative to the other groups. We thus implemented an independent measure of attendance that is not affected by strategic
   attendance reporting.

discussed above: psychometric rigor, feasibility, and international applicability. Thus, IDELA is easily translat-
ed and administered in varied cultural contexts, and has strong reliability and validity10. IDELA involves four
developmental areas: motor, language and early literacy, math and problem solving, and socio-emotional devel-
opment. The questionnaire constitutes a core of 22 items that span the four developmental domains mentioned
above. See in Appendix IV examples of items included in the IDELA questionnaire used for this project. The
questionnaire was administered only once at endline, at home, by a trained enumerator. The original question-
naire was written in Bulgarian, but enumerators were told to adjust to children’ preferred language. For this
purpose, enumerators were selected by OSI to fit local communities.


Design Validation
Baseline Balance

The baseline sample is very well balanced across all program assignment groups. This is shown in
Appendix I Table 1. Twenty-five key variables were tested, covering demographics, education, livelihoods, and
parental care practices. For each of these, means were calculated for the 8 intervention sub-groups; 1 pure con-
trol and 7 groups that receive some combination of financial incentives and (no) information. Clustering error
terms at the community level, a t-test is carried out between the mean of the pure control and each of these 7
groups for each of the 25 variables; i.e. 175 t-tests. In 8 out of the 287 (two-sided) t-tests, the means are signifi-
cantly different (with p-values <0.10); in comparison, if these means were all randomly drawn from identical
underlying distributions, we would expect nearly 17 significant differences by pure chance. The balance checks
thus do not reject the assumption that each treatment group is statistically identical to the control group.


Attrition and its Impact on Baseline Balance

Attrition at endline was 11%, meaning that 11% of the households who were sampled at baseline and took
the baseline questionnaire could not be interviewed at endline. In general, these households were not available
or not at home at the time the interviewer visited them. This attrition rate looks rather medium-low compared
to what is found in the literature. Appendix I Table 2 shows attrition by treatment group. Attrition happened to
be lower in the pure control group (8%) and larger in the pure information group (18%), all other groups having
an attrition rate very close to 10%.

The baseline characteristics continue to be very well balanced across all program assignment
groups, considering the 5,158 of the 5,772 baseline households that were interviewed in the end-
line survey. This is shown in Appendix I Table 3. Testing the same variables, we now find that in 5 out of the
175 (two-sided) t-tests, the means are significantly different (with p-values <0.10), still well below the near 30
significant differences we would expect by pure chance. So, attrition had no impact on the internal validity of the
experiment: the baseline characteristics of the non-attritors look identical in all treatment groups. Consequently,
the higher attrition rates in some groups relative to other groups do not affect the internal validity of the impact
estimates.

Finally, attrition did not much affect the external validity of the experiment as the final sample has
the same characteristics as the original sample. Appendix I Table 4 shows the correlation between baseline char-
acteristics and the fact that the child was present at endline to see how attrition changed the composition of the
experimental population. We find that minority children are 4 percentage points (pp) more likely to be present
at endline than majority children, probably because geographical mobility is lower for minority households.
Households who do not speak Bulgarian and where the parent cannot write a simple text at baseline were also
respectively 3 pp and 4 pp more likely to be present at endline, probably for the same reason. The other cor-
relations are smaller and marginally significant. Overall, the final sample is a bit more disadvantaged than the
original sample but the differences are not large.

Determining Program Impacts
Main Impacts

The basic statistical model described in Equation 1 provides intention-to-treat (ITT) program impact estimates:
it regresses the outcome Yivc for child i in settlement v in stratum c on binary variables that equal 1 for households
in this treatment and 0 for the other households:

Equation 1:	     Yivc = α + ß1Informationvc + ß2FreeAccessvc + ß3FreeAccess_and_infovc + ß4BGN7vc + ß5BGN7_
                 
                 and_infovc + ß6BGN20vc + ß7BGN20_and_infovc + ß8BaselineYivc + γc + ϵivc

The key coefficients are ß1 – ß7 which represent the differences between each experimental group and the con-
trol group. Appendix VII offers another perspective on the impacts of the interventions which focuses on the
impacts of each component of the interventions (information, free access, 7 BGN incentive, 20 BGN incentive)
independently from the other components.

The basic model also controls for strata fixed effects γc and a set of baseline control variables BaselineYivc to
improve the precision of the impact estimates. The baseline control variables are: age of the child, gender of
the child, language, household size, employment of household head, household income, parental involvement
in activities with the child, child is registered in kindergarten at baseline, level of education of parents, single
parent household, presence of books in house, and expectations of parents about kindergarten and about future
educational attainment. The standard errors allow for non-independence in error terms (clustering) within a
settlement.


Heterogeneous Impacts

Following the research proposal that was approved by SIEF in 2013, we also examined whether the treatment
impacts vary depending on whether the household is Roma or Bulgarian. Measuring ethnicity is not straightfor-
ward since some Roma or Turkish households tend to hide their ethnicity due to social image concerns. In this
study, we thus favor a measure of ethnicity which is reported by the interviewers instead of self-reported by the
households. In our sample, 13% of the households were identified by interviewers as Bulgarian, another 13% as
Turkish, and the remaining 74% as Roma. We consider two groups: Bulgarian (“majority”) on the one hand, and
Roma or Turkish (“minority”) on the other hand.

For each characteristic S (already included in the set of baseline control variables Baseline Yivc), the statistical
model is:

             Yivc = α + ß1Informationvc + ß2FreeAccessvc + ß3FreeAccess_and_infovc + ß4BGN7vc + ß5BGN7_
Equation 2: 	
             and_infovc + ß6BGN20vc + ß7BGN20_and_infovc + ß8Minorityivc + ß9Informationvc*Minorityivc
             + ß10FreeAccessvc*Minorityivc + ß11FreeAccessvc_and_infovc*Minorityivc + ß12BGN7vc*
             Minorityivc + ß13BGN7_and_infovc*Minorityivc + ß14BGN20vc*Minorityivc + ß15BGN20_and_
             infovc*Minorityivc + ß16BaselineYivc + γc + ϵivc

The coefficients ß1 – ß7 are the estimated difference in outcome for majority children, while ß8– ß15 are the
additional estimated difference in outcome for minority children. For instance, the impact of being offered free
access for majority children is ß2, while the impact of being offered free access for minority children is ß2 + ß10.
If ß10 is not significant, it means that the impact on minority children is statistically similar to the impact on ma-
jority children. Impacts by ethnicity are presented in Appendix III Tables 1-7.

Finally, we test two explanations for the specific impact of the treatments on child development for minority
children. One explanation may be the language spoken at home (based on parent declaration). 63% of sampled
children do not speak Bulgarian at home, while 36% do (0.5% do not declare the language spoken at home and
are dropped from the analysis when it uses this variable). Children who do not speak Bulgarian at home are es-
sentially a subgroup of minority children (only 5% of children who do not speak Bulgarian at home belong to the
majority group, which may reflect errors in ethnicity declaration). Therefore, Appendix IV Table 1 presents the


16	                                           Supporting Disadvantaged Children Enter Kindergarten: Experimental Evidence from Bulgaria
impact estimates for three groups: majority children (coefficients ß1 – ß7), minority children who speak Bulgarian
at home (coefficients ß1 – ß7 + coefficients ß8 – ß15 ), and (minority) children who do not speak Bulgarian at home
(coefficients ß1 – ß7 + coefficients ß8 – ß15 + coefficients ß17 – ß23)11.

Another explanation for the specific impact of the treatments on child development for minority children may
be the intensity of segregation measured by the proportion of minority children in the community, as a proxy
for kindergarten quality. We define a community as “segregated” when more than 4 households in 5 belong to
the minority group. According to this definition, 76% of the sampled communities are segregated, while 24% are
not. By construction, children living in segregated communities are essentially a subgroup of minority children
(only 7% of children in segregated communities belong to the majority group). Therefore, Appendix IV Table
2 presents the impact estimates for three groups: majority children (coefficients ß1 – ß7), minority children in
mixed communities (coefficients ß1 – ß7+ coefficients ß8 – ß15), and (minority) children in segregated communi-
ties (coefficients ß1 – ß7 + coefficients ß8 – ß15 + coefficients ß17 – ß23)12.




    We do not interact ethnicity with language spoken at home since the subgroup “majority children who do not speak Bulgarian at home”
11. 
    is virtually empty.
    We do not interact ethnicity with the dummy indicating that the community is segregated since the subgroup “majority children in seg-
12. 
    regated community” is too small.

Results

Overview of the Sample Population and Household Characteristics
The average age of the children at baseline was 3.9 years, and 54% were boys. Parental education levels are low.
At baseline, 44% of parents had not completed primary (meaning grade 4 in the Bulgarian educational system),
35% only primary, and 21% secondary or higher. This is comparable to households surveyed as part of the 2011
UNDP/World Bank/EC Regional Roma Survey, where 19% of Bulgarian Roma aged 20 to 24 had at least com-
pleted general or vocational upper-secondary (FRA and UNDP, 2012)13. With regards to literacy, almost half
reported having some difficulty reading and writing Bulgarian.

Households are poor: self-reported monthly income (from all sources) amounted to BGN 432 at baseline14. In
comparison, according to the official statistics, average monthly household income in Bulgaria in 2014 was BGN
957 (National Statistics Institute, 2014).15 Low incomes are consistent with low levels of employment; only 61%
of household heads were employed at the time of the baseline. This figure is the same as the employment rate
among the working-age population (15-64) of men found in the 2011 UNDP/World Bank/EC Regional Roma
Survey (World Bank, 2012, p. 18).

While employment and parental education outcomes are nearly identical between the 2011 UNDP/World Bank/
EC regional Roma survey and the 2014 baseline survey, kindergarten participation in the control group is much
higher during the 2013-2014 school year: 68% of eligible children 3-6 years in control communities are reported
to be registered in a kindergarten, compared with 45% of children aged 3-6 in the 2011 survey16 . This may indi-
cate that the September 2010 legal amendment providing for 2 years of compulsory preschool education (5 and
6-year-olds)17 and the 2013 legal amendment conditioning the payment of child allowance for children aged 5 and
6 years on regular kindergarten attendance, were successful in substantially raising kindergarten participation.


Program Implementation
At the endline survey, respondents were asked about their participation in and knowledge of the program in their
specific community. Table 1 below shows how eligible households perceived the financial support they were of-
fered (columns 1-3), as well as their participation in the information sessions at the kindergarten (columns 4-5).

First, offering free access to kindergarten increases by 66 to 74 pp the proportion of respondents
who report they were offered free access (column 1). This indicates that this component of the programs
was largely perceived by the households. Among communities that were not offered free access, approximately
9% report they were offered free access, which is explained by the fact that some municipalities offer free access
to third child, orphans, or child of disabled parents. Among the households that were offered free access and do
not report it, half report not having been aware, while the other half report not having been interested (see in
Appendix VI summary statistics on the reasons for program ineffectiveness).

Second, offering conditional financial incentive of BGN 7 or BGN 20 per month increases by 42
to 55 pp the proportion of respondents who report that there was additional financial help in the
community. Appendix VI shows that the reason why only about half of eligible households were aware of the
financial incentives is twofold: 7-8% households eligible for CCT were not aware of the CCT, while the remaining
proportion of non-compliers (41% on the BGN 7 group and 32% in the BGN 20 group18) were not interested in

inability to comply with the condition, rather than non-implementation of the intervention.

Robust standard errors in parentheses *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1
Standard errors clustered at the community level. Any covariate missing value was replaced with the community average, and a missing
dummy for each variable containing at least one missing value has been included in the model. Controls include age, gender, language,
household size, employment of head, income, parental involvement, registered in KG at baseline, education of parents, single parent house-
hold, presence of books in house, expectations of parents about kindergarten and about their child’s future educational attainment.



Third, with regards to the information campaign, participation of eligible households varies
greatly depending on whether financial support was offered or not. In communities, which received
a financial intervention, the information campaign increased by 52 to 63 pp the proportion of households that
participated in an information session (column 4), and by 41 to 47 pp the proportion of households that partici-
pated in 3 or more information sessions. By contrast, in communities that did not additionally receive a financial
intervention, the information campaign increased by only 28pp the proportion of households that participated
in an information session, and by 12 pp the proportion of households that participated in 3 or more information
sessions.

There are two reasons for the low participation in information sessions when communities did not additionally
receive a financial intervention (see Appendix VI): first, 23% of the corresponding kindergartens refused to orga-
nize such information sessions, maybe because they thought that providing information to poor families without
any financial help is inappropriate. Second, the presence of a financial intervention may have boosted the inter-
est of respondents to participate in information sessions: only 15-20% households declare they have no interest
in information sessions when they receive a financial intervention, while 32% when they do not.

Conversely, approximately one quarter of respondents in communities that did receive financial support but
not an information campaign reported participating in at least one session. Since the information campaign was
not organized in these communities, respondents may have been referring to discussions that they had with the
NGOs implementing the financial interventions (like the meeting announcing the lottery results), or ordinary
meetings at the kindergarten.

Per Appendix III Table 1, there is clear evidence that Roma and Turkish families had significantly lower aware-
ness of / interest in information sessions than Bulgarian families in communities that were offered financial
support. Minority families were less likely to participate in the information sessions when they were associated
with financial interventions than Bulgarian families (columns 4-5). For instance, while free access increased
Bulgarian parents’ likelihood of attending an information session by 91 pp, it only increased minority parents’
likelihood of attending by 59 pp (32 pp less). In communities that were offered free access, minority families
were also less likely to report that they were offered free access than Bulgarian families (column 1), but this is
probably related to the fact that at baseline minority children are 14 pp more likely to be offered free access than
majority children. In the end, the same proportion of minority and majority families report having free access
in conditions offering free access. Notably, the effect of offering conditional financial incentive on likelihood to
report being offered such, is similar for both minority and majority parents.

Overall, these results indicate that offering free access to kindergarten is the intervention that was the easiest
to understand by all households. Offering an information campaign was not very effective in the absence of fi-
nancial support, and the take-up was lower among minority families than majority families. Only half of eligible
households were aware of and interested in the conditional financial incentives.

Estimation Results
Impacts on Kindergarten Participation
Table 2 presents the impact of the treatments on kindergarten registration and attendance. Our preferred indi-
cators are in columns 2 and 5 as these indicators are not from parents but from school registers (column 2) and
unannounced visits (column 5).

The first result is that all interventions could increase kindergarten registration. Column 2 shows that the inter-
ventions raise the share of children registered in a kindergarten by 7 to 19 pp, effectively reducing the share of
children not registered by about half. Column 1 shows that free access increases the proportion of children who
have ever attended kindergarten by 4 to 13 pp. This indicates that the increase in current registration comes
from both a decrease in dropout, and an increase in participation from children who would never had attended
kindergarten in the absence of free access. The different combinations of interventions (information, free access,
and incentives) seem to have a similar impact on registration, meaning that they are mutual substitutes.

Besides, attendance also increases and the effect size is also large in all treatment groups but the
information group. Through the unannounced attendance checks (column 5), we see that the proportion
of visits resulting in a presence during the three checks (regardless of registration) was 47.4% for children
in the control group19 and that interventions which include free access increased this proportion by 5 to
11 pp (although some estimates are not significant). This represents an increase in the attendance rate of

11 to 23%. Self-reported attendance in the last 5 days also increased significantly in some experimental groups
(column 4).

Overall, there is no additional impact from the CCTs, whether this incentive is BGN 7 or BGN 20 per month,
and no additional impact from the information campaign on attendance. As soon as the main financial barrier
is removed, parents do increase their demand for preschool education and providing more information on the
benefits of preschool education or incentives do not increase their demand further. We interpret this finding as
evidence that the financial cost of kindergarten is a more important barrier than behavioral issues which are
generally addressed by reasonable incentives, like time inconsistency or inattention issues. For children who
remain out of school despite free access, financial incentives are too low to overcome the true additional costs
of school beyond school fees, which suggest strong preferences against kindergarten. Offering free access is
thus the most cost-effective intervention to increase kindergarten participation. Our finding that
financial incentives were not efficient at increasing kindergarten participation on top of reduced costs echoes
the finding in Benhassine et al. (2015) that adding conditionality to small transfers made no difference in school
participation in Morocco.

In Appendix III Table 2, we see that all the effects of treatments on registration are statistically identical for Bul-
garian and minority children alike. However, the impacts are different regarding attendance. Column 5 shows
that the positive effects of financial treatments on attendance are mostly driven by minority children – whose
baseline attendance rate at unannounced visits is smaller than for majority children (44% versus 67%). Offering
free access in disadvantaged communities (combined or not with information or financial incentives) thus tends
to reduce the gap between majority and minority children.

Finally, it should be noted that the treatment effects are statistically identical for girls and boys, as well as for
3/4-year-old children and 5/6-year-old children (results not shown, available upon request). This last result is
surprising since by law, 5/6-year-old children should attend a preschool program whose cost should be minimal,
and they already have an incentive to attend through the conditional child allowance (monthly BGN35). The fact
that the impacts are identical for younger and older children may indicate that the enforcement of the law is not
perfect and there is still a large margin of improvement when it comes to increasing 5/6-year-olds’ participation
in preschool programs. In fact, in control communities, 70% of 3 and 4-year-old children are registered in a
kindergarten, while 75% of the 5 and 6-year-old children, which shows that baseline kindergarten participation
is very close.



Impacts on Parental Perceptions of Kindergarten

As shown in Table 3, information sessions had a positive impact on average parental perceptions
of the benefits of kindergarten. The perception of how completing kindergarten will change the probability
that primary school will be completed increases by 15 pp in information communities, and by 12 pp free access
+ BGN 20 incentive + information communities compared to control communities (column 1), suggesting that
parental perception of the benefits of kindergarten increases.

These two treatments also improved parental perception of how completing kindergarten will change comple-
tion of secondary school, the incidence of bullying in primary school, and respect by teachers in primary school,
although the impacts are not always precisely estimated (columns 2, 3, and 4). The other treatments had no
significant effect on parental perceptions of the benefits of kindergarten.

household size, employment of head, income, parental involvement, registered in KG at baseline, education of parents, single parent house-
hold, presence of books in house, expectations of parents about kindergarten and about their child’s future educational attainment.




As per Appendix III Table 3, the change in perception in the benefit of kindergarten is larger in Roma and Turk-
ish parents. In particular, the free access + BGN20 incentive + information treatment improved parental percep-
tion of how completing kindergarten will change completion of primary school, completion of secondary school,
incidence of bullying, and respect by teachers for minority parents - but not for Bulgarian parents.

More generally, in all treatments including information campaign, the point estimates are positive and larger for
minority parents than for majority parents. This suggests that the information campaign was effective in raising
Roma and Turkish perceptions of the benefits of kindergarten. This may explain why minority parents who were
exposed to the information campaign and financial interventions were more likely to make their children attend
kindergarten than majority parents – although most differences between majority and minority parents are not
statistically significant (Appendix III Table 2).

Note that parental perceptions of the benefits of kindergarten are already high: parents in the control communi-
ties estimate that the probability to complete primary school is 47 pp higher if the child complete kindergarten
compared to if the child does not. Also, among parents in control communities, the probability to complete sec-
ondary school is 54 pp higher if the child complete kindergarten compared to if the child does not. These results
suggest that parental awareness is already high among control households, and that there might have been little
margin for improvement in that domain.

Impacts on Parental Aspirations for their Child

Tables 4a and 4b show the impact of the interventions on the aspirations parents have for their child in terms of
education and family life: how long parents would like their child to continue in education, at what age parents
would like their child to get married and have children, and what level of education is considered minimum ed-
ucation. Table 4a presents the results for boys and Table 4b – for girls.

The treatments had some positive impacts on parental aspirations for boys, although only a few point estimates
are significant (Table 4a). The impacts are more frequent in treatments which include the information campaign,
suggesting that this component may be more efficient than the financial interventions to change parental aspi-
rations.

Impressively, treatments led to increases in most beliefs about age appropriateness for girls, particularly the
treatments which include the information campaign (Table 4b). Families that received only the information
campaign said their girls should stop education 0.8 years later than families in the control group. Appropriate
age for girls to get married also increased by 0.8 years, but this increase is not significant. The treatments com-
bining information and financial support also had large impacts on parental beliefs about age appropriateness
in almost every category for girls.

Appendix III Tables 4a and 4b indicate that these trends are more pronounced for minority families, for which
baseline beliefs about age appropriateness are substantially lower than among majority families. The informa-
tion campaign was thus efficient at changing slightly social norms regarding education and family life, and at
reducing the gap between norms for majority and minority families. As noted above, the change in educational
norms was not accompanied with a change in participation in kindergarten, neither for boys nor for girls.

Standard errors clustered at the community level. Any covariate missing value was replaced with the community average, and a missing
dummy for each variable containing at least one missing value has been included in the model. Controls include age, gender, language,
household size, employment of head, income, parental involvement, registered in KG at baseline, education of parents, single parent house-
hold, presence of books in house, expectations of parents about kindergarten and about their child’s future educational attainment.

Impacts on Household Employment

Table 5 shows that treatments had no clear and consistent impacts on parental work and income.
Despite greater participation in kindergarten by their children, parents may not be able to substitute child care
with employment. Monthly income in column (3) includes all types of income, among which the CCT (one cate-
gory of income was social transfers), whereas income from employment in column (4) does not include the CCT.

We do not find evidence that any treatment affected the proportion of primary child caregivers working (32%
in the control group, unchanged in the treatment groups), nor the proportion of primary child caregivers being
homemaker (39% in the control group, unchanged in the treatment groups). Total monthly income and income
from employment are largely equal in all groups, although a small positive difference in the free access group and
a small negative difference in the information group are present. The latter can hardly be interpreted since the
time parents may have spent at the information session seems not large enough to induce a lower income from
employment. Given the small number of significant differences, it seems likely that these are spurious differenc-
es due to sampling variations.

In Appendix III Table 5, we see the impacts based on ethnicity. Again, we see few significant differences, but with
weak consistency.

28	                                                   Supporting Disadvantaged Children Enter Kindergarten: Experimental Evidence from Bulgaria
Impacts on Parental Involvement in Educational Activities

Table 6 column 6 shows evidence that all treatments induced a substitution away from parent pro-
vided activities with the child. In the 3 days prior to the endline survey, parents in the control communities
engaged into an average of 67.5% of activities with their child (among: reading a book, telling a story, playing
with toys, singing, or naming/drawing/counting). Parental involvement in all activities is significantly lower in
treatment communities. This results in a decrease in the proportion of activities done with the child by 10 to 18
pp, hence a 15 to 26% reduction.

There is no clear difference between treatments regarding this substitution away from parental investment in
child education. This negative impact is consistent with the fact that treatments increase registration and at-
tendance in kindergarten, inducing less time spent by the child in the home environment. The only puzzle is
the substitution away from parental involvement in the information group, since we do not see an increase in
attendance in kindergarten in this group, neither based on self-declared attendance in the last 5 days nor based
on the unannounced visits. One explanation may be that parents who attended the information sessions were
discouraged by the information sessions whose main goal was to excite parents about the value of kindergarten
with no focus on parental activities.

Supporting Disadvantaged Children Enter Kindergarten: Experimental Evidence from Bulgaria	                                             29
To go further into the substitution of parental inputs with kindergarten inputs in the education of the child,
columns 1 through 5 detail the impact of the interventions activity by activity. It appears that parents are less
likely to be involved in all type of activities with the child than parents in control communities,
the decrease being more pronounced for telling a story, singing, and playing with toys with family members.
Effect sizes are substantial: for instance, 69% parents in control communities spend time with their child telling
a story, while only 48% to 59% in the treatment communities, representing a 14 to 30% decrease.

Overall, parental participation in child education is quite important: parents in the sampled communities, although
poor and segregated, get involved in activities in favour of child learning and development. Attending kindergarten
should therefore be regarded as choosing a mode of education (collective and done by specialists) instead of anoth-
er mode of education (private and done by non-specialists). The resulting impact on child learning and develop-
ment thus depends on the relative productivity of parents and kindergartens in the education production function.

Impacts related to family involvement in child education were generally similar for minority and majority groups,
as seen in Appendix III Table 6. However, the substitution away from parental activities is more pronounced
among minority families for three types of activities: telling a story, singing, and playing with toys. These activ-
ities are the most prevalent activities in minority families, whereas reading a book and naming, counting, and
drawing are more prevalent in majority families. For instance, only 48% of minority parents read a book to their
child in the last three days, while 82% of majority parents. Conversely, 77% of minority parents sang a song to
their child in the last three days, while 70% of majority parents. We generally observe greater substitution away
from activities that are more prevalent in each type of family.


Impacts on Child Learning and Development

Table 7 shows the impact of the interventions on child development outcomes. As discussed above, we use a tool
for child performance assessment developed by Save the Children (IDELA) to measure cognitive and non-cog-
nitive skills: emergent literacy (column 1), emergent numeracy (column 2), motor development (column 3), and
socio-emotional skills (column 4).

We find that treatments led to no gain in child development compared to the control group. Children in
treatment groups achieve less in terms of emergent numeracy than children in the control group: all coefficients
are negative and the coefficients for information (T1), free access (T2), and free access + BGN20 incentive +
information (T7), are statistically significant. There is no consistent and significant difference in literacy, motor
skills, or socio-emotional skills between treatment and control children. These results are surprising given that
all treatments (except information only T1) led to a significant increase in kindergarten participation. It indicates
that the additional kindergarten participation was not associated with any gain in terms of child development in
the short-run (one year).

A natural question is whether a one-year period is a too short period for the benefits of kindergarten on child
development to appear. Therefore, the first recommendation of the current research is to follow the impact of
providing free access to kindergarten in the longer term, in particular once kindergarten educa-
tion will be completed, in order to estimate the effects on educational performances at the end of kindergar-
ten and in primary school.

Besides, it may be that kindergarten curriculum focuses on skills that are not measured by the
IDELA questionnaire. For instance, Bulgaria’s governmental standards discourage the teaching of numbers
and letters throughout kindergarten, and favor more free play, drawing, telling stories or songs, which may have
larger long-term effects. However, it should be noted that our measures of child development do not focus on
“academic” skills since they largely incorporate fine and gross motor skills, as well as socio-emotional skills.
Moreover, our measure of emergent literacy is broader than letter identification since it incorporates items like
listening comprehension and print awareness, which are closely related to being read stories and books. The
quality and comprehensiveness of the IDELA tool make it unlikely that a major gain in child development would
not be detected in our study.

The impact of the interventions on child development is generally similar for boys and girls, as well as for 3-4-year-
old and 5-6-year-old children (results not shown, available upon request). However, as shown in Appendix III
Table 7, it is important to notice that the impacts on child development are very different by ethnicity. The im-
pacts of financial treatments are nil or positive for Bulgarian children, whereas they are significantly
negative for minority children. Bulgarian children in financial treatment communities perform similarly
(numeracy and motor tasks) or better (socio-emotional and literacy skills) than Bulgarian children in control
communities (although the differences are rarely significant except for socio-emotional skills); in contrast, Roma
and Turkish children in financial treatment communities perform worse than Roma and Turkish children in con-
trol communities. These differences are, in some cases, substantial: regarding socio-emotional skills, majority
children do 5 to 15 pp better than majority children in control communities, while minority children do 3 to 5 pp
worse than minority children in control communities. We do not find any difference in motor skills, but there are
also some negative impacts on emergent literacy and emergent numeracy for minority children.

The fact that the impacts are observed only in financial treatment groups is consistent with the fact that only
financial treatments increased attendance in kindergarten. Importantly, the negative impact is observed on
minority children who respond more to the financial treatments in terms of kindergarten participation. It
means that for minority children, an increase in kindergarten participation was associated with a decrease in
socio-emotional skills and, to a lesser extent, in emergent numeracy. These results provide evidence that full-
day kindergartens immediately benefit (although not dramatically) Bulgarian children, while Roma and Turk-
ish children do not. The results from Bulgaria PISA 2012 show that attending at least two years of preschool
education raises low achievers’ scores, including those of the Roma and Turkish children, which suggests that
a longer-term study may raise more positive findings about the effect of providing free access to kindergarten
on child development.

However, in the first year, minority children development is greater when they are not encouraged to participate
in kindergarten than when they are encouraged. What are the potential explanations for this negative impact of
full-day kindergarten on minority children’s development?

First, the role of families on child development should not be neglected. As shown in Appendix III
Table 6, parental involvement in educational activities is substantial even in minority families: minority parents
in the control settlements report that they did an average of 65.8% of the activities listed in our questionnaire
over a period of 3 days. Parental involvement is larger among Bulgarian families (they did an average of 77.4% of
these activities), but still substantial among minority parents. Therefore, we cannot take as granted that minority
parents do not invest time for educational activities with their children. Besides, classes are big relative to fami-
lies, so one teacher can hardly interact with each child as much as parents and siblings at home. Finally, the fact
that most parents in our sample are low educated does not mean that they are unable to stimulate young-child

development: at the very early stages of child development, even low-educated parents may be able to provide their
child with basic knowledge like counting and identifying letters since this does not require high parental education.
This is particularly true for the development of socio-emotional skills which require no academic skills but a stable
and confident interpersonal relationship. Therefore, it may be that the lower parental involvement in educational
activities associated with providing free access to kindergarten has a negative effect on child development.

Second, a complementary explanation may be that the quality of kindergarten in our sample may be low rel-
ative to the average kindergarten, which may explain the lower performances of minority children who were of-
fered free access. We do not have yet sufficient data on kindergarten quality to test directly this hypothesis. Ideal-
ly we will need information on teacher experience, teacher levels of education, quality of kindergarten equipment
and furniture, etc. However, quality of kindergarten would not explain the differential impact of providing free
access on majority and minority children unless kindergarten quality is strongly correlated with the proportion
of majority versus minority children in the kindergarten. For instance, if most majority children are enrolled in
normal quality kindergarten while most minority children are enrolled in poor quality ones, this would lead to
offering free access is positive on majority children but negative on minority children. To test this possibility,
we look at treatment effects by levels of segregation: if the poor quality of the kindergarten is the reason why
minority children achieve less in treatment groups than in the control group, then the impact of treatments on
minority children in non-segregated kindergarten should be better than the impact of treatments on minority
children in segregated kindergarten.

Appendix IV Table 2 shows that offering free access had a negative impact on socio-emotional skills and
emergent numeracy of minority children even when these children attend a non-segregated kin-
dergarten. The negative impacts are more pronounced in segregated kindergartens (most coefficients on treat-
ments interacted with segregated kindergarten are negative), but most of the negative impacts of offering free
access appear already on minority children who attend a non-segregated kindergarten, as shown by the negative
coefficients on treatments interacted with minority ethnicity.

A third explanation for the fact that offering free access has a negative impact on minority children development
is that a large proportion of minority children, 72%, do not speak Bulgarian at home. The language of
instruction in the kindergarten is Bulgarian. The fact that kindergartens specifically fail to improve development of
minority children in the first year may thus come from the fact that children who do not speak Bulgarian at home
need to adjust in a bilingual environment, which represents an obvious source of difficulty relative to children who
speak Bulgarian. In Appendix IV Table 2, we consider both dimensions together: ethnicity and spoken language.
The impact of offering free access can be seen on minority children independently from their language.

We find that ethnicity is a disadvantage in its own right: the negative effect of providing free access to kindergar-
ten is more pronounced for minority children who do not speak Bulgarian at home, but ethnicity
is a clear disadvantage in its own right. The detrimental impact of offering free access on socio-emotional
skills is strong, independently from children’s first language. This result suggests that the language itself adds to
the difficulty that children face in adapting to the kindergarten environment, but does not explain entirely the
negative impact of providing free access to kindergarten for minority children.

Overall, these results question how minority children are treated in the kindergartens and to what
extent it is difficult for them to adjust to a new – strange – environment. Qualitative feedback from kindergarten
directors suggests that teachers find it more difficult to work with groups of children of different ethnic origin
because the usual way of teaching is not well-adapted to minority children. Adaptation to kindergarten is easier
for Bulgarian children who already “know how to put on shoes or use toilets” for instance, while for minority
children it may represents a shock and put them under stress. The environment in kindergarten is currently not
structured to meet the specific needs of minority children, leading to no gains in cognitive development.

Conclusions and Policy Recommendations

The conclusions that we can draw from this large-scale multi-arm experiment in Bulgaria are three-fold.

First, offering free access to Kindergarten is the most cost-efficient strategy to encourage partici-
pation of disadvantaged children in Kindergarten. We find that the free access intervention component
significantly increased kindergarten registration and attendance, reducing by half the proportion of children
that are not registered, and increasing by about 20% daily attendance rate. In contrast, neither the additional
conditional financial incentives nor the additional information sessions increased further kindergarten partic-
ipation. Free access to kindergarten is the most natural way to lower the monetary costs of early education and
remove the affordability barrier to early education. The results show that offering free access led to a significant
increase in participation. The conditional financial incentive increases the direct utility from having a child at
kindergarten since it provides an additional disposable income to the household, but it requires complying with
the attendance requirement. As the average child in control communities that is registered at the kindergarten
attends 71% of the time, fulfilling compliance with the conditional financial incentives would have required an
important shift in behavior and neither the BGN 7 nor BGN 20 may have been large enough to induce this. It
should also be noted that these conditional financial incentives were offered on top of the child allowances paid
by the government, conditioned on attendance for the children aged 5 and 6 years and paid unconditionally for
children below that age. Besides, we find that parents do not participate much in the information campaign
when it is not combined with financial support, and that the information campaign alone does not encourage
higher attendance in kindergarten, showing that this component itself is not sufficient. Overall, the best strategy
to increase kindergarten participation among children from disadvantaged areas in Bulgaria is thus to remove
kindergarten fees for parents and other hidden costs.

Second, the information campaign has some positive impacts on parental perceptions of the
benefit of kindergarten and aspirations for their child which are interesting per se, even if these
changes do not lead to increased participation in kindergarten. The information campaign was intended to
help parents better understand the returns of kindergarten education and increase their perception of expect-
ed benefits. During the endline survey, respondents reported larger differences in the likelihood that someone
who completed kindergarten will – later in life – be able to complete primary and secondary school, and be
treated with respect by peers and teachers, compared with someone who does not complete kindergarten.
Moreover, the information campaign raised parents’ aspirations for their child, especially for girls. If these
changes do not affect immediate participation in kindergarten, it may have longer-term effects on later deci-
sions – if changes in parental perceptions are durable, which cannot be tested in this experiment. Since the
cost of the information campaign is quite small, combining free access to kindergarten with the information
sessions may be optimal to induce not only present participation in kindergarten but also longer term changes
in parental attitudes.

Third, a concern arises from this experiment about the one-year impact of kindergarten partic-
ipation on cognitive and non-cognitive development of minority children. After one year, we find
no impact of offering free access on the development of the average child, which results from the combination
of a positive impact on majority children with a negative impact on minority children compared to similar chil-
dren in control communities. In fact, an increase in kindergarten participation was associated with some skill
improvements for Bulgarian children, while lower emergent numeracy and socio-emotional skills for Roma
and Turkish children. Further analysis and qualitative feedback suggest that this may be primarily due to low
readiness of kindergartens to accept and create a low-stress transition to school environment for minority
children. Our policy recommendations are therefore the following:

Appendix III: Impacts by ethnicity

In this report, we use interviewer-identified ethnicity rather than self-identification. Overall, 74% of the house-
holds in our sample are identified as Roma by the interviewers, 13% as Turkish, and 13% as Bulgarian.

Based on self-identification, these proportions are respectively 62%, 16%, and 22%. The differences are due to
the fact that some households who self-identified as Bulgarian are identified as either Roma or Turkish by the
interviewer. Note that for the vast majority of households (91%), self-assessed and enumerators’ assessed eth-
nicities are consistent.

We present in the table below the characteristics of the households whose ethnicity is not consistent and com-
pare with the households whose ethnicity is consistent. We see that ethnicity-inconsistent households are in fact
in between majority and minority households: they look closer to majority households in terms of language and
religion, while closer to minority households in terms of education and economic outcomes.

We favor the measure of ethnicity based of interviewer assessment since it is less prone to social image concerns,
and thus more commonly used in the literature on Roma.

Appendix IV: Exploring explanations for the specific impact on minority children’
development

In order to explore possible driving factors for the child learning outcomes we observed, we looked at impacts
by ethnicity and the level of segregation in the kindergarten, as well as the impacts by ethnicity and language
spoken at home.

We had no direct measures of kindergarten quality, but we test whether treatment impacts are different de-
pending on the level of segregation in the community as an indirect measure for kindergarten quality. Indeed,
the negative impacts of offering free access on minority children may come from the fact that the quality of kin-
dergarten attended by minority children is lower than the quality of kindergarten attended by majority children.
In this case, we should not see a detrimental impact of offering free access on minority children in non-segregat-
ed communities but only in segregated communities. This test is presented in Appendix IV Table 1.

With first language, we test whether children who did not speak Bulgarian as a first language may be benefiting
less from free access than their native speaking peers, as Bulgarian is the primary language spoken by teachers
in all kindergarten. In this context, non-Bulgarian speakers would still be benefiting from preschool, as they
would be improving their skills at speaking Bulgarian, but it may take time for the benefit to materialize since
it is well known that bilingualism initially slows down child development without persistent impacts later on. If
the negative impacts of offering free access are due to the initial slowdown associated with bilingualism, then we
should not see any detrimental impact on minority children who speak Bulgarian at home. This test is presented
in Appendix IV Table 2.

Here is a list of some items included in the IDELA questionnaire. This list is not exhaustive. Contact Save the
Children for more information on the content of the questionnaire.


Emergent Numeracy/Math
Comparison and Measurement – Child compares objects by size and length using picture cards with circles and
pencils
Sorting and Classification – Child groups cards by different similarities using picture cards of stars and circles
Shape identification – Child recognizes shapes on a laminated page with pictures of 6 shapes used in this test (4
shapes + 2 distractors)
Number knowledge – Child recognizes numbers from 1-20 using number chart of numbers
One to One Correspondence – Child picks the right number of objects (5, 8, 15) using small items for counting
Simple addition & subtraction – Child adds and subtracts with help of manipulatives using rocks/blocks used for
adding, and picture cards with bikes and apples
Problem Solving – Child completes a simple puzzle using 4 or 6 piece jigsaw puzzle (laminated and standardized,
cut appropriately). Include a picture of the puzzle for the child to see.


Emergent Literacy
Expressive vocabulary – Child names different types of animals and foods
Print awareness – Child knows to open book in right way; Difference between text and pictures; Directionality of
reading. Materials: Age appropriate book for 3-5 year olds with pictures and simple text
Letter knowledge – Child recognizes letters of the alphabet using a letter grid with 20 letters
First letter sounds (phonemic awareness) – Child identifies words that have similar beginning sounds using
word pair list of common words.
Emergent Writing – Child writes his/her name using blank paper, pencil or pen
Listening comprehension – Child answers 5 questions based on a short story read aloud to him/her using a story
adapted to the local context


Motor Development
Copying a Shape – Child copies a triangle using a pencil, paper, and a picture card with a triangle (fine motor)
Drawing – Child draws a person using a pencil and paper (fine motor)
Simple Folding – Child follows a 5 step folding task using a 20 x 20 cm. piece of paper (fine motor)
Hopping – Child hops up to 10 steps (gross motor)


Social-emotional skills
Friends / Peers – Child names friends he/she plays with (interpersonal relationships)
Emotional awareness – Child can identify sad, angry, happy (understanding individual emotions)
Perspective taking/Empathy – Child can identify how someone else feels using picture card of a girl crying
Conflict Resolution – Child identifies solutions to a social conflict situation

Appendix VII Main impacts using a different treatment specification

In this section, we present the results from a different statistical model than the one we use in the main text of
the paper. This model, described in Equation 3, regresses the outcome Yivc for child i in settlement v in stratum c
on a set of dummies indicating each component of the experimental treatments: the FreeAccessvc dummy equals
1 for children who have been assigned to a treatment that includes free access (i.e. T2-T7); the Any Financial
Incentivevc dummy equals 1 for children who have been assigned to a treatment including any incentive, BGN7 or
BGN20 (i.e. T4-T7); the BGN20 incentivevc dummy equals 1 for children who have been assigned to a treatment
including the BGN20 incentive (i.e. T6-T7); finally, the nformation Campaignvc dummy equals 1 for children
who have been assigned to a treatment including the information campaign (i.e. T1, T3, T5, and T7). The stan-
dard errors allow for non-independence in error terms (“clustering”) within a settlement.

             Yivc = α + ß1FreeAccessvc + ß2Any Financial Incentivevc + ß3BGN20 incentivevc + ß4Information
Equation 3: 	
             Campaignvc + ß5BaselineYivc + γc + ϵivc

The key coefficients are:
  ß1 is the estimated difference in outcome for a child in a settlement that was offered at least free access versus
  
  control settlements.
  ß2 is the estimated difference in outcome for a child in a settlement that was additionally offered a monthly
  
  conditional incentive (either BGN7 or BGN20) versus a settlement that was offered free access only.
  ß3 is the estimated difference in outcome for a child in a settlement that was additionally offered a BGN 20
  
  monthly conditional incentive versus a settlement that was offered free access and a BNG 7 incentive only.
  ß4 is the estimated difference in outcome for a child in a settlement that was offered the information campaign
  
  versus a settlement without information campaign.

Note that, by program design, an eligible child living in a settlement that was offered either the BGN 7 or BGN
20 conditional incentive would also be eligible for free access. Hence, as an example, for a child in a settlement
that was offered the BGN 20 conditional incentive, the estimated difference between his/her outcome and that
of a child in a control settlement equals ß1 + ß2 + ß3

Also, an eligible child living in a settlement that was offered the information campaign might be in any financial
condition –no free access, or free access only, or free access plus a conditional incentive. Hence, as an example,
for a child in a settlement that was offered information sessions and the BGN 20 conditional incentive, the es-
timated difference between his/her outcome and that of a child in a control settlement equals ß1 + ß2 + ß3 + ß4.
As another example, for a child in a settlement that was offered the information campaign only, the estimated
difference between his/her outcome and that of a child in a control settlement equals ß4.

The results from this specification are presenting in Appendix VII Tables 2-7.
