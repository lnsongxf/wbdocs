    0. Executive Summary

                    The main purpose of this research is to assess the performance of Laureate graduates1 in the labor
                            market and their avenues for social mobility, vis-à-vis their peers from other universities.

Laureate universities offer higher education degrees in the Mexican context, an environment where there is a
significant, unmet demand for college degrees and yet, private universities face a highly competitive market to
expand their services. This study is an ex-post impact evaluation. Namely, it was planned and implemented, years
after the individuals participating in this study enrolled and graduated from college, cancelling the possibility of
having baseline information available. Thus, the study relies on data collected directly from the field, including a
college graduate’s survey, an employer’s survey, and in-depth interviews to Laureate former students. The analysis is
based on a quasi-experimental approach for an impact evaluation, complemented with descriptive statistics and
qualitative information.

The outcome results assessed in this report can be grouped into three categories: a) Economic Capital and
Employment, which refers to various aspects of the alumni’s professional career and income generation after
graduation; b) Career Advancement, which measures ability to be promoted and access to managerial positions, and
c) Social Progress, which captures the change in an individual’s position within a power hierarchy via occupational
prestige and the change in socioeconomic levels during shorter periods of time (as opposed to an intergenerational
change).

The impact evaluation relied on comparing outcomes from a treatment group (UVM and UNITEC) to a control group
(other private and public universities), defined in close consultation with the International Finance Corporation (IFC)
and Laureate International Universities (Laureate). The treatment group included individuals, who enrolled in and
graduated from the traditional bachelor degrees offered by UVM and UNITEC.2 More precisely, it included those
individuals between the ages of 17 and 21 years old at the time of enrollment (during the years 2005, 2006 and
2007), who attended a Laureate institution located in the Mexico City’s Metropolitan Area (MCMA). Two different
comparison groups were proposed:

       1.    A group of individuals who graduated from other (non-Laureate) universities, which includes both public
             and private institutions.
       2.    A group of individuals who graduated only from (non-Laureate) private universities.

Both control groups are formed by college graduates, from other universities in the MCMA with similar
characteristics to Laureate graduates prior to enrollment. Namely, these are students who could potentially have
joined a Laureate institution, but chose the alternative. The majority of this group attended either UNAM or IPN
(64%), a third of them graduated from a private financially accessible college (27%), 7% attended another public
university, and 2% graduated from a private premium university.

Matching estimates assume that all relevant variables, or covariates, can be observed and account for all pre-
treatment differences across the treatment and control groups. Moreover, such covariates should not be affected by
the treatment. In this case, the pre-treatment observable variables that meet these conditions are: gender, age, year
of enrollment, household socioeconomic status, parents’ educational background, employment status before a
student´s enrollment, and high school’s type.3 The impact evaluation was implemented by conducting a one-to-one
matching with replacement following a genetic search algorithm.

Through the evaluation, it was possible to identify significant impacts of a Laureate education in most of the analyzed
outcome variables. In general, when compared to the control group, the most robust results show that Laureate has
a positive effect in aspects such as: 4
            Employability: Laureate graduates spent less time when searching for their first job after graduation than
             their counterparts in other private and public universities. Particularly, UNITEC’s graduates show a higher
             employment rate than graduates from other private universities.
            Income and job quality: More graduates from Laureate universities have income higher than their
             counterparts.
            Career advancement: More Laureate graduates were recently promoted and were likely to hold management
             positions than professionals in the control group. UVM’s graduates show a particularly high likelihood of
             being recently promoted.
            Gender gaps: Female graduates from Laureate, both in UVM and UNITEC, were more likely to hold
             management positions than females in the control group.
            Social progress: More Laureate graduates have moved upward from their previous socioeconomic status
             (based on their household’s socioeconomic level) than their counterparts. Furthermore, a higher number of
             Laureate graduates registered positive changes in their occupational prestige, compared to their parents.
            UNITEC graduates’ avenues to social mobility are driven mainly by higher income. UVM graduates’ avenues to
             social mobility are driven mainly by gains in occupational prestige.


The results are consistent across both control groups, both in the group formed by public and private universities and
the group consisting only of private universities. However, effects are stronger when comparing the treatment group
to the private universities only. Negative impacts were also found. Laureate alumni spent more time unemployed
since graduation and they find their bachelor’s studies less useful for their professional life than their counterparts. In
general, the main findings are consistent and reinforce each other. A correlation analysis (presented in Appendix 2.
Quasi-Experimental Impact Evaluation (based on Graduates’ Survey), section D) shows that those graduates, who
spent less time looking for their first job after college are more likely to have been promoted recently, and to be
holding a management position. They also tend to me more satisfied with their jobs, have a higher income and spent
shorter periods of time unemployed.
Moreover, the gender distribution allowed for the analysis of the differences in the impact a Laureate’s education
had on male and females. The evaluation results revealed clear signs that Laureate has a higher impact on women´s
careers. While the effects on men are significant and robust, effects are many times larger for women. Both UVM and
UNITEC seem to be contributing to closing the gender gap in career advancement.
Additionally, Laureate graduates show greater social mobility than their peers, relative to their family background.
For UNITEC, this is particularly significant, provided that their target students come from lower socioeconomic
classes. Over one tenth of them were able to join the highest strata after graduation. UNITEC alumni clearly jump to a
higher socioeconomic status, which is driven mainly by higher incomes. UVM alumni usually come from more affluent
backgrounds and, although they show a significant improvement, it is not as large as UNITEC alumni’s. Nonetheless,
social mobility in UVM is driven by joining a profession with higher prestige than their parent´s.
The job market perceives that Laureate alumni have competitive skills, when compared to undergraduates from
other universities, including those in the premium segment. This makes it feasible for recent Laureate graduates to
attain a higher-than-average level of compensation and expect promotions in the same time-lapse as their
counterparts. Moreover, the flexibility offered by Laureate institutions may be increasing a student’s possibilities of
receiving a greater amount of on-the-job training before graduation.

Based on qualitative data, the study found that Laureate alumni chose to join either UVM or UNITEC for reasons such
as name recognition, the flexibility in the academic system, as well as affordable tuition. They share the perception

that their degree helped them to enter the job market successfully. However, some of them expressed concerns
about being competitive in the long-term, in relation to their peers from non-Laureate top private universities.

This evaluation shows that Laureate universities in Mexico offer access to high quality higher education. While the
public sector provides access to higher education to many students, the demand for university degrees is unmet. The
private sector has been investing resources to meet such a demand. Particularly, this evaluation demonstrates that
Laureate universities in Mexico supply such degrees with positive implications in career advancement and social
mobility. Some people (including students) regard public or premium private education as the only viable option. This
study proves that Laureate education in Mexico is a viable option and better than other affordable private education
alternatives. Laureate alumni who completed a university degree found a good job, are advancing in their career, and
are directed towards upward social mobility.

    1. Introduction

Mexico is a country with high inequality, characterized by a relatively dynamic middle class, but by significant
immobility at the extremes of the distribution.5 According to the OECD, Mexico has the highest level of income
inequality amongst OECD countries, 52% above the OECD average.6 In terms of mobility, 48% of Mexicans in the
lowest quintile see no upward mobility in their lifetime. Likewise, 52% of Mexicans in the highest quintile remain
there. However, since the 2000s, Mexico has seen large declines in income distribution, with the middle three
quintiles of Mexico’s social classes showing a strong increase in income share.7 As a result, the possibility of social
mobility has become all the more relevant throughout the Mexican social classes.

Social mobility is the phenomenon that measures the equal opportunity of a given society. Social mobility refers to a
process and to an outcome, where the success of an individual is independent from the home and circumstances in
which such individual was born. It is measured by comparing parents’ and adult children’s socioeconomic standing;
the higher the correlation between them, the lower the mobility. In turn, socioeconomic standing is captured most
commonly by measuring current income, wealth, occupation or social class.8 Social mobility is considered high if the
barriers or advantages associated with the background of an individual are low. In other words, any person could
move upward or downward the socioeconomic ladder regardless of their parents’ status.

There are several factors that may affect social mobility. On the one hand, there are background factors such as
household income; parent´s education and occupation; family ethnicity and structure; and geographical region, which
are inherent characteristics that affect economic outcomes over time, especially on high-inequality societies.9 In
Mexico, children of parents that completed a college education are five times more likely to continue their education
than children with parents that only completed primary studies. Only 6% of Mexicans whose parent has an unskilled
manual occupation reached a white collar job, while 41% of Mexicans whose parent has a non-manual occupation
reached a white collar job. Furthermore, evidence shows that in Mexico, gender is a factor that also affects social
mobility, where there is higher mobility amongst women than amongst men.10 On the other hand, there are external
factors such as investing in human capital, which provide individuals with alternatives to affect their own outcomes.

Investing in human capital increases productivity, which leads to higher earnings and better social standing.11
Accordingly, evidence shows that higher education contributes toward a more mobile society.12,13 Obtaining a college
degree helps individuals move up in the income distribution relative to their peers.14 These findings are stronger for
people from the lower quintiles in the income distribution and for children with parents who did not enroll in tertiary
education.

The literature focuses on two types of specific mobility: income and occupational. The former (typically the domain of
economists) is the extent to which an adult’s relative ranking in the income distribution is similar to his or her

This report seeks to evaluate social mobility for Mexican undergraduates from Laureate institutions, a private
university system, specifically evaluating the effect of a Laureate education on both income and occupational mobility
at the individual level by focusing on returns to education as well as other avenues to social mobility (career
advancement and social progress). Its main purpose is to identify how Laureate undergraduates perform vis-à-vis
undergraduate students from other universities in Mexico, both public and private and with different performances,
recruitment and admission processes. Specifically, it aims to assess the performance of graduates in the labor market
and their avenues for social mobility, both from college graduates’ and their employers’ perspectives.

The outcome results assessed in this report can be grouped into three categories: a) Economic Capital and
Employment, which refers to various aspects of the alumni’s professional career and income generation after
graduation; b) Career Advancement, which measures ability to be promoted and access to managerial positions, and
c) Social Progress, which captures the change in an individual’s position within a power hierarchy via occupational
prestige and the change in socioeconomic levels during shorter periods of time (as opposed to an intergenerational
change). For those indicators with significant effects and enough data available, the analysis in this study goes
further, testing for differences by gender and socioeconomic background.

This is an ex-post impact evaluation. Namely, it was planned and implemented years after the individuals
participating in this study enrolled and graduated from college, cancelling the possibility of having baseline
information available. Thus, the study relies on data collected directly from the field, including a college graduate’s
survey (who enrolled between 2005 and 2007), an employer’s survey, and in-depth interviews to Laureate former
students. The analysis is based on a quasi-experimental approach for an impact evaluation, complemented with
descriptive statistics and qualitative information.

The report is organized as follows: section two states the motivation of the study; section three describes the
methodology; section four provides a description of the data sources; section five shows both the main results and
the limitations of the study, and section six presents the conclusions.

     2. Motivation of the Study

             i.    Higher Education in the Mexico City Area
At the beginning of every academic year, approximately 200,000 new students join an undergraduate program in
Mexico City’s Metropolitan Area (MCMA). This figure represents 21% of the total new enrollments at the national
level, the highest share in the country.15 A significant portion of these students attends two public universities: the
Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM)16 and the Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN)17. Together, these
institutions contain approximately 39% of the population enrolled in a higher education program in the metropolitan
area.18

UNAM is the largest university in Latin America. Currently, its total enrollment is approximately 190,00019 students
(26% of the total enrollment in MCMA). The IPN, with around 100,000 students, is Mexico´s second largest university,
accounting for 13% of the enrollment in the area (Table 1). In terms of their socioeconomic background, enrolled
students at UNAM and/or IPN are highly heterogeneous and distributed almost uniformly across the upper, middle,
and lower middle social classes.20 However, the public universities’ capacity to provide access to higher education is
limited. Only 14% of the applicants get admitted to these universities.21

Alternatively, the MCMA is also home to more than 180 private universities which, all combined, account for over
50% of the total undergraduate enrolled population.22 These colleges can be classified in two groups:23 financially
accessible universities and premium universities. The first group is constituted by private universities that provide
higher education degrees with flexible class schedules, shorter programs, and relatively low tuition fees. The flexible
class schedule scheme allows students to work full or part time, while shorter programs imply lower opportunity
costs. The tuition fees at these universities vary from $24,000 MXN ($1,630 USD) per year at Universidad ETAC24 to
$93,000 MXN ($6,500 USD) per year at Escuela Bancaria y Comercial (EBC).25 This group of universities has a market
share of 37% of the higher education system.26 Financially accessible private universities have an enrollment capacity
that is 26% more than their total applicant pool, signifying unused system capacity.27,28

By comparison, the premium, private universities charge relatively high tuition fees and most of their students are
enrolled in full time programs, while a large proportion of the faculty has a post-graduate degree. The cost of

   According to the Asociación Nacional de Universidades e Instituciones de Educación Superior (ANUIES) and Instituto Nacional de Estadística,
Geografía (INEGI), Mexico City’s metropolitan area also accounts for 22.8% of the total enrollment in higher education at the national level,
which is 3.45 million students.

    There are two other major public universities: Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana (UAM) and Universidad Autónoma de la Ciudad de
México, that account for 8% of total enrollment.

    This broad classification is based on Laureate’s knowledge of the higher education m arket. Universidad La Salle, at the lower bound of
premium universities, has an annual tuition fee of approximate $8,120 USD. UVM, at the upper bound of the finacially accesible universities,
costs annually approximately $6,100 USD. This classification simplifies the higher education market but proves useful as a starting point for
research about returns to college education in Mexico.

   Universities published its available places for enrollment each year. This 26% is the ratio of number of available seats divided by the number

premium universities fluctuates from $120,000 MXN ($8,120 USD) per year for a program at La Salle29 to $180,000
MXN ($12,235 USD) per year when studying at the ITESM30 (although all of these universities offer grants and
scholarships to a significant proportion of their students). The market share of this group of academic institutions is
about 6% of the total higher education students in the MCMA.31 Premium institutions of higher education usually
offer joint academic programs with prestigious universities in Europe and the United States, some of them have
appeared in international university ranks,32 and their alumni hold high positions in the public and private sectors.
Premium private universities are more selective than those in the financially accessible group, with an average
rejection rate of 18%.33

The market share for private universities in general is highly fragmented. Table 1 shows enrollment figures for the
four largest universities (based on total enrollment) for each category of universities in the MCMA. None of the
private institutions hold more than 3% of the market. However, there is limited data about the economic and social
returns of attending a specific college vis-à-vis the alternatives. This fact suggests that, although institutions may
follow different strategies to enroll new students and achieve high standards of educational quality, aspiring students

them do not get access to a college education.34 This is mainly due to the fact that for most of the individuals who are
not offered admission in a public university (approximately 370,000) there are not enough spots available for them in
private universities (either financially accessible or premium).35 It is also true that not all of the individuals who do not
get access to a public university apply to a private alternative, either because they cannot afford them or do not
consider them a viable option. This constitutes a market opportunity that private universities, especially those in the
financially accessible group, are trying to address. Nonetheless, this is a highly competitive sector and even
institutions offering grants and scholarships failed to achieve their targeted level of admission applications.36


            ii.    The Laureate Education Program
Laureate International Universities37 is a leading international network of institutions of higher education. The
Laureate network is comprised of more than 80 universities which provide undergraduate and graduate programs to
over 950,000 students around the world. These students belong to an international and academic community that
spans 29 countries throughout the Americas, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Middle East. Laureate’s universities offer
hundreds of career-focused undergraduate, master's, and doctoral programs in fields such as architecture, art,
business, culinary arts, design, education, engineering, health sciences, hospitality management, information
technology, law, and medicine.

Relationships amongst this network of universities are enriched with shared curricula, faculty, degree programs, and
student exchange opportunities. However, every institution in the Laureate network operates under its own unique
brand, guided by local leadership, and actively involved in its community.

Over the past decade, Laureate acquired two major universities in Mexico: the Universidad del Valle de México (UVM)
and the Universidad Tecnológica de México (UNITEC).38 While UVM has national coverage, UNITEC’s reach spans
Mexico City’s Metropolitan Area and nearby cities such as Toluca (in the State of México) and Leon (in the State of
Guanajuato).

UVM is the largest system of private universities in Mexico, with more than 120,000 students nationwide, and more
than 33,000 in the MCMA.39 It offers undergraduate (both traditional and working adult) and graduate programs on
37 campuses throughout the country, as well as education programs at the high school level. UVM’s higher education
programs span diverse fields such as: arts and humanities, economics, business administration, engineering, health
sciences, and social sciences. Also, its students have the opportunity to enroll in dual-degree programs with other
academic institutions in the Laureate International Universities network, including École Supérieure du Commerce
Extérieur (France), Glion Institute of Higher Education (Switzerland), Universidad Europea de Madrid (Spain), and
Walden University (United States). The cost of studying for one year at a UVM’s campus in Mexico City is roughly
$90,000 MXN ($6,100 USD), that is, a cost located at the upper end within the category of financially accessible
universities.

On the other hand, UNITEC is a financially accessible alternative that focuses on increasing access to higher education
by offering affordable programs ($2,000 USD per year, roughly one third of UVM’s tuition fee) and shorter degrees (3
years, instead of 4.5). There are nearly 60,000 students enrolled nationwide throughout its 6 campuses and online

academic programs in fields such as: arts and design, biological medical sciences, business administration,
engineering sciences, and social sciences. Business administration and dentistry are among the school’s best -known
and in-demand programs.42

Even though UVM and UNITEC were categorized as financially accessible private universities, and have almost the
same market share in the MCMA (4.4% and 4.9% respectively),43 they target populations from different
socioeconomic backgrounds and with different academic profiles and interests. While UVM’s students generally
belong to upper and middle socioeconomic classes, the majority of UNITEC’s students come from middle and lower
socioeconomic class households.44 In terms of academic interests, UVM is well-known for its programs in social and
administrative sciences, whereas UNITEC’s more sought-after degrees come from the engineering and health
sciences disciplines. Finally, the duration of the academic programs is slightly different as well. While 40% of UNITEC
students completed their studies in 3 years, only 16% of UMV students graduated in the same period of time.

          iii.   Research Objectives
The study sought to evaluate returns to education for college graduates from Laureate universities vis-à-vis graduates
from other universities. In order to achieve this goal, three specific objectives were established:

     1. Identify the impact of having a degree from a Laureate institution on factors related to social mobility,45 vis-à-
        vis having a degree from another university.

         The underlying hypothesis behind this objective is that a Laureate education results in better professional
         outcomes and that investing in this type of private education delivers better chances of upward social
         mobility compared to other universities, recognizing that at times, the impact a Laureate education has on
         professional outcomes will be different for males and females.

     2. Provide an employer’s perspective of the perceived market value of the Laureate alumni.

         This objective seeks to understand how employers perceive the performance, skills, and quality of work of
         Laureate alumni.

     3. Understand the perceptions of Laureate alumni regarding their career expectations and levels of satisfaction.

         This objective aims to study Laureate alumni’s motivation to enroll in those universities and build a narrative
         that explains their professional expectations and perceptions about socioeconomic mobility.

    3. Methodology
           i.   The Research Questions
In order to assess whether a Laureate higher education grants its graduates greater economic and social benefits by
improving their professional outcomes, the study identified a specific set of research questions. The research
questions, as presented below in Table 2, were defined in accordance with the three specific objectives.

                                        Table 2. Research questions, by objective

          ii.   Research Design
To assess the impacts of a Laureate higher education in the performance of graduates in the labor market, career
advancement, and social progress (their avenues for social mobility), the research plan followed a mixed-methods
approach. Therefore, every specific objective was developed based on different methodological approaches with
specific data sources (Table 3). Provided that the results from the impact evaluation are the most robust, these are
considered the main findings of this report. Information from employers’ survey and alumni in-depth interviews
contributes to develop a richer and multidimensional narrative, as well as ascertain that the statistical findings of the
impact evaluation are in line with employers’ and alumni’s perceptions.
                                                                                                     13

                  A. First Approach: Quasi-Experimental Design

In the first approach, the study focused on a set of outcomes related to the graduates’ income, employability, career
advancement, and social progress, comparing between Laureate alumni and graduates from other universities (Table
4). The following tasks were performed:
             1. Design of a questionnaire for graduates
             2. Review of the UVM and UNITEC administrative information
             3. Definition of the sampling frame
             4. Collection of primary data through telephone, and face to face surveys to graduates (1,480 surveys
                after piloting a small sample)
             5. Construction of the final matched sample
             6. Perform statistical tests to analyze the data obtained from the survey and assess the impact of the
                Laureate institutions´ programs
Firstly, the questionnaire was designed based on the following outcome indicators related to social mobility:

  C230 is grateful to the Market Research Department of Laureate-Mexico for its useful support and valuable comments during the design and
implementation of the surveys.
                                                                                                                14
This methodological approach relied on comparing outcomes from a treatment group (UVM and UNITEC) to a control
group (other private and public universities). The treatment group included individuals who enrolled in and graduated
from the traditional bachelor degrees offered by UVM and UNITEC (Figure 1).47 More precisely, those individuals
between the ages of 17 and 21 years old at the time of enrollment (during the years 2005-2007), who attended a
Laureate institution located in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area. To maintain a higher level of homogeneity in the
treatment group, the individuals that graduated from an executive program were not considered in this study, as
these individuals usually start studying at later ages (around 25 years old or more) and, in general, might already have
some work experience before their enrollment.48 Hence, the treatment group was limited to individuals born
between 1984 and 1989.

The treatment group considered students from only 10 of the most representative academic programs, which
account for 82% of Laureate alumni.49 The selected majors seemed suitable to be considered since they constitute
the most demanded programs in Mexico City, and thus facilitated the comparison between different universities. 50

In terms of the year of enrollment, 2005, 2006 and 2007 seemed to be the most appropriate years for the study. On
one hand, the intention was to go back as far as possible, in order to assess Laureate´s alumni career development
over an extended period of time (four to five years). On the other hand, there was a restriction as Laureate took
control over and made important institutional changes to UNITEC and UVM during the second half of the past
decade. Incidentally, 2005 is the first year in which there are sound administrative records containing alumni contact
information. These enrollment years guaranteed the influence of Laureate in UVM and UNITEC, while ensuring that
graduates had at least three years of experience in the job market post-graduation.

university (counterfactual).

   Choosing only enrollment as the treatment would increase the number of treated individuals and might facilitate the calculation of elasticity
of enrollment into Laureate. Nevertheless, it would complicate the interpretation of the results, increase heterogeneity in the sample, and add
marginal information to the study (an important increase in the number of interviews would be necessary to calculate treatment elasticity).
                                                                                                                     15
                       a.    Building a Valid Control Group

The quasi-experimental control group relied on finding individuals that graduated from other public and private
universities, who are the most comparable to the treatment group based on pretreatment observable characteristics.
Two different comparison groups were proposed:

          1. A group of individuals who graduated from other (non-Laureate) universities, which includes both public
             and private institutions.
          2. A group of individuals who graduated from a (non-Laureate) private university only, including financially
              accessible and premium universities.

This categorization was constructed taking into consideration the importance of having a sample that represented
the diverse types of academic institutions operating in the MCMA. In particular, the group of financially accessible
private universities is somehow comparable to UVM or UNITEC in terms of factors like cost of tuition, offered majors,
enrollment, campus infrastructure, prestige of graduates, and students’ socioeconomic status. Nonetheless, private
premium universities present some characteristics similar to UVM and UNITEC’s, such as offered majors, campus
infrastructure, and student’s socioeconomic status and, as a result, were included in the control group.

                       b.    The Matching Strategy

The impact evaluation relied on a matching procedure. The main purpose was to have individuals in the treatment
and control groups with similar conditions previous to college enrollment. The premise was that if the initial
conditions were as similar as possible, the difference in the outcome variables could be explained by receiving the
treatment (namely, a Laureate degree).

Any matching process always assumes that all relevant variables, or covariates, can be observed and account for all
pre-treatment differences across the treatment and control groups. Moreover, such covariates should not be
affected by the treatment. In this case, the pre-treatment observable variables that meet these conditions are:
gender, age, enrollment year, household socioeconomic status, parents’ educational background, employment status
before a student´s enrollment, and high school’s type (Table 5).

                                                      Table 5. Matching Covariates
                 Variables                                                 Description

          Age                       Individuals born between 1984 and 1989

          Education of Mother       The highest educational level attained by the graduate’s mother*
          Socioeconomic             The pre-enrollment socioeconomic status of household measured by AMAI (see Appendix

          Type of High-School       Attended public or private high-school before enrollment at university
          Employment Status         Whether the graduate had a job before university enrollment


The impact evaluation was implemented by conducting a one-to-one matching with replacement following a genetic
search algorithm.51 The Genetic Matching Algorithm searches amongst a range of distance metrics to find the
particular measure that optimizes post-matching covariate balance across the treatment and control groups. Each

potential distance metric considered corresponds to a particular assignment of weights for all matching variables. The
algorithm weights each variable according to its relative importance and iterates until achieving the best overall
balance.52, 53

The matching strategy achieved a successful balance across the treatment and control groups. Some matching
variables presented significant disparities in the pre-matched sample. Such was the case for variables such as
socioeconomic levels, parents’ education, and high school background, a clear reminder that a simple comparison
cannot be made for graduates of different universities. Table 6 presents descriptive statistics for the matching
variables (prior to the treatment) before and after running the Genetic Matching Algorithm, showing that the
differences disappear, although at the cost of losing observations in the process.54

   As an alternative, Coarsened Exact Match (CEM) was proposed and the research team compared some of the outcomes with those obtained
from Genetic Caliper Matching. The results are similar, and move in the same direction. However, CEM results have a lower magnitude, bigger
standard errors, and the covariate balance between the treatment and control group is not as precise as the one achieved by the Genetic
Caliper algorithm, although the number of matched observations was larger.

The distribution of the universities represented in the matched control group broadly corresponds with the entire
sample’s composition. The majority of the surveyed alumni attended either UNAM or IPN (64%), followed by almost a
third of them who attended a financially accessible university (27%). There are alumni from other public universities
(7%), and from premium private universities (2%).

  The treatment and control group matching was done utilizing the outcome variable “current status of employment,” therefore th ere were no
missing values for said variable.
                                                                                                                    19
Missing Observations

Missing observations in the outcome variables are a concern. They can potentially introduce a bias to the impact
estimate if the missing data is correlated to unobserved factors. In other words, if missing values differ systematically
between treatment and control groups, the impact estimate may be due to pre-treatment unobserved differences
correlated to non-response (missing values), rather than due to a post-treatment effect. Appendix 3: presents a table
with descriptive statistics.

The most susceptible outcomes to non-response bias, in this study, are “employment benefits” and “income.” The
missing observations constitute more than 30% of the observations for the matched sample. If it is the case that
people with lower quality of employment are less prone to provide information, then there is an upward bias,
overestimating the impact for the treatment group. The “percentage of recently promoted” and “satisfaction with
current job” outcomes are also compromised, although to a lesser degree, having less than 20% observations missing.

Other variables have more observations missing in the treatment group than in the control group, but they account
for less than 8% of each sample.56

This issue has been addressed with a methodology that fills the missing data with plausible values: Multiple
Imputation. Our research follows a methodology proposed in King et al,57 implemented with the software Amelia II.58
In particular, five data sets were generated, with different plausible values, to account for uncertainty in the
imputation process. The matching algorithm was implemented for each of the data sets, and then combined into one
estimator for every outcome variable. Finally, those estimators were compared to those produced without correcting
for missing observations. Section 5 errs on the side of caution, presenting the estimators for the outcomes that are
consistent in both approaches.




56
   Such is the case of percentage of currently employed, maximum period in unemployment, time looking for first job and percentage in
management positions. However, there are robust variables with low percentages of missing observations and not different across control and
treatment groups; which are: positive chance in socio economic index and positive change in intergenerational prestige based on occupation.

            B. Second Approach: Employers’ Perceptions About Graduates Performance and Market Value

The Employers’ Survey served as a complement to the impact analysis done with the main survey (Graduates’
Survey). The main idea of this approach was to understand employers’ perceptions regarding the performance and
market value of Laureate alumni, compared to graduates from other universities. The tasks performed in this
approach included:

           1. Design of a questionnaire for employers
           2. Review of the Laureate’s databases for information regarding the main employers
           3. Definition of the sampling frame using the National Statistics Directory of Economic Units (DENUE),
              and information from Laureate’s databases
           4. Collection of primary data through 400 MCMA employers’ telephone surveys (after piloting on a small
              sample)
           5. Analysis of data obtained from the surveys, in order to understand the perceived market value of
              Laureate alumni according to the employers
The filters (during the construction of the sample frame) to select employers were the following: 1) firms located in
the MCMA, because of the geographical scope of the study; 2) firms that might know about graduates from either
UVM or UNITEC, to express more realistic perceptions about how they compare them to graduates from other
universities, and 3) firms from medium to large sizes, in order to increase the likelihood of surveying companies that
have experience working with university graduates. The filter criteria are shown in Figure 3.

                C. Third Approach: Qualitative Perception of Laureate Graduates

The evaluation performed a series of in-depth interviews to a selected sample of Laureate alumni. The objective of
this approach was to gather more insights on the graduates’ personal achievements, fulfillment of expectations, and
perceptions regarding social mobility-related aspects.

In-depth interviews are useful to understand behaviors or to contextualize other data. For example, qualitative
interviews can help to put results assessed through a quantitative setting into context, offering a more complete
picture of what is happening and why. This approach was also important to check for possible survey response bias,
specifically with the interpretation and validation of the direction of the quantitative results, as well as to clarify some
hypothesis from the impact evaluation.

The first step was to develop a guide containing all the possible topics to be discussed during the interviews. The
second step consisted in carrying out 20 in-depth interviews (two hours long), focused on perceptions about the
professional and personal life of UVM and UNITEC alumni (with social mobility as a central topic).

The qualitative analysis was structured around three key moments in the consolidation of a graduate’s professional
life: the construction of the idea of the college experience and its influence in the conformation of a life plan, the
complete college experience, and finally, the insertion into the job market and its impact on the professional life of
the graduate. The main topics of interest for each of these three moments are listed in Figure 4.

     4. Data Sources
             i.    C230-IFC Graduates’ Survey
For the first approach (quasi-experimental design), it was necessary to gather information about pre-treatment
observable characteristics (matching variables), and also post-treatment data (outcome variables), by implementing a
survey. The study relied on the Laureate alumni administrative databases in order to contact graduates for the
treatment group. These Laureate alumni databases included only individuals who had graduated from either UVM or
UNITEC between years of 2006 and 2012.

To contact graduates for the control group (other universities), the study employed two sources. 1) A market
research database (obtained from a marketing firm) that contained contact information as well as the filter variables
to match the treatment group (Table 8). The database was already a selected sample of individuals that passed the
filter variables; however, the telephone survey was applied only to those individuals that passed a second, over-the-
phone filter. 2) On-field exploration of areas with high job density59 to complete the number of observations required
for the control sample. Randomly selected individuals were surveyed face-to-face at many commercial and industrial
areas in MCMA. Candidates were selected based on the following criteria (filter variables).

The low response rate observed at the pilot stage generated the necessity of a very large sample size.60 As expected,
data collection was the most challenging step of the evaluation. Contacting working graduates presents many
obstacles due to the length of the working day in Mexico City and the difficulty in obtaining information about
income and expenditure. The call center (telephone surveys) was open 16 hours a day 7 days a week for 6 weeks in
order to call approximately 10,000 graduates, and obtain the required number of surveys.61 The average length of the
survey was 16 minutes and the successful contact rate at the call center was 8.6%.62 The original data collection plan
included only telephone surveys. The low successful contact rate required the evaluators to plan for an on-field
exploration to obtain the sample size required for the matching procedures. Face-to-face surveys come with
methodological caveats63 but made this evaluation possible. Both the telephone and the face-to-face survey were
implemented during October and November of 2014. Table 9 below shows the number of surveys obtained from
each source of data as well as the sample they belong to. For the control group, most of the surveys came from the
face-to-face (on-field) channel.

   Jobs density is defined as the number of jobs in an area divided by the resident population aged 16-64 in that area. For example, a job density
of 1.0 would mean that there is one job for every resident aged 16-64.
60
   Roughly 11% of the called individuals accepted the survey.
61
   More than 4,000 from UVM, around 3,000 from UNITEC and 3,200 from the market research database.
62
    Successful contact rate is calculated as the ratio of effective surveys divided by the number of called graduates in the database. The
successful contact rate was 8.7% for the UVM database, 9.5 for UNITEC’s and 7.6% for the market research database.
63
   Face-to-face surveys were implemented in areas with high job density which produced a sample more likely to be employed. Thus, study may
be producing an underestimation of employability impacts.

            ii.    Employers’ Survey
For the second approach (Employers’ Survey), 400 surveys were conducted. In most of the cases, an appointment
was necessary in order to contact the human resources officer responsible of hiring and evaluating employees. The
survey was carried out over four weeks during October and November of 2014. The final composition of the
employers’ survey sample is shown in Figure 5.

          iii.   In-Depth Qualitative Interviews
For the third approach (in-depth qualitative interviews to graduates), 20 graduates (10 from UVM and 10 from
UNITEC) were selected from the 637 effective quantitative surveys in the treatment group. The selection of profiles
sought purposely (not randomly) to balance the different experiences while studying at these universities by
including stories of professional failures and successes, as well as aspects such as: social mobility, gender inequality,
international experience, expectations about future, among others.

The 20 in-depth qualitative interviews were completed during 3 weeks of work between October and November
2014.

Figure 6 presents the composition of the sample used for the in-depth interviews. The sample had the same
proportion of men and women, and other variables of interest were: university, major, employment status at the
time of the interview, and type of business or employer. This composition guaranteed a diversity of profiles and
experiences.

          5. Findings64

     i.      Employability (Access to Jobs and Unemployment)

UNITEC alumni have a higher employment rate (92%) compared to graduates from other private universities (87%).
This is a positive difference of 5 percentage points.65 In contrast, UVM does not show an employment rate different
from both of the control groups (Figure 7, graphs a and b). Laureate alumni found their first job more quickly after
graduation than their counterparts from other private and public universities. The evaluation found that Laureate
graduates spent, on average, 1.3 months less to obtain their first job after graduation than the entire control group
(5.7 months vs 7 months, respectively), and when the control group is restricted to only private universities, the
magnitude of the effect is twofold (2.6 less months to find the first job). The results are more favorable for UNITEC;
nonetheless, UVM shows a consistent impact when compared to other private universities (Figure 7, graphs c and d).

However, Laureate alumni have remained unemployed for longer periods of time since their graduation. On
average, Laureate alumni have experienced periods of unemployment that are 36% longer than graduates from other
universities since their graduation. On average, the maximum amount of consecutive time spent unemployed was 5.4
months for Laureate alumni and 4 months for the entire control group. The negative impact is greater for UVM; its
graduates had unemployment periods 2.8 months longer than their counterparts (a 76% difference). When
comparing only against the private universities, the results are consistent (see Figure 7, graphs e and f).

   Results presented in this section were estimated using the standard approach (not correcting for missing observations), except for the case of
income variable. Appendix 4 shows a table comparing outcomes with those estimated with multiple imputations. Unless explicitly noted, results
are generally consistent.

The surveyed employers perceive that Laureate alumni have competitive skills compared to graduates from other
universities. UNITEC and UVM alumni were graded with high scores consistently (4 out of 5 and above) in every skill
considered important by the employers. However, there are some aspects that should be strengthened, as graduates
from public and premium universities outperformed them in verbal and written communication and leadership skills.
Laureate alumni seem to be relatively strong regarding new technologies and team work and outperformed
financially accessible universities in every field (see Figure 8 ).

The majority of employers find the Laureate alumni’s profile either attractive or very attractive. Employers find
65% of UVM alumni and 62% of UNITEC alumni in the range of attractive to very attractive (see Figure 9).

During in-depth interviews, both UNITEC and UVM alumni agreed that at school they developed valuable tools to
enter the job market. However, some of them expressed concerns regarding how competitive they are when they
are compared to graduates from other universities. It seemed to them that both UVM and UNITEC are perceived to
be at an intermediate level of academic preparation during college.

UNITEC alumni earn on average $2,034 MXN ($134 USD) more than their peers in other private universities, a 19%
significant difference. No effects were found when making the comparison against the larger control group (see

UVM’s results are consistent. The impact on income is around 13% when comparing to private universities and non-
significant compared to private and public universities together (see Figure 11).

More generally, on average Laureate alumni earn $1,542.06 MXN ($101 USD) more than graduates from other
private universities (a 15% difference) (see Figure 12, graph a). Regarding job quality, the number of employment
benefits offered to Laureate alumni (1.98 out of 3) is higher than the control group (1.84), a six percent difference.

   Due to the high frequency of missing observations, impact for the income variable was calculated using a multiple imputation tool proposed
in King et al (2001) and implemented with the software Amelia II.
                                                                                                                    29

significant.

According to the surveyed employers, it is feasible for a recent Laureate graduate to attain a higher than average
level of compensation. While the market is willing to pay an average monthly salary of $6,427 MXN ($423 USD) to
recent college graduates, the employers expressed willingness to pay a monthly salary of $6,821 MXN ($449 USD) to
a UVM graduate, and $7,124 MXN ($469 USD) to a UNITEC graduate (6% and 11% more, respectively).

The in-depth qualitative interviews revealed that a substantial portion of Laureate alumni had started working
while they were still studying. By entering the job market before completing their studies, they were more likely to
receive lower wage compensations initially, but also more likely to obtain substantial wage raises during their career.

                                                                   I’m financially independent. My father and I support our household.

 iii.   Satisfaction with Current Professional Life

There are important challenges concerning professional success and career satisfaction for Laureate alumni. Firstly,
Laureate alumni regard their undergraduate studies as less useful than graduates from other universities. In
general, Laureate alumni believe their major is less useful for professional life, from a 1-7 point scale (where 7 is the
highest level of satisfaction), the average score is 0.20 points lower (a 4% lower valuation) than graduates from other
control group universities (see Figure 13, graphs a and b). When the control group is restricted to only private
universities, the difference is twofold for the Laureate alumni in general. Results for both for UVM and UNITEC
separately are consistent.

Secondly, Laureate alumni are less satisfied with their current jobs than their peers in other private universities.
The average score in terms of current job satisfaction is 5.82 points for Laureate alumni and 6.26 points for the
control group. This is a 7% lower valuation for current job satisfaction, a statistically significant difference. This is also
the case when UNITEC and UVM are compared (either separately or jointly) to other private universities (see Figure
13, graphs c and d). Nonetheless, these results are not significant when Multiple Imputation is used to correct for
missing data. When impact estimates are not robust, such as in this case, results have to be interpreted
conservatively.

However, some graduates identify positive achievements in their professional or personal life. During in-depth
interviews they mentioned having opened their own businesses or organizations, having moved out of their parents’
house, having studied for a higher degree, amongst others. In particular, graduates who have started their own
business or organization perceived their achievements to be like dreams come true. Those graduates who could not
clearly identify big personal achievements in their past generally have an optimistic view of their future.

              [UNITEC for me] plays an important role. It gave me the tools to professionalize my business, including
                        doing budgets, knowing how important our image is, and being on time with our deliveries.

 iv.    Career Advancement (Executive Positions and Promotions)

A higher percentage of Laureate graduates are currently holding managerial positions, vis-à-vis the general control
group (26% vs 17%, respectively). This is particularly relevant, since holding a managerial position signifies career
advancement and leadership. When compared only to other private universities, the impact of a Laureate education
is relatively higher and statistically significant. Results for UVM and UNITEC separately are consistent (see Figure 14,
graphs a and b).
Also, more Laureate graduates have been recently promoted in the workplace. While 35% of the Laureate alumni
have been promoted in their current job, the same is true for only 27% of the control group. This is a 29% significant
difference (see Figure 14, graphs c and d). When compared to other private universities, all of the differences are
larger: for Laureate alumni in general, 1.7 times higher; for UVM alumni, 2.4 times higher; and for UNITEC alumni 79%
higher.

The outcomes for career advancement are especially favorable for women, for both UVM and UNITEC. While the
average effect for the proportion of men holding a management position is 5 percentage points (a 25% difference),
the effect for women is 13 points (more than 100% difference). Regarding the proportion of alumni that recently
received a promotion, the effect is 5 percentage points for men (a 15% difference) and 15 percentage points for
women (a 95% difference).

Employers agree that Laureate alumni have a positive outlook for career advancements and this increases their
compensation. They consider that it is feasible for a Laureate graduate who has five years of work experience to
achieve an increase in compensation.

During in-depth interviews, both UNITEC and UVM alumni agreed that they have competitive skills to access mid-
level management positions in important companies. However, they also recognized that more barriers exist when
trying to reach certain top management positions. There is a perception that graduates from private premium
universities have easier access to high level positions due to social networks.

Laureate alumni also believe that Laureate institutions are contributing positively to their career advancement by
providing them with more management tools for their jobs. An UVM graduated declared: “There are many courses
that are focused on managing, knowing your people, knowing how to lead”. However, another group of Laureate
graduates advocated that leadership skills must be taught at Laureate institutions with the same high level of
effectiveness that is carried out at private premium universities.

  v.    Changes in Socioeconomic Status

A Laureate education is having a positive impact on the socioeconomic status of its alumni. The percentage of
Laureate graduates who have experimented positive changes in their socioeconomic index (based on the values of
the AMAI, comparing prior to enrollment and at the time of the survey) is 55% higher for Laureate graduates than the
entire control group (28% vs 18%, respectively). This difference is statistically significant also for UNITEC graduates
(difference of 89% or 19 percentage points higher). When compared only to the private universities, the differences
are larger, positive and significant for Laureate (1.7 times higher), UVM (1.6 times higher) and UNITEC (2.67 times
higher) (Figure 17, graphs a and b).

Figure 18 presents the distribution of these effects for UNITEC, by socioeconomic level before enrollment . It clearly
shows that a UNITEC education has an impact across students with different socioeconomic backgrounds. For those
in the D segment (lower income) particularly, virtually all of the students experienced an upward change (a 67%
difference when compared to the entire control group). But also, individuals with a middle class background
experienced the strongest effects. For individuals in segment C+, the difference with the control group is more than
300% and for those in the C segment, the difference is 100%. The results are not significant for UVM graduates.

A higher percentage of Laureate graduates have gained intergenerational prestige based on their occupation.67 The
evaluation finds that the percentage of graduates who have experienced positive changes in the index of
intergenerational prestige based on their occupation is 14% higher and significant for Laureate graduates (the
average change is 64% in the Laureate group and 56% in the control group). The comparison against only private
universities shows significant impacts for Laureate (difference 22% higher), UVM (difference 31% higher) or UNITEC
(difference 16% higher) graduates. This effect is particularly significant and consistent for UVM graduates with a
50% difference when compared to the entire control group (Figure 17, graphs e and f). This is equivalent to moving
from an occupation such as mechanical maintenance worker (for parents) to a department coordinator in a company
or government agency (for alumni). Figure 19 presents the distribution of the “impact in positive change in
percentage of graduates who gained intergenerational occupational prestige” for Laureate and UVM graduates, by
socioeconomic level before enrollment.68 For all strata, there was a positive change. However, for those in the C+
segment, typically middle class, the increase was more dramatic, a more than 200% difference compared to the
entire control group.

Although many of the Laureate graduates interviewed declared that they have maintained their previous
socioeconomic status, some of them perceived an upwards change, especially to the highest social stratum. In
particular, some pointed out that entrepreneurship, access to jobs with clear career opportunities, and their
aspirations to achieve top management positions constitute the best ways to move upward in the socioeconomic
scale. The in-depth interviews also revealed some contrast between the socioeconomic situation of UVM and
UNITEC alumni during their early personal life. While almost every interviewee from UVM declared the economic
situation of her family to be stable during her childhood, UNITEC graduates may have had a relatively more difficult
childhood. This may explain why UNITEC graduates may be more likely to experience economic mobility, since they
come from lower socioeconomic levels than UVM graduates. For example, while an undergraduate from UVM
declared: “Fortunately, during my childhood, we [my parents, siblings, and I] were in a quite comfortable economic
situation, with no unmet needs, two cars, our own house…”; in contrast, a quote from UNITEC exposed that: “It was a
neighborhood without public services and the streets were unpaved. Our family moved here when the house was just
a concrete slab of flooring and we began building it up from there.”

Sensitivity Analysis and Methodological Limitations

Matching estimators rely on the strong assumption that observable covariates fully explain the difference between
the treatment and control groups. However there is a risk that when there are unobserved factors that may explain
individual self-selection, the matching estimates are biased. Given the ex-post design of the impact evaluation, it is
impossible to know how prospective students made the decision to join a Laureate institution or any of the
alternatives, and to what extent there were unobserved covariates shaping such decision.

In order to follow high standards of methodological rigor, a study must test the validity of estimates. Rosembaum69
proposes a sensitivity analysis methodology in order to test the validity of the matching estimates when unobserved
covariates affect the probability of treatment. Following an approach to implement this test proposed by Keele,70
“Rosembaum bounds” were estimated for the p-value of all the matching estimates of this study.71 The results of the
sensitivity analysis indicate that the findings presented in this section are highly sensitive to the presence of
unobserved covariates; in other words, findings would not be robust if unobservable variables have shaped the
schooling decision of the study sample.72

Research on education outcomes poses the methodological challenge of dealing with unobservable variables, such as
student’s motivation. This unobservable factor may be correlated with the decision of attending a Laureate university
and likewise correlated to outcomes such as employability, income, career advancement, and social progress.
Similarly, as mentioned earlier, non-response bias73 imposes another internal validity threat, which is dealt through
Multiple Imputation. Thirdly, the employment differences between the telephone and the face-to-face survey may be
cofounding with treatment effects, and producing imprecise impact estimates.

A final methodological consideration is the external validity of the study. The matched sample may not be a
representative sample of Laureate population. Matching procedures reduce the sample so as to make comparable
treatment and control groups. Such contraction of the sample compromises the study´s capacity to extrapolate
conclusions to all Laureate education. Moreover, the study excluded executive programs and specific majors from the
impact analysis, and so conclusions must be taken with caution when speaking broadly about Laureate.

control and treatment groups, could produce a treatment and control group not entirely comparable.

     6. Recommendations and Conclusions

                             Graduating from my university has given me the greatest satisfaction of my past few years.
                                                                                                      Laureate alumnus

Laureate universities offer higher education degrees that enhance the performance of their undergraduates in the
labor market and provide more opportunities and pathways for social mobility relative to other affordable education
alternatives. This is particularly relevant in the Mexican context where there is an unmet demand for college degrees
and private universities face a highly competitive market to expand their services. Laureate is contributing to expand
not only the quantity of educational facilities, but the quality as well.

Through this evaluation, it was possible to identify significant impacts of a Laureate education in most of the analyzed
outcome variables. In general, when compared to the control group, the most robust results74 indicate that Laureate
has a positive effect on aspects including:
        Employability: Laureate graduates spent less time when searching for their first job after graduation than
         their counterparts in other private and public universities. UNITEC’s graduates show a particularly higher
         employment rate compared to graduates from other private universities.
        Income and job quality: More graduates from the Laureate universities have monthly wages and incomes
         higher than their counterparts.
        Career advancement: More Laureate graduates were promoted recently and were more likely to hold
         management positions than graduates in the control group.
        Gender gaps: Female graduates from Laureate were more likely to hold management positions than females
         in the control group.
        Social progress: More Laureate graduates have moved upward from their previous socioeconomic status
         (based on household socioeconomic level) than their peers. Furthermore, a higher number of Laureate
         graduates registered positive changes in their occupational prestige, compared to their parents.
Results are consistent across both control groups, one of which consisted of both public and private universities and
one of which consisted of only private universities. However, some negative impacts were also found. Laureate
alumni spent more consecutive time unemployed since graduation. They also reported that their studies had been
less relevant for their professional careers than their counterparts from other universities.
The main findings are consistent and reinforce each other. A correlation analysis (presented in Appendix 2. Quasi-
Experimental Impact Evaluation (based on Graduates’ Survey), section D) shows, for example, that those graduates
who spent less time looking for their first job after college were more likely to have been promoted recently and to
be holding a management position. They also tend to be more satisfied with their jobs, have a higher income, and
have spent less time unemployed.
Mexico is a country with signs of high inequality and low social mobility,75 a fact that is evident in the Graduate
Survey conducted for this study.76 Within this context, the positive effects of a Laureate education on social mobility
are noteworthy. The study’s two key findings are as follows. Firstly, a UNITEC education helps its college graduates
get better paying jobs compared to their parents. This is particularly significant because their target student body
tends to come from lower socioeconomic classes. UNITEC is contributing to social mobility through higher income.
This study shows that UNITEC provides an education with high returns, which becomes an avenue for social mobility.
Over one tenth of UNITEC graduates were able to join the highest socioeconomic strata after graduation. Secondly,
UVM, with students from relatively more affluent backgrounds, helps its college graduates get more prestigious jobs
compared to their parents. UVM is contributing to social mobility through occupational prestige. Further research

   Intergenerational correlation between socioeconomic statuses, highest attained level of education and income is positive and significant for
the whole sample, for the control group and for UVM graduates.
                                                                                                                    38
on the effects of affordable higher education in more or less mobile societies would be an important contribution to
the field.

While the effects of Laureate education on career advancement among male students are significant and robust,
these effects are many times larger for female students. Female alumni of Laureate universities advance in their
careers at a faster pace than their female peers from other universities. This study provides preliminary insights
about how Laureate can become an instrument to close the gap between men and women in career opportunities.
Based on in-depth interviews, the study found that Laureate alumni chose to join either UVM or UNITEC for reasons
including name recognition, the flexibility in the academic system, and affordable tuition. They share the perception
that their degree helped them to enter the job market successfully. These interviews also provided hints that some
Laureate college graduates were rejected by public universities (UNAM and IPN). This study shows that a Laureate
degree is a sound choice not only because it is affordable, but because it provides high returns on their educational
investment and avenues to social mobility.

Potential employers perceive that Laureate alumni have competitive skills compared to undergraduates from other
universities, including those in the premium segment. Because of this, recent Laureate graduates receive higher-than-
average levels of compensation and many receive a promotion in the same time-lapse as their “premium”
counterparts. Employers, in many cases, see that Laureate graduates are as valuable as graduates from public
universities and premium private universities.

Laureate students are attractive at first glance and find jobs quickly, but at the same time they spent more time
unemployed, which could point to a contradiction. However, this does not mean that graduates may be attractive for
the market at graduation but less competitive in the longer term. The study finds that Laureate recent graduates are
attractive, but also, that they develop long term skills: more Laureate graduates have outperformed the career
advancement of non-Laureate graduates.

Perhaps the most significant limitation of this study is that, while it identifies Laureate’s high-achieving graduate
performance, it cannot explain what the specific mechanisms that explain these results are. This opens an
opportunity for further research. It is important to understand what Laureate is doing better than its competitors.
What mechanisms can explain these high returns on educational investment? How do career services, academic
curriculum, professors’ training, flexible schedules, opportunity to work during studies, and social networks affect
social mobility outcomes? Both policy makers and private investors need to further understand how to improve
higher education. Finally, this is a first study about the effects of access to affordable higher education on social
mobility. The next generation of studies on social mobility and affordable higher education should explore shifting
research focus from access to education quality.

From Laureate’s perspective, this study shows strong positive results. Laureate stakeholders could benefit from
considering the implications of this study. Students make educational decisions without sufficient information about
the higher education market. Laureate provides higher returns on educational investment than their competitors,
and prospective students should know this so that they can make better decisions. Laureate should share and
publicize the findings of this study to convey that Laureate is a sound investment vis-a-vis their competitors. From a
policy perspective, affordable private education like Laureate is providing accessible and high-quality higher
education. Private higher education is worth exploring further as a solution to education access, and as a key player in
building stronger labor markets.

Appendix 2. Quasi-Experimental Impact Evaluation (based on Graduates’ Survey)

       A. Sample Composition and Power Calculations

The size of the sample is a key element to adequately identify the effects of attaining a Laureate degree, vis-à-vis
other academic institutions. The larger the sample size, the higher the likelihood of detecting a statistically significant
difference in outcome variables between graduates from a Laureate institution and graduates from other institutions
of higher education. Moreover, as sample size increases, an impact evaluation is able to identify effects with a higher
precision.

The National Employment and Occupation Survey (Encuesta Nacional de Ocupación y Empleo, ENOE) provided data
on education, income, and employment status for the population of Mexico that was used in the power calculations.
Specifically, the estimation was conducted for individuals currently between 25 and 35 years old, with 16 years of
schooling or more, and who reported having reached the level of higher education (Media Superior, Licenciatura or
Posgrado).

The main variable used in the power analysis is income. After analyzing the sample size needed to detect several
levels of effect and according to the existing literature on education and Laureate’s estimates about i ts alumni’s
income distribution, it would be desirable to detect an effect (or difference) of at least $1,000 MXN in monthly
income (equivalent to a change of 10% from the mean).77 The power calculations showed that a sample of 300
graduates would be acceptable to detect the required difference in income the next figure.

77
     The income difference of $1,000 MXN was fixed by Laureate, according to its knowledge of the institutions’ graduates in the j ob market.

Appendix 5: Measuring Social Class Using AMAI
The Mexican Association of Market Research and Public Opinion (AMAI) developed in 1994 a classification that allows
the Mexican research industry to count with a homogeneous criterion to study, classify and explain their markets.

To standardize this measure, the AMAI defined 13 specific variables established by the committee of Socio Economic
Levels. The Variables are:

    1.    Last year of studies of the family's head.
    2.    Number of lightbulbs at home.
    3.    Number of rooms (without bathrooms).
    4.    Number of baths with shower inside the home.

Possession of:

    5.    Cars
    6.    Boiler.
    7.    Kind of floor.
    8.    Vacuum Cleaner.
    9.    Computer (PC).
    10.   Microwave oven.
    11.   Washing machine.
    12.   Bread toaster.
    13.   DVD player.

With these 13 variables 6 levels were assigned.

- A/B: Upper Class – This is the segment with the highest life standards. The profile of the family head of these
  homes is composed by individuals with an education level of Bachelor degree or higher. They live in luxury houses
  or apartments with all the services and amenities.
- C+: Upper Mid – This segment contains those with income and/or lifestyle slightly superior to those of the middle
  class. The profile of the family head of these homes is of individuals with an educational level of Bachelor degree.
  Generally they live in houses or apartments of their own, some are luxury homes and they have all the amenities.
- C: Middle Class – This segment contains what is typically known as middle class. The profile of the family head of
  these homes is of individuals with an educational level of high school mostly. Homes belonging to this segment are
  houses or apartments that can be owned or rented with some amenities.
- D+: Lower Mid – This segment includes those homes with income and/or lifestyle slightly inferior to those of
  middle class. They possess the best life standards among the lower class. The profile of the family head of these
  homes is composed of individuals with an educational level of junior high or elementary school completed. Homes
  belonging to this segment are, in their majority, owned; although some people rent the property and some are
  social interest homes.
- D: Low – This is the middle segment of lower classes. The profile of the family head of these homes is formed by
  individuals with an educational level averaging elementary school (complete in most cases). Homes belonging to
  this segment are owned or rented like, tenement houses and council units or they are under frozen rents.
- E: Lowest - This segment is not usually included in marketing segmentation. The profile of the family head is of
  individuals with an educational level of unfinished elementary school. These people usually lack properties, so
  they live or use other resources to acquire housing. Usually many generations live under the same roof, and they
  are totally frugal.

Based on these criteria, the distinguished aspects of the socio economic composition of Mexico (as a country) are:

    a) Monthly family income per socio economic level in the country is estimated around $0.00 to $179 (USD) for
       level E; from $180 to $452 (USD) for level D; from $453 to $773 (USD) for level D+; from $774 to 2,333 (USD)
       for level C; from $2,334 to $5,666 (USD) for level C+ and from $5,667, or more (USD) for level A/B.
    b) From the total of urban areas in Mexico (which include those with more than 40,000 inhabitants), 7.5%
       belongs to A/B 13.6% to level C+ 18.8% to C; 32.6% to D+;19.5% to D, and 8% to E.
    c) The average family educational level for each socioeconomic level is finished bachelor degree for level A/B;
       Incomplete bachelor for level C+; Associates degree or Unfinished bachelor for C; finished elementary or
       unfinished high school for D; Finished elementary for D, and unfinished elementary for level E.



Using AMAI to Measure Pre-Laureate Enrolment Socioeconomic Level and Current Socioeconomic Level

A key impact estimation of this study is to analyze changes in socioeconomic level, between pre-enrolling to a
Laureate university program compared to the current socioeconomic level. Pre-enrolment compared to current level
does not provide a long enough period of time to analyze intergenerational change; it is enough time, though, to
observe if alumni are directing their lives into the “avenues” for social mobility.

The questionnaire applied to Laureate’s graduates was designed to estimate AMAI’s socioeconomic level before
enrolling to Laureate education, as well as to estimate AMAI’s level at the moment of the survey. The responses to
AMAI’s battery of questions that corresponded to both the pre-enrolment and the current socioeconomic level were
elicited at the same time. One section of the questionnaire asked about AMAI variables pre-enrolment; and the
following section asked the same questions for the current moment. The ideal research design would ask about the
AMAI conditions of the parent at the moment of the respondent’s current age and compare such socioeconomic level
to the current respondent level, but this type of questions would have caused recall bias. This research design entails
that social progress (changes in socioeconomic level) is measured over a maximum period of 10 years. The current
AMAI socioeconomic level from all respondents corresponds to 2014, and the pre-enrolment socioeconomic level
would correspond to dates around 2005-07.

Appendix 6: Prestige Based on Occupation Methodology
The occupational prestige scale used in this study is based on the methodology developed by the Cambridge Social
Interaction and Stratification Scale (CAMSIS) project, an internationally comparative assessment of the structures of
social interaction and stratification across a number of countries. At its core lies the construction of occupational
scales for each constituent country. Each country has a different prestige scale based on the value that each society
puts on different occupations. The scale values represent an occupational unit's relative position within the national
classification of social interaction and stratification. The theory behind CAMSIS implies that occupational groups are
robust indicators of social stratification because employment still provides the major mechanism by which social and
economic rewards are distributed directly or indirectly in modern societies and is the single most significant indicator
of someone’s location in the overall structure of advantage and disadvantage (Blackburn & Prandy, 1997). It is
important to understand that ‘occupational group’ here is defined to include status differences in employment (self-
employed or supervisory, for example), in addition to the conventional understanding of the meaning of
“occupation.” Furthermore, CAMSIS is gender-sensitive, i.e. different scales are calculated for men and women, since
holding the same occupation may have different implications for the persons’ social position, depending on their
gender.

The theory behind CAMSIS scales (developed from the original 'Cambridge Scale') covers not just a particular measure
but a whole distinctive theoretical approach to social stratification. Using large-scale survey datasets, sociologists are
able to carry out empirical analyses of individual level data on features of, or attitudes about, occupations.

The “CAMSIS” approach to studying the relative stratification position of the incumbents of occupations exploits data
on social connections between the incumbents of occupations. CAMSIS scales are scores given to occupations which
indicate their position in the social stratification structure and can be used to compare occupational prestige across
generations.94

CAMSIS measures can be constructed by using data on 130 pairs of occupations linked by a social interaction, such as
marriage, friendship, or parent-child relationships. First, a two-way cross-tabulation of the occupations for the first
and second members of the pair is prepared. A score is assigned to each occupation to indicate its position within the
empirical dimension(s) of social interaction. Prestige scores go from 0 (for instance, unoccupied or homemakers),
which means that society does not regard this occupation highly in the prestige scale; to (approximately) 100 points
(for example, doctors), which means that this occupation is highly regarded by society.

For this study, the relationship studied was the parent-child level. The main idea behind the analysis was to measure
the upward mobility of the graduates, comparing their CAMSIS score with their parents’. This analysis was done for
gender-specific pairs: mother-daughter and father-son. The average score for each subject of study is presented in
the following table.

                         Subject                                                        CAMSIS Score

                         Mother                                                             25.88
                         Father                                                             51.27
                         Daughter                                                           60.36

Hereby, some examples are presented to clarify the prestige scale used in the study and to illustrate the changes in
occupational prestige across generations. Common occupations in the sample for a father are: sales workers,

                                                                                                                                      60
dispatchers and clerks (53.4595); drivers of buses and taxis (50.70); and engineers (73.00). Common occupations for
the alumni (sons) are business administrators (81.02), programmers (71.69), and graphic designers (75.98).

In the case of mothers, common occupations are: homemakers (0.0096); sales workers, dispatchers and clerks (49.62);
and primary school teachers (65.73); for daughters (alumni) common occupations are teachers (67.79), graphic
designers (83.03) and human resources (82.97).

An illustrative case of intergenerational change of occupational prestige would be for a father occupied in mechanical
maintenance to have a son who is an optometrist; or for a mother who manufactures textile products to have a
daughter who is a medical auxiliary; or for a parent who is a transport inspector with a Laureate alumni that is a real
state agent.

The next figure presents the distribution of occupational prestige for UVM and UNITEC graduates and their parents’,
(the horizontal axis presents the prestige scale from 0 to 100, and the vertical axis, the proportion in each level).97




95
   The numbers in parenthesis indicate the score within the prestige scale. This specific score means, for example, that clerks have a prestige
score of 53.45, which is an occupation in the middle of the prestige scale.
96
   Homemaker is a non-gender definition of housewife. This occupation has a score of 0 in social prestige scale, which means is lowly regarded
in the Mexican context.
97
   Both graduates and their parents’ occupation prestige were calculated at the time of the survey. According to CAMSIS, unemployed
individuals and homemakers have a prestige scale of 0.
