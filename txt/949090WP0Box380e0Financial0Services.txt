Introduction

Mobile financial services implementations are structurally complex, typically
requiring expertise in banking, telecommunications, technology, marketing
and distribution. Rarely will one company have the core competence to
perform all of these functions efficiently, although it is not uncommon to
see one player fulfilling multiple roles. In addition, banks are often required
by regulation to play certain roles, and mobile network operators must
provide communications services.
As a result, MFS implementations typically involve some                             in Kenya, MTN in Ghana, WING in Cambodia, and Easypaisa in

1. The structure of MFS implementations:
four key roles
MFS implementations are structurally complex. They typically require safe
storage of funds, a reliable and widely available communication channel,
effective marketing and delivery of payments, and the ability to put money
in and take money out of the system through a widely distributed agent
network. Partnerships are what hold the core pieces together.

 In each of the case studies presented in this paper, the funds are held by a risk sharing partner. However, under certain regulatory environments this role can also
 be contracted out to a bank (as in the case of M-Pesa in Kenya). For a detailed discussion on regulation of non-bank e-money issuers see “Non-bank E-Money

      The regulations required that MTN partnered with at least three banks. The nine banks were CAL Bank, Ecobank, Fidelity Bank, GT Bank, Intercontinental Bank,
      Merchant Bank, Stanbic, UBA and Zenith Bank. Since then, MTN has added the Agricultural Development Bank as the tenth partner bank.

3. Aligning competitive forces, economic
motivation and roles
The starting point for understanding the economic motivations of the
companies engaged in most MFS implementations is an understanding of
the competitive forces in the banking, MNO, payment services, and agent-
based distribution sectors. MFS channels create value by serving mass market
customers and therefore the motivation of the players is driven largely by
how much value they perceive that mass market customers can add in their
respective industries.

     This describes the market conditions that MTN faced in Ghana in 2009. At the time, MTN had 51% market share, substantially more than the closest competitor
     Tigo with 23%. Since that time, competition has intensified and there are now six operators in the market, with MTN dropping to a 46% market share. Tigo and
     Airtel have also launched mobile money services and at least one other MNO is planning to launch mobile money services in 2013. In contrast, the competition
     for mass market customers is significantly lower in the Ghanaian banking sector. The entire sector serves only 34% of the population (compared to 85% of the
     population using mobile phones) and established banks have anchored their business model in corporate and higher income individuals. As a result, MTN and
     other MNOs have been eager to distinguish themselves through value-added financial services but only a few banks have shown significant interest in delivering
     bank products to the target market.

4. The core revenue sources in an MFS
supply chain and the distribution of revenue
The ultimate test of an MFS partnership is the revenue that accrues to the
partners. An MFS supply chain links at least four distinct core functions that
can generate benefits from an MFS implementation. Partners’ success is a
function of how well the MFS implementation enables the companies in the
supply chain to capture core sources of revenue. The following subsections
explore how partnership arrangements enable companies in the supply
chain to leverage all of the possible revenue sources.

      banking activity.

5. Final observations

The research revealed multiple ways that companies partner to create value
in an MFS implementation. The case studies provide meaningful examples
of enabling partnerships. However, the findings are equally revealing about
conditions that can undermine partnership arrangements. In fact, one of
the noteworthy findings in the background research for this paper was the
limited number of successful partnerships in operation.
A second dimension to partnership requirements is that most             •	 Prohibitions on non-banks earning interest on e-money float

20        PARTNERSHIPS IN MOBILE FINANCIAL SERVICES




THE PARTNERSHIP FOR FINANCIAL INCLUSION

The Partnership for Financial Inclusion aims to bring financial
services to 5.3 million previously unbanked people in Sub-Saharan
Africa by 2017, by supporting the scaling up of sustainable
microfinance and the development of mobile financial services.
It is a $37.4 million initiative by The MasterCard Foundation and
IFC that brings together the intellectual and financial capital of
the Foundation with IFC’s market knowledge, expertise and client
base. The partnership is also supported by donor and knowledge
partners such as The Development Bank of Austria (OeEB,
Oesterreichische Entwicklungsbank AG), the World Bank and
CGAP. An important objective of the partnership is to contribute
to the global community of practice on financial inclusion, and
to share research and lessons learnt. This publication is part of
a series of reports published by the program. To find out more,
