    The Justice, Security and Development Series
    This research report is part of a series on Justice, Security and Development, produced with the generous support of the Bank-
    Netherlands Partnership Program (BNPP). The series presents the findings and critical reflections of a three-year work program
    aimed at improving development approaches to justice and security stresses in fragile and conflict-affected settings. Drawing from
    reviews of current scholarship, in-depth field research, and engagement with development programs, the papers in the series
    seek to identify the key challenges and obstacles to effective development, and propose ways to re-frame the challenges and
    solutions as a basis for more effective development programs. The framing paper for this series, Justice and Institutional Change
    in Fragile and Conflict-Affected Settings: Re-Framing the Challenges and Solutions, presents the rationale, organizing logic and
    conclusions of this work.

IV   CRIME, VIOLENCE, AND COMMUNITY-BASED PREVENTION IN HONDURAS
Executive Summary


Violent crime has emerged as a growing development challenge, affecting large segments of societies and taking
a severe toll on economic development. In many high crime environments, weak institutions, fiscal constraints,
and political resistance have undermined the effectiveness of development programs and threatened their
sustainability. The World Bank has begun to confront this challenge. Building upon successful experiences,
it has expanded its support to crime prevention through an approach that balances criminal justice and law
enforcement with efforts to address the factors associated with violence and its prevention.

The country of Honduras is the most violent in the world as measured by its homicide rate, which reached 90.4
per 100,000 inhabitants in 2012 (UNODC 2013). Yet levels of violence vary across time and space. In 2012, 65
percent of homicides occurred in 5 percent of urban municipalities, and within those areas, they were further
concentrated in a small number of “hotspot” neighborhoods. Understanding why some neighborhoods in
Honduras are more affected than others can point the way toward effective prevention approaches.

This report presents the findings of a study of crime dynamics and prevention practices focused around a
comparison of nine neighborhoods in three of the most violent cities in Honduras: La Ceiba, El Progreso,
and Choloma. The research revealed that although the transnational drug trade, economic downturn, and
political crisis have deepened the country’s vulnerability, some neighborhoods have successfully prevented
crime. Drawing from extensive qualitative research in these neighborhoods, the study identified practices that
communities pursue to prevent violence through collective responses. It also examined the characteristics
of communities, societal factors, and institutional context that have enabled or constrained these responses.
The research points to measures that can be built upon, scaled up and tested through future research and
programming to strengthen community-based crime prevention. It illustrates how deep examination of the
dynamics of insecurity—and the ways communities manage it—can inform efforts to improve public safety in
violence-prone countries.


THE EVOLUTION OF VIOLENT CRIME IN HONDURAN NEIGHBORHOODS
A combination of transnational and national forces in Honduras has contributed to sharply rising crime rates
since 2006. The shift in the transnational drug trade into the country has fueled a change in the nature and
structure of criminal groups, while economic instability and political conflict have increased the vulnerability of
Honduran society to these changes. As a result, homicide rates have climbed sharply in recent years.

In northern Honduras, these trends have contributed to a change in the nature of crime as it is experienced
by urban residents. Neighborhood-based youth gangs have declined as new groups have emerged to contest
control over drug transit routes. Crimes, which include widespread homicide, drug trafficking, extortion, assault,
robbery, and domestic violence, are today more often conducted anonymously than when neighborhood gangs
were the primary perpetrators. This shifting landscape has generated widespread fear and uncertainty regarding
where and when violence will take place and who will perpetrate it. Yet many residents nonetheless perceive
their own neighborhoods to be safe, even in areas with high homicide rates. This variation points to the highly
localized nature of crime and suggests that some communities have prevented crime from taking hold in their
neighborhoods.

     PREVENTING VIOLENCE WITHIN COMMUNITIES: COERCION AND COLLECTIVE ACTION
     The study identified two distinct forms of violence prevention in vulnerable neighborhoods. In some communities
     with relatively low homicide rates, armed groups have pushed out their competitors and achieved a level
     of control that inhibits violence. The identity of these groups varies, from known criminal gangs to secretive
     vigilante groups and organized crime networks. Although residents of these neighborhoods sometimes report
     a greater sense of safety due to fewer homicides, they also point to ways in which violence and insecurity persist
     as other crimes, such as extortion, assault, and robbery, remain widespread.

     In other communities with low levels of violence, residents have taken actions to prevent incidents of crime and
     minimize the conditions that might allow violence to thrive. Residents organize collective measures to address a
     range of problems, including violence prevention. These forms of violence prevention, summarized in figure 1,
     are remarkably low cost and relatively simple to organize.

     THE CONDITIONS FOR COMMUNITY-BASED PREVENTION
     The ability of communities to organize collective prevention measures depends on the extent of fragmentation
     or integration within the neighborhood. While community associations are present in most urban neighborhoods
     in Honduras, they tend to be highly fragmented. Individuals frequently know only members of their own group
     and rarely collaborate across groups for community-wide action. In some neighborhoods, however, dense
     interpersonal ties between these associations, along with a shared identity and norms, facilitate community-
     wide collaboration. These attributes provide the foundation for the organization, interpersonal knowledge, and
     communication that facilitate collective responses to violence. Although neighborhood associations thus form
     the building blocks of effective violence prevention, their role and impact vary. Yet strengthening and integrating
     community groups can enable effective violence prevention.

     Community-level capacity for violence prevention also reflects a broader range of societal factors and the
     institutional context. Urban migration, unemployment, and the lack of access to education weaken community
     organization and shared identity. The prevalence of drugs, guns, and organized crime creates a climate of fear and
     inhibits collective action. Unreliable access to basic services from the municipal and national governments—due
     to a combination of polarized politics, weak institutional capacity, and limited resources—constrains community

efforts because of the challenges involved in securing basic resources or protection from the state. As people
lack trust in state authority and community leaders to address widespread insecurity, they become less willing
to participate in community organization and more willing to rely on alternative sources of authority, including
protection by criminal armed actors.

Some communities have nonetheless succeeded in securing resources through a combination of effective
organization, persistence, and the ability to pursue multiple channels to municipal and national government.
The research pointed to changes in municipal governance, such as improved data, planning, and financing
systems, that have created more favorable environments for community prevention in some places. Yet the
research also found that proactive support by community networks remains essential even in the presence of
more effective state institutions.

Based on these findings, the following areas can serve as entry points for further investment and research in
support for violence prevention in Honduras and elsewhere.

Invest in community organizations by incorporating efforts to deepen inter-group ties, community identity,
and shared norms into interventions, while encouraging communities to organize collective measures to
prevent violence.

Target specific risk factors—especially drug and alcohol consumption, the prevalence of firearms, and
the limited access to secondary education—that constrain community organization and deepen the effects
of other risk dynamics and that can be addressed through focused community-, municipal-, and national-
level intervention.

       Strengthen municipal-level planning and response, focusing on systems to collect and analyze data on crime,
       population, and service-delivery needs; municipal financing systems; inclusive planning processes to prioritize
       responses; and the monitoring of outcomes.

       Explore opportunities for police and justice sector reform. The research found widespread support for reform
       despite the deep challenges. Efforts to understand the constraints, facilitate policy dialogue, and measure
       results could help drive reform efforts. Municipal governments could explore neighborhood-level responses,
       learning from pilot community policing, local mediation, and alternative dispute-resolution initiatives.

       Build the evidence base. Data collection and analysis facilitates crime prevention by identifying the nature
       of crime, its causes and actors, and the impact of different approaches. Data collection processes should be
       strengthened and used more systematically by municipal and national governments to plan responses and
       monitor impact.

       We are united neighbors when there is a necessity, we assist each other among ourselves. In the entire
       community we don’t all know each other, but on each street we get along well… One of the things that
       brings us together is when a neighbor is sick and we are all ready to assist one another. (Community
       leader, Choloma)

       Two or three years ago, my grandparent had an accident and the neighbors from across the street came
       to help without being asked. My mother came to where they had the accident and the neighbor was
       with them. The neighbor stayed there in the house with us, they are good neighbors and trustworthy.
       (Woman, El Progreso)

       When the neighbor nearby has problems we all get together and if he needs money, we all contribute.
       Of course we are going to go. We have to help our neighbor so that he is better off. (Man, El Progreso)

       We get along very well… In fact I am a bit tired because the neighbor had a problem last night, well not
       directly him, but the neighbor that is in the back went out late to work and there was not transportation
       so we served as a telephone and I called the neighbor who has a car and he came from the brewery by
       foot. (Man, Choloma)

       In front of my house there was a guy with a tank of propane gas who cut his finger. So all of the neighbors
       ran to see what they could do for him, and one neighbor who had a car took him to the hospital. There
       they put back the finger, they fixed him up and they left him with something. He healed because all of
       the neighbors came to see what they could do, and one neighbor who was a nurse told us what we had
       to do. (Youth, El Progreso)

     Annex:
     Neighborhood Selection Methodology and Data

     The neighborhoods included in the study were selected to enable a structured, focused comparison between
     three different categories of neighborhoods in each city: neighborhoods with high levels of violence, neighbor-
     hoods with low levels of violence, and neighborhoods that had previously experienced high violence followed
     by a visible decline. The neighborhoods were similar enough in most other categories to permit a controlled
     comparison. All had a medium population size (middle two quartiles) and an income level in the bottom two
     quartiles, and all were located in the urban sections of the municipality. All of the neighborhoods were required
     to have a minimum level of organization to permit comparisons of the type and nature of organization. A
     set of eligible neighborhoods that met these criteria was categorized by homicide rate, and the team con-
     ducted inquiries with municipal officials and community leaders as to the feasibility of conducting research in
     these communities, based on security considerations and any notable characteristics. One neighborhood from
     each category (low homicide rate, high homicide rate, and recent reduction in homicide rate) was selected in
     all three municipalities.

     The selection process coincided with the process of neighborhood selection for the Honduras Safer Municipali-
     ties Project, financed by the World Bank. The same data and indicators were collected in order to select treat-
     ment and control municipalities, all of which were to have similar socio-demographic characteristics, a basic
     level of community organization, a primary school, and a relatively high level of crime. The communities were
     assigned a score and ranked numerically based on a weighted total of points assigned for each indicator. The
     top 20 neighborhoods were deemed eligible and “clustered” geographically in order to maximize positive spill-
     over effects and expand impact to form between three and six eligible clusters of three neighborhoods each.
     One of these clusters was assigned to be the treatment, and the other cluster was assigned to be the control.

     The indicators used for the selection of the neighborhoods for the comparative study and the project are listed
     below, followed by a list of neighborhoods with data assigned. Note that due to the different objectives of the
     selection (structured comparison vs. treatment and control), the same neighborhoods were not selected for both
     the study and the project. The selected neighborhoods have not been listed to preserve the confidentiality of
     the community leaders and members interviewed for the study.

     •	   Homicide rate: This was used as the primary proxy for level of violent crime. Data were collected from the
          National Preventive Police and the National Violence Observatory for the period 2009–12. Although other
          crime and dispute data were collected from municipalities and the police, they were deemed to be too
          inconsistent and unreliable to be used.

     •	   Population: As a proxy for population size, data were collected from the municipal cadastre on the number
          of housing lots in each neighborhood. This proxy was required, since the last census was conducted in 2000
          and some of the municipalities have experienced significant demographic shifts since then.

     •	    Income level: The most reliable indicator to measure neighborhood-level poverty in Honduras is house-
          hold energy consumption. Data on monthly electricity consumption per neighborhood from 2009 (the most
          recent available data) were collected from the national electrical company (Empresa Nacional de Energia
          Electrica, ENEE). Neighborhoods in the lowest quartile in terms of average electricity consumption were
          selected.




54   CRIME, VIOLENCE, AND COMMUNITY-BASED PREVENTION IN HONDURAS
•	   Presence of primary school: The school is an important community institution that can serve as the platform for a
     variety of prevention activities. Data on the presence of primary and secondary schools and numbers of students
     will be collected from the official registries of the Ministry of Education and cross checked with municipal officials.

•	   Community organization: Data on community organization were provided by municipal authorities through a
     rapid assessment of the types of community organizations present and active in each neighborhood. Designated
     officials with experience working in communities were given questionnaires regarding the presence and activity of
     common community organizations (i.e., patronatos, water committees, parents associations, youth and women’s
     groups, and churches, among others); the management quality of these organizations; and the types of projects
     recently implemented or currently under implementation by these organizations. Only neighborhoods that met
     the other criteria were assigned community organization scores.

•	   Prioritization by municipality for crime prevention: The municipal governments and civil society in two of the
     cities, Choloma and La Ceiba, had developed Municipal Citizen Security and Coexistence Plans, which included
     priority neighborhoods for prevention efforts. These neighborhoods had been selected based on homicide rates
     as well as peoples’ knowledge of “hot spot” areas of the city that needed attention. Although El Progreso did not
     have a written plan, municipal officials had their own list of priority neighborhoods.
