the World Bank Group also supports countries
in responding to shocks when they occur. The
crisis response brings together both the short-
term objectives of supporting a rapid recovery and
the medium- and long-term objectives of building
resilience. Response mechanisms also cut across
different kinds of crises. For example, ﬁscal policies

                                   The succession of systemic shocks affecting
                                   developing countries in the past decade has

                                   ﬁnancial crisis led the World Bank to double
                                   its lending for crisis response during 2008–10
                                   compared with the previous three years. IFC
                                   responded to the ﬁnancial crisis by developing a
                                   range of new instruments designed to build private

   BOX 2.2. Weather Index Insurance in India and Mongolia



   IEG evaluations have documented two World Bank–supported index insurance projects operating at
   large scale in India and Mongolia that contributed to coverage of some risk for farmers and herders.

   The Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme in India, which relies heavily on public subsidies, is by
   far the largest in the world. The program originated from a 2003 pilot in Andhra Pradesh that received
   World Bank technical assistance. Farmer participation is largely compulsory and is tied to credit
   access. More than 9 million farmers were enrolled as of 2010–11, but basis risk is still signiﬁcant,
   and farmers who suffer a total crop loss will still have a 1 in 3 chance of receiving no payment from
   the program.

   In Mongolia, the World Bank designed an innovative livestock insurance to help reduce herders’
   vulnerability to harsh winters, reﬂecting the realization that the loss of livestock during extremely cold
   winters was an important cause of poverty in Mongolia. After a request from the Bank of Mongolia,
   the World Bank invited a group of experts to discuss a possible insurance program. At that time,
   index insurance was well established for crops, but not for livestock. A workable design evolved from
   these discussions and was piloted as a component in a World Bank project. After a successful pilot
   program, the approach was scaled up to the country as a whole starting in 2009. The World Bank had
   a major role in obtaining political buy-in for the program. Currently, 15 percent of the herder population
   buys private insurance against loss of livestock in an extreme cold spell. The private insurance industry
   handles the program entirely, and the World Bank project essentially ﬁnances a reinsurance program.
